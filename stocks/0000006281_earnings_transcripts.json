I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Jeff Ambrosi, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nThank you, Gigi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Conference Call. Joining me on the call today is ADI CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche, and ADI Chief Financial Officer, Richard Puccio. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release, periodic reports, and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information, as these statements reflect our expectations.\nOnly as the date of this call, we undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. References to gross margin, operating and non-operating expenses, operating margin, tax rate, earnings per share, and free cash flow in our comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures, and additional information about our non-GAAP measures, are included in today's earnings release. References to earnings per share are on a fully diluted basis. With that, I'll turn the call over to ADI CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche.\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results reflect the ongoing business recovery, with continued growth in revenue and earnings per share, both of which finished above the midpoint of our outlook. Now widening the aperture to our full fiscal 2025, revenue accelerated throughout the year and returned to meaningful growth despite the persistent macro and geopolitical headwinds. All of our end markets increased by double digits, reflecting both cyclical and company-specific drivers, including strong execution against our maximum revenue synergy targets. Top-line strength, combined with margin expansion, resulted in earnings per share growth of more than 20% in fiscal 2025. Our strong operating results and reduced CapEx enabled us to generate record free cash flow of more than $4 billion US dollars, or 39% of revenue. We also returned more than $4 billion US dollars to our shareholders, supporting an 8% dividend increase, as well as share count reduction.\nInnovation has always been integral to ADI's brand and our value proposition, forming the foundation for strong financial performance. Consequently, R&D activities receive capital prioritization, with record investments made in FY 2025 to advance our leadership in analog, mixed-signal, and power technologies. We've also intensified our focus on software, digital, and artificial intelligence capabilities to strengthen our core franchise, enabling us to address increased customer complexity and expedite their innovation cycles and time to market. Our comprehensive technology portfolio, combined with extensive application domain expertise, uniquely positions us to proactively identify and resolve the most complex engineering challenges for our customers. As a result, we're realizing stronger value capture, as reflected in the increase in our average selling prices, particularly in new products where ASPs significantly exceed those of legacy offerings. Beyond product innovation, our dedication to customer success encompasses ongoing investments to streamline and accelerate their product development activities.\nTo this end, we are rapidly expanding our development support environment from research to deployment, with a combination of proprietary ADI Tools and leading ecosystem and open-source platforms. Furthermore, following the acquisition of Maxim, we've allocated over $3 billion US dollars in capital expenditures to substantially enhance capacity, optionality, and resiliency for our customers, supporting our long-term vision for sustained growth. As you've seen, our relentless focus on driving customer success translated to strong results and a diverse design pipeline that grew more than 20% in fiscal 2025. I'd like to share a few examples of our success this past year. Within industrial, every sector grew, driven by improved cyclical dynamics, and powerful secular trends, such as AI, automation, and the drive for efficient and reliable energy generation, transmission, and distribution.\nFor example, the exponential growth in demand for AI and high-performance compute drove a record year in our automatic test equipment business, building upon and extending our strong position in the SoC and memory test markets. We anticipate further growth in FY 2026 due to our expanding design pipeline, industry transitions to HBM4, and expected double-digit growth in hyperscaler CapEx. In 2025, robust automation design and growth was propelled by the burgeoning demand for enhanced productivity, efficiency, and reliability across key sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. This momentum was particularly evident within our robotics segment, which saw notable expansion as customers increasingly prioritized automation to streamline operations and improve business outcomes. As highlighted in our previous quarter, we foresee tremendous long-term opportunity as advancements in AI fuel the emergence of content-rich humanoid robots, positioning ADI at the forefront of the next wave of robotics innovation.\nWithin healthcare, the proliferation of robot-assisted surgical systems represents a vibrant vector of growth alongside our imaging and diagnostic segments. Additionally, we expect growing demand for our suite of diabetes management solutions to continue to contribute to growth in FY 2026. Energy was our fastest-growing industrial segment this past year, driven by high demand from the industrial, transportation, and data center sectors. Design and activity was especially strong for grid management and battery storage systems, and we anticipate continued growth in 2026 and well beyond. Aerospace and defense achieved record results, and we expect further growth in the year ahead, driven by our expanding portfolio of advanced sensor, mixed-signal, and power solutions, coupled with an increasingly strong opportunity pipeline. We also expect to maintain our strong presence in the growing low Earth orbit satellite market.\nTurning to automotive, advances in autonomous driving and cabin digitalization led to a record year for ADI in fiscal 2025, with growth outpacing light vehicle production. Our intelligent audio and video connectivity solutions, which avoid bulky and expensive cabling, drove multiple new growth awards across GMSL, A2B, and our signal processing and safe power portfolios. Building on this success, our new E2B Ethernet bus is expanding our market, simplifying customer systems, boosting power efficiency, and lowering costs as it gains traction. In the communications sector, AI CapEx investment led to a record year for our data center segment, with design and activity more than doubling. Strong demand for high-throughput connectivity and power delivery solutions supports our confidence in continued growth through 2026.\nWireless communications was one of the few areas of softness in 2025, but we believe customers have completed their inventory digestion phase and that the market bottomed during the year. In addition, we see a positive impact of new products, such as our software-defined, AI-enabled Macro Base Station on a Chip solution, for which we secured design-ins from leading OEMs and service providers, and see additional opportunity beyond telecommunications in private industrial networks, as well as other secure communications applications. Finally, as consumer markets rapidly evolve, we're expanding our SAN and growing a diverse pipeline by delivering integrated solutions in hearables, wearables, gaming, AR/VR, and many related areas. For example, our new Acoustics Platform combines analog, power, digital, software, and machine learning for advanced environmental awareness and adaptive noise cancellation.\nWe've secured design wins for these solutions in consumer and healthcare segments, enabling ADI to triple the value generated over legacy designs. We've also captured several new power management design wins in premium handsets and smart glasses in FY 2025, positioning us for further growth in 2026. In summary, our diversified business model has proven agile and consistently capable of generating superior outcomes, reflected in both last year's resilient margins and this year's strong rebound in profitable growth.\nWhile we're mindful of the macro environment and the continued impacts of tariffs and trade uncertainty, we remain confident in our growth in FY 2026 and beyond as we continue to leverage our key differentiators, namely an enviable technology leadership position at the intelligent edge, as it becomes a center of gravity for a host of secular growth markets, unrivaled application domain expertise, and the trusted brand that we have developed and strengthened with our customers over the decades. With that, I'll pass it over to Rich.\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nThank you, Vince, and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. I'll start with a brief overview of our full fiscal 2025 financial performance. Revenue for the year came in at just over $11 billion US dollars, up 17% from fiscal 2024, with double-digit growth across all end markets. Gross margin finished at 69.3%, up 140 basis points, driven by higher utilizations.\nOperating margin finished up 100 basis points at 41.9% and includes the headwind associated with the normalization of variable comp. All told, earnings per share of $7.79 US dollars increased 22% versus fiscal 2024. Now onto our fourth quarter results. Revenue in the fourth quarter came in toward the higher end of our outlook at $3.08 billion US dollars, growing 7% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Industrial represented 46% of our fourth quarter revenue, finishing up 12% sequentially, and 34% year-over-year. The stronger-than-seasonal results underpins the cyclical momentum we see across industrial, as well as the secular growth unfolding in AI infrastructure, which drove a record quarter for our ATE business. For the full year, industrial increased 15%, with growth across every major application, including record years for aerospace and defense, and ATE. Automotive represented 28% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 1% sequentially and up 19% year-over-year.\nDouble-digit year-over-year growth continues to be the driving, excuse me, continues to be driven by our leading connectivity and functionally safe power solutions. For the full year, automotive increased 16% to an all-time high, driven predominantly by our higher content and share position across Level 2+ ADAS systems globally. Communications represented 13% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 4% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Our data center segment surpassed a $1 billion US dollars run rate this quarter and, on a year-over-year basis, has now grown more than 50% for three consecutive quarters, fueled by continued strength in the AI infrastructure market. Wireless revenue was up double digits year-over-year for the second straight quarter, owing to improving cyclical dynamics. For the full year, communications was our fastest-growing market, increasing 26%, driven by our data center segment, which had a record year, while wireless revenue was flat.\nLastly, consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 7% both sequentially and year-over-year. For the full year, consumer increased 19%, driven by strong growth in handsets, gaming, and a record year for our hearables and wearables segment. Now on to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 69.8%, up 60 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher utilization and favorable mix. OpEx in the quarter was $809 million US dollars, resulting in an operating margin of 43.5%, up 130 basis points sequentially and up 240 basis points year-over-year. Non-operating expenses finished at $60 million US dollars, and the tax rate for the quarter was 12.7%. All told, EPS was $2.26 US dollars, up 10% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Now, I'd like to highlight a few items from our balance sheet and cash flow statements.\nCash and short-term investments finished the quarter at $3.7 billion US dollars, and our net leverage ratio decreased to 0.9. As I discussed previously, we continue to build die bank buffers for our fastest-growing applications. As such, our inventories were higher by $59 million US dollars sequentially, while days of inventory declined by 1 to 159. Channel inventory increased but remains lean at approximately six weeks. Fiscal 2025 operating cash flow and CapEx were $4.8 billion US dollars and $0.5 billion US dollars, respectively, resulting in record free cash flow of $4.3 billion US dollars, or 39% of revenue, up from 33% in 2024. In total, we returned $4.1 billion US dollars to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return over the long term, using 40% to 60% for our dividend, and the remainder for share count reduction. Now, moving on to our first quarter 2026 outlook.\nRevenue is expected to be $3.1 billion US dollars, ±$100 million US dollars. Operating margin at the midpoint is expected to be 43.5%, ±100 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be 12% to 14%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.29 US dollars, ±$0.10 US dollars. In closing, fiscal 2025 was a strong year, highlighted by a return to growth, margin expansion, and record free cash flow. Importantly, I'm confident in our ability to continue navigating macro and geopolitical challenges, and believe we are well-positioned to drive further profitable growth in 2026. With that, I'll give it back to Jeff for Q&A.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nAll right, thank you, Rich. Now, let's get to our Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question, please re-queue, and we will take your question if time allows. With that, can we have our first question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nFor those participating by telephone dial-in, if you have a question, please press star one one on your phone to enter the queue. If your question has been answered and you wish to be removed from the queue, please press star one one again. If you are listening on a speakerphone, please pick up the handset when asking your question. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you for taking my question. I had a near and a medium term. On the near term, I think you're guiding Q1 slightly up, which is a little bit above seasonal. I was hoping you could give us some color by segment where you are seeing the strength, because I do think industrial was slightly below what you had thought in Q4. Just any dynamics going into Q1. If we zoom out, Vince, I mean, if I were to just annualize Q1 guidance, that suggests a very strong kind of 12%, 13% sales growth year in fiscal 2026. I was really hoping to get your perspectives as you start the new fiscal year on what you're seeing from a broader macro perspective and whether this kind of growth rate is possible in fiscal 2026. Thank you.\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nSure. Thanks, Vivek. Rich?\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nVivek? I'll take the first part of your question. Q1, which is our weakest sequential quarter with normal seasonality, typically down mid-single digits. Our outlook is for up quarter-over-quarter, which reflects our seventh straight quarter of above seasonal growth. Another key point is, additionally, our outlook assumes sell-in and sell-through are equal. From an end market color perspective, industrial, we expect to be up mid-single digits, above seasonal. We expect auto to be down mid-single digits, below seasonal, where we continue to see some risk there around tariff and some of the macro environment. Coms, we expect to be up 10%, above seasonal. Again, as Vince mentioned, we're seeing real strength in the AI infrastructure and demand for our data center products. Consumer is seasonally down, low double digits. All markets, we expect to be up year-over-year.\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nYeah. Maybe if we look year-over-year, Vivek, we believe we're well-positioned to see broad-based growth in 2026. I think cyclical, as well as many idiosyncratic factors, are giving us tailwinds. My expectation is that in 2026, industrial and communications will lead the charge. I think when you look at industrial and coms, as I said, the cyclical dynamics are good, very lean inventories out there. I think both of those markets bottomed some quarters ago. Data center, which is going to see, again, we believe, a strong surge in CapEx. We've got good exposure to that sector, and it's 2/3 of our coms business at this point in time. Aerospace and defense, as well as ATE, which are together about 1/3 of the industrial market. We've got strong content growth stories in both, and coupled with the ADI demand surge in the ATE business, I think is very, very well-positioned.\nI think as well in consumer, we talked a little bit in the preparatory marks there about the higher content and key applications. We've got tremendous diversity in that business at a level we never had before as a company. Both in applications, customers, and platforms, we're well-positioned. Last but not least, if I talk a little bit about the auto sector, I think SAR has really been flat now for quite a while. We see that persist in 2026. Given that we've been able to show against SAR 10% content growth per annum, we see that continue given the strength of the pipeline that we've got. All that said, we've got a very uncertain macro environment. My expectation is all the end markets will be up despite the outlook from a macro perspective.\n\nVivek Arya\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. Speaking of autos, I think you guys had indicated when you guided the quarter that you'd be slightly down, you ended up slightly up. Can you talk about what's coming in a little bit better? You guys have been pretty good about helping us understand pull forwards and things like that, any sign of any activity now?\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nSure, Joe, I'll take that one. For us, auto has been our strongest market, right? Double-digit CAGR through cycle, driven by secular content gains, compounded by our share gains, particularly in connectivity and power for ADAS and next-gen infotainment systems. Here, I would note we've had pretty significant share gains in China, which is where you see a lot of the light vehicle share getting increased.\nThat's been beneficial. Near term, the market's been more resilient than we and many had predicted, right? Evidenced by the stronger volumes on vehicles. We do think some of the upside we've seen in the volumes in our business this year was tariff and policy-related. We've talked in prior calls about our view that there might have been some pull-ins. It can't be precise or certain, but we did make that estimation. Given this, we did approach Q4 with some caution and expected to see, I think I said on the last call, we thought we'd see some of this pre-buying unwind in the fourth quarter. That did not appear to happen to us. Our results were fairly seasonal, and bookings were normal, with a book-to-build just below one, which is actually pretty typical for Q4.\nWe're still being a bit cautious on the market as it's unclear how the tariffs and volatilities we saw will ultimately impact us and our customers. Just given short lead time orders, visibility tends to be pretty low right now. As we think about our Q1 outlook, it is a sub-seasonal quarter or down mid-single digits sequentially, but up year-over-year. Given the content gains in this market and the positive design win traction that Vince mentioned, we do think fiscal 2026 can be another strong year.\n\nJoe Moore\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nVery helpful. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about gross margins. You sort of talked about being at 70% gross margins around $3 billion US dollars. You're sitting over there, and you're still, I mean, even in the quarter, you came in a little below 70. As far as I can tell, the guidance implies gross margins relatively flattish around that 70% range. You can let me know if that's right or not. I'm just wondering why we're not seeing more leverage on the gross margin line, especially as utilizations are going up and everything else. Why shouldn't we expect more leverage on gross margins?\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nOkay. Can I take that one? Obviously, with our interesting leading gross margins, you can see the impact that we get from the innovation premium. We did increase quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and we did have higher utilization and some favorable mix. We didn't get to the 70% as planned, as the mix component wasn't as strong as we were expecting.\nAs we've talked about, we had a much stronger result in auto, which kept the industrial mix a bit lower than we planned, and that's what kept us from getting all the way to 70%. Now, if I look out to Q1, gross margin percent for us is typically lower in Q1 seasonally, given the annual shutdown factories for required maintenance and around the holidays in conjunction with customer shutdowns. However, based on our outlook, we are anticipating that the higher industrial mix in Q1, which we think will offset the seasonal component and hold gross margin flat. You were right that embedded is a flatter gross margin where we get an offset from higher mix, which will offset the pressure from the shutdowns.\nI guess in the last piece, as we think about the continued go forward, Stacy, and at this revenue level, one of the things I like to remind is we did have a pretty significant capacity expansion while we were addressing our resilience over the last several years. It will take us higher revenue dollars to continue to expand beyond 70. Also, as we've talked about, the continued movement in mix. Given the strength we see in industrial going into 2026, we expect that share of our business will continue to increase.\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nYeah. I think just one other piece of color, Stacy, that pricing is in good shape. It's really a question of mix and continuing to push the utilizations.\n\nStacy Rasgon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein Research\n\nThank you. Got it. Thank you, guys.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nThanks, Stacy. Move on to our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Danely from Citi.\n\nChristopher Danely\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Just to follow up on Stacy's question, has the relative gross margin levels, have those changed at all between the end markets? Have any of them gone up or down versus the corporate average? I guess just to cut to the chase, have the auto gross margins gotten a little worse relative to the corporate average over the last two, three years? Or anything else changed?\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nChris, I would say the way we've characterized the individual end market margins versus average has not changed, not in any meaningful way.\n\nChristopher Danely\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nOkay. Thanks, Rich.\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot. Vincent, you talked about Maxim revenue synergies. Can you update us on that? I know you said you're on track, but maybe you can give us a sense of where that stands. Rich, can you tell us sort of what your sense of a normal fiscal Q2 is? It seems like normal seasonal and fiscal Q2 is up like mid-singles. Is that sort of how you think about a typical fiscal Q2? Maybe what are the puts and takes as you kind of head into fiscal Q2? Thanks.\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nYeah. Tim, I'll start with the synergies. We began the conversion process, the conversion of the pipeline in 2024, and began in earnest in 2024. It contributed tens of millions of dollars to ADI's top line in 2024. It's clearly accelerated in 2025, and it's in the hundreds of millions against our billion-dollar target by 2027.\nWe expect an even stronger contribution in 2026, given the momentum that we have in terms of new products and cross-sell. We're seeing, as we said, when we acquired Maxim, we saw tremendous complementarity in terms of some technology niches that Maxim filled, particularly in areas like power, these connectivity structures that we use in automobiles and now industrial products. The complementarity actually works for ADI right across the spectrum of applications, but particularly auto, as I've just said, consumer, healthcare, and data centers. I think we are well on track to meet our commitment, possibly even a little earlier than what we thought. Rich, you want to take that?\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nYeah. Tim, you're absolutely right. Q2 tends to be our seasonally strongest quarter where we tend to be up mid-single digits. I think that's the right way to think about it.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nThank you, Tim.\n\nTimothy Arcuri\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nMove on to our next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\nC.J. Muse\n\nAnalyst, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nYeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Vincent, in your prepared remarks, you talked about IDEO drivers led by AI in the data center. I was hoping you could perhaps speak a bit more to a framework that we should be thinking about across both industrial and comms. Obviously, you dominate semi-test analog. You've got some real design wins on the optical and power side, and you also spoke about energy strength. Is there kind of a percentage of mix that we should be thinking about that should be growing significantly faster than the rest of your business? If there's kind of numbers around that, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll just give some color, and Richard with some numbers. Yeah. Specifically, when we talk about AI, there's the data center and the ATE businesses. If I look at data center in 2025, it grew about 50%. The ATE business, which also benefits from the skyrocketing compute intensities, the new memory types that are being used as well, new memory chips, that business, so the ATE business grew up 40% last year. We believe we'll see that growth continue in 2026. If I just talk about where we are, data center, I think, as Rich said in the prepared remarks, is running about a billion-dollar run rate at this point in time. There are really two primary sectors there. One is at the electro-optical interface, and we're seeing tremendous upsurge in demand for 800Gb.\nNow we're seeing 1.6Tb electro-optical interfaces that require very, very sophisticated power management and control systems. There's power more generally, I think, in the areas of protection. We're beginning to see a shift in very, very high voltage technologies that require very sophisticated monitoring and control. There's power conversion and power delivery, and we're seeing our portfolios in those three areas gain significant traction. On the delivery side, we had mentioned before, vertical power. That technology now is beginning to be adopted broadly. We're at the kind of, we use a term in the electronics industry, we're at the meat of the curve. I think we're in place to see exponential growth there. ATE, $800 million US dollars run rate. As I said, very, very well positioned with all the key players, both the vertically integrated players as well as the OEMs in chip testing.\nAs the shift to HBM4 takes place, we're going to see higher pin count, more complexity, more speed, basically more instrumentation compute density in our chips. I think we're in a good place from a customer engagement standpoint, from a technology standpoint. My sense is we should see double-digit growth in both those areas over the next few years. Rich, do you want to add anything?\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nI will add my concurrence on your view about the outlook for the next few years in these areas. I look at, if you look at the external factors, particularly around the data center piece and the high-performance compute, the forecast, continue forecast from all of the hyperscalers and the big buyers in the space, continue to go up. Even recently, several of the large hyperscalers have added even further increases to their CapEx plans. I do think that near medium-term spend is going to continue, and we should be a big beneficiary given our strength there.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nThank you, C.J. Move on to our next caller, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One of the other strong dynamics among several which separates ADI from peers is obviously the strong exposure to aerospace and defense. This has been a growth area for ADI during this last downturn. I think the business is now driving well over $1 billion US dollars of annualized run rate revenues or roughly greater than 10% of your total revenues. It grew strongly double digits in fiscal 2025. Does the team anticipate continued strong double digits growth in fiscal 2026? Maybe help us understand what are some of the ADI-specific product cycles here that's going to continue to drive the strong growth profile going forward?\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nYeah, thanks very much for the question. Yeah, the journey for ADI in that aerospace and defense market really took off in earnest when we acquired Hittite. We got Hittite's really high-quality RF and microwave portfolio, which is central to all the communications activities right across the aerospace and defense market, from defense systems, every type of defense system you can imagine, to satellite communications. The primary portfolios we have there are obviously microwave and RF sensors, the highest performance conversion products that we build on the precision and very, very high-speed signal processing side, are central.\nIncreasingly, when we acquired LTC and Maxim, we were able to cross-connect with all those signal processing technologies, the power tech, all the power management technologies. If you look then at the market drivers, you've got the world isn't becoming any more peaceful. There's going to be increasing capital deployment to build defense systems globally. We're seeing very strong demand, an increasing demand in Europe and beyond. We work with all of the primary OEMs, and all that coupled with increasing ASPs. I mean, some of these products we build attract tens of thousands of dollars per system. I think that business has the capacity by the end of the decade to more than double.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nThank you, Harlan. We'll move on to our next question.\n\nHarlan Sur\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter from TD Cowen.\n\nJoshua Buchalter\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions, and congrats on the strong results. I wanted to follow up on the comments about fiscal Q2 being a seasonal plus mid-single digit percent. Could you maybe speak to what's driving the confidence and the visibility there? Any metrics you're able to give on lead times? Bigger picture, how has your visibility looking forward changed as the mix has changed? Do you think compared to a couple of years ago, there's more of your exposure tied to IDEO drivers like aerospace and defense, and data center, and that's increasing your visibility? I'd just be curious to hear because you mentioned there was some uncertainty on the shape of the year in the press release. I'd be curious to hear how you're feeling about visibility. Thank you.\n\nRichard Puccio\n\nCFO, Analog Devices\n\nThanks, Josh. First, I didn't guide for Q2. I confirmed what the historical seasonality is. As we've been talking about, right, we still don't have a ton of visibility beyond current quarter plus one, right? As we've talked about, the lead times are most of our products have lead times sub-13 weeks. We get a lot of orders in quarter. We get a lot of orders with short lead times, which does reduce some of that visibility. I think on the first part of your question, I don't think we've necessarily seen an improvement in visibility over the last two years, although I do agree. I think that we've now got broad strength in a number of the IDEO areas that Vince described. Given where we are from an inventory on hand position as well as our cycle times, we're not getting a ton of outside of a quarter visibility.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nThank you, Josh. We'll move to our last question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel.\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nYes. Thank you for squeezing me in. Vince, ADI has been always very thoughtful about allocating R&D dollars. The economy is changing in the front of our eyes structurally quite significantly here. How are you thinking about prioritizing your R&D spend right now? Are there any areas you would like to double down in and perhaps areas you would like to de-emphasize as a company? Thank you.\n\nVincent Roche\n\nCEO and Chairman, Analog Devices\n\nYeah. Thanks, Tore. Yeah. When I look at the analog space, in the core analog business, we continue to push the edges of signal processing, data conversion systems, and precision, as well as very, very high speed. I think power management for ADI is still an opportunity with a much, much bigger growth story. That is a place that, as we've gone through our strategy planning cycle in the last few quarters here, we're doubling down on for sure. There are areas as well of our digital portfolio where we see very, very strong niches for what we do in terms of, for example, low power, low latency, these heterogeneous compute structures, as well as algorithmic technologies. I mentioned during the prepared remarks how we're enhancing the functionality of our core analog technologies by using machine learning techniques, for example, in base stations, in the consumer areas as well.\nI think most of what we do is making sure that we have the platforms to be able to compete globally across all the geographies, across the spectrum of markets that we find most attractive, solve the most important problems. What I can tell you is that our customers are asking us to do more and more to tame their complexity and help them speed up their innovation cycle. When we think about the investment portfolio, we're very opportunity-rich. We've got a very high-quality problem, which is picking the most valuable opportunities in that spectrum that's replete with opportunity.\n\nTore Svanberg\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nThank you for the call.\n\nJeff Ambrosi\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Analog Devices\n\nThanks, Tore. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website, and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found in the quarterly results section of our investor relations website. Thank you for your continued interest in Analog Devices, and happy Thanksgiving.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect."

Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nRichard C. Puccio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Josh, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal '25 conference call.\nJoining me today on the call is ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com.\nThe information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call.

References to EPS are on a fully diluted basis. Okay.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche.\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rich, and a very good morning to you all. Well, our third quarter revenue and earnings exceeded our expectations. And for the second quarter in a row, we achieved double-digit year-over-year growth across all of our end markets. While geopolitical and macro uncertainty continues to cloud the outlook, we believe ADI's innovation-driven, resilient, highly diversified business model positions us to continue to successfully navigate these challenges.\nThe accelerated recovery of our industrial business, encompassing instrumentation, automation, health care, aerospace and defense and energy management is a case in point. As you've heard us detail on prior calls, our industrial recovery began in the aerospace and defense and instrumentation sectors, driven by our strong product and customer portfolio positions as well as spending growth in defense and AI infrastructure.\nWe're now seeing double-digit year-over-year growth across the entire industrial portfolio. For today's call, I'm going to focus on our $1 billion-plus industrial automation business, which was the last sector to return to double-digit growth. Its market dynamics and trajectory are expected to bring long-term expansion. Companies have long invested in automation systems to gain first-order productivity, efficiency and quality benefits. Today, a new wave of adoption is being driven by economic and demographic pressures and enabled by the potential to transform and accelerate business through leverage of real-time Intelligent Edge data.\nADI's high-performance technology stack and deep domain expertise are crucial to customer success in this highly sense, securely connected software-driven era and the new robotic modalities that are emerging. It's predicted that the convergence of compounding macro and AI-enabled technology factors will drive robust double-digit growth within robotics market for the foreseeable future.\nADI's ability to deliver exceptionally accurate physic representations and enable faster insights of the edge we become even more essential as the market migrates to next-generation autonomous robotic systems. Our long history of robotics has given us a deep understanding of the sectors hardest problems and degraded opportunities.\nWe're investing to maintain our performance edge and analog while capturing increasing levels of system value. In addition, we're building ecosystem partnerships and deploying experts and an increasingly broad suite of technologies to enrich and deepen our customer collaborations. We expect this multi-pronged approach to unlock significant ASP and some expansion for our automation business.\nFollowing the proven path we've successfully executed in other markets such as aerospace and defense and health care. Now let me share a few examples of our strategy in action. Earlier this year, we partnered with Teradyne Robotics. Our solutions for precision positioning and dynamic motion control are helping Teradyne increase their value proposition to the logistics industry through higher-performance cobots and autonomous mobile robots or AMRs.\nIn the agricultural sector, where labor shortages are [indiscernible] high-precision robotic systems are increasingly filling the gap. In addition, these systems and [indiscernible] collection capabilities are enabling higher crop use while reducing water and chemical usage levels. A growing portion of our robotics revenue is coming from this sector as we help customers solve their toughest challenges through our sensing, connectivity and energy management solutions.\nIn the health care sector, robot-assisted surgery systems minimize invasiveness and improve patient outcomes through enhanced system precision. And we're leveraging our leading precision technology franchise to successfully attach more of our power management, connectivity and sensing content to the more innovative systems being designed, employed.\nThis year, we're achieving robust growth and expect continued momentum as the proliferation of automated surgical procedures further expands our opportunities in this space. Overall, the near and medium-term outlook for robotics is compelling, supported by increasing revenue and the burgeoning opportunity pipeline. From this strong foundation, we're extending into the next promising era of robotics, namely humanoid and other highly dexterous robot form factors, and creating a potentially exponential growth opportunity for ADI.\nOur content in the humanoid robot is likely to be several thousands of dollars, but that's basically a 10x increase over the content in today's cutting-edge AMRs. The primary reason for this content multiplier is the explosion sensor and actuator counts. Every joint and point of contact requires accurate sensing and precision motor control and every sensor and actuator drives the signal chain and power management opportunity for ADI.\nTo further capture this flourishing opportunity, we're investing in higher-level application-specific solutions that integrates multiple sensing modalities, such as pressure, vibration, depth, acoustics, vision and positioning with high accuracy, ultra-low power signal chains, functionally safe power management and AI algorithms powered by robotics foundation models.\nSimultaneously, we're collaborating with NVIDIA on a range of digital twin simulation programs and reference designs for humanoid and other robotic systems to accelerate development and AI training for our customers. This work is particularly relevant for high-value applications such as dexterous manipulation of cable assemblies in data centers and of course, in automotive manufacturing to name just one.\nWe are combining ADI's unique sensor expertise and our latest advances in robotics policy training techniques to enhance realism in NVIDIA's [indiscernible] Isaac SIM and substantially shorten our customers' innovation time lines.\nSo in summary, we're capitalizing on growth in advanced robotics today and investing to capture even more value in the future. Ultimately, the strategy of investments and customer impact of our robotics business is a microcosm of our approach across ADI mainly on covering and tackling the hardest innovation challenges at the intelligent physical edge and leveraging our industry-leading technology portfolio and expertise to solve them.\nAs we turn our attention to the end of fiscal '25 and the beginning of the new fiscal year, we're focused on executing our strategy and capitalizing on cyclical and idiosyncratic momentum. Despite the geopolitical and macro turbulence, we remain undeterred and excited by the tremendous growth opportunities that we see over both the near and long terms.\nAnd with that, I'm going to pass it on to Rich.\n\nRichard C. Puccio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vince. Now on to our third quarter results. Revenue of $2.88 billion came in above the high end of our outlook, up 9% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. Industrial represented 45% of our third quarter revenue, finishing up 12% sequentially and 23% year-over-year.\nOur industrial recovery has continued with sequential growth across all subsectors and regions, year-over-year growth accelerated across all major applications led by our automatic test equipment business, fueled by increasing AI investment. Additionally, our aerospace and defense business had a record quarter.\nAutomotive represented 30% of quarterly revenue, finishing down 1% sequentially and up 22% year-over-year. Double-digit year-over-year growth continues to be driven by our leading connectivity and functionally safe power solutions. Communications represented 13% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 18% sequentially and 40% year-over-year. Our wireline and data center business, which is roughly 2/3 of total communications, grew double digits sequentially and year-over-year as increasing AI demand continues. Wireless also grew double digits both sequentially and year-over-year. And lastly, consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 16% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, marking the fourth straight quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth.\nWe continue to see strength across handsets, gaming, hearables and wearables.\nNow on to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 69.2% and operating margin was 42.2%, up 100 basis points sequentially and year-over-year. Nonoperating expenses finished at $57 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 11.9%. All told, EPS was $2.05, above the high end of our guided range and up 30% year-over-year.\nNow I'd like to highlight a few items from our balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Cash and short-term investments finished the quarter at $3.5 billion. Our net leverage ratio remained virtually flat at 1.1. Inventory increased $72 million sequentially in support of the cycle recovery. Days of inventory declined to 160 and channel weeks ticked lower.\nWe are continuing to execute our strategy of keeping leaner channel inventories while maintaining higher levels on our balance sheet. Over the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow and CapEx were $4.2 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. We continue to expect fiscal 2025 CapEx to be within our long-term model of 4% to 6% of revenue.\nFree cash flow over the trailing 12 months was $3.7 billion or 35% of revenue and we have returned $3.5 billion in cash to shareholders over the last 4 quarters. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return over the long term using 40% to 60% for our dividend and the remainder for share count reduction.\nNow on to our fourth quarter guidance. Revenue is expected to be $3 billion, plus or minus $100 million. On a sequential basis, at the midpoint, we expect industrial, communications and consumer to increase with the fastest growth in industrial. Automotive is expected to decline. Operating margin is expected to increase to 43.5%, plus or minus 100 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13% -- and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.22, plus or minus $0.10.\nIn closing, our strong results and outlook for continued growth, especially in the industrial market, reinforce our view that 2025 will close as a strong recovery year for ADI. However, we are mindful of the continued uncertainty facing customers with respect to tariffs and are monitoring the impacts closely. We believe we are well positioned to successfully navigate an evolving global operating environment, thanks to the optionality enabled by the diversity of our markets, applications and products and the resilience of our hybrid manufacturing strategy.\nWith that, let's go to our Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question in order to allow us for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have follow-up questions, please requeue and we will take your questions if time allows. Operator, can we have our first question, please?"

With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Rich Puccio.\nFor anyone who missed the release, you can find it and related financial schedules at investor.analog.com.\nOnto the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and other periodic parts and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from this forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only at the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except required by law.\nReferences to gross margin, operating and nonoperating expenses, operating margin, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow in our comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis. These excluded special items. When comparing our results to historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. All references to earnings per share are on a fully diluted basis.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche.\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. First quarter revenue profitability and earnings per share all finished above the midpoint of our outlook. And while we continue to operate in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our first quarter results and outlook for double-digit year-over-year growth in our second quarter builds my confidence that 2025 will be a year of growth.\nOur track record of resilience and profitability through cycles, combined with our strong balance sheet supports our long-standing robust capital return program. I'm delighted to share that we've increased our dividend for the 21st consecutive year, and that over just the past 5 years, we have returned more than $16 billion or roughly 15% of our current market cap to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nTurning now to our operating environment. The magnitude and duration of this most recent semiconductor cycle has surprised many of us. But we believe ADI has entered and is well positioned for sustained recovery. Throughout the cycle, we invested diligently to enhance and leverage our hybrid manufacturing model to support the dynamic needs of our customers, both big and small. We work closely with our customers to be responsive to their evolving business needs and map factory starts to true end demand. As a result, inventory levels have largely normalized and our partnership approach with our customers throughout the volatility of the past several years has enabled us to balance supply and real demand.\nWhile the macro backdrop will continue to influence the pace of our recovery, the signals we monitor from lean channel inventories to gradual bookings improvements over the past 18 months. support our view that we've passed the cyclical trough and the tide has turned in our favor. Throughout the cycle, we've been busily deepening our customer engagements and accelerating our pipeline growth and conversion.\nMany of the design wins I've shared on recent calls are [ now ] contributing to growth. And let me give you some examples. For example, in industrial automation, the shift towards decentralized intelligence to enable modular manufacturing is driving significant growth in software-defined connectivity solutions. Our software configurable I/O products that double channel density and reduce power consumption by 40% have been installed across all major automation suppliers. Revenue from these wins has begun ramping and the automation market begins to recover and will provide a durable revenue stream over the next decade.\nWithin the growing surgical robotics segment, increasing levels of content from across our portfolio, and in particular, or high precision solutions are being deployed in next-generation surgical systems. And additionally, in health care, the growing interest in a data-driven approach to health and wellness is creating a convergence of the clinical and consumer markets and driving demand for higher performance of vital signs monitoring in consumer wearables. Our suite of high-performance sensors, signal chains and efficient power solutions and wins at leaders in these markets position us for double-digit growth this year.\nWithin the automatic test equipment market, the growth of AI has significantly increased our signal chain and power content. In some cases, by up to 300% across memory test systems. Customers are leveraging our solutions to increase channel density and throughput while reducing power demands by up to 30% per system. In light of increased hyperscaler CapEx, we expect our 2025 memory and high-performance compute test revenue to achieve strong growth.\nIn our broad aerospace and defense portfolio, our modules, which support ASPs often into the hundreds of thousands of dollars are expected to lead double-digit growth in this industrial subsector in 2025. In addition, we're anticipating growth this year from newer design wins in [ orap ] and power in the military and commercial satellite sectors.\nIn automotive, the convergence of trends ranging from autonomy to electrification to immersive in-cabin experiences continue to drive robust demand for many of our solutions. For example, our GMSL portfolio is outpacing the growth of advanced driver assistance systems and is positioned to reach yet another record-breaking year in 2025. Since acquiring this video connectivity technology in 2021, our revenue has nearly tripled. We're also anticipating continued record-setting revenue from our A2B and functionally safe power franchises, which share similar growth trajectories.\nLastly, in electric vehicles, BMS is poised to return to growth in '25 after a challenging prior year. Part of this growth is coming from our higher content wireless solution wins with key OEMs ramping in America and Europe.\nIn communications, our growth is predominantly being driven by robust CapEx investments to support AI infrastructure build-outs. Our high-precision electrooptical controller is now shipping in a 1.6 terabit optical module for AI systems based on industry-leading GPUs. On the power side of the data center, we are delivering high voltage power path protection systems, which are on a strong growth trajectory, and we'll begin shipping our vertical power solutions later in this year.\nFinally, in consumer, design wins secured in recent years at multiple customers across numerous applications, including premium handsets, hearables, wearables and gaming systems, began to drive robust diversified growth in the second half of fiscal '24, with even more content in upcoming launches, we expect a strong year ahead and beyond in consumer. Collectively, we anticipate these combined cyclical and idiosyncratic trends to return us to a solid growth path this year.\nSo in closing, the relatively favorable position in which we find ourselves coming out of one of the worst downturns the industry has ever experienced, is not by chance. But rather a reflection of our fiscal and operational discipline, commitment to the success of our customers and our investments for the long term. And while I'm excited about our prospects for 2025, I'm even more excited about the longer-term opportunities across numerous concurrent secular growth areas, including automation, digital health care electrification, automotive, data center and many, many more.\nA common request from our customers across our many diversified applications is that we help them attain the increasing complexity by bringing more complete solutions to them, a reflection of our robust technology stack and stellar customer reputation. In stepping up to our customers' challenge, we continue to push the edges by investing vigorously in our world-class analog, mixed signal and power portfolios and integrate higher levels of supporting digital and software into our solutions to meet our customers at the application layer.\nAnd so with that, I'd like to pass the call over to Rich.\n\nRichard C. Puccio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vince, and let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. First quarter revenue of $2.42 billion came in above the midpoint of our outlook for a 1% sequential decrease and a 4% decline year-over-year. Adjusting for the extra week in our fiscal Q1 2024, however, our Q1 '25 performance represents a 4% increase in our first year-over-year growth since Q2 of 2023.\nIndustrial represented 44% of our first quarter revenue, finishing up 1% sequentially. The improved customer inventory backdrop is benefiting each of our industrial [ subsectors ]. In addition, we are seeing stronger demand in our automatic test and aerospace and defense businesses, each of which were up year-over-year. Automotive represented 30% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 2% sequentially. Our leading connectivity and functionally safe power solutions were each up double digits year-over-year once again, reflecting secular content growth and greater share position.\nCommunications represented 12% of quarterly revenue, finishing up 6% sequentially. Wireline, which makes up roughly 2/3 of our total communications business, was up double digits sequentially and year-over-year, driven by data center infrastructure build-outs fueled by AI demand. Conversely, our wireless revenue continues to see demand challenges. And lastly, consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue, finishing down 15% sequentially, reflecting seasonal [ latency ].\nOur second consecutive quarter of robust year-over-year growth reflects our greater share and stronger content position across a diversified list of applications.\nNow on to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 68.8%, up 90 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable product mix. OpEx in the quarter was $687 million, up $32 million sequentially, resulting in an operating margin of 40.5%. All told, nonoperating expenses finished at $58 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. All told, adjusted EPS was $1.63, at the high end of our guided range.\nNow I'd like to highlight a few items from our balance sheet and cash flow statements. Cash and short-term investments finished the quarter at $2.7 billion, and our net leverage ratio decreased to 1.1. Inventory increased $27 million sequentially as we replenish the die bank of our fastest-turning products. Days of inventory increased to 176, while channel weeks moved lower and remained below our target of 7 to 8 weeks.\nOver the trailing 12 months operating cash flow and CapEx were $3.8 billion and $656 million, respectively. We continue to expect CapEx for fiscal '25 to decrease from '24 and fall within our long-term model of 4% to 6% of revenue. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months was $3.2 billion or 34% of revenue. And during the same time period, we have returned more than $2.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nAs a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return over the long term, using 40% to 60% for our dividend with the remainder used for share count reduction. As Vince mentioned, we announced an 8% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.99 from $0.92. In addition, our Board has authorized an incremental $10 billion for share repurchases resulting in roughly $11.5 billion of remaining buyback potential under our current program.\nNow moving on to guidance. Second quarter revenue is expected to be $2.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million. On a sequential basis, at the midpoint, we expect Industrial to lead our growth and automotive to grow, while communications and consumer decline. Operating margin is expected to be [ 40.5% ], plus or minus 100 basis points flat sequentially due to a notable uptick in variable compensation. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%, and based on these imports, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.68 plus or minus $0.10.\nBefore passing it back to Mike to begin our Q&A session, I'd like to address the near-term backdrop. Overall, our business continues to improve up our Q2 '24 trough in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment. We saw further order improvement and a positive book-to-bill during Q1. Importantly, bookings strength was driven by industrial and automotive, our 2 largest end markets. Given this trend and the exciting product cycles Vince described, I'm confident we will return to long-term model growth in 2025 and believe we are well positioned to capture additional upside should macro conditions improve.\nOver to you, Mike.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThanks, Rich. Let's get to the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to one question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question, please requeue and we'll take your question if time allows it. With that, queue our first question, please."

Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Rich Puccio. For anyone who missed the release, you find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.\nOnto the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law.\nReferences to gross margin, operating, nonoperating expenses, operating margin, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow in our comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis.

Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. With stronger demand for our high-performance product portfolio and skillful execution resulted in third quarter revenue of more than $2.3 billion, operating margin north of 41% and EPS of $1.58, all above the midpoint of our outlook. These favorable results, combined with improved customer inventory levels and order momentum across most of our markets, increased my confidence that our second quarter marked the cyclical bottom for ADI.\nBy optimism remains guarded however, this challenging economic and geopolitical conditions are limiting a sharp recovery. We continue to balance near-term fiscal discipline with strategic investments in our long-term growth initiatives, positioning ADI to capitalize on the extraordinary opportunities that we see ahead.\nNow I'd like to draw attention to our industrial end market, which is our largest, most diverse and most profitable business, generating durable revenue streams that last close to 2 decades on average. As our business begins to recover from the pandemics volatility, we're excited about the tremendous long-term growth opportunities of the industrial market. We offer our customers an unparalleled suite of high-performance solutions stretching from antenna to bits, sensor to cloud and nanowatts to kilowatts.\nOur extensive technology portfolio, combined with our deep domain expertise and engineering muscle has enabled us to secure leading positions across the most attractive industrial sectors. Now with growing digital software and algorithmic capabilities, augmenting our cutting-edge and our portfolio, ADI is strongly positioned to solve our customers' most difficult challenges in factory and process automation energy efficiency, secure connectivity and many, many more.\nTo illustrate the power and potential of our industrial franchise, let me share with you a few examples of how our recent innovations are unlocking new revenue streams and positioning us for strong growth in the years ahead. For example, our instrumentation and test business which include scientific instruments, electronic test and measurement and automated test equipment is essential to the important scientific and technological advancements of the digital era.\nWithin automated test equipment, for example, our next-generation solutions increased channel density and throughput while reducing energy consumption by up to 30% per system. These are crucial parameters for testing complex, high-performance compute GPUs and high-bandwidth memory systems for AI. As the AI infrastructure [indiscernible] remains a priority for global hyperscalers, we expect growth to continue into 2025 and indeed well beyond.\nTurning now to aerospace and defense, which has been our most resilient business during this downturn. ADI's domain expertise in high-performance portfolio across RF and Microwave, high speed and precision converters, power and MEMS, uniquely positions us to deliver complete edge solutions, offering our customers scale, velocity and lower total cost of ownership.\nAs an example, we're building upon our programmable Apollo Signal Gen platform today to create full software-defined [indiscernible] communications and sensor systems which has the potential to increase our SAM by 5x in commercial, defense and aerospace communication systems. Indeed, we see a path to double-digit revenue growth in this sector in 2025, fueled by several high-value design wins that are going to production.\nIn automation, though we've seen a slower recovery to date, we remain strongly confident in its future growth potential as the benefits of increased productivity are ever more clear. Customers are prioritizing enhanced digitalization and IT/OT integration on the factory floors. Their deployments of in-line instrumentation and advanced robotics are driving the need for more sensing, edge processing, secure connectivity and car management.\nWithin robotics, we're seeing a progression from fixed arm machines to autonomous and mobile robots to eventually humanoid robots. This evolution creates additional opportunities for our precision signal chain franchise, and sensing connectivity and motion control subsystems with fully isolated and efficient power solutions can drive content from hundreds of dollars in robots today to thousands in autonomous and humanoid robots.\nWhat is additionally exciting about these advances, is their broad applicability beyond factories such as surgical robots and imaging systems in health care. ADI's products have the potential to dramatically improve a surgeon's effectiveness through a more precise surgical experience with lower latency connectivity. Additionally, patients gained the potential benefits of shorter hospital stays and fewer complications. The evolution in robotics is expected to unlock billions of dollars of potential opportunity for our high-performance Analog, mixed signal, power connectivity and sensing solutions. We see the potential for a doubling of our robotics revenue in the years ahead.\nTurning now to energy transmission and distribution. Our customers are modernizing and digitalizing the electrical grid to respond to exponentially accelerating energy demand, driven in part by the proliferation of electric transportation and rapid AI adoption. This process is resulting in a grid that is distributed dynamic and bidirectional, a paradigm shift from the past model of linear, stable supply.\nWe're working with traditional suppliers and disruptors to enable the necessary intelligence for the new grid from decentralized power plants to the distribution edge. We're leveraging our analog and algorithm capabilities in cutting-edge energy monitoring and management solutions. Additionally, our battery management technology increases capacity and improves energy utilization in the grid's renewable energy storage systems. This reimagined intelligent grid of the future has the potential to expand our SAM by over $10 billion and creates tailwinds for our energy franchise for many years to come.\nGiven the synergies across our industrial portfolio, our pace of innovation and the emerging signs of market recovery, we're optimistic for our industrial business that has turned the corner and '25 will be a robust growth year.\nSo in closing, our investments in high-performance Analog solutions are enabling us to intersect with and leverage the numerous concurrent secular trends that transcend the business cycle and will propel us into the future. Our commitment to our customers' success and to impactful innovation will be the path that carries us there, ultimately increasing long-term shareholder value.\nAnd so with that, I'm going to turn it over to Rich, who will take you through the numbers.\n\nRichard C. Puccio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Third quarter revenue of $2.31 billion came in above the midpoint of our outlook finishing up 7% sequentially and down 25% year-over-year. Industrial represented 46% of revenue in the third quarter, finishing up 6% sequentially and down 37% year-over-year. Every major application increased sequentially, except for automation, which declined at a much slower pace than it had in previous quarters. Automotive represented 29% of revenue finishing flat sequentially and down 8% year-over-year.\nWe saw continued double-digit growth year-over-year for our industry-leading connectivity and functionally safe power platforms. Conversely, automotive production cuts are extending inventory digestion across customers, particularly impacting our legacy automotive and electrification businesses. Communications represented 12% of revenue, finishing up 10% sequentially and down 26% year-over-year. slowing customer inventory digestion enabled both wireless and wireline growth sequentially.\nAnd lastly, consumer represented 14% of revenue, finishing up 29% sequentially and increased year-over-year for the first time since 2022. We saw diversified growth across applications with notable strength in portables and gaming.\nNow let's move from the top line to the rest of the P&L. Third quarter gross margin was 67.9%, up 120 basis points sequentially, driven by higher revenue, higher utilization and favorable mix. Operating expenses in the quarter were $619 million, up modestly sequentially, driven primarily by higher variable compensation. Operating margin of 41.2% exceeded the high end of our outlook. Nonoperating expenses finished at $70 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 10.8%. The net result was EPS of $1.58 which finish near the high end of our outlook.\nOur financial position is solid, and I'd like to call out a few items from our balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q3 with more than $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and a net leverage ratio of 1.2. Inventory decreased $51 million sequentially and days declined to 178 from 192. As planned, we reduced channel inventory further this quarter with weeks ending near the low end of our 7- to 8-week target.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter and trailing 12 months was $0.9 billion and $4 billion, respectively. CapEx for the quarter and trailing 12 months was $154 million and $1 billion, respectively. For fiscal '24, CapEx is tracking to our $700 million plan, which is down roughly 45% versus 2023 as our hybrid manufacturing investment cycle tapers. Not included in these figures are the anticipated benefits from both the European and U.S. CHIPS Act.\nDuring the last 12 months, we generated $2.9 billion of free cash flow or 30% of revenue. Over the same time period, we have returned $2.8 billion via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our strategy is to return 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders over the long term.\nNow I'll turn to the fourth quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.5 -- $2.4 billion, plus or minus $100 million, up 4% sequentially at the midpoint. We expect sell-through to be roughly equal to sell in this quarter. At the midpoint on a sequential basis, we expect industrial and consumer to increase communications to be flattish and automotive to decrease.\nOperating margin is expected to be 41%, plus or minus 100 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, EPS is expected to be $1.63 plus or minus $0.10.\nIn closing, our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook support our view that we have passed this cycle's trough. However, challenging economic and geopolitical conditions are limiting a faster demand recovery.\nI will now give it back to Mike for Q&A."

Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThank you, Gigi, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Rich Puccio.\nFor anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.\nOn to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release, and our periodic report and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update the statements, except as required by law.\nReference to gross margin, operating and nonoperating expenses, operating margin, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow in our comments today will be on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's release.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince.\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Mike. Good morning, and a big welcome to you all. So in the second quarter, our strong focus [ on ] execution resulted in revenue of $2.16 billion, with profitability and earnings per share finishing above the high end of our outlook.\nWith 2Q now behind us, we believe we've passed the low point of this cycle. Notably, global manufacturing PMIs, which are highly correlated with our core business are improving, customer inventories are stabilizing, and our bookings have improved for a third consecutive quarter.\nOur growing optimism remains guarded however, as short-term economic and geopolitical uncertainty persists. As such, we will continue to manage the near term with great discipline as we fund and execute against our longer-term strategic priorities to drive increasing levels of value for all of our stakeholders.\nSo with that framing, I'd like to share some examples with you of how we are continuing to strengthen ADI's high-performance franchise across all markets and creating unique growth drivers that would be additive to what we hope will be a strong cyclical recovery.\nFor example, in health care, we have exciting wins in areas such as the rapidly expanding surgical robotics market where the performance of our precision signal processing and connectivity solutions is critical. And in the fast-growing continuous glucose monitoring space, we've won multiple opportunities across several customers.\nOur unique, digitally-enabled analog front-end solutions increase the accuracy and power efficiency of sensors and extend battery life from days to weeks.\nIn industrial automation, the growth of the digital factory is accelerating upgrades to hire bandwidth, deterministic, industrial Ethernet that can support up to 10x the number of edge devices across the factory floor. We believe our leadership position with key customers will create a durable revenue stream beginning next year that can grow to several hundreds of millions of dollars as deployments ramp over time.\nTurning to automotive. Our solid performance is being driven by the proliferation of higher content vehicles that use more power management, more connectivity and an increasing number of sensor platforms that open new signal processing opportunities for ADI. The increase in content per vehicle is a pervasive trend across all vehicle types, combustion engines, hybrids and full EVs.\nFor example, in advanced safety, we've increased our GMSL design wins from 12 to 15 of the top 20 OEMs, and expanded our engagements at 2 European and 1 Korean OEM who intend to deploy our high-performance, high-bandwidth connectivity solution across a larger share of their fleets. We've also seen strong attach for a functionally safe power, which is used with sensors and displays and ADAS systems and recently increased share at the leading global car manufacturer.\nIn electrification, we've expanded our battery management system share at leading Chinese OEMs and more than doubled our BMS share [ and ] upcoming European OEM model launches and 2 manufacturers intend to deploy our higher content wireless solutions starting next year.\nNow I'd like to use the rest of my prepared comments today to share our perspective on the role that artificial intelligence is playing and will play at ADI in the future. This technology has clearly reached a tipping point, and our AI opportunity spans from sensor to cloud. While we've been adding algorithmic and software intelligence to our products now for decades, we've expanded the scope and pace of our investments in recent years.\nToday, we are increasingly leveraging AI in and around our products as well as in our operations, to more fully meet our customers' needs and extend our industry leadership. We're deploying AI internally to help accelerate engineering development, enhanced manufacturing efficiency and create a better customer experience. But the majority of our activities are centered around product portfolio innovations that position us to take advantage of AI's enormous potential.\nWe see this business opportunity coming in 2 distinct waves. The first wave, focused on infrastructure is now underway, and as we all know, is growing very rapidly. In order to tackle the intensified energy and processing demands of AI compute systems, data center customers are investing in new vertical power architectures. As we highlighted previously, our vertical power technology, which can reduce power losses by up to 35% compared to existing architectures, is gaining traction with hyperscalers.\nWe continue to leverage our heterogeneous integration expertise to create more efficient, smaller vertical power solutions that deliver more value and enable us to capture more share in this nascent space.\nPower-efficient computing, though, is just one challenge, the AI ecosystem faces. Data must also be transported efficiently, securely and at much, much greater speeds. This is driving wireline customers to upgrade connectivity infrastructure, sparking a transition to 800 gigabit and 1.6 terabit optical modules.\nAt the electro-optical interface, our ability to provide high-performance solutions that integrate analog, digital and memory in a reduced form factor is indeed a key differentiator. Our high-precision controller was recently designed into a 1.6-terabit optical module used in the next-gen AI systems of the high-performance compute leader.\nIn Industrial, AI is fueling extraordinary demand for high-bandwidth memory and high-performance compute. This, in turn, is driving a new growth vector for our instrumentation and test business, particularly in SoC and memory test. We're working with key players globally to enable faster digital scan speeds, higher channel density and the improved energy efficiency necessary to scale production of AI systems.\nThe significantly greater amount of ADI content in these systems is positioning our high-performance compute and memory test sectors for record revenues in the near to midterm. The opportunity ahead for ADI is to compound the impact of this first wave by bringing application-specific AI models and high-performance compute right down to the physical edge, creating greater system value with added improvements in the latency, power efficiency, security and cost.\nSo let me share some examples of how we are working to amplify this second wave. For example, in acoustic systems, we are combining our application-specific algorithms with ultralow energy processing hardware to enrich our audio platform offerings. We're also developing a mixed signal processor with embedded neural networks that enable a system to learn and adapt to the highly variable nature of sound in real time. Excitingly, we have strong traction with multiple customers in this area.\nNow in the same vein, we're leveraging our rich domain expertise with our growing processing capabilities to enhance our advanced connectivity platform. In next-generation 5G radios, for example, we've implemented the first AI-enabled technology, combining an energy-efficient, real-time neural network with an AI-assisted development tool to give customers the ability to solve their linearization challenges in a fraction of the time.\nIn our power management platform, we're using AI to address the arduous challenge of tuning power [ trees ] for volatile consumption patterns in data centers. Our solutions reduce complexity for power engineers and compress the time required from weeks to hours, helping to lower costs and, of course, accelerate time to market.\nADI has always operated at the physical edge where the world's most important real data is born. As multimodal AI becomes more pervasive at the edge, and the diversity of sensor types is used to unearth deeper insights, we expect to see an explosion of demand that will accelerate growth for our broad signal chain as well as power portfolios.\nIn short, ADI's AI future looks bright across the continuum of sensor to cloud.\nSo in closing, I'm very proud of how our team has executed in one of the largest downturns the semiconductor industry has seen. More importantly, I've never been more excited about how we're positioned for the future and what it holds for ADI.\nAnd so with that, I'm going to hand it over to Rich.\n\nRichard C. Puccio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vince, and let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. As a reminder, our first quarter 2024 was a 14-week quarter, so we are going to limit our comparison this quarter to year-over-year only.\nSecond quarter revenue of $2.16 billion finished above the midpoint of our outlook, this result was down 34% year-over-year. Industrial represented 47% of revenue in the quarter and was down 44% year-over-year. As expected, all applications were impacted by inventory digestion. However, aerospace and defense revenues outperformed broader industrial.\nAutomotive represented 30% of revenue and was down 10% year-over-year. Continued growth in our leading connectivity and functionally safe power franchises balanced broad-based declines elsewhere.\nCommunications represented 11% of revenue and was down 45% year-over-year. Inventory digestion and weaker demand impacted both our wireline and wireless businesses.\nAnd lastly, consumer represented 11% of revenue and was down 9% year-over-year with growth in portables, partially offsetting declines across other applications.\nNow let's move from the top line to the rest of the P&L. Second quarter gross margin was 66.7%, down sequentially and year-over-year driven by unfavorable mix, lower revenue and lower utilization as we continue to reduce inventory. Operating expenses in the quarter were $598 million, down significantly year-over-year, driven by lower variable compensation and strong organization-wide execution on cost control. Operating margin of 39% exceeded the high end of our outlook.\nNonoperating expenses finished at $64 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 10.6%. The net result was EPS of $1.40, above the high end of our outlook.\nOur financial position is solid, and I'd like to call out a few items from our balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q2 with more than $2.3 billion of cash and short-term investments and a net leverage ratio of 1.1.\nDuring the quarter, we raised $1.1 billion of debt for general corporate purposes, including upcoming debt maturities. Inventory decreased $74 million sequentially and days declined to 192 from 201. As planned, we reduced channel inventory this quarter with weeks ending at approximately 8.\nOperating cash flow for the quarter [ and ] trailing 12 months was $0.8 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. CapEx for the quarter [ and ] trailing 12 months was $188 million and $1.2 billion, respectively. We continue to expect fiscal '24 CapEx to be roughly $700 million, which is a reduction of approximately 45% versus 2023, as our hybrid manufacturing investment cycle tapers. Not included in these figures are the benefits from both the European and U.S. CHIPS Act.\nDuring the last 12 months, we generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow or 29% of revenue. Over the same time period, we have returned roughly 110% of our free cash flow via dividends and share repurchases. As a reminder, our policy is to return 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders over the long term.\nNow I'll turn to the third quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.27 billion, plus or minus $100 million, up 5% sequentially at the midpoint. Once again, we expect sell-through to be higher than sell-in. At the midpoint, we expect all B2B markets to increase sequentially with the fastest growth in industrial and for consumer to exhibit seasonal strength.\nOperating margin is expected to be 40%, plus or minus 100 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.50, plus or minus $0.10.\nBefore passing it back to Mike to begin Q&A, I'll share some [ final ] thoughts on our near term. As Vince indicated, we believe we are at the beginning of a cyclical recovery as our bookings increased throughout the quarter, and we exited 2Q with a book-to-bill above parity for the first time in well over a year.\nNo doubt, cyclical transitions can be challenging, but they also provide opportunity for outsized business acceleration when approached for the balance of fiscal discipline, smart risk taking and strong execution. ADI has always excelled in these areas, and we look forward to driving outstanding value for our stakeholders in the quarters to come.\nWith that, I'll pass it back to Mike for Q&A."

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThank you, Josh, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Rich Puccio. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.\nOn to the disclosures.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2024 was a 14-week quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince?\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Mike, and good morning to you all. But before I begin, I'd like to welcome ADI's new CFO, Richard Puccio, to the call, which is only a few weeks in, but we're very excited to have him on board. He brings tremendous financial experience and capability from complex technology sectors, which I think will be very valuable as we continue to extend our leadership in the intelligent edge era. I'd also like to recognize Jim Mollica for serving as interim CFO and thank Jim for his continued partnership and contributions to our success.\nNow on to the results for the first quarter. ADI delivered revenue of more than $2.5 billion, operating margins of 42% and earnings per share of $1.73, all above the midpoint of our outlook. As we previously discussed, the inventory rationalization at our customers that began during the middle of 2023 is expected to continue through our second quarter. Encouragingly, first quarter bookings improved sequentially, growing our confidence that inventory-related headwinds will largely subside this quarter. That said, the macro situation remains challenging, and the shape and timing of a second half recovery will be governed by underlying demand.\nImportantly, the strength of our balance sheet, operational agility and prudent capital management are serving us well during this downturn. We've invested heavily in R&D, customer engagement activity and manufacturing resiliency fueling our future growth even as we maintain the industry-leading profitability that supports our practice of robust capital returns. To that end, I'm pleased to highlight that we announced a 7% dividend increase yesterday, making 2024 the 20th consecutive year of higher dividends for shareholders.\nNow digging a little deeper into our investment philosophy, we continue to focus on anticipating our customers' future needs in what's becoming a software-defined, AI-driven world, leveraging pervasive sensing, edge computing and ubiquitous connectivity. The technological complexity facing our customers is compounded by their need to deliver solutions that are both secure and extremely power efficient. So let me share a little more now about how we are strategically allocating our capital to deliver more solutions value to our customers and further support their confidence in long-term supply assurance.\nSince our acquisition of Maxim, we've increased our engineering population by around 10%, complementing our world-class Analog talent with increasing levels of digital, software, AI and systems expertise. This breadth of engineering gives ADI the capabilities to tackle more of our customers' challenges and grow our SAM across markets. In addition, as our engineers increasingly work shoulder to shoulder with our customers to co-architect their solutions, we further deepen our understanding of their technological and market complexities. This strengthens our ability to deliver increasingly stronger innovation from components to physical edge systems.\nAnd I'd like to share now a few examples of what I mean. For example, in the industrial sector, digital transformation is driving investment in edge-based connectivity and control platforms that enable secure, power-efficient monitoring and control of automation systems. Last month, Honeywell announced that we'll use ADI's deterministic ethernet and software configurable I/O solutions across their factory automation and building management offerings. Our portfolio enables customers to securely deliver end-to-end signal integrity between the edge and the cloud in a power-efficient and highly flexible platform configuration. This system approach enables us to capture 3x more value, and we expect additional design wins due to high customer interest globally.\nIn the automotive sector, we've aligned our business to the secular trends of electrification, advanced safety systems and immersive digital in-cabin experience. For example, our Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link, or GMSL solution, continues to gain broader adoption as customers seek to extend high-performance data and video capabilities across their fleets. We recently increased our share at a top 3 global auto manufacturer, extending our position across all their brands and quintupling our GMSL opportunity at that customer.\nIn data centers, AI and machine learning computing systems require orders of magnitude more processing, and thus energy compared to traditional workloads. Our portfolio of high-performance power and protection solutions, specifically designed for vertical power delivery is helping customers rearchitect their data center systems to improve power delivery and system performance. Last quarter, we secured a significant design win from a large hyperscale customer for our multiphase vertical power solution that reduces power losses by 35% when compared to conventional ones.\nIn Healthcare, this market continues to digitalize to enable more predictive and preventative treatment regimens. ADI has been on the forefront of this transition, and I'm pleased to let you know that we've recently received FDA clearance for a noninvasive remote monitoring platform, that enables home-based management of chronic diseases such as congestive heart failure. This solution leverages our deep domain expertise, leading-edge capabilities across signal processing and sensor modalities, and unique algorithms that enable medical providers to act early, precisely and effectively. As a platform, this also allows us in the future to use our data-driven AI algorithms to make this even more personalized. This advance unlocks a new growth vector for ADI, adding more than $5 billion of new [indiscernible].\nSwitching now to the evolution of our supply chain, I'd like to share some of our progress in manufacturing resilience, which is a growing priority for our customers. Over the last 2 years, we've invested record levels of CapEx to expand our capacity and to enhance resiliency. Now with line of sight to achieving our goal of doubling front and back-end internal capacity in 2025 and will begin to significantly reduce our capital spend.\nNotably, approximately 10% of our investments have been focused on implementing more efficient systems that will deliver sustainability benefits, including greatly reducing input resources and emissions, which, over time, will also lower our operating costs. These investments enable a more flexible hybrid manufacturing model and will increase our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years. This unique ability helps to capture the upside in strong demand backdrops and better protect our gross margins during more challenging times.\nComplementing these organic investments, we also extended our foundry partnership with TSMC to secure additional 300-millimeter fine-pitch technology capacity at their Japan subsidiary. Our investments, combined with the support of our foundry partners will enable us to manufacture our products in multiple geographic locations, enhancing our resiliency and giving our customers greater optionality and assurance over their supply chains.\nSo in closing, as always, we're keeping one eye on the present and one eye on the future. I have confidence in the steps that we're taking to preserve our capital and navigate the near-term challenges while ensuring that we make the necessary investments to increase our competitiveness and accelerate our business in the future.\nAnd so with that, I'd like to pass the microphone over to Rich.\n\nRichard C. Puccio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Vince. And let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm excited to have joined ADI and look forward to helping the company navigate the near term while ensuring we are well positioned to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. Despite continued challenging business conditions, we achieved first quarter revenue, which was slightly above the midpoint of our outlook or down 8% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Industrial represented 48% of revenue in the quarter, down 12% sequentially and 31% year-over-year.\nAs expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Automotive, which represented 29% of revenue, was up 2% sequentially and 9% versus the year ago period, representing 14 consecutive quarters of growth. Notably our leading connectivity and functionally safe power solutions collectively increased double digits year-over-year.\nCommunications, which represented 12% of revenue, declined 10% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, wireline fared relatively well driven by AI-related demand, while wireless decreased as global investments in 5G remain depressed. And lastly, consumer represented 11% of revenue, down 7% sequentially and 22% year-over-year driven by continued sluggish end demand across applications. Now on to the rest of the P&L. First quarter gross margin was 69%, down sequentially and year-over-year driven by unfavorable mix lower revenue and lower utilization.\nOpEx in the quarter was $679 million, down 2% sequentially despite the extra week, driven by lower variable comp, disciplined discretionary spend and structural cost improvement. As a result, operating margin of 42% finished near the high end of our outlook. Nonoperating expenses finished at $75 million, and the tax rate for the quarter was 11.8%. All told, EPS was $1.73, slightly above the guided midpoint.\nNow on to the balance sheet. Cash and equivalents increased more than $340 million sequentially and ended the quarter at $1.3 billion, our net leverage ratio remained below 1. Inventory decreased nearly $90 million sequentially, driven primarily by finished goods, while days increased to 201 due to lower revenue. Channel inventory dollars declined again in 1Q with weeks of inventory finishing slightly above our target range of 7 to 8 weeks.\nMoving on to cash flow items. Over the trailing 12 months, operating cash flow and CapEx were $4.6 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 CapEx to be approximately $700 million. As a reminder, these are gross CapEx figures, not including any of the anticipated benefits from both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Over the last 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 28% of revenue. During the same time period, we have returned more than $4.2 billion through dividends and share repurchases.\nAnd since our Maxim acquisition, we have returned nearly $12 billion or more than 130% of free cash flow to shareholders, reducing share count by 8% while also increasing our dividend per share by 33%, including our most recently announced 7% increase. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return over the long term. We aim to use 40% to 60% to grow our dividend annually with the remaining free cash flow used for share count reduction.\nNow moving on to guidance. Second quarter revenue is expected to be $2.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million, once again, we expect sell-through to be higher than selling. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to decline sequentially with the largest decline in industrial as we continue to meaningfully reduce channel inventory. Operating margin is expected to be 37%, plus or minus 100 basis points. This includes the impact of unfavorable mix and lower utilization as we further reduce balance sheet inventory. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%. And based on these inputs, EPS is expected to be $1.26 plus or minus $0.10.\nIn closing, the actions we've taken to protect profitability in the near term as well as the natural shock absorbers embedded in ADI have enabled us to maintain strong profitability even as our quarterly revenue has fallen significantly from its peak. Importantly, with the strength of our financial profile and the growing importance of our technology, we will continue to invest confidently in our future, regardless of where we are in the cycle.\nI will now give it back to Mike for Q&A."

I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nGood morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's Interim CFO, Jim Mollica. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.\nOn our disclosures, the information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and as further described in our earnings release and other periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information. These statements reflect our expectations only as the call today. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law.\nOur references to gross and operating margin, operating and non-op expenses, tax rate, EPS and free cash flow will be on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items. When comparing our results to our hysterical performance, special items are also excluded from our prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.\nTwo comments before we go prepared remarks. We adjusted our mapping to better align revenue to customer end markets. This resulted in slight changes in our end market mix with industrial increasing in each of the other markets slightly lower. These changes are reflected on our web schedule in the quarterly results section for the last 3 years. And second, 1 more quick reminder, the first quarter of 2024 is a 14-week quarter. And with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent.\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. Though the industry is obviously moving through a more challenging period of the business cycle, I'm very pleased to share that we're preserving the strength of our financial performance while preparing for the market's recovery. .\nFourth quarter revenue was $2.7 billion, led by double-digit year-over-year growth in our automotive sector. The combination of careful expense management and our employees' commitment to high standards of execution enabled us to deliver operating margins of 44.7% and EPS of $2.01 for the quarter. For the fiscal year, '23 again set new high watermarks with revenue reaching $12.3 billion, supported by all-time highs in the industrial and automotive sectors. This resulted in EPS of $10.09 up 5% from a year ago. Notably, we returned a record $4.6 billion to shareholders in 2023, exceeding our 100% free cash flow return target.\nSince the closing of Maxim just over 2 years ago, ADI has returned roughly $12 billion to shareholders or nearly 15% of our market cap. Over the same time, we've reduced our share count by more than 6% and increased our dividend per share by 25%.\nNow looking to fiscal '24, the near-term dynamics remain uncertain. As you will recall, last quarter, we outlined a broad-based inventory correction across all markets and geographies, reflecting the deteriorating macro conditions and our improving lead times. Consistent with our view 90 days ago, we expect the customer inventory overhang to persist through the first half of the year.\nChallenging times like these confirm the wisdom and the strength of our business model. The diversification of our business across customers, applications and products helps to limit volatility while preserving profitability. Building upon that foundation, we took actions to better ensure we can deliver operating margins in the low 40s and solid free cash flow despite the revenue decline.\nImportantly, however, we're not simply battening down the hatches. A resilient financial model enables us to continue making the strategic investments necessary to allow us to capitalize on the upside when the business inflects higher. That longer-term focus and commitment is why our customers have the confidence to increasingly depend on us as a key strategic partner. I've been very heartened by my conversations with customers across many markets and geographies over this past quarter. Despite the near-term challenges, they share our optimism that the intelligent edge is enabling a future replete with opportunity, and they are clear about the expanding role that they expect ADI to play in their success. Our customers' optimism is reflected in the continued expansion of our design win pipeline, which increased by double digits again in 2023. That growth was enhanced by sustained momentum in our Maxim revenue synergies pipeline, which is tracking ahead of our initial expectations.\nWe expect synergy-driven revenue acceleration in '25 putting us on a path to achieve our goal of more than $1 billion in revenue synergy by 2027. The combination of our strong design win growth with recurring revenue streams from our 75,000 product SKUs, which have average life span of a decade or more creates a business with high barriers to entry that's both resilient and rich with growth opportunities.\nNow let me share some examples of recent wins with you. In Industrial Automation, we're increasingly delivering more complete solutions. At a top digital factory automation supplier, for example, we recently leveraged our anchor position in software configurable I/O to attach additional solutions value across power, isolation and connectivity. As a result, we captured 3x the bill of materials and secured design wins across their entire platform.\nIn Industrial Instrumentation, we've increased our design wins at SOC and memory test market leaders. Our next-generation solutions, increased channel density and throughput while reducing energy consumption by up to an incredible 30% per system. These are critical parameters for testing complex, high-performance compute GPUs and high-bandwidth memory for artificial intelligence systems.\nLooking now to automotive. In electrification, momentum continues for our wireless battery management system. This novel solution enables lower weight, greater scalability and improved manufacturing productivity, driving down the total cost of ownership for our customers while increasing ADI's content. Last quarter, we secured our fifth customer, a top 10 EV OEM, we'll begin to deploy our wireless solution in their next-gen EVs in 2026.\nNow furthermore, during the year, ADI reinforced our industry-leading position in automotive, high-performance functionally save power. To that end, we won next-generation power for ADAS systems at 4 top suppliers this past year. These wins add another growth vector to our automotive franchise, which has benefited from strong momentum across electrification and in-cabin connectivity.\nThis proliferation of ADAS is benefiting our high-speed GMSL connectivity portfolio. GMSL has been 1 of our fastest-growing areas and a major revenue synergy generator for us. In the last year, we were awarded 4 new wins across leading North American, Asian and European OEMs. We're also expanding our opportunity and increasing our ROI, winning multiple design wins in industrial areas -- in adjacent areas such as autonomous robotic systems.\nOur cloud infrastructure business is beginning to benefit from the power challenges and connectivity requirements necessary in AI ML systems. Notably, a large hyperscaler designed our high-performance power and protection solutions into their next-generation AI platform. And in connectivity, systems are upgrading now to [indiscernible] per second and require our highest level of precision control solutions to efficiently support the growth in data generation.\nIn consumer, we won multiple power management sockets in a portable application and a key customer. These wins truly show the combinatorial power of our acquisition strategy. We leveraged our industry-leading cell and switcher, Maxim's cost optimized process technology and our customer relationships to secure these wins. And lastly, in Healthcare, Maxim strengthened our comprehensive suite of technology for personal monitoring solutions, adding sensor AFEs, microcontrollers and ultra-low power technologies. We secured a design win at a leading continuous glucose monitoring customer this year. Our solution increases the robustness, accuracy and power efficiency of their glucose center, thereby helping to extend its life from days to weeks.\nSo in summary, we're proud of another year of record revenue and earnings. We continue to demonstrate the power of our business model, which delivers results through all phases of the business cycle. Our continued strong investments in technology and business innovation, customer engagement, and our hybrid manufacturing model positions ADI and our customers to take maximum advantage of the opportunities at the intelligent edge when the business recovery arrives.\nNow I'd like to pass the call over to Jim. Over the past 35 years, Jim has taken on a number of critical financial leadership roles across ADI, enabling him to develop a breadth and depth of understanding of our business that very, very few possess. So I'm pleased now to have him on my leadership team and to be joined by Jim on today's call. Over to you, Jim.\n\nJim Mollica\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you for that introduction, Vince, I'm excited to be here today, and let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Starting with a brief recap of fiscal 2023 results. Revenue increased 2% to $12.3 billion, marking ADI's third consecutive record year. Gross margin of 72.5% moderated from last year's record results of 73.6%.\nOperating margin of 48.9% decreased 50 basis points, roughly half the decline of gross margin, reflecting strong operating expense control. All told, EPS increased 5% to a record $10.09.\nNow moving to fourth quarter results. Revenue of $2.72 billion declined 12% sequentially and 16% year-over-year, finishing above the midpoint of our outlook despite the challenging operating environment. Industrial represented 50% of quarterly revenue, declining 19% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. As expected, we experienced broad-based weakness as inventory adjustments continued across our diverse customer base. For the full year, Industrial increased 6%, achieving its third straight record result with strength across instrumentation, test, energy and aerospace and defense.\nAutomotive, which represented 27% of quarterly revenue was down slightly sequentially and up 14% year-over-year, marking 12 straight quarters of double-digit growth. For the year, Automotive also achieved its third straight record result, increasing 19%, with strong growth across our functionally safe power, battery management and in cabin connectivity solutions. Collectively, these were up more than 30%.\nCommunications, which represented 13% of quarterly revenue declined 6% sequentially and 32% versus a record fourth quarter 2022. For the year, Communications decreased 13%, with steeper declines in wireless versus wireline.\nAnd lastly, Consumer represented 11% of quarterly revenue, down 6% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. Consumer decreased 20% in fiscal 2023, driven by industry-wide weaker demand and ongoing inventory corrections.\nNow on to the rest of the P&L. Fourth quarter gross margin was 70.2%, down sequentially and year-over-year driven by unfavorable product mix, lower factory utilizations and lower revenue. OpEx in the quarter was $692 million, down $60 million sequentially. These significant savings were driven by disciplined expense management and lower variable compensation. As a result, operating margin came in at the higher end of our outlook of 44.7%.\nNon-op expense finished at $65 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 12.5%. All told, EPS was $2.01, slightly above our outlook.\nNow on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a net leverage ratio of 0.9x. Inventory decreased nearly $70 million sequentially, driven by finished goods. Channel inventory also declined as we actively manage sell-in to be less than sell-through. Given lower revenue, inventory days increased to [ 188 ] and channel weeks ticked up slightly, ending within our target range of 7 to 8 weeks.\nNow moving on to our cash flow items. Operating cash for the quarter and the year was $1.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. CapEx for the quarter was $476 million and for fiscal 2023 was $1.3 billion. These CapEx numbers are gross figures, which do not include the benefits of the investment tax credits or grants related to both the U.S. and European Chips Act. Full year free cash flow was $3.6 billion or 29% of revenue. During the year, we returned 130% of free cash flow via roughly $3 billion in share repurchases and $1.7 billion in dividends.\nNow moving on to the guidance for the first quarter, which will be on a 14-week basis. First quarter revenue is expected to be $2.5 billion, plus or minus $100 million. Once again, we expect sell-through to be higher than sell-in. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to be down sequentially. Industrial is expected to be down the most, followed by Consumer and Comms with Automotive faring the best.\nOperating margin is expected to be 41.5%, plus or minus 70 basis points. Our tax rate is expected to be 11% to 13%, and based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.70 plus or minus $0.10.\nI will conclude my remarks with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As Vince mentioned, we continue to see broad-based weakness across markets and geographies as customers work to reduce inventory and a stressed macro backdrop. Importantly, our lead times are now back to normal levels with 95% of our products shipping within 13 weeks, given our customers high confidence and timely supply. Encouragingly, during the fourth quarter, we've seen cancellations fall and bookings stabilize. This gives us greater confidence that the ongoing inventory correction will taper through the first half of the fiscal year.\nAs we discussed last time, we've taken actions to preserve the integrity of our income statement, our balance sheet and our cash flow statements. Let me provide an update in these areas. We are once again lowering internal utilizations with a goal of significantly reducing inventory in the first half of the year. Our hybrid manufacturing model and ability to swing in external wafers will help us moderate the decline in factory starts. The unique ability positions us to deliver healthy gross margins despite the significant revenue decline from a year ago.\nGiven the enhancements made to our hybrid manufacturing model over the last 2 years, we now plan to slow the expansion of our internal fabs and back-end facilities. As a result, we expect 2024 CapEx to be between $600 million and $800 million or down about 45% versus 2023. Importantly, this CapEx reduction does not compromise our long-term growth or resiliency efforts that gives customers multiple locations to source ADI supply.\nAnd lastly, we took additional steps to structurally reduce our OpEx. These actions, combined with lower variable comp and seasonally lower spend in the first quarter will result in a slight decline in OpEx sequentially even with the extra week.\nSo in closing, our ability to generate operating margins in the low 40s, which were our previous highs in the last cycle demonstrates the durability of this franchise and how we've enhanced our operating model over time. And with that, I'll give it back to Mike for Q&A.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThanks, Jim. Welcome to the call. It's great to have you. Now let's get to the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourself to 1 question in order to allow for additional participants on the call this morning. [indiscernible] if time allows. With that, we will have our first question please."

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThank you, Michelle, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal '23 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.\nFor anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. -- on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release, and other periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC.\nActual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations only as the date of this call.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche. Vince?\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. ADI executed well in the third quarter. and delivered results within our expectations despite the challenging operating environment. Revenue was nearly $3.1 billion, led by growth in our industrial and automotive markets once again. Gross margin remained strong, above 72%, operating margin was nearly 48% and EPS was [ $2.49. ] This continued profitability reflects our portfolio's resilience as well as the innovation premium that it commands.\nI want to turn to the current business environment now just for a moment. As we shared last quarter, we believe we're in a period of customer inventory reconciliation following 3 consecutive years of steady growth. Through our customer conversations, it's evident these accelerating inventory adjustments relate to the weakening macro backdrop and ADI's rapidly improving lead times. Importantly, we believe we shipped below end market consumption in the third quarter and expect to do so again in the fourth. This will help normalize our customers' inventory more quickly and position us to return to growth more quickly in the coming quarters.\nStepping back, while near-term dynamics or turbulence, our long-term confidence remains undiminished. Over the last several decades, we have enhanced the resiliency of our global business, defined by our diversified customer and product portfolio and flexible hybrid manufacturing model. This enables us to ensure softer demand periods while sustaining strategic investments to ensure that we capitalize on the upside when the business inflects. It's these characteristics and our alignment to numerous concurrent secular growth trends that give us confidence that ADI will deliver on our long-term model of 7% to 10% revenue CAGR.\nNow one area underpinning this growth outlook are the applications tied to sustainable use cases, which currently represents about 1/3 of our total revenue. And today, I want to unpack a vital part of this, the evolving electrification ecosystem that is driving growth in our industrial and automotive markets. As the world marches to net 0, we need to eliminate 51 gigatons of global greenhouse gases emitted every year. Fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor accounting for more than 75% of all emissions. And at the same time, global energy consumption is forecasted to increase by 50% by 2050. And major unnecessary energy transition is underway and an upgraded and expanded energy grid is foundational to support a decarbonization pathway.\nMaking the shift through renewable energy sources in both commercial and residential infrastructure as well as electric vehicles and global transportation will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These moves also create new challenges in the generation distribution, consumption and smoothing of energy supply. ADI solutions are embedded across all phases of this electrification journey from upgrading the grid infrastructure to forming and managing the vehicle battery. The common thread woven through all these applications is the high-performance precision signal processing control and power management capabilities they require, capabilities in which ADI excels.\nNow today, I'll bring the story to life at the application level, starting with grid infrastructure. Overall, today's electrical grid is undergoing modernization to meet current and future demands. Historically, traditional energy sources like coal, oil and gas were centralized and distributed in one direction from the grid to the consumer. Today, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are more distributed necessitating a dynamic bidirectional flow of energy. To achieve this, the grid must be able to adjust performance across the network in real time, which requires an exponential increase in monitoring and storage capabilities. And for example, our collaboration with the Enel Group provides smart meters and grid digitalization solutions for distribution system operators. Here, ADI's control and sensing technologies are enabling high-performance, precision monitoring and data creation at the heart of the digital substation. And we're leveraging our mixed-signal digital and algorithm technologies to enable greater intelligence at the grid's edge.\nNow moving to energy storage systems, which are critical to mitigate intermittency issues across the network. ADI is a leader with our technologies used in 60% of energy storage systems across residential, commercial and grid scale networks. Leveraging our battery management system technology or BMS, we're increasing capacity and improving energy utilization in energy storage systems, which maximizes the battery's lifetime value. These monitoring and storage challenges extend to the grid's edge as well, including EV charging stations, ADI's energy metrology, isolation and sensing technologies, help enable a broader range of applications in AC and DC charging equipment.\nIn addition to these important applications in our highly diverse industrial segment, our high-performance signal processing platforms and domain expertise are helping to electrify the automotive market. Here, our technology is a key enabler in the transition from combustion engines to cleaner electric vehicles by increasing range and lowering cost. And I'll start with BMS.\nAs we've shared before, we are the leader in this area with our BMS solution designed into 16 of the top 20 EV manufacturers. We're currently sampling our eighth generation solution, which utilizes software and algorithms to enable physical measurement capabilities all the way into the battery cell. These advances in edge processing change the game in how the internal battery health is managed, supporting faster charging and better range prediction. An extension of this is our wireless BMS solution, a first in the industry. It has all the benefits of our wired solution and enables a scalable battery architecture, with quicker and more cost-effective production cycles.\nCurrently, our wireless BMS is designed in at 4 OEMs, and we expect another large OEM to adopt it in the coming quarters. Given this momentum and the cutting-edge value proposition, we believe the wireless platform will represent a large portion of our BMS revenue by the end of the decade. And looking ahead, we're broadening our EV capabilities beyond battery management and storage to power conversion solutions. Specifically, we're developing a silicon carbide-based smart switch for bidirectional onboard charging that significantly reduces charger size and weight by over 50%, thus driving down cost. Notably, this intelligent integrated switch enables the EV to transfer energy back into the network, creating a more reliable grid. And this innovation solution more than doubles our content opportunity per EV powertrain.\nSo in summary, ADI is driven by a deep sense of purpose and a desire for our innovations to positively impact all stakeholders. We're immensely proud of the role our technologies play to improve the well-being of humanity and indeed the planet, and I remain very confident in our future. Our portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, world-class talent base are aligned with an unprecedented number of attractive secular trends, where the semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx is increasing tremendously. This presents ADI with continued profitable growth opportunities as well as the ability to shape the future of industries.\nAnd so with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth.\n\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO\n\nThank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. While demand continued to soften throughout the quarter, ADI delivered nearly $3.1 billion revenue, in line with our guidance. This was driven by continued year-over-year growth for both industrial and automotive.\nLooking at our performance by end market. Industrial, which represented 53% of revenue, finished down 7% sequentially after a tremendous stretch of 13 straight quarters of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% with most applications up, led by sustainable energy as well as aerospace and defense, which each grew double digits. Automotive, which represented 24% of revenue, was down modestly sequentially in line with our expectations. Year-over-year growth of 15% was broad-based. We saw continued outsized growth for ADI's leading battery management and in-cabin connectivity solutions, which collectively increased nearly 30% year-over-year. Communications, which represented 12% of revenue, decreased double digits, both sequentially and year-over-year due to the broad-based inventory correction we flagged previously.\nAnd lastly, consumer, which represented 10% of revenue came in stronger than expected, finishing up 15% sequentially, but down 21% year-over-year. We remain optimistic that our second quarter marked the bottom for this business despite the ongoing inventory correction.\nAnd now on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin of 72.2% remains industry-leading, but declined sequentially due to lower utilization and product mix. Operating expenses of $752 million were roughly flat year-over-year and up sequentially. This quarter's OpEx reflects the full impact of annual merit increases. Operating margin of 47.8% contracted 230 basis points year-over-year, roughly in line with the gross margin decline. Non-op expenses were $57 million, and our tax rate was 11.2%. All told, EPS came in at $2.49 within our guidance range.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with over $1.1 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. Given the revenue pressures and our decision to hold more finished goods versus restocking the channel, inventory dollars increased and the days of inventory moved higher to [ $1.79.] As a result, channel inventory remains below our target level and slightly declined. Specifically, we strategically undershipped Asia, especially China, due to weaker demand trends. CapEx was $325 million for the quarter as we invest to enhance ADI's global resiliency and offer our customers options on where their products are sourced. 2023 should represent the high watermark for CapEx, and we expect it to decline in 2024.\nImportantly, our investments do not include the benefits of tax credit and grant funds that we anticipate from both the U.S. and the European Chips Act. Over the trailing 12 months, we've generated $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 29% of revenue. And over the same period, we've returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders or over 130% of free cash flow via more than $3.3 billion in buybacks and more than $1.6 billion in dividends.\nNow turning to the Q4 guidance. We expect the fourth quarter revenue to be $2.7 billion, plus or minus $100 million. This outlook assumes sell-in to be below sell-through. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect all markets to be down sequentially given the broad-based inventory correction. On a relative basis, auto and consumer should perform a bit better than industrial and comms. Operating margin is expected to be 44% plus or minus 70 basis points. This margin outlook embeds planned utilization reductions and a decline in OpEx. Our tax rate is expected to be between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2 plus or minus $0.10.\nAs our outlook is lower than expected, let me provide some context on what we're experiencing and how we will navigate. Our revenue outlook reflects the broad-based macro softness across all end markets, all geographies and customers both large and small. We are also strategically improving lead times to get a better view into demand and enhance customer satisfaction. Today, we're shipping over 85% of our products within 13 weeks, and this is up from 35% a year ago. As Vince mentioned, we are seeing customers accelerate inventory adjustments due to both the softer environment and our lead time improvements. And as such, we're taking measures to preserve the integrity of our balance sheet, cash flow and income statement. This includes further reducing utilization and lowering external wafer purchases with a goal to decrease inventory meaningfully in the coming quarters. And importantly, as we've outlined before, we expect gross margins will maintain a 70% level on a trailing 12-month basis. This gross margin resiliency is a testament to the flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model and our unique swing capacity capability.\nIn addition to the naturally lower variable comp, we're also taking steps to reduce total OpEx by roughly $50 million sequentially. So stepping back, we're not ready to call the bottom yet, but our history shows that we cycle up quickly. And when we do, we will achieve higher highs. ADI has built a very resilient business, rich with opportunities. Our diversification and exposure to numerous secular trends drives our durable earnings stream and solid free cash flow, enabling us to consistently return capital to shareholders. And to that end, over the trailing 12 months, we've returned $5 billion to shareholders or more than 5% of our market cap.\nAs this is my last ADI earnings call, I'd like to give a quick thank you to Vince for his mentorship and counsel over the past 6 years to the ADI Board, including our audit chair, Karen Gold, for their unwavering support and most importantly, to the world-class finance staff, including young Mike here for always reminding us of our commitments to you, the company's owners. I look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks as we get on the road. Mike, let's go to Q&A."

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThank you, Liz, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our Second Quarter Fiscal '23 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial statements and schedules at investor.analog.com after the disclosure. Information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as further described in our earnings release and other periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC.\nAs results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. And these statements reflect our expectations only as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements except as required by law. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to AID's CEO, Chair Vince.\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning to you all. Well, I'm very pleased to share that ADI continue to execute well in the second quarter. We delivered our 13th consecutive quarter of revenue growth and record earnings per share. Notably, revenue was $3.26 billion, growing 10% year-over-year. And once again, this was driven by record results in our industrial and automotive sectors. Gross margin was nearly 74%, and operating margin surpassed 51% and reflecting the innovation premium, our portfolio commands and our strong financial discipline and EPS increased an impressive 18% year-over-year.\nNow I'd like to spend a moment on the current business conditions. We previously shared that our business was at an inflection point due to uncertain economic and geopolitical backdrop. After 3 years of steady growth, customers are beginning to adjust their forecasts and rebalance their inventories. This is most pronounced in Asia, while North America and Europe demand is moderating but at a more measured pace. We expect this normalization of revenue will persist through the second half of 2023. Importantly, given our customer conversations and proactive decisions to improve lead times and rightsize our backlog, we're in a position to deliver on our goal of delivering a soft lending.\nStepping back, we've successfully navigated macro challenges many, many times before. Today, ADI has an even more durable franchise defined by an unmatched diversity of products, customers and applications a hybrid manufacturing model that better adapts to demand fluctuations and, of course, a fortified balance sheet. These characteristics instill a resiliency that helps ADI mitigate market weakness and invest through our economic cycles in critical areas that will define our future. Notably, unlike previous economic cycles, we have numerous concurrent secular growth drivers across all of our markets that drive more semi content per dollar of CapEx. And we have exposure to sectors that will transcend the macro uncertainty, including areas like digital health care, aerospace, defense and the electrification ecosystem.\nSo to that end, I want to highlight our digital health care business, which resides in our industrial end market. Health care is a market that is ripe for innovation and is one that requires the highest levels of performance. Now currently, the United States leads the world in health care spending with more than $4 trillion spent in 2022 alone. Approaching 20% of GDP. This amount has steadily increased over several decades and unfortunately, does not correlate to world-leading health outcomes. Both the U.S., along with most international health care systems are still reliant on serving the majority of patients with critical or chronic conditions in large centralized acute care hospitals, where specialized expertise and equipment reside. The pandemic highlighted the fragility of this system, underscoring the urgent need for remote physician consultation and distributed clinical-grade patient care. This vision of a decentralized system to improve the accessibility, affordability and efficacy of global health care can only be realized through the proliferation of edge-based diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.\nADI saw this promising opportunity early and made digital health care a strategic focus area over a decade ago. Over that time, our R&D investments have expanded our portfolio from core signal processing, sensing and power technologies to more highly integrated application-specific products. to now full system-level solutions. The results, our health care franchise has delivered 7 straight record revenue years, generating $900 million annually and we're on track to achieve a new high watermark in '23 despite the macro backdrop. Importantly, ADI has become an industry leader in 3 primary areas. The first is medical imaging, where our highly integrated products perform critical functions. This includes enhancing image quality, minimizing radiation dosage, improving system assembly and simplifying field maintenance.\nToday, we have strong share positions in areas like CT scanners, digital x-ray and ultrasound. Next is automation and instrumentation. For example, our broad portfolio enables us to create the optimized signal chains required in applications such as infusion pumps, ventilators and defibrillators. Third is personal health monitoring. Here, our highest performance products are used throughout the operating room and the ICU, while more compact versions with lower power are designed into wearable devices, performing both clinical and consumer wellness monitoring functions.\nNow let me share some of the examples of how we're seeing ADI solutions shape the future of health care. The ultrasound industry is migrating from large cart-based equipment to more compact mobile systems. Recently, ADI won the design as a market leader for their compact ultrasound system. Our solution leverages our complete portfolio, including high-speed signal chain and high-voltage power technologies, to deliver the highest quality images at the lowest power in a smaller footprint. We're also developing an echo to bit technology to untether the ultrasound modality from the hospital and enable hospital grade care and even the most remote locations. Our solution uses proprietary ultra-low power analog technology that performs both the data acquisition and beam forming functions at extremely low power levels with embedded software algorithms. This allows the user to get cart-based performance in a handheld form without compromising image quality, resolution or functionality.\nNow turning for a moment to robotic surgery. Currently, only about 15% of the world's surgical procedures use robotic technology despite the many benefits. These include greater precision, flexibility and control during surgery, and shorter hospital stays, fewer complications and lower levels of pain for patients. We're already designed in at the largest robotic surgical suppliers with our suite of precision motor control, signal processing, power management and sensing solutions. And with content per system in the thousands of dollars and performance demands increasing exponentially, this application is poised to deliver significant growth in the years ahead.\nIn the area of personal health monitoring, clinical grade vital signs monitors are converging with consumer wellness wearables. Now this is an emerging market for our comprehensive suite of technologies. Including our sensor [ AFEs ], microcontrollers and ultra low-power technologies, which has been strengthened by the integration of Maxim. For example, in diabetes management, ADI has long been a leading supplier of blood glucose monitoring technology. Now we're working with key customers in the next generation of continuous glucose monitoring. Our solution increases the level of robustness accuracy and power efficiency of the glucose sensor, thereby extending its life from days to weeks. And there is much, much more to come. We're extending our reach into innovative medical products that connect our hardware with cloud-based connectivity, analytics and service.\nI'm delighted to share with you that our first noninvasive chronic disease management device is undergoing marketing clearance with the FDA, and I look forward to sharing more as this new market has the potential to significantly expand our health care set. So big picture, we're shaping the digital revolution in health care. ADI's ability to go from component to system supplier underscores our deep domain expertise and unrelenting focus on innovation, setting us apart from the pack, not only in health care but in all of our markets. So while there's near-term uncertainty, we're excited about the long-term opportunities that lie ahead. The center of gravity for data processing is shifting from the cloud to the edge. And ADI where data is born, is at the center of this evolution, enabling the next waves of innovation for our customers.\nNow before I hand over to Prashanth, I want to address our announcement that he will be leaving ADI at the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize Prashanth for his many contributions and for his partnership over these past 6 years. He's played an important role during a period of extraordinary growth and value creation for ADI, including help build a robust finance function and fostering strong investor community engagement. Please know that Prashanth will be remaining in its full capacity and continuing to engage with all of you while we identify our next CFO through a search process that is now underway.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth.\n\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO\n\nThank you, Vince. It has been an honor to serve as the CFO of this phenomenal company and lead this world-class finance organization. As Vince mentioned, I'm fully committed to ensuring a smooth transition, and I look forward to engaging with all of you during the coming quarters. I do want to express my deep appreciation to Vince, both as a coach and a mentor but also for introducing me to this magical world of semiconductors. As my boss often says, we truly are the bedrock upon which the global technology industry is built.\nNow turning to our second quarter results. As usual, my comments today, with the exception of revenue will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We delivered another very strong quarter, record revenue of $3.26 billion exceeded the midpoint of guidance and represented ADI's 13th consecutive quarter of sequential growth. On a year-over-year basis, we grew 10%, led once again by all-time highs in industrial and automotive. Breaking it down by market, industrial, our most diverse and profitable business represented 53% of revenue and finished up 3% sequentially. Year-over-year growth of 16% was broad-based, notable gains in sustainable energy, aerospace and defense. These markets, in addition to health care, which Vince just highlighted, are much better positioned to withstand cyclical slowdown. And together, they represent roughly 40% of industrial revenue.\nAutomotive, which represented 24% of revenue, once again exhibited broad-based strength, growing 10% sequentially and 24% year-over-year. Secular tailwinds fueling content growth continue to drive ADI's leading battery management and in-cabin connectivity solutions, which combined, increased nearly 40% year-over-year. Communications, which represented 14% of revenue decreased both sequentially and year-over-year due to the ongoing inventory corrections across this end market. And lastly, consumer at 9% of revenue was down more than 20% sequentially and year-over-year. After several quarters of softness, consumer revenue is close to its COVID load, suggesting that the correction is nearly complete.\nMoving on to the P&L. Gross margin of 73.7% was up slightly sequentially due to favorable product mix, OpEx at $733 million was in line with last quarter and op margins of 51.2%, up roughly 100 basis points year-over-year, set a new record. Non-op expenses were $48 million and our tax rate was 11.4%. Remember that Q2 is typically our lowest rate. All told, EPS came in at $2.83, up an impressive 18% year-over-year.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio of 0.8. We've discussed many times our decision to hold more finished goods inventory versus restocking the channel. Thus, our days of inventory increased to 168 and channel inventory weeks were basically unchanged. As we outlined a quarter ago, we expect inventory dollars will decline in the second half as we balance the replenishment of die bank and moderate external purchases.\nMoving to cash flow. CapEx was $284 million in the quarter and $930 million over the trailing 12 months, representing 7% of revenue. As a reminder, we outlined at our Investor Day that we expect CapEx to be high single digits as a percentage of sales in 2023 and then decline in subsequent years to our longer-term target of mid-single digits. These investments will support our long-term growth plans and enable strategic swing capacity between our fabs and our foundry partners. The flexibility of our hybrid model across different geographies enhances our resiliency. It offers our customers additional optionality, and it provides an important financial shock absorber during times of volatility.\nOf note, our CapEx spend to date does not include the benefits of both the U.S. and the European tax credit and grant funds that we anticipate from both the U.S. and European chip sox. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $4 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. We've returned $5.1 billion to shareholders, $3.5 billion in buybacks and $1.6 billion via dividend. We remain committed to our shareholder-friendly policy of returning 100% of free cash flow over the long term.\nNow before moving to the outlook, I do want to provide some additional details on the evolving business conditions. As Vince shared in his remarks, customers are adjusting forecast and rebalancing inventory. At the same time, our lead times continue to improve, with over 70% of our portfolio now shipping in under 13 weeks. This gives customers high confidence into the timeliness of our supply. The result book-to-bill, as we outlined last quarter, remains below parity in all markets and our backlog due in the current quarter has returned to its typical coverage range. As a result, total backlog continues to decline, but at just under a year of revenue, it's still 2x regular levels. And lastly, after a strong start to the second quarter, demand quickly deteriorated in Asia, impacting channel sell-through. As a result, we plan to reduce channel inventory in this region. And in the third quarter, we are planning for sell-in to be below sell-through for the total company.\nGiven these dynamics, we are guiding third quarter revenue to be $3.1 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint of our outlook, we expect industrial and auto to be down low to mid-single digits sequentially, communications down around 10% sequentially, while consumer will increase sequentially. Op margin is expected to be 48.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. The decline in op margin relates to our annual merit increases, changing product mix and a reduction of manufacturing utilization given the softer environment. Our tax rate, again, between 11% and 13%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.52, plus or minus $0.10. While the near-term operating environment is a difficult one, our diversification and exposure to key secular trends is expected to help mitigate the revenue impact.\nIn addition, we have key levers to help us minimize margin volatility. This includes our flexible hybrid manufacturing model which allows us to quickly reduce spend on external wafers and moderate the impact on internal utilizations. Our variable compensation program, which has a true accordion-like function, allowing us to reduce spend while still investing in key long-term areas. As a result, we expect a durable earnings stream and solid free cash flow generation. Enabling us to take advantage of any share price dislocations.\nBefore handing off to Mike, I want to remind folks that in June, we will be doing a deep dive on the burgeoning opportunity for ADI in the construction of Gigafactories. And with that, let me pass it to Mike for Q&A.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nAnalyst, Evercore Partners (Securities)\n\nThanks, Prashanth. I want to echo Vince's comments to thank you for the partnership over the past 6 years, but I will warn you is not done yet. We have called more earnings calls together. So with that, let's get to the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] With that, we have our first question, please."

I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nVP, IR and FP&A, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gigi, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our first quarter fiscal '23 conference call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. Anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com. On to the disclosures.

Vince?\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nCEO & Chair of the Board of Directors, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Well, I'm very pleased to share that ADI continued to execute exceptionally well in the first quarter of fiscal '23 despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty. Revenue was $3.25 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Strength was broad-based with all B2B markets up [double digits] (corrected by company after the call). Gross and operating margins were 74% and 51% respectively, and adjusted EPS achieved another record at $2.75. Our continued success is driven by a relentless focus on customer collaboration, a growing demand for our innovative technologies and strong operational execution. We play a long game and are excited about what the future holds for us. To ensure that we capture the opportunity ahead, we've been steadily increasing investments in R&D, manufacturing capabilities and in partnerships that deepen our value to our customers now and over the long term. For example, in R&D, we've invested $1.7 billion over the trailing 12 months to strengthen our core franchises and capture market opportunities presented by secular growth drivers.\nOver this same period, we've invested $750 million in CapEx to enhance the resiliency of our internal semiconductor manufacturing operations. These investments not only increase our operational resiliency, but also modernize our fabs to better address our sustainability ambitions.\nAs mentioned in our press release, our industrial and automotive businesses remain strong as we gain market share. So this morning, I want to focus specifically on our industrial business, which continues to grow significantly despite the macroeconomic backdrop. Now from a big picture perspective, the industrial market is the bedrock of ADI, representing more than half of our total revenue. It's also our most diverse and profitable business segment with tens of thousands of customers and products that sustain revenue streams for decades. Additionally, ADI's industrial revenue is derived from high-performance technology in mission-critical CapEx-intensive equipment across the myriad applications.\nOur leadership position has been strengthened over the last decade as we intensified our focus in this market and invested over $5 billion in R&D activities to capture the opportunity across the hundreds of applications that characterize the industrial sector. This space is inherently fragmented and the unmatched breadth and depth of ADI's portfolio uniquely allows us to address our customers' needs across the full spectrum of applications with core component building blocks to application-specific solutions that encompass analog, digital and algorithms.\nToday, we're seeing the rise of new industrial applications that require more sophisticated and more complex architectures as machines become more intelligent and more sustainable. This is driving more semiconductor content per dollar of CapEx, unlocking new opportunities for our portfolio. While this transformation is benefiting all of our industrial applications, including healthcare and aerospace, let me share how we're winning in industrial automation and instrumentation more specifically, and discuss the burgeoning opportunity across the electrification ecosystem.\nSo starting first with Industrial Automation. Here, our customers are upgrading their factories with more automation and connectivity to increase output with greater energy efficiency. ADI's broad portfolio helps customers create these more resilient and flexible footprints while lowering their carbon emissions on the journey to net zero. As an example, at a leading U.S. robotics manufacturer, we've won additional content across power, sensing and GMSL connectivity. Our systems approach reduced our customers' design time and increased our content per cobot by 4x.\nAlso in the last quarter, our IO-Link solution was designed in at multiple leading industrial automation customers. These solutions are critical for delivering robust connectivity to the edge of the factory floor.\nTurning our attention now to our instrumentation and test business. This subsector is highly aligned to secular growth trends from connectivity to AI-assisted compute to electrification, to drug discovery and gene therapies. The consistent thread across this diverse set of applications is the growing complexity that requires more advanced metrology and test. The results, our average content per system is now 2 to 3x higher. Further, the localization of semiconductor supply is providing additional tailwinds for our test business. We've secured multiple design wins in North America as well as Asia for memory and high-performance compute.\nAnd finally, on to one of our fastest-growing areas, the electrification ecosystem. The collective need for a more sustainable future is driving massive growth in electrical grid infrastructure.\nNow let me share 2 examples with you. First, industrial and automotive companies have announced more than $300 billion of investments in greenfield gigafactories, essential to the production of batteries to proliferate the electrification ecosystem. These Gigafactories will drive additional demand for our formation and test solutions critical to producing higher density batteries. Further, given the inherent safety hazards of using higher cell voltages, these factories will also provide new growth vectors for ADI. In our sustainable energy franchise, we're leveraging our industry-leading automotive BMS solutions into energy storage systems for electrical grids and fast-charging infrastructure. We've won designs at leading EV infrastructure manufacturers in North America, Europe and Asia, putting us on a path to more than tripling this business in the coming years.\nOf course, while no market is fully immune to adverse economic cycles, our industrial business is highly diversified and aligned with secular trends. This has translated to more durable revenue streams with sales in this sector increasing more than 25% over the trailing 12 months despite a weakening economic backdrop. But looking ahead, we see continued strength in this franchise as the breadth and depth of our portfolio, our deep customer collaborations and design win pipeline momentum underpin our new phase of profitable growth.\nSo in closing, ADI's business model is diverse, resilient and rich with opportunity. I'm very optimistic about what our future holds as we drive enhanced value for our customers, employees and shareholders, as well as society at large. And so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth.\n\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call.\nMy comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. First quarter revenue of $3.25 billion finished at the high end of our outlook, driven by continued share gains in industrial and automotive.\nOur B2B markets represented 89% of revenue, up 25% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially despite our first quarter typically being down.\nNow let's look at performance by end market. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market represented 52% of revenue and hit another all-time high. This business has grown sequentially for 12 consecutive quarters. All markets increased year-over-year, led by automation, sustainable energy, instrumentation and test. Automotive, which represented 22% of revenue, also achieved another record, increasing 29% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. All applications grew double digits year-over-year as our market-leading positions across battery management and in-cabin connectivity continued to deliver significant growth.\nCommunications, which represented 15% of revenue, grew 18% year-over-year. As expected, comps declined slightly sequentially as strength in wired was offset by softness in wireless due to the timing of 5G deployments. And lastly, consumer, which represented 11% of revenue was down 5% year-over-year and declined 14% sequentially given weaker market trends and seasonality.\nNow on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin of 73.6% expanded 170 basis points year-over-year on favorable mix and cost synergies. OpEx was $733 million, down slightly sequentially as we balance strategic hiring with the tight discretionary spend and synergy capture. Given our strong operating leverage, combined with the synergy savings, our operating margin was 51.1%. Importantly, we have already captured nearly all of the $400 million cost synergy goal. As such, our communication will now turn to the revenue synergy opportunities from our combined portfolio and our complementary customer base with Maxim.\nRecall that Anelise, our Chief Customer Officer, unveiled how we are strategically approaching these synergies during our Investor Day, and Vince has routinely highlighted some of these compelling opportunities over the past few quarters. To that end, we are closely monitoring and measuring progress from opportunity to design win, to new revenue. And while it is still early, design win momentum to date has exceeded our expectations. This gives us increased confidence in achieving our $1 billion-plus revenue synergy opportunity that we outlined at our Investor Day.\nNon-op expenses were $60 million and the tax rate was just over 12%. All told, EPS came in at $2.75, up 42% year-over-year and hitting a new record.\nMoving to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and a net leverage ratio below 1. Days of inventory increased to 155 while channel inventory remains below our target level. Recall that last quarter, we outlined our strategy to rebuild strategic die bank and hold more finished goods inventory on our balance sheet as we moderate shipment into the channel during this time of inflection.\nMoving on to cash flow. CapEx for the quarter was $176 million and $764 million over the trailing 12 months, representing 6% of revenue. We continue to expect CapEx to be high single digits as a percentage of sales in 2023 and then decline in subsequent years to our long-term target of mid-single digit. These investments will double our internal revenue output exiting next year and support strategic swing capacity between our fabs and our foundry partners. The flexibility of our hybrid model across different geographies enhances our resiliency and offers our customers additional optionality.\nOver the trailing 12 months, we generated $4.3 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Over this period, we have returned $4.7 billion to shareholders or over 100% of free cash flow via $3.1 billion of buybacks and dividends of $1.6 billion. We just raised our quarterly dividend by 13%, marking our fifth consecutive double-digit increase and 19 consecutive years of increases. This is a testament to our durable operating model that has generated positive free cash flow for 26 consecutive years. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. The dividend is the cornerstone of this policy, and we look to increase our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle, with remaining cash used for share count reduction.\nNow similar to prior quarters, I'd like to give a brief update on the operating backdrop. First, on markets. Industrial orders, as Vince highlighted, remained the strongest followed by automotive, while comms and consumer remain weak. Given the rapidly changing environment, we are diligently working with our customers to remove orders that they may no longer require.\nAt the same time, we have increased our supply by growing our internal output and working with our foundry partners. These actions have reduced our lead times with half of our portfolio now shipping in under 13 weeks. Despite this, backlog coverage remains around 1 year of revenue. As such, we expect our book-to-bill will remain below parity over the next couple of quarters as our backlog returns to more normal levels. Given these dynamics, we are guiding second quarter revenue to be $3.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million. We expect continued sequential growth in our industrial and automotive markets and another sequential decline in our communications and consumer markets. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high single digits year-over-year with our B2B markets up over 10% once again. Operating margin is expected to be 51% plus or minus 70 basis points.\nOur tax rate is now expected to be between 11% to 13% for the year. This guide reflects the new U.S. tax requirement to capitalize R&D expenses for tax purposes, resulting in higher upfront cash tax payments, but lowers our effective tax rate temporarily due to the deferred tax accounting requirements.\nBased on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.75 plus or minus $0.10. In all, the macro backdrop remains uncertain. However, we remain cautiously optimistic in the near term given the resilient strength across our industrial and auto businesses, which represent over 75% of our revenue.\nLonger term, we remain well-positioned to drive growth, enabled by our diverse, high-performance portfolio aligned with the key secular trends at the Intelligent edge.\nLet me now pass it back to Mike for our Q&A.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nVP, IR and FP&A, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks, Prashanth. We'll begin the Q&A session. We ask that you limit yourselves to 1 question in order allow for additional participants in the call this morning. If you have a follow-up question, please re-queue, I'll take your question if time allows. With that, we have our first question, please."

Well, I'm really extremely pleased to share that we delivered another record quarter, capping off what was a banner year for ADI. Our fourth quarter revenue was $3.25 billion and adjusted EPS was $2.73, and both at the high end of our outlook.\nFor the fiscal year, revenue was $12 billion, up an impressive 26% year-over-year on a combined basis. Our Industrial, Automotive and Communications markets delivered all-time high revenues, and our consumer business continued to grow despite industry-wide weakness. Adjusted EPS increased by nearly 50% to $9.57.\nWe also delivered on our commitment to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in '22, returning $4.6 billion through share repurchases and dividends. These results not only exemplify the strength of our portfolio but also our deep customer focus and the hard work of our employees to fortify ADI's brand. To that end, in my recent conversations with customers, the message has been very clear.\nWhile we're not immune to supply disruptions, ADI's service, quality and support throughout this challenging time continues to be outstanding. Importantly, this sentiment is shared by customers of all sizes and across all markets. As a result, our customers are calling upon ADI to engage in longer term, more strategic collaborations to develop solutions that further empower the intelligent edge.\nSo to ensure we remain at the forefront of technological advancements and customer service, we invested $1.7 billion in R&D and $700 million in CapEx in FY'22. Now let me start with R&D. Our investments are targeted at strengthening our foundational high-performance analog franchises as well as moving up the stack to create more complete solutions for our customers. A prime example is our Apollo platform, which we previewed at our Investor Day in April.\nApollo is a flexible high-speed signal processing platform with unmatched levels of functionality, integration and performance, making it ubiquitous for all customers, but especially appealing to those in the broad market. During the quarter, we began sampling this innovative platform with our aerospace, communications and instrumentation customers, and their feedback has been extremely positive.\nTurning now to the operations side. Over the last year, we invested a record amount of CapEx to increase our manufacturing output. And in 2023, we are, once again, investing aggressively in our U.S. and European factories to significantly expand our capacity. These investments will create a more flexible and cost-effective hybrid manufacturing model by increasing our swing capacity to around 70% of revenue in the coming years.\nOur R&D and supply chain investments are essential to support our design win pipeline, which expanded by more than 10% in '22. This growth was led by our automotive energy systems and digital health care businesses. Notably, our growth in automotive was underpinned by battery management systems, or BMS, which now has an opportunity pipeline nearing $4 billion. This year, 8 new manufacturers designed in our BMS solutions, including two that plan to utilize our wireless platform. Our strong leadership position, combined with increasing EV penetration globally gives me great confidence in our future growth prospects.\nLooking now at some selected design activity in the quarter. In Industrial Automation, we were designed into an advanced diagnostic system that measures machine health at a global supplier for energy exploration. Our system solution approach enables an approximate 50% reduction in size and lowers wiring costs meaningfully. In aerospace and defense, we won RF module programs at multiple defense prime contractors. Our modules integrate hundreds of components to simplify the design process for our customers while increasing our content from hundreds to thousands of dollars per system.\nIn Industrial Instrumentation, we secured wins at two market leaders of next-generation high-voltage testers for electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. The combination of our high-voltage processes and precision technology enables us to deliver accurate, reliable and efficient testing required to scale the manufacturing of these systems.\nAnd lastly, in communications, we expanded our leadership in 5G radio systems with our transceiver portfolio, winning additional share at key suppliers. These new wins position us even better as 5G networks roll out globally, especially in India, and O-RAN begins to proliferate. Importantly, our design pipeline is beginning to benefit from cross-selling our ADI and Maxim portfolios. This puts us on a path to achieve our target $1 billion in revenue synergies.\nFor example, at an European auto manufacturer, we built upon our strong audio connectivity position to cross-sell our high-speed GMSL technology, connecting their advanced driver systems. We're also capturing new opportunities with GMSL in the industrial market. Last quarter, for example, our technology was designed into autonomous order fulfillment systems at one of the largest e-commerce companies. We're also making great inroads with our broader power portfolio, where our opportunity pipeline increased by double digits last year.\nOur increased breadth is helping us to better match customers' performance and power trade-offs across more applications, expanding our power SAM to nearly $10 billion. For example, at a leading European industrial customer, our position in mid-voltage power for distributed I/O control systems enabled us to pull through additional power content and precision signal chain sockets, thereby, doubling our content per system.\nOur expanding pipeline and significant revenue synergy opportunities instills greater diversity and resilience into our business while adding new growth vectors. And taken together, I'm confident in our ability to bend the growth curve and move from our historical mid-single-digit growth rate to our long-term model of 7% to 10%.\nSo in summary, while the macro crosscurrents are creating an abundance of uncertainty, ADI has successfully navigated many slowdowns over the course of our 57-year history. The strength of our franchise allows us to invest through business cycles, ensuring we continue to deliver breakthrough innovation, deepen our relevance to our customers and capture the emerging secular opportunities at the intelligent edge.\nAnd so with that, I'll pass you over to Prashanth.\n\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We closed fiscal 2022 as our second consecutive year of record revenue and profits. We delivered sequential growth each quarter, achieving a new all-time high of $12 billion in revenue, gross margins of 73.6% increased 270 basis points due to favorable product mix, stronger utilization and cost synergies. Operating margin of 49.4% increased 700 basis points, reflecting strong execution on OpEx synergies, and adjusted EPS increased nearly 50% to $9.57.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenue was $3.25 billion, finishing at the high end of our outlook. As I cover the performance by end market, both for the quarter and full year, my growth comments are on an adjusted combined basis where applicable. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, hit another all-time high and represented 51% of quarterly revenue. Growth was broad-based with each major application increasing sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, Industrial expanded 29% with growth in each business. Notably, digital health care was up over 30% and has now achieved seven straight record years. This consistent success in health care underscores the breadth of our ICs and subsystem solutions in a key secular growth market where such performance is critical.\nAutomotive, which represented 21% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record year, growing both sequentially and year-over-year. For the year, auto was up 31%, a favorable mix of premium vehicles, our growing BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power franchises, combined with enhanced value capture, drove significant growth compared to SAAR. Together, these franchises of BMS, GMSL, A2B and functional safe power represent over $1 billion of automotive revenue.\nCommunications, which represented 15% of quarterly revenue, achieved another record quarter with strong sequential growth in wireline, while our wireless business was about flat. For the year, comms grew 27%. In wireless, our strong position in radio signal chains is enabling the 5G rollout globally. And in wireline, our optical and power portfolios benefited from the continued demand for bandwidth.\nLastly, consumer represented 13% of quarterly revenue and was up modestly sequentially and flat year-over-year. Despite a challenging year for the broader industry, consumer finished up 8%. This growth is a testament to how we have diversified our consumer business and the innovation premium our products command. Today, approximately 30% of revenue is derived from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-gen conferencing systems, professional AV and home theater, while the remaining revenue in consumer relates to the faster-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones.\nNow I'll move down the P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin was 74%, up 310 basis points year-over-year, driven by favorable product mix and synergy capture. OpEx was $744 million, down slightly sequentially due to the realization of additional synergies. And operating margin increased 800 basis points year-over-year, finishing at a record 51.1% as we exited the year with roughly $350 million of synergies realized across OpEx and cost of goods in our run rate. This incredible pace of synergy capture would not have been possible without the dedication of our integration office and the cross-functional teams that supported them. Non-Op expenses were $57 million, and the tax rate was 12.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at $2.73, up 58% year-over-year.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents and our net leverage ratio continues to remain below 1. Days of inventory increased to 140 while channel inventory was once again below our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. Let me provide some additional details on our inventory. But first, during these uncertain times, we believe it is prudent to temporarily hold more finished goods on our balance sheet instead of shipping into the channel. This provides us with enhanced flexibility to better align supply with end customer demand across regions and markets.\nSecond, raw material and WIP are increasing as we begin to rebuild our die bank. Over the last couple of years, our die bank was drastically reduced, and in some cases, fits 50% below optimal levels. Die bank inventory is highly cost efficient and it's critical for customer service as it can be used for different markets and customers. We believe higher inventory is crucial to reducing lead times as we look to return to our 4- to 8-week target service level over time. Given these actions, we expect inventory to increase in the near term before trending back down as we balance die bank rebuild with finished goods depletion.\nMoving to cash flow items. CapEx was $305 million for the quarter and $699 million for the year or 6% of revenue. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we expect elevated CapEx through 2023 at around high single digits as a percentage of revenue. For fiscal 2022, we generated $3.8 billion of free cash flow or 31% of revenue. This is lower than normal given our higher capital intensity and onetime transaction and restructuring costs. These near-term headwinds were not unexpected when we outlined our long-term free cash flow target at our Investor Day, and we remain committed to growing free cash flow to 40% of revenue.\nAs a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to grow our dividend at a 10% CAGR through the cycle with the remaining cash used for share count reduction. And during the year, we returned more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. We repurchased $3.1 billion in shares, reducing share count by nearly 4%, while paying $1.5 billion of dividends.\nSo let me close with a brief update on the current operating backdrop. As we noted last quarter, the uncertain and slowing macroeconomic environment has had some impact on demand. However, after a couple of months of slowing orders, we saw bookings stabilize during the quarter at what we'd consider relatively normal levels for entering our first quarter. Not surprisingly, bookings remain the strongest in the industrial and auto, while communications and consumer are weaker. We're guiding first quarter revenue to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million.\nGiven this environment, we thought it might be helpful to be a little more prescriptive in our outlook by market. So in the first quarter, we expect auto to be up slightly sequentially; industrial about flat; comps to decline by mid-single digits; and consumer to be down double digits sequentially. At the midpoint of our outlook, revenue will be up high teens year-over-year and our B2B markets increasing over 20%. Op margins are expected to be 50%, plus or minus 70 bps. Tax rate is expected to be between 12% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be $2.60, plus or minus $0.10.\nSo stepping back, we are well positioned in the near term, but the environment remains highly variable and dynamic. ADI, like the rest of the industry, is not immune to a softer macro environment, and thus, we remain cautious, yet optimistic. Longer term, we have over a year of backlog and continued momentum in our pipeline. We also have high flexibility with our hybrid manufacturing model and several OpEx levers in our toolkit to support our industry-leading margins and maintain robust cash returns to shareholders.\nSo let me now pass it back to Mike for the Q&A.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nVP, IR and FP&A, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks, Prashanth. Now let's get to my favorite part of the call, a Q&A session.\n(Operator Instructions) With that, will we have our first question, please?"

I'd like now to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Michael Lucarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and FP&A. Sir, the floor is yours.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nVP, IR and FP&A, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining our third quarter fiscal 2022 call. With me on the call today are ADI's CEO and Chair, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. For anyone who missed the release, you can find it and relating financial schedules at investor.analog.com.\nNow on to the disclosures. The information we're about to discuss includes forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as further described in our earnings release and our periodic reports and other materials filed with the SEC. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking information as these statements reflect our expectations as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to update these statements, except as required by law.\nOur comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude special items. When comparing our results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from prior periods. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today's earnings release. Please note, we've also published our annual ESG report last quarter titled Future Forward. You can find it on the IR web page. And with that, I'll turn the call over to ADI's CEO and Chair, Vince. Vince?\n\nVincent T. Roche\n\nCEO & Chair of the Board of Directors, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning to you, all. Well, I'm pleased to share that we executed very well amidst a dynamic macro backdrop. We delivered another quarter of record results, driven by continued operational excellence, strong financial discipline and resilient demand for our diverse portfolio of innovation-rich products. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up 24% year-over-year on a combined basis and above the midpoint of our outlook. Strength was broad-based with double-digit growth in every end market.\nOur third quarter profitability reflects ADI's innovation premium and strong operating leverage with gross and operating margins of 74% and 50%, respectively. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.52 finished at the high end of our outlook, marking another new high. I'm exceptionally pleased with our results, and I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to our success, and importantly, to the success of our customers.\nAt ADI, innovation is ingrained in our culture, fueled by an unwavering commitment to robust R&D investments. Over the last 12 months, we've invested over $1.7 billion in R&D. A key facet to our innovation-driven success is our dedication to extensive and deep customer engagements, which enables us to collaborate with them in solving their toughest problems.\nNow I'd like to share some recent customer highlights. In Automotive, we reinforced our market-leading position in BMS with wins at 2 premium European auto manufacturers. One of these wins was with our wireless BMS solution. This marks the fourth OEM to adopt wireless BMS as customer interest continues to build for this unique technology. In sustainable energy, we announced a design win with Enel Group on the quantum edge device used to digitally monitor electric grids. ADI's unmatched precision measurement capabilities are critical to creating a more resilient and flexible grid to help advance efficient electrification globally.\nIn health care, the recently released wireless hospital monitoring system by GE Healthcare in Europe uses ADI solutions across signal chain, power, RF MCUs and sensors. This wearable system enables wireless continuous monitoring to detect patient deterioration earlier, helping to improve outcomes.\nToday, I'd like to profile our $1.5 billion-plus consumer franchise, a business that plays an important role in our long-term profitable growth strategy. Given the recent negative data points surrounding the consumer end market, one may wonder why highlight this market now. But that's just the reason our consumer business is built differently. In the third quarter, we posted our seventh consecutive growth quarter. And while we are not immune to macro slowdown, we have aligned this business to the high end of the market where performance really matters and into applications where our differentiation is truly valued.\nThe composition of our consumer franchise is indeed unique. Approximately 30% of our revenue comes from long life cycle prosumer applications, including next-generation conferencing systems, professional audio/video and home theater. The remaining revenue in consumer relates to portables, including fast-growing wearables and hearables as well as premium smartphones.\nTaking a step back, over the last 5 years-plus, we have reconfigured our consumer business to increase diversity across customers, products and applications to better drive growth and limit volatility while enhancing profitability. The addition of Maxim further enhances our diversity and expanded our portfolio. Over this time, we've increased our product SKUs to just over 10,000 and expanded our customer count to more than 3,000. Importantly, the composition of this business is quite similar to our B2B markets, with no single product contributing more than a couple of percentage points to total ADI sales.\nThe velocity of innovation in the consumer market is appealing. It allows us to accelerate technology development and commercialize solutions quickly at scale. Over time, we take these breakthrough solutions into other markets to create new waves of growth and drive strong profitability and cash flow. For example, we have leveraged our consumer audio expertise into the automotive market. This capability was demonstrated at our Investor Day where we showcased an electric vehicle with Dolby Atmos that uses our SHARC DSP and software that was first proven in the consumer business.\nAdditionally, we've also leveraged R&D investments from our core franchises into the consumer market. To that end, our high-precision converters and industrial instrumentation, for example, have been repurposed to solve similar challenges for stabilization in smartphone compass and pressure sensing in wearables. Not only have we created a highly diverse and profitable business but also one that is aimed at key growth drivers that position us to grow at a high single-digit rate over the long-term.\nFor example, our prosumer growth has been revitalized as companies implement future of work plans that encompass more immersive enterprise video conferencing. Here, the breadth of our portfolio across DSP, analog, mixed-signal and power management enables us to solve the entire customer challenge from high-bandwidth connectivity to video resolution and sound quality.\nAnd turning now a moment to the portables market. In hearables, we shift into the majority of premium wireless stereo earbuds. Our newest offerings include software-augmented hearing algorithms and optimized power that reduces size and improves audio fidelity while increasing our value per system by over 3x. In wearables, we're a leader in personal wellness products with our sensing solutions designed into over 50% of products today. There is a convergence of these personal wellness products and clinical-grade vital signs monitoring solutions that could unlock new opportunities for ADI. And in premium smartphones, we're expanding our share and content at key customers, which is providing us additional diversification and stimulating new growth vectors.\nAn emerging opportunity is the Metaverse. ADI's breadth of hardware, software algorithms and domain expertise gives us an ability to provide complete sub-system solutions. While we're still in the early days, of course, momentum is building, and we have design wins in multiple next-generation AR/VR headsets. Across all these consumer applications, power management is becoming ever more critical. Customers are adding more features into smaller spaces, while consumers are demanding longer battery life. Maxim doubled the size of our low-power portfolio and increased our consumer power SAM by over $1 billion. We're already beginning to see the cross-sell benefits of our complementary customer bases and synergistic portfolios with wins in both wearables and conferencing systems.\nSo in summary, I'm very encouraged with the strides we've taken to reignite growth in our consumer business, and with a record opportunity pipeline and significant synergy potential, I believe we're in a position to deliver consistent growth over the long-term.\nNow before passing over to Prashanth, I'd like to make some comments on the current business environment. Obviously, the macro backdrop is dynamic and it's clear that we're at an inflection point. Economic conditions are beginning to impact demand with orders showing -- orders slowing later in the quarter and cancellations increasing slightly. Prashanth will provide additional details on these dynamics in his remarks.\nADI successfully navigated macro challenges many, many times before in our 57-year history. We've created a premier analog franchise with an unmatched diversity of products, customers and applications. And we've invested in a hybrid manufacturing model that better adapts to demand fluctuations. These characteristics instill a resiliency into our business to mitigate market weaknesses, sustain profitability and enable investment in our business through economic cycles to focus on playing our long game. And with that, I'll hand it over to Prashanth.\n\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. My comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. Third quarter revenue of $3.1 billion finished above the midpoint of our outlook and marked our sixth consecutive quarterly record. If we look at third quarter end market performance, industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, hit another all-time high and represented 50% of growth -- excuse me, 50% of revenue.\nGrowth was broad-based with each of our major applications increasing sequentially. Industrial revenue has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 7 straight quarters, underscoring ADI's strong position and secular content growth across applications. Automotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, increasing 28% year-over-year. The better mix of higher-content premium vehicles, combined with our growth engines of BMS, GMSL, A2B and better value capture is driving our outsized growth versus SAAR.\nCommunications, which represented 16% of revenue, achieved a quarterly record, with strong year-over-year growth in both wireless and wireline. Sequentially, wireline outpaced wireless with growing demand for our optical and power portfolios as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for data. And lastly, Consumer represented 13% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 7 consecutive quarters. As Vince highlighted, the diversity and growing design momentum across portables and prosumer is enabling us to grow despite the consumer market slowdown.\nNow on to the rest of the P&L. Gross margin was 74.1%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher utilization, favorable mix and synergy capture. OpEx in the quarter was $747 million, which reflects a full quarter of higher-than-normal merit increases. Operating margin increased 650 basis points year-over-year, finishing at 50.1% toward the high end of our outlook. Non-Op was $48 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, EPS came in at a record $2.52, up 47% versus the third quarter of 2021.\nOn the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with over $1.5 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased to 129, while channel inventory remains below the low end of our target range of 7 to 8 weeks. For cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $165 million and $526 million over the trailing 12 months, just under 5% of revenue. We continue to expect elevated CapEx investments through 2023 to support the strategic expansion of our hybrid manufacturing model. And these investments will strengthen our resiliency and support our long-term growth outlook of 7% to 10% CAGR.\nOver the trailing 12 months, we generated over $3.7 billion of free cash flow or 34% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime deal-related costs which amount to about 3% of revenue. With the intra-quarter volatility, we opportunistically increased repo activity to $906 million. And after approximately 1 year post the close of Maxim, we've repurchased $4.4 billion worth of shares, putting us on track to exceed our $5 billion commitment by the end of fiscal '22.\nIncluding dividend payments, we've returned approximately $6 billion to shareholders over the last 12 months or more than 6% of our market cap. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We target to allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR through the cycle, with the remaining cash used for share count reduction.\nNow before we move to the outlook, I want to provide some additional details around demand. In third quarter, our order book remained strong and backlog increased to a new record, stretching well into mid-2023. However, orders moderated later in the quarter, and as a result, book-to-bill was down from a quarter ago but still well above 1. By market, we are seeing strength persist in both Industrial and Automotive, which together represent over 2/3 of our sales, while Consumer and comms were a bit softer. We also saw a modest increase in cancellations and was not specific to any end market or geography.\nGiven these dynamics, coupled with the macro backdrop, we believe it's prudent to take a more cautious stance. As such, we are only forecasting slight sequential revenue growth to $3.15 billion, plus or minus $100 million, despite bookings, backlog and higher supply that would all suggest stronger growth. At the midpoint, we expect all end markets to grow quarter-over-quarter. Op margin is expected to be 50.3%, plus or minus 70 bps. Our tax rate is expected to be 13% to 14%. And based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.57, plus or minus $0.10.\nMore broadly, while the macro backdrop is dynamic, our business has several aspects that position us quite well to manage further headwinds. These include our diverse end market exposure, coupled with strong secular drivers that will help buffer our top line. The flexibility of our hybrid manufacturing model gives us confidence in maintaining our 70% gross margin floor. And we also have several OpEx layers to support our industry-leading margins and maintain a solid return of cash to our investors. So in closing, my confidence to our path of $15 of EPS in the next 5 years remains high. Let me now give it back to Mike for the Q&A.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nVP, IR and FP&A, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks, Prashanth. Let's get to the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) With that, can we have our first question, please, Matt?"

Roche\n\nCEO & Chair of the Board of Directors, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and a very good morning to you all. Well, I'm very pleased to report that ADI delivered another quarter of record revenue, profitability and earnings, driven by continued insatiable demand for our products, strong operational execution and accelerated synergy capture. Moreover, amidst a dynamic macro environment, we're operating from a position of remarkable strength, supported by our record backlog, robust bookings and ongoing capacity expansions, which position us favorably as we enter the second half.\nNow moving to a summary of our results. Revenue was $2.97 billion, above the high end of our outlook and up 28% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Strength was broad-based with all segments up double digits year-over-year. Impressively, adjusted gross margin expanded to 74% and operating margin to 50%. Adjusted EPS was $2.40, exceeding the high end of outlook and increasing over 50% from the year ago period.\nOverall, I'm very excited with our performance and our team's outstanding execution. Today, I'd like to reinforce what we shared at our Investor Day around how our markets are evolving and how we're investing to solve more of our customers' problems while also improving on our business model that's both rich with growth opportunities and, indeed, resiliency.\nThe next wave in the evolution of the ICT sector is the nascent intelligent edge revolution. It will be characterized by ubiquitous sensing, hyperscale computing and pervasive connectivity, pushing processing and intelligence closer to the edge. Semiconductors are the bedrock enabling this next wave. And ADI, where data is born, is at the center of this revolution.\nAt our core, we're an innovation-driven enterprise. Over the last decade, through both robust organic investments and strategic M&A, we've built the industry's broadest and highest performance analog, mixed signal and power portfolio. Our offerings span from microwave to bits, nanowatts to kilowatts, sensor to cloud and increasingly, from components to subsystems. Our vast arsenal of technologies, along with the deep level of engagement and support we provide our customers, has earned us the #1 positions in analog, mixed signal, RF and high-performance power.\nThis, coupled with our focus on customer success, awards ADI with an innovation premium that is reflected in our ASPs that are more than 3x the industry average and also industry-leading gross margins. The growing scope of our customers' products is dramatically expanding in complexity and pressuring their product development teams and innovation cycles. To meet these challenges and deliver the next wave of disruptive innovations, we're investing over $1.6 billion in R&D annually. These investments strengthen our broad market franchise and enable us to expand our SAM and vertical applications where more complete solutions are necessary. We achieve this by integrating our core analog technologies with increasing levels of digital algorithms and software.\nNow let's look at how our technology is intersecting with our markets. Industries like transportation, energy, telecoms, manufacturing and health care are prioritizing digitalization. This is driving new generations of applications and fueling a host of concurrent secular growth trends, and I'd like to touch on just a few now.\nStarting with automotive. Here, ADI is the market leader in battery management systems, for example, for EVs. Our battery management systems, or BMS, solutions offer customers the highest levels of accuracy, reliability, safety and security. Our wireless BMS solution offers all the benefits of wired but also enables rapid battery pack configurability and cost-effective scaling of our customers' EV fleets. This innovative solution continues to gain traction in the market and adds to our content per system by up to 2x.\nMoving to communications, where ADI is the market leader in radio signal chains for 5G with a majority share across the ecosystem. Our latest generation transceiver includes a fully integrated digital front end and grows our SAM by 2x. This innovative radio architecture reduces system cost and waste and improves power efficiency. Further, the flexibility of these software-defined solutions allows them to be used across traditional 5G networks as well as in emerging Open RAN and LEO satellite networks.\nLastly, health care. We have a #1 position with dominant share in medical imaging, for example. Subsystems like our photons-to-bits module are used by the top CT players in the world. Our solution delivers the highest-fidelity images while decreasing radiation dosage. And in the process, it allows us to capture 4x the SAM compared to offering just components alone.\nIn addition to expanding our innovation edge across these secular trends to amplify growth, the Maxim combination creates a $1 billion revenue synergy opportunity for us over the next 5 years. The first opportunity arises from customer cross-selling, leveraging our complementary relationships to pull through our extended portfolio. Second is fusing together the new product road maps of these 2 premier Analog portfolios to push the boundaries of what's possible. And third is power management. Here, the combination with Maxim increases our breadth of power capabilities, creates a more cost competitive portfolio and adds to our engineering talent pool. As a result, we unlocked $4 billion of additional power SAM and look to double our power revenue in the years ahead.\nThe proliferation of the intelligent edge and our revenue synergy opportunity gives me great confidence that we can bend the growth curve upwards, moving from our historical mid-single-digit growth rate to our new model of 7% to 10%.\nNow I'd like to speak a little to the unique resiliency of our business. The diversity of our portfolio is a source of great strength. We ship 75,000 product SKUs, which support thousands of applications to over 125,000 customers. Notably, 80% of our revenue is derived from products that individually contribute no more than 0.1% of total revenue. And the longevity of our products is unmatched. On average, our products have life spans of a decade or more, effectively delivering recurring revenue streams for decades. It's these characteristics that create a high barrier to entry and an enduring business model.\nFinally, we utilize a geographically diverse hybrid manufacturing strategy to tame the complexity and fragmentation of the analog market. This strategy provides us with a broad array of technology and packaging necessary to create innovative solutions from 7 nanometers to 7 micrometers. At the same time, this model creates a diverse network of internal and external partners to best manage our operations through economic cycles.\nAs we mentioned at our Investor Day, we're investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost-effective model. To that end, we're doubling the capacity of our internal factories and adding significant capital to our product test operations. These investments will grow our output this year and into 2023 and increase our swing capacity across our network to over 70% of revenue.\nSo in closing, ADI is a leader in innovating at the edge, and I believe that our best days are still ahead of us as we drive increased value for our customers, shareholders and society. And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Prashanth, who will take you through the financial detail.\n\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vince. Let me add my welcome to our second quarter earnings call. It was great to see and hear from so many of you at our Investor Day last month, and it was also exciting to welcome so many of our customers to demonstrate our technologies in action.\nAs usual, my comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. We printed another very impressive quarter with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These strong results reflect increasing demand for our highly differentiated products aligned to multiple secular trends as well as our ability to leverage our hybrid manufacturing model, offset inflation and accelerate synergy capture.\nSecond quarter revenue of $2.97 billion finished above the high end of our outlook, with every B2B end market exceeding initial expectations. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue and our ninth straight sequential growth period.\nSo let's look at the performance by end market. Industrial, our most diverse and profitable end market, represented 51% of revenue and hit another all-time high. We experienced broad-based growth with digital health care, automation, instrumentation and test leading the way, underscoring increasing content and our strong position in these secular markets. Industrial has now grown more than 20% year-over-year for 6 straight quarters.\nAutomotive, which represented 21% of revenue, also achieved another record with all applications growing double digits year-over-year. In BMS, where we hold the #1 position, our quarterly revenue eclipsed $100 million for the first time. We expect strong growth to persist, given the momentum in the market and our continued design wins. Additionally, our A2B and GMSL solutions, which together make up roughly 20% of automotive, continued on their secular growth path fueled by the digitalization of the automobile.\nCommunications represented 16% of revenue with robust broad-based growth. In wireless, we experienced growing demand across our RF portfolio as 5G deployments, particularly in North America, gained momentum. ADI's latest generation transceiver, which Vince spoke to, is ideally positioned to capitalize on the virtualization trend. In wireline, demand for our optical and power products remained strong as carriers and hyperscalers invest to meet the ever-growing demand for bandwidth. And lastly, consumer represented 12% of revenue and has now grown year-over-year for 6 straight quarters. This consistent growth is a function of our product and customer breadth, which better insulates us from the typical fluctuations associated with PCs and portable devices.\nNow on to the P&L. Gross margin was a record 74.2%, increasing 230 basis points sequentially and 330 basis points year-over-year. Favorable product mix, high utilization and revenue growth and synergy fall-through were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $710 million, better than anticipated, owing to faster synergy execution. Record operating margins of 50.3% grew 450 basis points sequentially and 860 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, we've realized over $250 million of cost synergies. We look to quickly achieve the remaining synergies and hit our recently increased target of $400 million in savings exiting fiscal '23.\nNon-op expenses were $41 million and the tax rate for the quarter was 13.2%. All told, adjusted EPS came in at a record $2.40, up more than 50% versus the second quarter 2021.\nAnd now on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and equivalents. Days of inventory increased sequentially to 122 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target. If we look at cash flow, CapEx for the quarter was $119 million and $447 million over the trailing 12 months or 5% of revenue. To support our accelerated 7% to 10% long-term revenue growth outlook, we are strategically investing to expand internal capacity while enhancing the resiliency of our hybrid model. To that end, as we stated at Investor Day, we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue to be in the high single digits during fiscal '22 and '23 before reverting back to 4% to 6% over the long term.\nAnd over the trailing 12 months, we generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Included in our free cash flow are onetime transaction-related costs amounting to about 3% of revenue. Given the recent market weakness, we accelerated our repo activity to $776 million during the second quarter. This brings our total share repurchase to approximately $3.5 billion since the close of Maxim. And we look to maintain this accelerated buyback pace this quarter and achieve our $5 billion commitment by the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We will allocate 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to support a 10% dividend CAGR throughout the cycle, with the remaining cash used for buybacks to reduce share count annually.\nAnd now on to the outlook for third quarter. Revenue is expected to be $3.05 billion, plus or minus $100 million. We expect all end markets to grow sequentially. Given our higher-than-normal annual merit increase, operating margin is expected to be 49.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And our tax rate is expected to be between 13% and 14%. Based on these inputs, adjusted EPS is expected to be $2.42, plus or minus $0.10. While we are very mindful of the current economic trends, our demand indicators remain very strong and our customer conversations remain upbeat, giving us confidence for continued growth for the remainder of 2022 and likely into 2023.\nImportantly, as a result of our vast diversification, leadership in numerous secular growth markets, additional synergies and our resilient hybrid manufacturing model, we believe ADI has never been better positioned to transcend cyclical downturns and accelerate long-term growth. Let me now give it back to Mike to start the Q&A.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nVP, IR and FP&A, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks, Prashanth. Let's get to our Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) With that, Katrina, can we have our first question, please?"

Roche\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nWell, thanks, Mike, and good morning to everybody.\nSo once again, ADI delivered another record quarter, marking a strong start to the year. Our continued success was driven by our unparalleled high-performance portfolio and our team's strong operational execution and intense customer focus, enabling us to better meet the growing demand for our products.\nNow looking at our first quarter results. Revenue was $2.68 billion, up more than 20% year-over-year on a combined basis. Growth was broad-based, with all segments up double-digits year-over-year, led by Industrial and Automotive. Gross margin expanded to 72% and operating margin increased to over 45%. Adjusted EPS was $1.94, up 35% year-over-year.\nNow it's been nearly 6 months since we closed the Maxim transaction. Overall, we've made great progress on the integration to date. The feedback we've received from customers and our teams has been overwhelmingly positive. And we've taken important steps to strengthen our operations.\nIn the many exchanges I've had with our customers, they have expressed their enthusiasm for the combination, recognizing the increased value that ADI and Maxim together bring to the market. Broadly speaking, ADI is viewed as a trusted long-term focused partner that takes a customer-first approach to our engagements. We offer a unique combination of best-in-class engineering and unmatched domain expertise, with a high-performance portfolio that spans from microwave to bits, from nanowatts to kilowatts, and from sensor to cloud. This is enabling us to develop more complete solutions that define the edge of possible.\nThe acquisition of Maxim increases the breadth and depth of our high-performance portfolio especially in power management. Here, our more comprehensive power portfolio allows us to better address opportunities across industrial, automotive, data center, connectivity and consumers. Similar to the cross-selling activity we implemented with the LTC portfolio, we're aggressively identifying areas to attach this power portfolio with ADI's leadership positions in analog, mixed signal and RF. And with our extended sales and field organizations, we're better positioned to uncover cross-selling opportunities and serve existing and new customers who have an increased need for application and design support at a solutions level.\nI've also been highly engaged with our teams across ADI. The combination has unleashed excitement throughout the organization. There's a burning desire to capitalize on the numerous opportunities to accelerate revenue growth. And I'm already seeing firsthand the benefits of our collaboration, from operations, to engineering, to sales, making me excited for what's ahead.\nTurning firstly to our manufacturing operations. The analog sector is characterized by fragmentation, with diversity across products, customers, applications and markets. To tackle this complexity, we utilize a hybrid manufacturing strategy, providing us with vast capabilities across technology, processes and packaging necessary to create innovative solutions from 7 nanometers to 7 microns for our 125,000 customers.\nThe combination with Maxim enhances our hybrid manufacturing model by enabling a more diverse network of internal facilities and external partners. This increases our access to technologies and capabilities, which in turn expands the scale and the scope of our offerings. We're investing in our internal manufacturing operations to build a more robust and cost-effective model. To that end, we're expanding the footprints of our Oregon and Limerick fabs and adding significant capital to our test operations at our facilities in the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. These investments will grow our capacity this year and into 2023, provide seamless product qualifications for our customers, and give us greater optionality between our internal facilities and foundry partners.\nNow ahead of our Investor Day in April, I'd like to preview some of the secular growth trends that make us most excited about the future of our industry and for our company.\nIn the industrial market, we're seeing the compounding effect of many concurrent secular trends. For example, our instrumentation business, which is comprised of automated test equipment, electronic test and measurement and scientific instruments, is aligned with growth trends from connectivity, to EVs, to sustainability. The growing technology complexity of these applications requires ADI's more advanced metrology solutions, enabling us to continue increasing our SAM.\nOur factory automation business is empowering another critical trend of more intelligent and connected factories. Here, we support tens of thousands of customers of all sizes with our precision signal chain, power management, sensing technologies, and robust wired and wireless connectivity solutions.\nIn automotive electrification, we're the global leader in battery management systems for EVs, with double the market share of our nearest competitor. We're continuing to build momentum globally. And in the last quarter, we've recorded several new design wins from premium European auto manufacturers.\nElectrification is not exclusive to the automotive sector. There is a necessary shift to sustainable energy sources to deliver the environmental benefits of electrification. This vision requires green energy generation with a smart grid, which digitally monitors and adjusts performance, and also energy storage systems, which mitigate intermittency issues related to variable user demand. ADI supports this infrastructure with control and sensing technologies as well as accurate monitoring and efficient power conversion to ensure the grid parameters remain stable.\nWithin automotive, we're also seeing manufacturers create a more immersive human experience by digitalizing the cabin. This requires increased bandwidth, lower latency and more efficient power management, creating new opportunities for ADI's connectivity and power portfolios. For example, our audio system solutions with signal processing, A2B connectivity and road noise cancellation provide customers with the highest fidelity solution while also reducing the vehicle's weight. In addition, our GMSL franchise and functional safety certified power management solutions are critical in architecting and efficiently powering advanced driver assistance systems. Overall, our market-leading positions in BMS, audio systems and GMSL, combined with our complementary customer bases, position our automotive franchise to deliver strong growth in the years ahead.\nTurning now to advanced communications networks. In wireless ADI's market-leading software-defined transceiver portfolio is enabling next-generation communication systems, from traditional 5G, to O-RAN, to low earth orbit satellites. And we're expanding our SAM with the industry's first transceiver that includes a fully integrated digital front end. In wireline, our optical control and power portfolios are critical to tackling the exponential growth in bandwidth and compute power of carrier networks and hyperscale data centers Here, we see a large and underserved opportunity for ADI.\nSo with that backdrop, we look forward to expanding on these areas and more at our Investor Day with our senior leadership team.\nSo in closing, ADI is the leader in innovating at the edge. We have an industry-leading high-performance portfolio that continues to benefit from the acceleration of mass digitalization across industries. And with Maxim, our portfolio has increased in breadth and depth, and we see even more opportunity than ever to capture additional market share. And I'm very optimistic about what our future holds.\nAnd so with that, I'll hand you over to Prashanth, who will take us through the financial details.\n\nPrashanth Mahendra-Rajah\n\nSenior VP of Finance & CFO, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my welcome to our first quarter earnings call. .\nMy comments today, with the exception of revenue, will be on an adjusted basis, which excludes special items outlined in today's press release. The revenue commentary is on a pro forma basis and includes pre-acquisition Maxim revenue in the comparable period.\nADI delivered a very strong first quarter, with record revenue, profitability and earnings. These results reflect the secular demand for ADI's products, capturing synergies and effectively passing on inflationary costs. Our manufacturing team is diligently securing additional internal and external capacity as orders remain robust across all our markets and our backlog continues to grow. This sets the stage for continued sequential growth through the balance of fiscal 2022.\nSo for the first quarter, revenue of $2.68 billion finished near the high end of our outlook, with double-digit growth across all end markets and geographies. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue and 8 straight of sequential growth.\nLooking at our end market performance for the quarter, Industrial, our most diverse and profitable market, represented 50% of revenue and achieved a new all-time high. Industrial has grown more than 20% year-over-year for 5 straight quarters, underscoring our strong market positioning, supported by numerous secular tailwinds, including automation, digital health care, sustainable energy, aerospace and instrumentation.\nAutomotive, which represented 21% of revenue, achieved another record, with every major application posting double-digit year-over-year growth. Our battery management system offering continues to outperform and represents over 15% of automotive revenue, underscoring ADI's leadership in electric powertrains. Additionally, secular content growth inside the cabin continues to drive both the A2B and GMSL connectivity franchises to new heights.\nCommunications represented 15% of revenue and exhibited strength in wireless and wireline. We are in the early days of 5G deployment and expect global rollouts, led by North America, to accelerate in 2022 and beyond. And in wireline, demand remains strong as carriers and hyperscalers continue to upgrade their cloud infrastructure from long haul to data center.\nAnd lastly, consumer represented 14% of revenue and was in line with seasonality. Importantly, we continue to grow year-over-year, supported by strategic investments aimed at diversifying our customer and application mix. The first quarter demonstrated our increased portfolio breadth as all segments achieved growth, including professional audio video, gaming, wearables, hearables and personal electronics.\nNow looking at the P&L. Gross margin increased 100 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-over-year, resulting in a record 71.9%. Favorable product mix, higher utilizations and synergies were key drivers of the increase. OpEx in the quarter was $702 million, better than anticipated due to faster synergy progress. Operating margin of 45.8% increased 510 basis points year-over-year. Non-op expenses were $44 million, in line with last quarter. And our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 13%. All told, adjusted EPS of $1.94 increased 35%. Our record profitability this quarter was driven by the stronger revenue growth as well as the synergy capture.\nAnd now moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and equivalents. And on a trailing 12-month pro forma basis, our net leverage ratio was just under 1 turn. Days of inventory increased modestly sequentially to 115 and channel inventory remains below the low end of our 7- to 8-week target.\nLooking at cash flow items. CapEx was $111 million for the quarter and $387 million over the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, during fiscal 2022, we plan to invest 6% to 8% of revenue to significantly grow our front and back-end capacity and build a more resilient hybrid manufacturing model for the long term. Importantly, this higher level of CapEx will not hinder our capital return commitments. Over the trailing 12 months, we generated $2.78 billion of free cash flow or 33% of revenue. Our free cash flow margin was lower by about 3% due to costs related to the Maxim acquisition. Over the same time period, we returned approximately $4.2 billion or more than 150% of free cash flow via purchases and dividends. And as a reminder, we target 100% free cash flow return. We aim to use 40% to 60% of our free cash flow to consistently grow our dividend, with the remaining free cash flow used for share repo. And just yesterday, we announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit increases. We have now raised our dividend 19 times in the past 18 years. Our ASR program concluded in the first quarter, and as a result, we retired approximately 14.4 million shares. We are now more than halfway towards executing our $5 billion repo commitment by the end of calendar 2022.\nSo let me finish with the second quarter outlook. Revenue is expected to be $2.8 billion, plus or minus $100 million. At the midpoint, we expect all B2B markets to grow sequentially and for consumer to be flattish. At the midpoint, operating margin is expected to be 46.5%, plus or minus 70 bps. And this outlook includes approximately $100 million of annual run rate synergies, split roughly evenly between cost of goods and OpEx as we exit second quarter. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 13%. So based on these inputs, adjusted EPS should be around $2.07, plus or minus $0.10.\nAnd finally, let me end with an invitation. We are holding our Investor Day on April 5, where we look forward to sharing ADI's long-term strategy, our new financial model and a detailed update on all phases of our synergy road map. We hope to see many of you in person at our headquarters right outside of Boston, where we will offer unique customer-led interactive technology demonstrations and displays throughout the day. This includes showcasing our wireless battery management system for EVs and much more.\nI'll hand it off to Mike for the Q&A.\n\nMichael C. Lucarelli\n\nSenior Director of IR, Analog Devices, Inc.\n\nThanks, Prashanth. Let's get to the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) With that, we have our first question, please."

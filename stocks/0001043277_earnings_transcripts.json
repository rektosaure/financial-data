Robinson Third Quarter 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, October 29, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Castagnetto, our President of North American Surface Transportation Arun Rajan, our Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer; and Damon Lee, our Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that our remarks today contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation list factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. To today's remarks also contain certain non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are included in the presentation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I've met with many investors over the past year. And as you know, we don't normally start our discussions or spend a lot of time on the macro environment. due to the exciting lean AI transformation that is occurring at Robinson. After a really strong third quarter performance that I and the team are really pleased with. I do want to start off, however, by sharing a little bit of context around the macro conditions that we're not immune to and that I'm proud of our employees for navigating with discipline and ingenuity. The third quarter of 2025 was marked by a continued soft freight environment with the cash freight shipment index declining year-over-year for the 12th consecutive quarter. The cash index reading was the lowest Q3 reading since the financial crisis of 2009. And despite a fairly steady exit of trucking capacity over the past 3 years, Truckload spot rates continue to bounce along the bottom due to low demand.\nInternational freight has been impacted by global trade policies, which caused previous front loading, a dislocation of shipments and a softer than normal peak season. Combined with excess vessel capacity, this caused ocean rates to decline substantially versus a year ago consistent with the expectations that we laid out at our Investor Day in December. Ocean rates also declined substantially during Q3, and causing our adjusted gross profit per ocean shipment to decline 27% from June to September. So the setup for global transportation companies was certainly unfavorable in Q3. We are not immune to the market and the volume and rate dynamics in Global Forwarding are certainly headwinds we are facing. But this is a new C.H. Robinson and we don't use the macro environment as an excuse. We are fundamentally different company than we were 2 years ago, illustrated by the company's consistent outperformance versus the market. But make no mistake, this consistent outperformance does not just happen, and it's not easy for others to replicate.\nWe're changing the culture of the company, which is really hard work. We've shifted to a culture of solving problems with speed and the implementation of a lean operating model has contributed greatly to this change. A lean operating model is about building the habit of getting better every day through innovation, selling fast and discovery. We certainly encounter challenges along the way, but how we solve them now is different. With the discipline and tools that we've armed our people with, we solved those challenges with a lean mindset with the experimentation and with urgency. The Robinson operating model helps us focus on what matters most to eliminate waste and deliver more value to our customers faster. Our people have embraced our lean operating model and the discipline needed to generate higher highs and higher lows across market cycles. While we've made considerable progress, we are still in the early innings of our lean transformation and a significant runway exists as we continue to deepen the lean mindset and methods across the organization.\nShifting to our Q3 results that provide another proof point of the disciplined execution of our strategy. In NAST, we grew our combined truckload and LTL volume by approximately 3% year-over-year and demonstrably grew market share versus a 7.2% decline in the cash freight shipment index. This was accomplished while expanding gross margins for the eighth consecutive quarter and further increasing productivity and operating leverage while growing volume. This resulted in a 39% adjusted operating margin in NAST and further progress towards our 40% mid-cycle adjusted operating margin target for NAST. In global forwarding, we expanded gross margins by 380 basis points year-over-year through improved revenue management discipline. We also continue to improve our productivity, which has now increased by more than 55% in Global Forwarding since the end of 2022. This improvement in our operating leverage enabled us to achieve our 30% mid-cycle adjusted operating margin target in Q3 despite the difficult market conditions. With 7 consecutive quarters of consistent outperformance through the disciplined execution of the strategy that we shared at our 2024 Investor Day, there is no doubt in our minds that we are on the right path to deliver sustainable outperformance.\nWe are not waiting for a market recovery to improve our financial results and the strategies that our team is executing are built to be effective in any market environment. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, we are comfortable operating in an environment that is lower for longer. In today's environment, there is a flight to quality, and that is Robinson. We're also highly confident and our ability to continue delivering exceptional value for our customers and to continue executing on all of our strategic initiatives, including further increasing our operating leverage, where the market eventually inflects. Our model with an industry-leading cost to serve is highly scalable, and we expect it will improve further as we harness the evolving power of AI and to drive automation across the quote-to-cash life cycle of a load. We're still in the early innings of our lean AI journey, call it third inning in NAST and first inning in Global Forwarding. Lean AI is our unique disciplined approach to AI innovation that transforms supply chains. By combining the principles of lean methodology in our Robinson operating model with the power of AI Lean AI is designed to maximize value and minimize waste for better outcomes. It is uniquely enabled by our leading AI technology.\nOur expert logisticians and our lean operating model that drives continuous improvement. Our fleet of AI agents are not only improving our productivity and operational performance by automating tasks that free up our industry-leading talent to focus on more strategic, higher-value work, but they are also enhancing the service and value we deliver to our customers and contributing to our market share gains. We are pioneering new ways to eliminate tasks, augment our capabilities and supercharge our talented people with industry-leading technology that materially elevates the customer and carrier experience and our lean operating model enables us to do this in a disciplined and cost-effective way that delivers the most value to all our stakeholders. Our genetic supply chain solutions are enabling a new era of logistics, and we're leading the way for customers and carriers.\nOverall, the progress on our strategic initiatives remains on track. The consistent disciplined execution of our Lean AI strategy, supported by the Robinson operating model makes us stronger, and we continue to believe that the next 2 years for C.H. Robinson and our stakeholders will be more exciting than the last 2 years. I'll turn it over to Michael now to provide more details on our NAST results.\n\nMichael D. Castagnetto\n\nPresident of North American Surface Transportation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q3 NAST results demonstrate the strength of our execution, the expertise and discipline of our team and the resilience of the Robinson operating model in a difficult freight environment. The team once again delivered market share growth in both truckload and LTL in Q3. Additionally, by strategically optimizing our volume, we not only drove year-over-year, but also sequential expansion in both our gross and operating profit margins. For more context, the Cass Freight Shipment Index declined on a year-over-year basis for the 12th consecutive quarter in Q3 and was down 7.2%. In contrast, our combined truckload and LTL volume delivered positive growth of approximately 3% year-over-year, outperforming the Cass Freight Shipping Index for the tenth consecutive quarter. Truckload volume rose approximately 3% year-over-year and LTL volume increased approximately 2.5% year-over-year. We continue to build strong momentum across key verticals and that we highlighted as growth areas at our Investor Day, which include retail, energy, automotive and health care.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered year-over-year volume growth in each of these verticals. We in addition to growth in cross-border and short-haul volume and with small- and medium-sized customers. These results reflect the execution of our strategic focus and our expanded capabilities that directly support these segments and evolving customer needs. We introduced several value-added solutions in recent months, including our new drop trailer asset management system, cross-border freight consolidation as well as our AI-driven always on logistics planner. These solutions are designed to simplify complexity, reduce costs and deliver consistent, high-quality service across the supply chain. In our over $3 billion LTL business, we delivered year-over-year volume growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, and we continue to outperform the broader LTL market. Through our deep, long-standing relationships with LTL carriers and our proven ability to manage service variability among the carriers to deliver a consistently high level of service to our customers. They continue to turn to us to simplify the complexities of LTL freight and to reduce their costs.\nOur ability to consistently provide the best combination of price and service to our LTL customers continues to result in more freight for us. Our team of freight experts once again responded to a challenging freight environment, supported by a resilient operating model and industry-leading tools. Through disciplined pricing strategies and a sustained cost of higher advantage we delivered yield improvements that translated into a 70 basis point year-over-year improvement in NAST gross margin and a 20 basis point sequential increase. Our team continues to actively assess the market and optimize for the most effective combination of volume and margin to enhance earnings performance. With strategic agility built into our model, we have the flexibility to pivot toward volume or margin as market dynamics evolve, making disciplined, data-driven adjustments in real time, all while staying focused on long-term value creation.\nWe're also making smarter use of our proprietary digital capabilities and getting actionable data and AI-powered tools into the hands of our freight experts faster enabling them to make better decisions and to capture the optimal freight for us. These digital capabilities have enabled us to continue delivering double-digit productivity increases in NAST in 2025. Since the end of 2022, we have delivered a more than 40% increase in shipments per person per day, and this is measured across the entirety of our NAST organization rather than a subset of employees. This enhanced efficiency is not only lowering our industry-leading cost to serve but is also elevating the customer experience by enabling faster, more reliable service. And while shifts in market dynamics and regulatory changes continue to occur, we remain confident in the strength and reliability of our carrier network. Our diversified carrier base and thorough vetting give us a high degree of comfort in our ability to navigate these changes without disruption and to maintain a high level of service quality for our customers.\nLooking ahead to Q4, it is typically a seasonally weaker quarter compared to Q3. The 10-year average of the Cass Freight Shipment Index, excluding the pandemic impacted year of 2020 reflects a 3.5% sequential volume decline from Q3 to Q4. Regardless of market conditions, we remain focused on what we can control, and we will continue to deliver industry-leading solutions and flexibility that only a scaled broker can provide to customers and carriers. Our people and their unmatched expertise enable us to deliver exceptional service, greater value and the team is relentlessly driving improved results. With that, I'll turn it over to Arun to provide an update on the innovation we're delivering to strengthen our customer and carrier experience and improve our gross margin and operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, to better serve our customers and widen our competitive moat, we are continuing to scale several innovations, including our fleet of secure proprietary AI agents across every aspect of the extensive quote-to-cash life cycle of an order and to more modes and customers. One example is our recently launched Always-on Logistics Planner, a coordinated service model that brings together more than 30 connected agents. Our agentic supply chain solutions, automaker team tasks, surface strategic insights and enables seamless global coordination across every mode and region. This launch is the first step in a broader expansion of a genetic AI across our managed solutions portfolio.\nOur fleet of AI agents is growing fast, and we're building a future where AI agents enable our logistics professionals to orchestrate supply chains with greater predictability, efficiency and operational excellence. By leveraging and scaling the use of game-changing AI technology, such as genetic AI to power new capabilities that are backed by our unmatched data and scale, we are continuing to disrupt from within. The advanced reasoning capabilities of genetic AI enable us to unlock the value trapped and unstructured data, such as phone calls, e-mails and tribal knowledge due to genetic AI's ability to understand context and make decisions in real time. But it's also important to understand that most transformative technologies and innovations rarely emerge fully formed. They evolved through cycles of experimentation, feedback and iteration. Along these lines, innovation and pioneering in a genic AI is not a straight line due to the complex iterative and unpredictable nature of the technology and its development.\nUnlike linear automation that follows predictable rule-based scripts, AgenticAI operates with a degree of autonomy and unpredictability, making his progress nonlinear. The journey is marked by cycles of advancement and retrenchment, shifting challenges and the continuous need for human-in-the-loop oversight. Our lean AI process of building, learning and discovering where missteps and the resulting learnings are milestones is not just necessary. It's the best path to success and uncovering what truly works. As Dave mentioned, our lean operating model enables us to develop and implement innovations in a disciplined and cost-effective way that delivers the most value to our stakeholders. Our in-house team of over 450 engineers and data scientists with their rich domain expertise, have been empowered to develop and implement our proprietary AI agents. This enables us to deliver optimized AI solutions at a faster pace and a lower cost. We have not increased our overall tech spending to implement AI and our only incremental cost of scale AI as the cost of tokens for which the price continues to decline.\nAs we continue to improve our service with cost-efficient AI task agents that listen, learn and act all day every day, Agent AI has the ability to ignite the revolution and empower systems to think, adapt and act differently, enabling us to deliver fast, accurate and personalized service at scale and in any market. All of these innovations are reducing the amount of time it takes for us to respond to a quote for a tendered load to be accepted or for an appointment to be set, thereby providing a superior customer experience. Additionally, the faster speed provided by our AI has enabled us to respond to more quotes and win more business, thereby accelerating our market share growth. The continued advancement of our AI is also powering our dynamic pricing and costing and responding more surgically and faster than ever to dynamic market conditions by performing more frequent price discovery. Along with our operating model rider and our revenue management practices, this is contributing to the gross margin improvements that we're delivering.\nFinally, the growing automation across our quote-to-cash life cycle whether it be in quoting, order entry, low tenders, appointment scheduling or other manual tasks, creates business model scalability. This enables us to decouple headcount growth from volume growth and to create greater operating leverage. Our ability to successfully leverage technology and automation has played a key role in our greater than 40% productivity increase since the end of 2022, and we expect to create further operating leverage as evergreen productivity improvements continue in 2025 and beyond. Ultimately, we are focused on 3 items that are key to our strategy, transforming the customer interior experience to elevate our service offering and drive growth, delivering business model scalability and driving gross margin and operating margin expansion. Technology continues to evolve, and we have and will continue to disrupt from within to stay at the forefront of that evolution and to further widen our competitive moat. With that, I'll turn the call over to Damon for a review of our third quarter results.\n\nDamon J. Lee\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q3, we continued to execute with discipline and focus, advancing our strategic initiatives in alignment with our North Star of growing operating income. Q3 results demonstrate our sustained strong momentum driven by market share growth, continued optimization of adjusted gross profit or AGP, disciplined cost management, and further productivity gains, all supported by our lean operating model and rapidly advancing AI capabilities. Due to significant year-over-year declines in ocean rates and the February 2025 sale of our Europe Surface Transportation business, our total revenue in AGP declined approximately 11% and 4%, respectively. An 18% decline in Global Forwarding AGP driven primarily by the lower ocean rates was partially offset by a 6% increase in NAST AGP. NAST continued to outperform, growing volume 3% year-over-year, significantly outpacing a market that was down 7%, while expanding gross margins and improving operating leverage. Global Forwarding's AGP was lower year-over-year due to lower ocean rates, but gross margins expanded year-over-year and sequentially due to disciplined pricing and revenue management.\nOn a monthly basis, compared to Q3 of last year, our total company AGP per business day was down 3% in July, flat in August and down 9% in September. This was primarily driven by lower ocean rates, which caused Q3 ocean AGP per shipment to decline 27.5% year-over-year. Turning to expenses, Q3 personnel expenses were $349.3 million, including $9.7 million of charges related to workforce reductions. Excluding these charges, our Q3 personnel expenses were $339.6 million, down $19.1 million due to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and our continued productivity and cost optimization efforts. Our average headcount was down 10.8% year-over-year in Q3 and was down 2.3% sequentially illustrating our continued decoupling of headcount growth from volume growth. Based on year-to-date personnel expenses of $1.02 billion, excluding restructuring charges, and current expectations for Q4, we still expect 2025 personnel expenses to be in the guidance range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, but above the midpoint of the range.\nOur Q3 SG&A expenses totaled $135.9 million, excluding 2024 charges primarily related to the divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business SG&A expenses were up $0.9 million or 0.7% year-over-year. Based on year-to-date SG&A expenses of $417.7 million, excluding restructuring charges and current expectations for Q4, we still expect our 2025 SG&A expenses to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million, but above the midpoint of the range. This guidance includes depreciation and amortization that is expected to be $100 million to $105 million versus our previous guidance of $95 million to $105 million. Shifting back to Q3, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.6%. We continue to expect the full year 2025 tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20%. We generated $275.4 million in cash from operations in Q3 and our capital expenditures were $18.6 million during the quarter. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be $65 million to $75 million.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we ended Q3 with approximately $1.37 billion of liquidity and including $1.23 billion of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $137 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q3 was 1.17x down from 1.40x at the end of Q2. This financial strength is a key differentiator in our industry, giving us the ability to continue investing through the bottom of the freight cycle and further enhancing our capabilities. While our capital allocation strategy remains grounded in maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, our financial strength and improved leverage ratio enabled us to return approximately $190 million of cash to shareholders in Q3 through $115 million of share repurchases and $75 million of dividends. Through the disciplined execution of our strategy, with our lean operating model and AI innovation at its core, Q3's results further validate the lean AI transformation underway at C.H. Robinson. As we carry this momentum forward, we are well positioned to continue outperforming in any market environment while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. That covers our Q3 results.\nAnd now I would like to give an update on the financial targets that we originally shared at our 2024 Investor Day in December. Based on the confidence in our strategy, our disciplined execution and our significant runway for further improvement. We issued a separate press release today announcing an increase in our 2026 operating income target. We originally expected to increase our 2026 operating income by $350 million to $450 million versus our 2023 adjusted operating income of $553 million. Today, we increased that expectation by roughly $50 million despite market dynamics that have created greater headwinds than we originally anticipated. This results in a new 2026 operating income target range of $965 million to $1.04 billion. The bottom end of this range, which assumes 0 market volume growth equates to approximately $6 of earnings per share. The full range of market volume growth assumptions include an expectation that if the market does return to year-over-year growth, it likely won't occur into the second half of 2026, in line with the market predictions of external sources such as ACT research.\nSo let's talk about what's behind the higher target. In our December Investor Day, we estimated that our strategic initiatives to grow market share, expand gross margins and increased operating leverage would deliver $220 million of adjusted operating income growth in 2026 versus 2024. Today, we are raising that expectation to $336 million, reflecting stronger benefits from our Lean AI strategy, resulting in additional productivity improvement and operating leverage as well as additional benefit in 2026 from continued gross margin expansion and market share growth. Embedded in our operating leverage target is an expectation that the disciplined execution of our lean operating model will deliver a baseline of single-digit productivity improvements every year. Then as we incorporate certain innovations into our operations, such as Agentic-AI, we expect there to be additional waves of productivity. For 2026, this translates to an expectation that we will again deliver double-digit productivity increases in both NAST and Global Forwarding. And we expect these benefits to be over-indexed to the second half of 2026.\nAlthough we are at or nearing our mid-cycle operating margin targets at the bottom of the market cycle, we have not increased those targets. We believe our margin targets represent a high quality of earnings, and we want to retain optionality in how to best deliver shareholder value. In other words, we may choose to invest operating margins above those targets to deliver demonstrable outgrowth if we believe that will deliver higher earnings and a better return for Robinson and our shareholders. To further enhance shareholder value, our Board of Directors has authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program, which we currently intend to execute over approximately 3 years. The new authorization is in addition to the existing share repurchase authorization, which has 4.5 million shares remaining on it. As we have said several times over the past year, we are still in the early innings of the transformation that is occurring at C.H. Robinson with significant runway remaining on the execution of our lean AI strategy. We are proud of the progress we have made and even more excited about what's ahead and about our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and long-term value for our customers and carriers, our people and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave for his final comments.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Damon. As you heard in our prepared remarks today, we've made significant progress on the transformation of C.H. Robinson into the global leader in lean AI supply chains. We're redefining what a logistics company can be and our differentiating Lean AI gives us a unique opportunity to create a new era in logistics, the era of agenetic supply chains. It's the next chapter in how we solve complex challenges at scale helping our customers build supply chains that are smarter, faster and more resilient in a world where disruption is constant and agility is essential. But as I mentioned in my opening remarks, and as Arun expanded on, there's an imperfection to our journey. A lean transformation and innovation includes failure and discovery. Innovation is not a single spark, but it's a series of sparks, often messy, sometimes misdirected, but always instructive. As Arun shared, most innovations are never right the first time. We have to build, learn and discover our path to succeed. And that is where the lean operating model is so important.\nAs lean tools continue to be deployed broadly across our organization, our teams are becoming increasingly equipped to identify root causes of problems, implement countermeasures and drive meaningful improvements. That's how we've consistently delivered outperformance for 7 consecutive quarters and how we're positioned to continue to doing so regardless of market conditions or cycle. And as we lead our industry and stay on offense with our Lean AI strategy, we've never been more excited about the future. Our technology is lifting manual, repetitive work off our people's plates, freeing them up to use their expertise to do more strategic work, to reach more customers, to garner more wallet share and to move up the value stack by leveraging our growing capabilities. Our technology is improving our gross margins while allowing us to better align capacity and pricing to the specific needs of our customers and to specific market conditions.\nThese superior dynamic costing and pricing capabilities will be even more important when we eventually see a turn in overall freight demand. And as you just heard, Damon talked about our technology is augmenting our evergreen productivity initiatives and improving our industry-leading cost to serve. I want to thank our people for their relentless efforts to provide exceptional service to our customers and carriers for embracing the Robinson operating model and continuing to execute with discipline. We've reinvigorated a winning culture, and we're getting our swagger back. But we have no hubris and we're not resting on our laurels. We are the new disruptor, and we will continue to disrupt our sales and this industry to lead with purpose, move with urgency, drive sustainable outperformance across market cycles and build a company that future generations will be proud to inherit. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to the operator now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Second Quarter 2025 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 30, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Castagnetto, our President of North American Surface Transportation; Arun Rajan, our Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer; and Damon Lee, our Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com.

Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. When the current transformation of C.H. Robinson began in early 2024 with the implementation of a new lean operating model, we recognize that some people had doubts and didn't understand how this would enable the company to change its trajectory. Now with 6 consecutive quarters of consistent outperformance through the disciplined execution of the strategy that we shared at our 2024 Investor Day, there is no doubt in our minds that we are on the right path to deliver sustainable outperformance in all market cycles. I'm proud of the Robinson team for embracing our new operating model and the discipline needed to improve our say-do ratio and to generate higher highs and higher lows across market cycles.\nOur people consistently demonstrate that they are the industry's best logisticians with the value that they bring to our customers and carriers, and they are excited about the transformation happening at Robinson and the momentum that we have. We are not waiting for a market recovery to improve our financial results and the strategies that our Robinson team is executing are not only working, but they are built to be effective in any market environment.\nWe're still in the early innings of our transformation journey. We have demonstrated our ability to responsibly grow market share and expand margins at the same time. This has enabled us to approach our mid-cycle operating margin targets despite operating in an elongated trough of the freight cycle. We are accelerating our progress by harnessing and scaling the evolving power of AI to drive automation across the pool's life cycle of the load.\nOur industry-leading innovations not only enhance the service and value we deliver to our customers, but also improve our operational performance by automating tasks that free up our talented people to focus on more strategic, high-value work. We are pioneering new ways to eliminate tasks, augment our capabilities and supercharge our talented people with industry-leading technology that materially elevates the customer and carrier experience and our lean operating model enables us to do this in a disciplined way that delivers the most value to all of our stakeholders. And you can expect the next chapters of this company's evolution to be just as exciting as the last 18 months.\nShifting to our Q2 results. In NAST, we outgrew the market again in both truckload and LTL, while expanding gross margins and improving productivity year-over-year and sequentially. In Global Forwarding, we continue to win new business and improve the yield of our portfolio by beginning to implement the revenue management disciplines that we've been utilizing in NAST for over a year. We also optimized our global forwarding expenses through further increases in productivity. Overall, we delivered a 21% year-over-year increase in our enterprises Q2 income from operations and we will continue to lean into the self-help initiatives that enabled our Q2 market share growth and margin expansion.\nFrom a macro standpoint, fluid trade policies continue to create uncertainty, making planning activities more difficult for our over 83,000 customers around the world. For some of them, tariffs caused them to reduce their import volumes. For instance, when U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods increased to 145% in April, numerous retailers, limited imports to only essentials needed for fall like back-to-school products. Others accelerated shipments to beat tariff deadlines from Southeast Asia and some stuck to their standard peak season schedules, taking a more wait-and-see approach.\nAlthough we're approaching the traditional retail peak season for ocean, the industry may not see traditional peak volumes as some retail customers are working through inventories and being highly selective and strategic about bringing in only the essential products they must import. We saw this dynamic with back-to-school ordering. And that trend is continuing as uncertainty about trade deals continues to shape customer behavior. But these periods of volatility reinforced C.H. Robinson's value proposition. There is a flight to quality right now, and that is Robinson.\nCustomers need a partner who not only understand how to navigate increasing complexity but who can also partner with them to solve their unique supply chain challenges, especially amid persistent uncertainty and change. We've been doing this for over a century. And with our scale, breadth of services, differentiated experience and financial stability, we are built to lead through disruption and to help our customers adapt just as quickly as we do to changing market dynamics.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to lead the industry in this era of digital enablement, including expanding our suite of cutting-edge self-serve digital solutions to enable faster and more effective navigation of our global trade complexities. Our new U.S. tariff impact analysis tool empowers U.S. importers to assess their overall duty exposure and drill down to the SKU level for precise cost analysis. We also saw a surge in demand for our ACE import intelligence tool, a proprietary self-serve compliance platform that gives importers greater visibility and control over their customs data. Together, these 2 tools provide an unmatched view into both historical compliance and future-facing tariff strategy, helping importers manage every stage of the import life cycle with precision.\nAdditionally, in Q2, we announced the expansion of our proven item-level solutions to all global customers, offering unmatched visibility and control over every SKU across their supply chains. These tools built on years of experience with complex global shippers reduce blind spots, increase agility and deliver measurable savings. In today's volatile environment, scaling this capability reinforces our leadership in digital logistics and our ability to connect data-driven insights with real-world execution. We'll continue to help our customers strategize on how to make their supply chains most efficient and cost effective.\nOur strategic initiatives remain on track. We've been preparing for a variety of market scenarios, and we're intensifying our strategic focus or market outgrowth, gross margin expansion and operating leverage improvement. And while we are not immune to global market dynamics, we remain confident in our strategy and our people. Their consistent, disciplined execution of our strategy, supported by the Robinson operating model makes us stronger, and we'll stay focused on providing differentiated service to our customers and carriers. I'll turn it over to Michael now to provide more details on our NAST results.\n\nMichael D. Castagnetto\n\nPresident of North American Surface Transportation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, the NAST team delivered market share growth in both truckload and LTL in Q2 and further optimized our volume, resulting in year-over-year expansion of our gross and operating profit margin. Once again, we delivered this outperformance in the midst of a historically long freight recession, underscoring the strength and resilience of our model and people. For more context, the cash freight shipment index declined on a year-over-year basis for the 11th consecutive quarter in Q2 and was down 3.4%. Our overall mass volume, on the other hand, increased approximately 1% year-over-year. Truckload volume was flat year-over-year and OTL volume was up approximately 1.5%. All of these outpaced the Cass index.\nSequentially, truckload volume per business day grew approximately 4.5% and LTL volume per business day grew 2.5%. At the same time, the market volumes have declined, load-to-truck ratios are higher than they were a year ago, and route guide depth in our managed solutions business has increased over the past year, reflecting an exit of capacity that has brought us closer to better balance in the market. The result of this has been a year-over-year increase in the truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges.\nSupported by our operating model and armed with industry-leading tools, our team of freight experts continues to respond to the challenging freight environment with pricing discipline and a cost of higher advantage. All of this led to improvement in the AGP yield in both our truckload business and our LTL business, resulting in an 80 basis point year-over-year improvement in our NAST gross margin. Our team continues to actively assess the market and optimize for the most effective combination of volume and margin to enhance earnings performance.\nWith strategic agility built into our model, we have the flexibility to pivot toward volume or margin as market dynamics evolve, making disciplined data-driven adjustments in real time. All while staying focused on long-term value creation. We're also making smarter use of our proprietary digital capabilities and getting actionable data into the hands of our freight experts faster, enabling them to make better decisions and to capture the optimal freight for us.\nAdditionally, these digital capabilities have enabled us to increase our NAST shipments per person per day at a double-digit pace over the past 2-plus years, and that momentum continued in Q2. Since the end of 2022, we have delivered a more than 35% increase in productivity. This enhanced efficiency is not only lowering our cost to serve, but it is also elevating the customer experience by enabling faster, more reliable service. As a result of executing on our strategies, our NAST operating margin of approximately 38% in Q2 increased both year-over-year and sequentially.\nRegardless of market conditions, we remain focused on what we can control. Our people and their unmatched expertise enable us to deliver exceptional service and greater value to our customers and carriers. In line with our disciplined and focused approach to capture growth opportunities in targeted customer segments, we recently announced the expansion of our ISO certification, which enhances our ability to meet rigorous quality standards in the health care logistics sector. We've also adapted our solutions to match our customers' supply chain needs and invested in capabilities such as drop trailer, cross-border, short haul and Robinson managed solutions and we will continue to deliver the industry-leading solutions and flexibility that only a scale broker can provide to customers and carriers.\nIn what continues to be a challenging marketplace, our people are relentlessly driving improved results, powered by their unwavering commitment to our customers and carriers and fueled by the growing adoption of the Robinson operating model and cutting-edge tools.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Arun to provide an update on the innovation we're delivering to strengthen our customer and carrier experience and improve our gross margin and operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, we continue to disrupt from within to transform our business to better serve our customers and to widen our competitive moat. In line with the strategy that we laid out at our 2024 Investor Day, we are scaling several innovations, including our fleet of secure proprietary AI agents across every aspect of the extensive quote-to-cash life cycle of an order and to more modes and customers.\nOne recently announced example is a new AI agent that helps shippers automate the process of classifying LTL freight under a new national system. In the AI agents first few months, it has been determining the freight class and code for about 2,000 orders a day and it has reduced the processing time from 10 minutes or more per shipment to 10 seconds or less. The AI agent can also handle hundreds of LTL shipments at once and determine the freight classification for all of them simultaneously. Our customers' freight gets on the road faster, and our people can devote more time to the work that our customers value most, helping them manage disruptions and operate their supply chains more strategically.\nAnother way that we continue to disrupt from within is by leveraging and scaling the use of game-changing AI technology, such as agentic AI to power new capabilities that are backed by our unmatched data and scale. The advanced reasoning capabilities of agentic AI expands the boundaries of what's possible for process automation by adding the ability to autonomously perform complex tasks without the explicit instructions that Gen AI requires. As we continue to improve our service with cost-efficient AI task agents that listen, learn and act all day, every day, agentic AI has the ability to ignite a revolution and empower systems to think, adapt and act differently, enabling us to deliver fast, accurate and personalized service at scale and in any market.\nAll of these innovations are reducing the amount of time it takes for us to respond to a quote or for a tendered load to be accepted, thereby providing a better customer experience. Additionally, our proprietary AI is supporting our market share and margin expansion initiatives. The faster speed provided by our AI has enabled us to respond to more quotes and win more business thereby augmenting our market share growth. The continued advancement of our AI is powering our dynamic pricing and costing and we are responding more surgically and faster than ever to dynamic market conditions by performing more frequent price discovery.\nAlong with our operating model rigor and our revenue management practices, this is contributing to the gross margin improvement that we're delivering. Through the same rigor, we've also improved our ability to manage the short-term gross margin compression that typically comes with a spot rate inflection, such that we are confident in our ability to shorten the time and reduce the impact of any margin compression compared to historical spot rate inflections. Over a 12-month time frame, we expect a stronger demand and/or reduction of excess capacity that leads to a spot rate inflection to outweigh any short-term margin compression that may occur. In this regard, we believe our outperformance will continue as spot rates inflect.\nFinally, the growing automation across our quote-to-cash life cycle, whether it be quoting, order entry, low tenders, appointment scheduling or other manual tasks, creates business model scalability. This enables us to decouple head count growth from volume growth and to create greater operating leverage. Our ability to leverage evolving technology has played a key role in our greater than 35% productivity increase since the end of 2022. And we expect to create further operating leverage as evergreen productivity improvements continue in 2025 and beyond.\nThe advancements that we're bringing to our customer supply chains, such as automation powered by AI, have significant impact due to our scale and our information advantage, which comes from moving more truckload freight than anyone in North America and doing more LTL shipments than any other 3PL. To date, our tech and AI investments have been over-indexed and asked where we could get the greatest leverage. Where we're now putting more emphasis on deploying the same playbook in global forwarding and expect to generate further improvements in that business to enable us to achieve our 30% operating margin target.\nUltimately, we are focused on 3 items that are key to our strategy: Transforming the customer and carrier experience to elevate our service offering and drive growth; delivering business model scalability; and driving gross margin and operating margin expansion. Technology continues to evolve, and we have and will continue to disrupt from within to stay at the forefront of that evolution. With that, I'll turn the call over to Damon for a review of our second quarter results.\n\nDamon J. Lee\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've heard today, Q2 marked another step forward in executing on the strategic initiatives aimed at our North Star of growing operating income. This was driven by market share growth, ongoing AGP optimization, disciplined cost management and evergreen productivity initiatives. Even as overall market volumes declined, we improved the quality of our volume and AGP through market share gains, disciplined capacity procurement and effective revenue management. Total AGP was up $5.8 million year-over-year despite a $15 million decline due to the sale of our European Surface Transportation business. The overall AGP increase was driven by a 3% increase in NAST and a 1.9% increase in global forwarding. On a monthly basis, compared to Q2 of last year, our total company, AGP, per business day was down 5% in April, up 5% in May and up 2% in June.\nFrom an expense standpoint, our total operating expenses declined $32 million or 6.3% year-over-year. Q2 personnel expenses were $335.3 million, including $3.9 million of charges related to workforce reductions. Excluding these charges, our Q2 personnel expenses were $331.4 million, down $20.3 million due to our continued productivity and cost optimization efforts, the divestiture of our European Surface Transportation business and a nonrecurring benefit of approximately $6.3 million from certain actions taken within Q2. Our average head count was down 11.2% year-over-year in Q2 and was down 3.7% sequentially, reflecting our dynamic workforce planning process that enables us to quickly adapt to changing market conditions.\nBased on our strong cost controls and productivity improvements through the first half of the year, and the visibility we have into the back half. We are lowering our guidance for 2025 personnel expenses to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, compared to our prior range of $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion. This reflects our disciplined approach to managing our cost structure and our ability to drive efficiency while positioning the organization for long-term growth, while remaining committed to further decoupling of head count from volume. With low to mid-teen turnover rates, we are well positioned to manage headcount, primarily through natural attrition, if needed.\nOur Q2 SG&A expenses were $142 million. Excluding $0.4 million of other charges related to the divestiture of our European Surface Transportation business, SG&A expenses of $141.6 million were down $0.8 million year-over-year. We are also lowering our guidance for 2025 SG&A expenses to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million compared to our prior range of $575 million to $625 million. This guidance includes depreciation and amortization of $95 million to $105 million. Although most of our SG&A expenses are subject to inflation, we expect continued cost improvements to partially offset the inflationary impact.\nShifting back to Q2. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.4%. We still expect our 2025 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20%. We generated $227.1 million in cash from operations in Q2, and our capital expenditures were $20.2 million. We still expect our full year capital expenditures to be $65 million to $75 million. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended Q2 with approximately $1.22 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.07 billion of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $156 million. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q2 was 1.40x, down from 1.54x at the end of Q1.\nOur financial strength continues to be a key differentiator in our industry as it enables us to continue investing in the bottom of the freight cycle and improving our capabilities. While our capital allocation strategy remains grounded in maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, our financial strength and improved leverage ratio enabled us to return approximately $161 million of cash to shareholders in Q2 through $85.8 million of share repurchases and $74.9 million of dividends. Compared to last year, our improved leverage ratio has led to a higher likelihood of continued share repurchases in the current year.\nAs we continue to build on our momentum, our Q2 financial results further validate the transformation underway at C.H. Robinson. With the disciplined execution driven by a Robinson operating model and the strength of our strategies to outperform in any market environment. I'm confident in our trajectory, and I'm energized by what lies ahead. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave for his final comments.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Damon. As you gathered from our comments today, we remain focused on executing our self-help initiatives, to strengthen our market share, expand our margins and enhance the level of service we deliver to our customers and carriers. These efforts are central to our strategy to create long-term sustainable value and to lead the logistics industry forward. I'm proud of the work we have done over the past 2 years to stand up a new operating model and to get fit, fast and focused. Our cost structure is in a much better position with greater than 35% productivity gains delivered since 2022, and we're continuing to drive further process improvements to enhance our service and increase our overall operating leverage.\nAs lean tools are deployed more broadly across our organization, our teams are becoming more increasingly equipped to identify root causes of problems, implement countermeasures and drive meaningful improvements. That's how we've consistently delivered outperformance for 6 consecutive quarters and how we'll continue to do so regardless of market conditions or cycle. This outperformance does not happen because you are one of the pack. This is a new and different Robison. And our difference sets us further and further apart from the pack. Our transformation is structural and technological. We're redefining what it means to be a logistics company. Leading from the front with cutting-edge technology, leveraged by the best logisticians in the game and moving faster than ever to shape the future of the supply chain.\nAnd as we lead our industry and stay on offense with our AI strategy, we are excited about the future. Our advanced AI and machine learning technology is improving our gross margins by allowing us to better align capacity and pricing to the specific needs of our customers and to specific market conditions. These superior dynamic costing and pricing capabilities will be even more important when we eventually see a turn in overall freight demand. Our technology is lifting mundane, repetitive tasks of our people's plates, freeing them up to do more strategic work and to reach more customers, garner more wallet share and move up the value stack by leveraging our growing capabilities.\nI want to thank our people for their relentless efforts to provide exceptional service to our customers and carriers. We're embracing the Robinson operating model and continuing to execute with discipline. I'm confident in the team's ability to drive a higher a more consistent level of operational execution and keep pushing the bar higher on our financial performance across market cycles. As I reflect on my first 2 years leading this great company, I'm proud of how we're building on a 120-year legacy of grit, innovation and a relentless focus on the customer. From the beginning Robinson has been grounded in delivering a great customer experience. And that foundation remains core to how we will grow and lead in the future.\nBut we also have hard work to do to evolve, to push our mindset to deliver more value, sharpen our execution, solve problems quickly and differentiate through speed, simplicity and clarity. We've made great progress on our transformation journey, and we're seeing the results, not just in stronger earnings, but in how we improve execution, innovate fast and elevate the customer and carrier experience. We've reinvigorated a winning culture, and we're getting our swagger back, but we're not resting on our laurels. We will continue to disrupt ourselves and this industry to lead with purpose, move with urgency and build a company that future generations will be just as proud to inherit.\nThe message is clear. C.H. Robinson is not just transforming. We're leading. We are the new disruptor, and we're on track to drive sustainable outperformance across market cycles. That concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Paul now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Fourth Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, January 29, 2025. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Senior Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shamali, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Castagnetto, our President of North American Surface Transportation; Arun Rajan, our Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer; and Damon Lee, our Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we'll let you know which slide we're referencing.\nToday's remarks also contain certain non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are included in the presentation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd first like to acknowledge the challenges that many people are facing due to the severe weather and natural disasters in certain regions of the country, including the recent wildfires that damaged and destroyed many homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been impacted, and we extend our gratitude to the first responders who worked tirelessly to keep people safe.\nI'm proud of the support that our company and our employees provided to help those in need as well as our customers. Turning to our fourth quarter. We've talked extensively over the past year about our new Robinson operating model and the disciplined execution that the model is enabling as well as how we're leveraging our industry-leading talent and technology to raise the bar in logistics.\nThe benefits of these efforts were never more evident than in the significant year-over-year improvement in our Q4 financial results. In what continues to be a historically prolonged freight recession with market growth in 2024 that did not materialize as had been projected, the difference in our execution versus last year is stark. Our people are embracing the discipline needed to generate higher highs and higher lows across market cycles, resulting in a higher quality of volume, greater productivity and expansion of our gross profit and operating profit margins.\nIn a trucking environment, where the cost of purchase transportation increased in Q4 due to a decline in industry capacity, our dynamic costing and pricing tools, our revenue management practices and our cost of higher advantage enabled us to provide greater value to our customers and at the same time, improve our NAST gross margin both year-over-year and sequentially. In our Global Forwarding business, the team has debunked the thesis that Robinson couldn't continue to improve productivity when volumes are growing.\nThroughout 2024, I've been impressed with and highly appreciative of the team as they continue to be nimble and highly engaged with our customers to help them navigate various market disruptions and to provide differentiated service and solutions. As a result, our ocean and air shipments grew each quarter on a year-over-year basis and each grew more than 5% for the full year.\nThrough improvements in process standardization and automation and embracing the rigor of our operating model, the forwarding team decoupled headcount growth from volume growth, reduced their average headcount for the year more than 10% and achieved productivity improvement of greater than 15% for the full year. Over the 2-year period of '23 and '24, we delivered compounded productivity growth of 30% or more in both Global Forwarding and NAST.\nAnd as we said at our Investor Day in December, we view our productivity as evergreen improvements that we do not expect to give back, enabled by the operating model disciplines and tools that are being applied across our company. We expect to further advance our productivity as we grow our businesses including both NAST and Global Forwarding. The productivity improvements have lowered our cost to serve and increased our operating leverage.\nCombined with our expanded gross margins, this resulted in a 79% year-over-year increase in our enterprise's Q4 adjusted income from operations. I want to thank our people, one of our greatest competitive advantages for their relentless efforts to embrace our new operating model and execute in a fit, fast and focused way as we keep pushing the bar higher on exceptional service to our customers and carriers, and on financial performance across market cycles.\nOur new operating model has changed how we discover and expect root cause issues and quickly implement countermeasures to improve the level of our operational execution. The reliability of our operating reviews continues to increase as we leverage our data-rich environment to inform our decision-making and enhance our competitive differentiation. This is showing up in improvements such as more disciplined pricing and better decisions on the volume that we're seeking.\nWe are still early in our journey. But the operating model is helping us execute a solid strategy even better, and we expect further improvement as the accountability that the operating model demands is embraced deeper in the organization. I'm confident in the team's ability to drive a higher and more consistent level of discipline in our operational execution.\nAs freight markets continue to fluctuate due to seasonal cyclical and geopolitical factors, we continue to remain focused on what we can control, including deploying our operating model and lean principles across the company, providing best-in-class service to our customers and carriers, gaining profitable share in targeted market segments and leveraging game-changing generative AI to improve our service, workflows and cost at scale, not in theory.\nWe also continue to focus on ensuring that we'll be ready for the eventual freight market rebound with a disciplined operating model that responsibly grows market share, further decouples headcount growth from volume growth, drives additional operating leverage and generates incremental operating income.\nI'll turn it over to Michael now to provide more details on our NAST results.\n\nMichael D. Castagnetto\n\nPresident of North American Surface Transportation\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q4, we delivered further optimization of our NAST volume, our gross profit margin and our adjusted gross profit per shipment resulting in a 40% year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating income. From a volume standpoint, the market continues to be in a prolonged freight recession, as Dave mentioned. The Cass Freight Shipment Index in Q4 was down 3.2% year-over-year and down 4.8% sequentially, and it was the lowest Q4 [indiscernible] the industry has seen in the last 15 years.\nAt the same time, the truckload linehaul cost per mile, excluding fuel surcharges, increased due to a decline in industry capacity. Our resilient team of freight experts responded to the challenging freight environment by improving the quality of our volume with pricing discipline and a cost of higher advantage delivered by our procurement teams and the growing usage of our digital brokerage capabilities. All of this led to an improvement in the AGP yield within both our transactional and our contractual truckload business and 170 basis point year-over-year improvement in our NAST gross margin.\nSupported by our operating model and armed with innovative tools, our team also delivered a sequential improvement in NAST gross margin and truckload AGP dollars per shipment, despite the rising cost of purchase transportation. From a volume perspective, our total NAST volume declined approximately 1% year-over-year, outpacing the index for the seventh consecutive quarter. This included a 2.5% increase in LTL volume and a 6.5% decrease in truckload volume.\nOur team is continuously testing the best combination of volume and margin to improve our earnings. We know we have the optionality to increase our volume when the conditions are right, and we are ready to pivot when it makes sense to do so, but we're going to maintain our discipline. From a market balance perspective, we continue to be in a drawn-out stage of capacity oversupply, although carrier attrition is occurring and moving toward better balance each quarter. Due to a seasonal decline in capacity, the dry van load-to-truck ratio and spot rates experienced some upward pressure during the holiday season and the subsequent winter storm similar to last year.\nBut the load-to-truck ratio and spot rates are expected to return to preholiday levels once the storms abate. What stands out is that our execution is markedly different than last December and January as we're making better decisions on the optimal freight for us and making better use of our proprietary digital capabilities. In our LTL business, the 2.5% year-over-year increase in our Q4 shipments was driven by strength across several of our LTL services.\nBy leveraging our vast access to capacity, our broad range of LTL services and solutions and our high level of customer service, our LTL team continues to onboard a solid pipeline of new business and build on our existing LTL business that exceeds $3 billion in annual revenue. Looking ahead to Q1, it is typically a seasonally weaker quarter compared to Q4, with the 10-year average of the Cass Freight Shipment Index, reflecting a 2.5% sequential volume decline from Q4 to Q1.\nAs Dave said, regardless of market conditions, we remain focused on what we can control. Our people and their unmatched expertise enable us to deliver exceptional service and greater value to our customers and carriers. In line with the disciplined and focused approach to capture growth opportunities in targeted customer segments, such as small and medium businesses, we have invested in our sales organization, and we will continue to deliver industry-leading solutions to customers and carriers.\nAs recently announced, one of those solutions is the introduction of C.H. Robinson Financial, an innovative digital payment solution for carriers that is aimed at setting a new standard of speed and efficiency unmatched by any other freight provider. It marks a significant leap forward in fostering financial stability and streamlining operations for carriers. As Dave called out earlier, I also want to take a moment to thank the NAST team for their incredible work in 2024. Our performance and improvements throughout the year reflect their commitment to our customers, carriers and each other. Through their continued engagement with the C.H. Robinson operating model, our people are delivering improved results in a very difficult marketplace, and I am proud to lead this team. I'll turn it over to Arun now to provide an update on the innovation we're delivering to strengthen our customer and carrier experience and improve our AGP yield and operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. As I mentioned at our Investor Day in December, C.H. Robinson is in prime position to disrupt from within to lead the industry forward in a way that others cannot match. The innovations that we bring to the industry and our customer supply chains, such as automation powered by Gen AI have a market-wide impact due to our size and scale.\nAnd we are not just talking about doing this. We are already doing it for thousands of global customers. As an example, with our proprietary technology that reads, classifies and response to incoming e-mails, we've been able to automate more than 10,000 transactions per day. This automation across the quote-to-cash life cycle of an order, whether it be quoting, order entry, low tenders, appointment scheduling, other manual tasks, enables us to reduce our response times and provide a better and more uniform experience for our customers and carriers.\nIt also creates business model scalability, thereby enabling us to decouple headcount growth from volume growth and to create greater operating leverage. In the fourth quarter, as throughout 2024, we continue to scale our process innovations and our use of Gen AI. After utilizing Gen AI to automate orders that are tendered via e-mail, the automation of our order tenders increased 1,150 basis points compared to Q4 of last year and 440 basis points sequentially.\nAnd while the automation of this process has now reached nearly 90%, the other points in the order life cycle have more runway for improvement. The increased automation in our order entry process and [ other points ] in the order life cycle enabled us to increase our NAST and Global Forwarding shipments per person per day by more than 30% over the 2-year period of 2023 and 2024. And although our productivity improvements will continue to compound at these levels, we expect to continue increasing our productivity in 2025 and beyond to create further operating leverage.\nWe also continue to increase the rigor and discipline in our pricing and procurement efforts, resulting in improved AGP yields across our portfolio. With continued innovation in our digital brokerage and dynamic pricing and costing, we're responding surgically and faster than ever to dynamic market conditions by performing more frequent price discovery and enhancing the quality of the pricing that we deliver.\nAlong with our operating model, this was a major contributor for the year-over-year improvement that we achieved during the seasonal market tightness and throughout 2024. But as I also said at our Investor Day, a digital-only approach has proven to be ineffective in the logistics industry due to the level of complexity and variation in freight characteristics that necessitate human expertise. The active role that our people play from a human-in-the-loop perspective leverages their deep domain expertise and drive feedback to our algorithms on a regular basis in the form of export market adjustments.\nAnd through our revenue management discipline, our teams are armed with intelligence on targeted countermeasures that they can take to implement a disciplined pricing strategy based on individual customer value propositions. Ultimately, we are innovating and disrupting [ from within ] to deliver on 3 items that are key to our strategy, transforming the customer and carrier experience to drive growth, delivering business model scalability and driving gross margin and operating margin expansion.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Damon for a review of our fourth quarter results.\n\nDamon Lee\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. As covered by Dave and the team, we delivered significant year-over-year improvement in operating income in Q4, driven by an increase in AGP while reducing cost through our operational discipline and productivity initiatives and thereby driving higher operating leverage. In the face of continued soft market volume and rising spot costs due to declining capacity, disciplined procurement of capacity and revenue management improved the quality of our volume and our AGP, which was up $66 million or 10.7% year-over-year, driven by a 25.6% increase in Global Forwarding and a 6.2% increase in NAST. .\nOn a monthly basis, compared to Q4 of last year, our total company AGP per business day was up 9% in October, up 6% in November and up 12% in December. From an expense standpoint, our total operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, declined $15.3 million year-over-year. Q4 personnel expenses were $354.4 million, including $3.7 million of restructuring charges related to workforce reductions.\nExcluding restructuring charges in the current and prior year, our Q4 personnel expenses were $350.6 million, down $12.5 million due to our continued productivity and cost optimization efforts and despite an increase in incentive compensation related to our improved financial results. Our average Q4 headcount was down 9.5% compared to Q4 of last year. Moving to SG&A. Q4 expenses were $146.4 million, including a $12.6 million decrease in the loss related to the planned divestiture of our European Surface Transportation business and $9.5 million of other restructuring charges, primarily related to reducing our facilities footprint.\nExcluding these, SG&A expenses were $149.6 million, down $2.7 million year-over-year with the expense reduction across several expense categories. Turning to our 2025 annual operating expense guidance, we expect our personnel expenses to be $1.375 billion to $1.475 billion. This includes some headcount decline including those related to the planned divestiture of our Europe Surface Transportation business and driven by continued productivity improvements, partially offset by investments in our team. as we reward the talented people that fuel our progress.\nWe expect 2025 SG&A expenses to be $575 million to $625 million, including depreciation and amortization of $95 million to $105 million. Although most of our SG&A expenses are subject to inflation, we expect continued cost improvements to partially offset the inflationary impact. Shifting back to Q4. Our effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding the tax impact of restructuring charges, was 12.4%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 18.7%. We expect our 2025 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20%. Our capital expenditures in Q4 were $15.2 million, bringing our 2024 total to $74.3 million. For 2025, we expect capital expenditures to be $75 million to $85 million.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we ended Q4 with approximately $1.2 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.04 billion of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $146 million. Our financial strength continues to be a key differentiator in our industry as it enables us to continue investing and improving our capabilities. Our debt balance at the end of Q4 was $1.38 billion, and our net debt to EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.61x, down from 2.08x at the end of Q3. This was primarily driven by the improved performance of the business, and the resulting increase in our trailing 12-month EBITDA as well as a decrease in our net debt balance.\nOverall, Our Q4 financial results are a testament to our disciplined execution and our focus on profitable growth, and I am optimistic about our runway for further improvement. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave for his final comments.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Damon. As I reflect on the noteworthy progress that we made in 2024, I'd like to thank the Robinson team for all the work they've put in to get to this point. I don't take their efforts and dedication for granted, and I commend them for helping us get more fit, fast and focused and for embracing the discipline that the new operating model demands. Our improved execution at the bottom of the freight cycle is delivering improved financial performance. We're making better and faster decisions on capturing the right freight at the right price to deliver a higher quality of volume.\nI believe the disciplines and practices that we have implemented at Robinson can endure through a prolonged freight recession through a market inflection and through any part of the freight cycle.\nAs I've mentioned during the past year and at our Investor Day in December, all the changes we're making are aimed at our North Star of generating incremental operating income by focusing on growing market share and expanding our gross and operating margins. We expect to continue growing market share by reclaiming share in targeted segments and by leveraging our robust capabilities to power value-added services and solutions for our customers and carriers that drive new volume to our 4 core modes and expand our addressable market.\nWe're optimizing our gross profit by monitoring key input metrics and responding faster to [ aerostats ] and changing market conditions with countermeasures and innovative technology that improves our execution such as our dynamic costing and pricing tools and our digital brokerage capabilities. And we're improving our operating leverage and operating income margins by embedding lean practices, removing waste and expanding our digital capabilities, such as leading the logistics industry on implementation of the game-changing capabilities of Gen AI.\nWe are arming our people with better tools and moving with greater clock speed and urgency to seize opportunities and solve problems in order to win now and to be ready for the eventual freight market rebound. On my first earnings call in August of 2023, I said that I look forward to leading this great company to new heights and sharing our progress with all of you along our journey. While there's still more grass to cut, I believe we're on the right path, and I'm pleased with the progress we've made on evolving our strategy and improving our execution by instilling discipline with our new operating model.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to the operator now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 31, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer; Michael Castagnetto, our President of North American Surface Transportation; Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer; and Damon Lee, our Incoming Chief Financial Officer.\nI'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com.\nOur prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we'll let you know which slide we're referencing.\nToday's remarks also contain certain non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are included in the presentation.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Having been in this seat for a little over a year now, I'm pleased with the progress we've made on involving our strategy. improving our execution and evaluating and enhancing the company's 4 Ps: people, products, processes and portfolio. We've brought in some new leaders, and we're arming our people with better tools to execute on our profitable growth strategies.\nWe're delivering innovative products to provide greater value to our customers and carriers. We're streamlining our processes, applying lean principles and leveraging generative AI to drive by waste and optimize our cost, and we're making changes to drive focus on the 4 core modes in our portfolio. All of these changes are aimed at our North Star of generating incremental operating income and delivering higher highs and higher lows over the course of freight market cycles.\nOur second quarter results reflect a higher quality of execution and performance as we continue to implement the new Robinson operating model. And although we continue to fight through an elongated freight recession, we are winning and executing better at this point in the cycle.\nOur people are delivering exceptional service and enhanced digital experience and differentiated value for our customers and carriers, and I thank the team for their efforts.\nOur truckload business grew market share for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we took share the right way, with margin improvement in mind. And our adjusted income from operations increased 32% year-over-year for the full enterprise.\nOn our first quarter earnings call, I discussed that we have begun deploying a new operating model that is rooted in lean methodology to improve the level and consistency of our operational execution. Today, I would like to share more about how the Robinson operating model is coming to life, which would hopefully help investors understand how things are evolving.\nThe Robinson operating model starts with an enterprise strategy map that lays out the key strategies that we need to execute on to drive profitable growth and improve the operating income of the business. Growth in operating income will come from margin expansion by improving our cost structure and operating leverage and for market share gains by igniting profitable growth in targeted market segments in industry verticals.\nOur enterprise strategy map converts to a balanced scorecard for the enterprise and cascades down to strategy maps and scorecards for each division and for the functional support areas. These scorecards include the key metrics to each area of the business needs to deliver on and be accountable to. As examples, these metrics may be related to driving growth, meeting customer expectations, optimizing AGP, optimizing cost, managing our talent or improving our cash conversion cycle. Through a regular cadence of operating reviews on at least a monthly basis, but in some cases, weekly or even daily, scorecard metrics are reviewed, and there's a binary view of whether they are on track. The metrics are green if they're on track and red if they're not on track. There is no yellow. We're coaching our people to embrace and attack the red with countermeasures or action plans to solve problems faster, which is driving improvements in execution. This may show up in improvements such as more disciplined pricing, better decisions on the volume that we're seeking or how we're servicing our customers and carriers.\nThese operating reviews are to prosecute the problem and not the person as we want our people to embrace the red as an opportunity for improvement.\nSince we began implementing the new operating model in Q1, we're getting better at being vocally self-critical in driving transparency and accountability. And we've been able to shine a light on some arrostates that negatively contributed to our results. We're also getting better at making decisions faster and taking quick action on countermeasures to correct those error space and improve our performance. We are still early in our journey but the operating model is helping us execute a solid strategy even better, and we expect further improvement as we continue to cascade the new operating model deeper into the organization, and as our team continues to embrace it and build operational muscle.\nI know from my past experiences of implementing lean operating models that improvement isn't always linear, and we still have a lot of grass to cut. I'm confident in the team's willingness and ability to drive a higher level of discipline in our operational execution.\nAs the global and North American freight markets fluctuate due to seasonal, cyclical and geopolitical factors, we remain focused on what we can control, including deploying our new operating model providing best-in-class service to our customers and carriers, gaining profitable share in targeted market segments and delivering tools that enable our customer and carrier-facing employees to allocate their time to relationship building and value-added solutioning.\nOur continued focus on productivity improvements is one part of our plan to address and optimize our enterprise-wide structural costs. We continue to eliminate or automate certain tasks to enable our teams to handle more volume. In 2024, we expect these initiatives will help drive a 15% increase in shipments per person per day in NAST and a 10% increase in Global 40, both of which would result and compounded productivity improvements of 32% or better over '23 and '24 combined.\nWe also took an important step yesterday on our journey to get fit, fast and focus when we announced that we've reached an agreement to sell our European Surface Transportation business. This move is consistent with our strategy to drive focus on profitable growth in our 4 core modes of North American truckload and LTL, in global ocean and air. Growth needs to be highly scalable within our model to create the most value for our stakeholders. As such, our Global Forwarding and managed services businesses in Europe will continue to execute on the breadth of global services that we provide to customers and that feed our core moats. With ongoing efforts to improve the customer experience and our cost to serve, we continue to focus on ensuring that we'll be ready for the eventual freight market rebound, with a disciplined operating model that decouples headcount growth from volume growth and drives operating leverage.\nI'm also excited about the changes that we've made on my senior leadership team. Being able to attract Damion Lee as our new CFO is a big win for Robinson, with this proven track record of financial discipline while delivering results as an operational leader and a strategist with a lean and continuous improvement mindset. I look forward to Damion's contributions to our strategy and execution. I'm also greatly appreciative that Mike Zechmeister graciously agreed to extend his time with us to facilitate a seamless transition for C.H. Robinson and for Damion. I thank Mike for his 5 years of service and dedication to Robinson, and wish him the best in his upcoming retirement.\nWe also recently announced that Arun Rajan, transition from the role of COO to a new role of Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. This change enables Arun and his team to focus their continued efforts on building our digital and operational capabilities and uphold tight alignment between our business teams and our digital investments. We're at a pivotal point as a company. And with a single threaded leader at the helm of strategy and innovation, we can accelerate efforts already underway to bring industry-leading products, technology, solutions and ways of working to our company and the global logistics marketplace.\nWorking closely with the senior leadership team, Arun will oversee our enterprise strategy and innovation process from creation to implementation and measure our performance against our strategic goals. I have high expectations for how this new role will benefit Robinson and all our stakeholders as we continue our transformation.\nAnd finally, it's been great to have Michael Castagnetto, leading and driving further improvement in our NAST business. He has a proven record of building strong relationships with our people and our customers, driving operational excellence and delivering exceptional results. Michael has joined us on today's call, and I'll turn it over to him now to provide more details on our NAST results.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. It has been extremely energizing to be leading the NAST organization and working with our talented and dedicated team members who are committed to delivering the best solutions and service to our customers and carriers every day. While we're still in the early stages of implementing and adopting the new Robinson operating model, I am convinced that this approach is just what we need. Our discipline execution and accountability has improved more than any other time in my previous 26 years at Robinson and 2 years in NAST. If it feels different, that's because it is, and it's showing up in our results.\nSupported by our new operating model, with our product and tech teams delivering new innovative tools like our recently announced digital matching product, our resilient team of freight experts is responding to the challenging freight environment. And we are reacting quicker and more effectively to provide solutions to our customers and carriers. As a result, our Q2 NAST truckload volume increased approximately 1.5% sequentially and year-over-year. which outpaced the market indices for the fourth quarter in a row.\nWithin Q2, we saw some seasonal volume strength in June, primarily related to produce season. But overall, seasonality was muted in Q2, as shown in the cash freight shipment index increasing only 0.2% sequentially versus the 10-year average of a 6.1% sequential increase, excluding the pandemic year of 2020.\nLooking ahead to Q3, the 10-year average of the cash freight shipment index, excluding the pandemic impacted year of 2020, is a 0.4% sequential decline from Q2 to Q3. At this point, it's hard to say whether the muted seasonality that we saw in Q2 will continue into Q3.\nFrom a market balance perspective, we continue to be in a drawn out stage of capacity oversupply. Although carrier attrition is occurring, it remains at a slower pace and not enough to materially impact the overall market. Load to truck ratios did increase in June and put upward pressure on spot rates, but it was largely regional and related to produce volumes in the southern half of the U.S. In July, however, dry van load-to-truck ratios have retreated to the levels seen in April and May.\nIn Q2, we delivered further optimization of volume and adjusted gross profit per truckload, which increased 6.5% sequentially and year-over-year. The improvement compared to Q2 of last year was driven by improved pricing discipline and revenue management. That led to better AGP yield within our transactional truckload business as our procurement teams, combined with the intentional usage of digital brokerage capabilities, delivered a cost of higher advantage versus the market average.\nThese practices are part of our operating structures that are integrated into our operating model and ladder up to the NAST divisional scorecard and ultimately into the enterprise scorecard.\nIn our LTL business, Q1 shipments were also up 1.5% on a year-over-year basis and 3.5% sequentially, driven primarily by strength in our retail consolidation service offering. By leveraging our vast access to capacity, broad range of services and our high level of service, our LTL team continues to onboard a solid pipeline of new business and build on our existing $3 billion LTL business.\nThe strength and unmatched expertise of our people enables us to deliver exceptional service and greater value to our customers. We are investing in our sales organization to maximize our growth opportunities. As an example of the operating model at work, we took actions recently to streamline our sales process and reorganize our sales teams. And the result has been a more effective and quicker engagement with our customers and a greater opportunity for our more experienced salespeople to engage with the right customers.\nWe've made net additions to and are actively growing our sales team in line with a disciplined and focused approach to capture growth opportunities in targeted customer segments. Our people are the single greatest differentiator for us versus the competition, and we are going to continue to lean into this. We may have gotten the balance of people versus tech wrong at certain points in our past, but we've learned and we are getting it right now. We will keep evaluating our results and adjust accordingly going forward.\nFrom upskilling our people to providing upward mobility and new opportunities, we will continue to lead with our people first. We will support our people with industry-leading tech and solutions to enhance their capabilities as we continue to focus on people, process and technology.\nI'll turn it over to Arun now to provide an update on the innovation we're delivering to strengthen our customer and carrier experience, increase AGP yield and improve operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Michael, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited about my recent transition into the role of Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer. I'm proud of the team's accomplishments over the past couple of years to build a solid foundation for our digital and operational strategy. Since I joined the organization in the fall of 2021, we have taken a surgical data-driven approach to technology investments to accelerate our digital transformation and deliver financial outcomes. These efforts have now matured into digitally-oriented operating structures that power core parts of our business, such as digital brokerage, revenue management and operational excellence teams.\nThe success of these collective efforts has enabled us to transition some of these digitally-oriented operating structures into our core operations, thereby enabling me to shift my focus to accelerating actions in support of our broader enterprise strategy and innovation to drive profitable growth.\nStrategy process is not static. Leveraging our operating model, we will diligently monitor execution towards strategic outcomes and the constantly evolving external landscape to take advantage of opportunities to accelerate our strategy as we expand our leadership position in the logistics industry.\nInnovation is at the heart of Robinson's competitive differentiation. We are leading and innovating at scale on our processes and our products for the benefit of both sides of our 2-sided marketplace, in alignment with our strategy to drive profitable market share growth. As an example, on the carrier side, we've launched an enhanced load matching platform for carriers called Digital Dispatch. This innovative tool utilizes advanced algorithms to match carriers with loads that best fit their needs and provides real-time customized load recommendations like the carriers phones via text or e-mail.\nIn addition to enabling carriers to run fewer empty miles, Digital Dispatch books loads 4x faster than traditional methods on average, transforming hours spent searching into valuable hauling time. Digital dispatch first became available in February to carriers that own 1 to 10 trucks, and we have plans to expand it to larger carriers in the future. For Robinson, we expect this innovative tool to help with the acquisition, retention and growth of our carrier base, and therefore, provide greater access to capacity for our customers, especially when the market turns.\nOn the customer side of the marketplace, we continue to innovate and leverage Gen AI to respond faster than ever to dynamic market conditions with the tools and capabilities we've developed. Last quarter, we shared the example of using Gen AI to automatically respond to transactional truckload quote e-mails, which drives faster speed to market, increases our addressable demand and reduces manual touches. Another touch point where we're leading is using Gen AI to translate order e-mails and generate on system orders. With Gen AI, we've been able to reduce the time to generate an order by more than 80%, and thereby enabling us to provide faster service to customers and to effectively scale our operations when the market returns to growth.\nIn addition to improving the customer and carrier experience, innovations such as Digital Dispatch and products that leverage the power of Gen AI are designed to improve the employee experience and improve productivity. These productivity improvements serve as a critical input into creating operating leverage.\nWe also continue to increase the rigor and discipline in our pricing and procurement efforts in Q2, resulting in improved HEP yield across the NAST and Global Forwarding portfolios. With continued innovation and dynamic pricing and costing, investment in contract management systems and increasing revenue management rigor, we are responding surgically and faster than ever to dynamic market conditions.\nFinally, as Michael mentioned, we believe we are getting the balance of people versus tech right. Getting this balance right includes the active role that our people play from a human in the loop perspective to drive continuous feedback and improvements to our algorithms and Gen AI implementations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a review of our second quarter results.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nChief Financial Officer, United Natural Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. Disciplined revenue management in the face of continued soft freight market conditions resulted in second quarter total revenues of $4.5 billion and adjusted gross profit, or AGP, of $687 million, which was up 3% year-over-year, driven by a 5% increase in NAST and a 3% increase in Global Forwarding.\nOn a monthly basis, compared to Q2 of last year, our total company AGP per business day was down 5% in April, up 1% in May and up 15% in June. Overall, Q2 AGP results reflect progress on the revenue management initiatives that were referenced earlier.\nThe AGP per business day improvement through the quarter also reflects both seasonal increases in freight demand and easier year-over-year comparisons as the quarter progressed.\nMichael covered the details of our Q2 NAST performance. I'll cover the performance of our Global Forwarding business, where the team has had success growing the business profitably and been highly engaged with our customers to help them navigate the ongoing conflicts in the Red Sea. The transit interruptions in the Red Sea have resulted in vessel reroutings that have extended transit times. In Q2, this put a strain on global ocean capacity and created varying levels of port congestion and container shortages. While the Asia to Europe trade lane has been most affected, the impact has also extended to other trade lanes as carriers adjust the geographic placement of vessel capacity based on shipping demand.\nAs we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, ocean rates had come down from the February peak as capacity was repositioned and new vessel capacity entered the market. In May and June, however, ocean rates rose again as capacity tightened. Given our mix of contractual and transactional business, the impact of changing market rates generally takes 1 to 2 months to flow through to our profit per shipment. So even though rates came down from the February peak, our profit per shipment held up through March and into April as we started realizing the declines in May and the first half of June. When the ocean markets rose in May and June, our same 1- to 2-month lag meant we started realizing the positive impact to our profit per shipment in the second half of June and now into July.\nWhile the Red Sea disruption continues without any clear time line of when it will be resolved, ocean rates have declined slightly in July, but remained elevated compared to 2023.\nOur team performed well in Q2 with our ocean forwarding AGP increasing 8.6% year-over-year, driven by a 4% increase in shipments and a 4.5% increase in AGP per shipment. Sequentially, shipments increased 6%, while AGP per shipment declined 2.5%. There are some indications that customers may be pulling forward some of their peak season ocean freight due to ongoing concerns about geopolitical issues and capacity disruptions as well as the potential for labor issues on the East Coast ports of the United States.\nOne measure of this is that our ocean volume per business day grew 8% sequentially in June versus May compared to a 2% sequential decline over the same period last year. Time will tell as to whether this pulls from the normal July to September peak season in ocean.\nTurning now to enterprise expenses, Q2 personnel expenses was $361.2 million, including $9.4 million of restructuring charges related to workforce reductions. Excluding restructuring charges this year and last year, our Q2 personnel expenses were $351.8 million, down $12.4 million or 3.4% year-over-year, driven by our continued productivity efforts and partially offset by higher incentive compensation.\nOur average Q2 headcount was down 10% compared to Q2 last year.\nWe continue to expect our 2024 personnel expenses to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, excluding restructuring, but likely below the midpoint of that range. With that, we expect a slower pace of net headcount reductions in the second half of 2024 compared to the first half.\nMoving to SG&A. Q2 expenses were $148.1 million, including $5.7 million of restructuring charges, which were driven by reducing our office footprint. Excluding restructuring charges this year and last year, SG&A expenses were $142.4 million, down $12.2 million or 7.9% year-over-year. The expense reduction was across several expense categories as we continue to eliminate nonvalue-added spending.\nWe continue to expect SG&A expenses for the full year to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, excluding restructuring charges, but likely below the midpoint of that range, too. SG&A includes depreciation and amortization expense, which we still expect to be $90 million to $100 million in 2024.\nOur effective tax rate in Q2 was 19.4% compared to 14.9% in Q2 last year and was in line with our expectations. We continue to expect our 2024 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%.\nIn Q2, our capital expenditures were $19.3 million, down 20.6% year-over-year on more focused technology spending. We now expect 2024 capital expenditures to be toward the lower end of the previously provided range of $85 million to $95 million.\nNow on to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with approximately $925 million of liquidity, comprised of $812 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $113 million.\nOne key differentiator for Robinson is our financial strength. This allows us to continue investing in improving our capabilities even through this prolonged freight recession. As a result, we expect to emerge stronger when the market tightens.\nOur debt balance at the end of Q2 was $1.6 billion, which was down $127 million from Q2 of last year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q2 was 2.4x, down from 2.73x at the end of Q1, primarily driven by the performance of the business and the resulting decrease in our net debt balance and increase in our trailing 12-month EBITDA.\nAs I depart Robinson for retirement, I'd just like to add that I couldn't be more proud of the accomplishments of the team, and I couldn't be more excited about the direction of the company. It feels terrific to be leaving the company in such great hands with a sound strategy and solid momentum on the business. From the deployment of the new operating model to the growth potential from the market segment and vertical focus to the incredible upside of generative AI to enhance the capabilities of our industry-leading people, the future looks incredibly bright. I will miss working with the best logistics experts in the business, but will be cheering for Robinson as a shareholder. Best wishes to the entire Robinson team.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Damon for a few comments.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm excited about joining C.H. Robinson and partnering with the rest of the senior leadership team as we execute on a strong strategic plan. I'm eager to leverage my past experiences and a focus on operational excellence to drive improved results and deliver more value for Robinson shareholders.\nI'd also like to reiterate Dave's comments and thank Mike Zechmeister for his collaboration and partnership to ensure a seamless transition. The first 3 weeks of my tenure have been great, and I look forward to talking with all of you as we continue on this exciting journey.\nI'll turn the call back to Dave now for his final comments. Dave?\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Damon. I want to commend our people for continuing to embrace the changes that we're making to deliver a higher and more consistent level of performance and for the high-quality Q2 results that they delivered and what continues to be a challenging market.\nAs I mentioned earlier, all the changes that we're making are aimed at our North Star of generating incremental operating income and delivering higher highs and higher lows over the course of freight market cycles. We will do this by focusing on 2 main fronts: growing market share and expanding our operating income margins. We'll continue to grow market share by leveraging our robust capabilities to power vertical-centric solutions by reclaiming share in targeted segments and by expanding our addressable market through value-added services and solutions for our customers and carriers that drive new volume to our 4 core modes.\nWe'll also be more intentional with our go-to-market strategy to drive additional synergies and cross-selling across our portfolio. We'll expand our operating income margins by embedding lean practices, removing waste and expanding our digital capabilities. This will enable us to strengthen our productivity and optimize our organization structure in order to be the most efficient operator in addition to the highest value provider.\nWe'll optimize our gross profit by monitoring key input metrics and responding faster to aerostats and changing market conditions with countermeasures and innovative technology that improves our execution.\nAs we take action on all of these fronts, I'm excited about the work that we're doing to reinvigorate Robinson's winning culture and to instill discipline with our new operating model. We are moving with greater clock speed and urgency to seize opportunities and solve problems in order to win now and to be ready for the eventual freight market rebound. And we now have a plan to share more about our strategy, how we'll execute that strategy, and the [indiscernible] financial targets at a 2024 Investor Day that is scheduled for December 12 in New York City. While there is a lot more work to do, I continue to see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth, further reducing our structural costs, and improving our efficiency, operating margins and profitability.\nTogether, we will win for our customers, carriers, employees and shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, May 1, 2024.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.

On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation list factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides.

Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter results and adjusted EPS of $0.86 reflects a change in our execution and discipline as we began implementing a new lean-based operating model.\nAnd although we continue to battle through an elongated freight recession with an oversupply of capacity, I'm optimistic about our ability to continue improving our execution regardless of the market environment. As part of my initial diagnosis of the company, I identified an opportunity to refocus our mindset on root causing and definitively solving problems, including making decisions amid uncertainty and acting with greater clock speed.\nFollowing my diagnosis, I brought in additional talent to assist the senior leadership team and me on improving operational execution across the business and to deploy a new operating model that is rooted in Lean methodology.\nIn Q1, we began deploying the new model at the enterprise, divisional and shared service levels, which is evolving our execution and accountability by bringing more structure to our continuous improvement cadence and culture. This new way of operating is starting to enable greater discipline, transparency, urgency and consistency in our decision-making based on data and input metrics that can reliably lead to better outputs.\nIt's also setting the tone of how we operate and hold ourselves accountable, helping us make systemic improvements, build operational muscle and drive value at speed. We began to see the benefits of our new operating model in our Q1 execution. As a result of disciplined pricing and capacity procurement efforts, we executed better across our contractual and transactional portfolios in our NAST business in Q1 and in particular, in our truckload business.\nThis resulted in improved optimization of volume and adjusted gross profit per truckload, which improved sequentially despite an increase in our linehaul cost per mile for the full quarter versus Q4.\nAdditionally, our truckload volume reflects growing market share, and we outpaced the market indices for the third quarter in a row. And what continues to be a difficult environment, our resilient team of freight Experts is responding to the challenge and embracing the new operating model and the innovative tools that we continue to arm them with.\nOur people have a powerful desire to win, and I thank them for their tireless efforts. They continue to be a differentiator for us and for our customers and carriers, and I'm confident in the team's willingness and ability to drive a higher level of discipline in our operational execution. We're moving in the right direction. And at the same time, everyone understands that we have more work to do.\nNow I'll provide some details on our Q1 results in our NAST and Global Forwarding businesses. In our NAST truckload business, our Q1 volume declined approximately 0.5% year-over-year, which outpaced the market indices. Our truckload AGP per load improved as we moved through the quarter.\nAnd although spot costs within the market came down after the winter storms in January, our new operating model and improved pricing discipline led to better AGP yield within both our committed and transactional business, while our procurement teams improved our cost of higher more than the market average.\nWe had an approximate mix of 65% contractual volume and 35% transactional volume in our truckload business compared to the same mix in Q4 and a 70-30 mix in Q1 last year. In our LTL business, Q1 shipments were up 3% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially on a per business day basis. AGP per order declined 1% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by lower fuel prices.\nOur LTL AGP per order improved within the quarter and also benefited from our pricing discipline and the new operating model that I mentioned earlier.\nIn our Global Forwarding business, we've been highly engaged with our customers to help them navigate the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea and to ensure flexibility and resilience in their supply chain. The transit interruptions in the Red Sea and resulting vessel reroutings have extended transit times, which has reduced global ocean capacity.\nWhile the Asia to Europe trade line has been most affected, the impact has also extended to other lanes as carriers adjust routes based on shipping demand. As a result, ocean rates increased sharply in Q1 on several trade lines, including Asia to Europe and Asia to North America.\nWhile the red sea disruption continues without any clear time line of when it will be resolved, ocean rates have come down from the February peak as capacity has been repositioned and new vessel capacity enters the market.\nWhile rates remain elevated compared to 2023. As a global logistics provider, with the scale and expertise to strategize and implement contingency plans, we have grown our ocean market share by providing differentiated solutions and customer service and by leveraging investments in technology and talent, leading to the addition of new customers and diversification of the verticals and trade lines that we serve.\nIn Q1, our ocean forwarding AGP increased by 2.5% year-over-year, driven by a 7% increase in shipments and partially offset by a 4% decrease in AGP per shipment. Sequentially, AGP per shipment increased 13.5%.\nAs the Global and North American freight markets fluctuate due to seasonal, cyclical and geopolitical factors, we remain focused on what we can control, including deploying our new operating model, providing best-in-class service to our customers and carriers, gaining profitable share in targeted market segments, reducing complexity in the organization and optimizing our structural costs, streamlining our processes by removing waste and manual touches and delivering tools that enable our customer and carrier-facing employees to allocate their time to relationship building, value-added solutioning and exception management.\nOur continued focus on productivity improvements is one part of our plan to address and optimize our enterprise-wide structural cost. After exceeding our productivity targets in 2023, with 17% improvement in NAST and 20% improvement in Global Forwarding, we have carried our productivity momentum into 2024.\nWe are on track to hit our 2024 target of an additional 15% improvement in NAST shipments per person per day, an additional 10% improvement in Global Forwarding shipments per person per month, both of which will result in compounded productivity improvements of 32% or better over '23 and '24 combined.\nOur commitment to deliver quality value and continuous improvements to our customers continues to be validated by high Net Promoter Scores. Over the past 4 quarters, these scores have been higher than any point over the past few years and higher than the last similar point in the cycle, which we believe has contributed to our market share gains and puts us in good position with customers ahead of the eventual rebound in [ fit ] market.\nOur customers continue to value the quality innovation and reliability that we provide as they work to optimize their transportation needs. They want a partner who has financial strength and the ability to consistently invest through cycles in the customer experience. They also want a customer-centric partner who can meet their increasingly complex logistics needs by providing expertise and our breadth of innovative solutions, enabled by technology and people that they can rely on to serve as an extension of their team.\nC.H. Robinson is that partner. With a combination of people, technology and scale to deliver an exceptional customer experience and with the breadth of capabilities to meet all their logistics needs, including value-added solutions for cross-border freight, drop trailer capacity and retail consolidation.\nWe deliver integrated global solutions with no equal as evidenced in how we are helping our customers navigate disruptions in the Red Sea and restrictions on transit via the Panama Canal as well as supporting their growth in cross-border trade between the U.S. and Mexico.\nAs we continue to improve the customer experience and our cost to serve, I'm focused on ensuring that we'll be ready for the eventual freight market rebound with a disciplined operating model that decouples volume growth from head count growth and drives operating leverage.\nOur commitment to continuously improving the experience of our customers and carriers and eliminating inefficiencies from our processes will make us a company that is faster, more flexible and more effective in solving problems for our customers, delivering better customer service and creating operating leverage and profitable growth.\nI'll turn it over to Arun now to provide more details on our efforts to strengthen our customer and carrier experience, increase AGP yield and improve operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, we increased the rigor and discipline in our pricing and procurement efforts in Q1, resulting in improved AGP yield across the contractual and transactional portfolios in our NAST business.\nWith continued investment in our pricing science, contract management and digital brokerage technology and deployment of our new operating model, we are responding faster than ever to dynamic market conditions with the tools and capabilities we've developed.\nThese tools and operating routines together with our scale, data and customer and carrier relationships underpin our revenue management function through which we can be more surgical in how we implement the disciplined pricing and profitable growth strategy based on individual customer value propositions.\nWe also continue to make progress in Q1 on concurrent work streams that are improving the customer and carrier experience and delivering process optimization by eliminating productivity bottlenecks.\nOne of those work streams is aimed at using generative AI to automatically respond to transactional truckload quote e-mails to drive faster speed to market, increase our addressable demand and reduce manual touches.\nResponding to transaction with truckload quote requests is time consuming for account teams, and we must respond quickly to be competitive. Through our automated process and utilizing our Gen AI technology, more than 2,000 truckload customers are getting the benefit of faster response time with our automated e-mail quotes. And we will continue to scale this technology to cover more customers and other modes.\nGen AI puts the power of large language models into the hands of our frontline teams, with more data and history to leverage than any other 3PL, we have opportunities to harness the power that generative AI now offer us to further capitalize on our information advantage and we'll continue to look for and pursue those opportunities.\nIn addition to an improved customer experience, our efforts are increasing the digital execution of critical touch points in the life cycle of an order. From quote to cash, thereby reducing the number of manual tasks per shipment and the time per task. This translates to productivity improvements measured in terms of shipments per person per day, which creates operating leverage.\nAs we deliver further process optimization and an improved customer experience, we plan to deliver the [indiscernible] cost structure benefits of additional 2024 productivity improvements of 15% NAST and 10% in Global Forwarding, with technology that supports our people and processes.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a review of our first quarter results.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nChief Financial Officer, United Natural Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. The continued soft freight market conditions outlined by day resulted in first quarter total revenues of $4.4 billion in adjusted gross profit, or AGP, of $658 million, which was down 4% year-over-year, driven by a 7% decline in NAST and partially offset by a 1% increase in Global Forwarding.\nOn a monthly basis compared to Q1 of last year, our total AGP per business day was down 16% in January, down 3% in February and up 7% in March, reflecting market conditions and improved execution, driven by the rollout of our new operating model. The new operating model will help simplify decision-making for our teams by focusing on what matters most and helping to ensure clear accountability around delivering results.\nTurning to expenses. Q1 personnel expenses were $379.1 million, including $7.9 million of restructuring charges related to workforce reductions. Excluding restructuring charges this year and last year, our Q1 personnel expenses were $371.1 million, down $8.4 million or 2.2% year-over-year driven by our cost optimization efforts and partially offset by expected higher incentive compensation.\nOur average Q1 head count was down 11.3% compared to Q1 last year, and our ending head count was down 10.2% to 14,734. We continue to expect our 2024 personnel expenses to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, excluding restructuring charges, with productivity initiatives and lower head count offsetting increases driven by the restoration of target incentive compensation related to the expected improvement in our financial performance.\nWe continue to eliminate nonvalue-added tasks to enable our teams to handle more volume. We expect these initiatives will help drive a 15% increase in shipments per person per day in NAST and a 10% increase in Global Forwarding, which comes on top of improvements last year of 17% in NAST and 20% in Global Forwarding that Dave in a room referenced earlier.\nMoving to SG&A. Q1 expenses were $151.5 million including $5 million of restructuring charges, driven by the impairment of certain internally developed software as we focus the efforts of our product and technology teams on the strategic initiatives that best accelerate the capabilities of our teams.\nExcluding restructuring charges this year and last year, SG&A expenses were $146.5 million, up $5.1 million or 3.6% year-over-year primarily due to a nonrecurring benefit in Q1 last year related to our credit loss reserve.\nWe continue to expect SG&A expenses for the full year to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, excluding restructuring charges, with cost reduction efforts offsetting expected inflation. SG&A includes depreciation and amortization expense, where we continue to expect $90 million to $100 million in 2024.\nShifting to expenses below operating income. Our Q1 interest and other expense totaled $16.8 million, which was down $11.5 million year-over-year. This included $22.1 million of interest expense, which was down $1.5 million versus Q1 last year, driven by the $307 million year-over-year reduction in our average debt balance.\nAnother factor that drove Q1 results in other was a $3.9 million gain on foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, which compared to the $9.6 million loss in Q1 of last year. As a reminder, our FX impacts are predominantly noncash gains and losses related to intercompany assets and liabilities.\nOur effective tax rate in Q1 was 15.8% compared to 13.5% in Q1 last year. As a reminder, our tax rate is typically lower in the first quarter of the year due to the incremental tax benefits from stock-based compensation deliveries in Q1. We continue to expect our 2024 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%.\nOur Q1 adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.86 excluded $12.9 million of restructuring charges and the $3.1 million tax provision benefit related to those restructuring charges.\nTurning to cash flow. Q1 cash flow used by operations was $33 million compared to $255 million generated in Q1 of last year. The year-over-year decline in cash flow was primarily driven by changes in net operating working capital.\nIn Q1 of last year, we had a cash inflow of $235 million from a sequential decrease in net operating working capital driven by the declining cost and price of purchased transportation in the market at that time.\nIn Q1 of this year, we had a cash outflow of $135 million from a sequential increase in net operating working capital, driven primarily by higher ocean rates in Global Forwarding. In Q1, our capital expenditures were $22.5 million, down 16.6% on more focused technology spending. We continue to expect 2024 capital expenditures to be $85 million to $95 million. We also returned $91 million of cash to shareholders in Q1, primarily through dividends.\nNow on to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with approximately $842 million of liquidity comprised of $720 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $122 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q1 was $1.7 billion, which was down $172 million from Q1 last year, but up $120 million from the end of Q4 due to the increase in net operating working capital that I mentioned earlier.\nOur net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q1 was 2.73x up from 2.34x at the end of Q4, primarily driven by the sequential increase in our net debt balance. Our capital allocation strategy remains grounded in maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital.\nOverall, I'm encouraged by our improved execution, the deployment of the new operating model, opportunities for continued market share gains and the plans in place to deliver the compounded benefits of continued productivity improvements in 2024.\nImproved growth in cost savings are expected to continue from the robust pipeline of process simplification, technology enablers and waste elimination initiatives. Continuing to leverage AI to take the capability of our people to an even higher level positions Robinson well to further reduce waste and drive structural cost changes that improve our operating leverage and help deliver on the long-term operating income margin expectations that are imperative to the success of the business.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his final comments.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mike. I want to commend our people for their performance and what continues to be a challenging market. I believe our team of logistics experts are the best in the business, and they continue to embrace the innovative technology that is acting as a force multiplier and making the industry's best people even better.\nI'm excited about the work that we're doing to reinvigorate Robinson's winning culture and it's still disciplined with our new operating model. If what you're hearing about our execution sounds different, it's because it is.\nAs we continue to deploy our new operating model, we're now monitoring key input metrics and responding faster to air states and changing market conditions with countermeasures that improve our execution. As we continue to chart our path forward, we're on a mission to be fit, fast and focused in order to win now and to be ready for the eventual freight market rebound.\nWe'll get fit by embedding lean practices, removing waste and expanding our digital capabilities. This will enable us to strengthen our productivity and optimize our organization structure in order to be the most efficient operator in addition to the highest value provider and achieve our profitable growth objectives.\nAs our customers' logistics needs continue to become increasingly complex, we'll leverage our robust capabilities to power vertical-centric and value-added solutions. We'll move fast with greater clock speed and urgency to seize opportunities and solve problems for our customers and carriers. We will arm our team of experts with the right capabilities to bring us into the future, enabled by our innovative and cutting-edge technology.\nAnd we'll be focused on profitable growth in our 4 core modes, North American truckload and LTL and global, ocean and air as the engines to ignite growth. by continuing to reclaim share and expand our addressable market through value-added services and solutions that drive new volume to the core modes.\nAs we take action on all of these fronts, our journey to unlock the power of our portfolio is moving forward. I continue to see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth, further reducing our structural costs and improving our efficiency, operating margins and profitability.\nI'm confident that together, we will win for our customers, carriers, employees and shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, January 31, 2024.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone.\nOn the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer.\nDave and Mike will provide a summary of our fourth quarter results and our expense guidance for 2024. Arun will provide an update on our initiatives to improve the customer and carrier experience, improve operating leverage and increased focus on revenue management, and Dave will share the findings from his initial diagnosis of the company. From there, we will open the call up for questions.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing.\nToday's remarks also contain certain non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are included in the presentation. I'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation, risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nOur fourth quarter results did not meet our expectations, as we continue to battle through a poor demand and pricing environment, but we made progress on a number of important initiatives, including charging our path forward. But let me address our results first.\nOn our third quarter earnings call, we indicated that Q4 truck volumes in NAST could follow the normal seasonal pattern. And in fact, that is what occurred. Specifically, the average sequential Q4 decline in the cash freight shipment index over the past 10 years is 2.4%. Excluding the pandemic impacted years of 2020 and 2021, the average sequential Q4 decline was 3.7%.\nIn Q4 of 2023, the shipment index declined 4.3% sequentially, and our combined truckload and LTL shipments declined less than the index at 3.5%.\nIn Global Forwarding, we increased our ocean shipments on a year-over-year basis, but they were down sequentially as well, as they typically are in a fourth quarter.\nFor the enterprise in total, the sequential declines in volume drove a 3% sequential decline in our Q4 AGP versus Q3, and this equated to $0.11 of our sequential EPS decline.\nBelow gross profit, personnel and SG&A expenses were within the guidance ranges that we provided on our Q3 earnings call, although personnel expenses were towards the high end of our guidance range.\nSequentially, Q4 personnel expenses increased due to the reduction of our incentive compensation accruals in Q3 that we didn't expect to repeat in Q4, as was explained on our Q3 earnings call. SG&A expenses were down sequentially, but slightly above the midpoint of our guidance.\nIn total, the 3.7% sequential increase in our operating expenses equated to $0.13 of sequential EPS decline. The combination of all these changes in AGP and operating expenses, some of which were expected, drove the sequential decrease in operating income.\nBelow operating income, there were a couple of significant items that negatively impacted our financial results and ultimately drove the remaining $0.10 of sequential decline in our adjusted EPS, namely, noncash losses on foreign currency revaluation and a higher income tax rate. Later in the call, Mike will share more details on these as well as provide guidance on our 2024 operating expenses.\nSo that addresses why our Q4 results declined sequentially versus Q3. Now I'll provide some additional details on our Q4 results in our North American Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding businesses.\nIn our NAST truckload business, our Q4 volume declined approximately 1.5% year-over-year and 3.5% on a sequential basis. The weak demand environment in an elongated market trough, combined with excess carrier capacity, continued to result in a very competitive market. With the exception of the holiday weeks in Q4, the dry van load-to-truck ratio was around 2:1. And in the second half of the quarter, was the lowest the industry has seen in the past 6 years.\nWith this environment in play in Q4, we targeted more truckload volume in the spot market where we could capture more profit due to seasonal market tension. This led to a sequential improvement in our overall truckload AGP per load in October and November and for the quarter as a whole. Profit per load in December declined as expected, as the cost of purchased transportation move seasonally higher.\nFor the quarter, we had an approximate mix of 65% contractual volume and 35% transactional volume in our truckload business, compared to a 70-30 mix over the past 3 quarters. The sequential declines that we have seen in our truckload linehaul cost per mile since Q2 of 2022 continued through November of 2023 before moving seasonally higher in December.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we saw a decline of approximately 10.5% in our average Q4 truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges.\nDue to the usual time lag associated with the resetting of contract pricing to follow spot market cost, our average truckload linehaul rate or price billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, declined 13.5% on a year-over-year basis. With this price decline coming off a higher base than the cost, these changes resulted in a 29.5% year-over-year decrease in AGP per load.\nMoving into 2024, we will substantially increase our focus on revenue management objectives to better align revenue and cost in our contractual portfolio. Arun will share more on this in a little bit, but we intend to use our advanced pricing and contract management tools and a more surgical and disciplined approach as we navigate changing market conditions in the future, with a focus on profitable growth.\nIn our LTL business, Q4 shipments were down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis and 3.5% sequentially. AGP per order declined 8.5% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by the soft market conditions and lower fuel prices.\nOn a sequential basis, the cost and price of purchased transportation in the LTL market increased in Q4, primarily driven by the assets and capacity that has temporarily exited the LTL market. This resulted in a 3% sequential increase in AGP per order.\nIn our Global Forwarding business, results continue to be impacted by the imbalance of soft demand and ample capacity. In Q4, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by 17.2% year-over-year, driven by a 20.5% decrease in AGP per shipment that was partially offset by a 4% increase in shipments.\nCompared to prepandemic levels, we have grown ocean market share by providing differentiated solutions in customer service and by leveraging investments in technology and talent, leading to the addition of new customers and diversification of the verticals and trade lanes that we serve.\nIn the wake of the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal, global supply chains are facing transit interruptions and vessel rerouting, which is causing extended transit times and putting a strain on global ocean capacity.\nWhile the Asia-to-Europe trade lane has been most affected, the impact is extending to other lanes as carriers adjust routes based on shipping demand. As a result, ocean rates have increased sharply in Q1 on several trade lanes, including Asia to Europe and Asia to North America.\nWhile the Red Sea disruption continues without any clear time line of when it will be resolved, the strain on capacity and the elevated spot rates are expected to continue through at least the Chinese New Year.\nAs a global logistics provider, with the scale and expertise to strategize and implement contingency plans, we're highly engaged with our customers to help them navigate the evolving situation and ensure flexibility and resilience in their supply chain. At some point, we expect that ocean pricing will loosen as new vessel capacity continues to enter the market in 2024.\nLooking ahead, we do not see any indications of a global freight volume upturn in the immediate future. In that, similar to the fourth quarter, the first quarter is typically characterized by a sequential decrease in ground transportation volumes. In fact, the average sequential Q1 decline in the cash freight shipment index over the past 10 years was 2.6%.\nAs the mobile freight market fluctuates due to seasonal, cyclical and geopolitical factors, we remain focused on what we can control by providing superior service to our customers and carriers, streamlining our processes by removing waste and manual touches, and delivering tools that enable our customer and carrier-facing employees to allocate their time to relationship building, value-added solutioning and exception management.\nOur 17% improvement in NAST shipments per person per day in Q4 exceeded our stated 15% target, and is an indicator of the progress that we've made on removing waste and manual touches.\nThese efforts are also bearing fruit in other key areas of our business, as Global Forwarding achieved a 20% year-over-year improvement in their Q4 shipments per person per month. Our continued focus on productivity improvements is one part of our plan to address and optimize our enterprise-wide structural cost, and we expect to carry our productivity momentum into 2024.\nOur commitment to deliver quality and continuous improvement to our customers continues to be validated by Net Promoter Scores in 2023 that were the highest hold record for the company which we believe puts us in a good position with customers ahead of the eventual rebound in the freight market. Our customers continue to value the quality, stability and reliability that we provide as they work to optimize their transportation needs. They want a partner who has financial strength and the ability to invest through cycles in the customer experience.\nThey also want a partner who can meet their increasingly complex logistics needs, by providing expertise and a breadth of innovative solutions, enabled by technology and people that they can rely on to serve as an extension of their team. C.H. Robinson is that partner. With a combination of people, technology and scale to deliver an unmatched customer experience and with a breadth of capabilities to meet all their logistics needs, including value-added solutions for cross-border freight, drop trailer capacity and retail consolidation.\nAs we continue to improve the customer experience and our cost to serve, I'm focused on ensuring that we'll be ready for the eventual freight market rebound, with a durable cost structure that decouples volume growth from head count growth and drives operating leverage.\nIn order to further eliminate productivity bottlenecks in the highest leverage areas, we're focused on a handful of concurrent work streams that will deliver an improved customer experience through process optimization. These focused work streams are an example of how the leadership team and I have made changes to drive focus so that we position ourselves for growth in our core business.\nOur commitment to continuously improving the experience of our customers and carriers and eliminating inefficiencies from our processes will make us a company that is faster, more flexible and more agile in solving problems for our customers, delivering better customer service and creating operating leverage and profitable growth.\nI'll turn it over to Arun now to provide more details on our efforts to strengthen our customer and carrier experience, and our revenue management practices and improve our efficiency and operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Dave said, we continue to execute on a handful of concurrent work streams that are addressing significant opportunities to eliminate productivity bottlenecks and to deliver process optimization and an improved customer experience. Two of the work streams on the productivity road map are aimed at quoting and order entry.\nIn both areas, we are reducing manual touches and our response time to customers, driving faster speed to market and higher customer engagement.\nIn addition to our past learnings, we're leaning more heavily on generative AI to deliver process improvements. In our order entry work stream, we're utilizing gen AI to translate structured and unstructured e-mails, PDFs and Excel files that we received from customers and their vendors into orders on our system. This solution fills in customer-specific requirements based on their past history and customer-specific prompts and scenarios entered by frontline teams who know the customers' business. Gen AI puts the power of large language models into the hands of our frontline teams rather than relying solely on data scientists to train models for unique customer requirements.\nWhile our preference is still to receive an order via API or other structured electronic means, there is large variability in how customer orders are transmitted. And this new method allows customers to have an interaction as though we receive their order, we have structured electronic means even when they choose to e-mail an order to us.\nWith more data and history to leverage than any other 3PL, we have opportunities to harness the power that generative AI now offers to further capitalize on our information advantage and we'll continue to look for and pursue those opportunities.\nAnother area where we've advanced our capabilities is in touchless appointments, where we've introduced technology to automate the entire process. This technology also uses AI to determine the optimal appointment based on transit time data from our millions of shipments across 300,000 shipping lanes, facility data such as peak [indiscernible] time and the most convenient time windows for carriers. This advancement saves shippers a considerable amount of time, enables them to achieve higher service levels and saves them money by avoiding chargebacks or fines they might face, due to freight arriving too early or too late.\nIn addition to an improved customer experience, our efforts are increasing the digital execution of critical touch points in the life cycle of an order from quote to cash, thereby reducing the number of manual tasks per shipment and the time per task. This translates to productivity improvements measured in terms of shipments per person per day, which creates operating leverage.\nAs Dave mentioned earlier, we surpassed our 2020 goal of a 15% year-over-year improvement in NAST shipments per person per day, with 17% improvement achieved in Q4. As we deliver further process optimization and an improved customer experience, we plan to deliver the compounded cost structure benefits of additional 2024 productivity improvements of 15% in NAST and 10% in Global Forwarding, with technology that supports our people and processes.\nAs Dave also mentioned, revenue management is a key focus for us as we navigate this difficult freight market. With continued investment in our pricing science and contract management technology over the course of 2023, we're now in a better position to respond to dynamic market conditions with the tools and capabilities we've developed.\nIn 2024, we will increase our rigor and disciplines in the application of these tools and capabilities. These tools, together with our scale, data and customer and carrier relationships, underpin our revenue management function through which we can be more surgical in how we approach customer discussions and how we implement a disciplined pricing and profitable growth strategy based on individual customer value propositions.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a review of our fourth quarter results.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nChief Financial Officer, United Natural Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. The soft freight market, outlined by date, resulted in fourth quarter total revenues of $4.2 billion, and adjusted gross profit or AGP, of $618.6 million which was down 20% year-over-year, driven by a 24% decline in NAST, and a 14% decline in Global Forwarding.\nOn a monthly basis, compared to Q4 of 2022, our total company AGP per business day was down 24% in October, down 20% in November and down 13% in December.\nTurning to expenses. Q4 personnel expenses were $361.8 million, including a $1.3 million favorable restructuring charge adjustment, primarily driven by the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso prior to completing the divestiture of our global forwarding operations in Argentina.\nExcluding these reversals, our Q4 personnel expenses of $363.2 million were down 10.5% year-over-year, primarily due to our cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation.\nOur average Q4 head count was down 13.3% year-over-year, including double-digit decreases in NAST, Global Forwarding and our all other and corporate segments. Ending head count was down 12.4% year-over-year, to 15,246.\nAs Dave mentioned, the sequential increase in our Q4 personnel expenses was included in our guidance. Although Q4 personnel expenses were within our guidance range, they came in at the higher end due to the achievement of certain objective bonus targets, for example, delivering results on cost reduction initiatives.\nMoving to SG&A. Q4 expenses were $149.4 million, including a $2.9 million reversal of restructuring charges also driven by the peso deflation prior to completing the divestiture of our Global Forwarding operations in Argentina.\nExcluding the reversal, SG&A expenses were $152.3 million, a decline of 5.8% year-over-year, primarily due to reductions in contingent worker expenses, and were down 2.6% sequentially.\nAs you recall from our Q1 earnings call in April, we raised our cost savings commitment to $300 million from $150 million, which was defined as the net annualized cost savings by Q4 of 2023 compared to the annualized run rate of Q3 of 2022, which is when the commitment was originally made.\nWith the progress on our 2023 productivity initiatives, we delivered $346 million in cost savings for the full year, excluding restructuring charges, with the majority of these savings expected to be long-term structural changes. Consistent with our strategy, we believe these cost savings will improve our operating leverage and help our margins as demand and a more balanced freight market return.\nTurning to our 2024 annual operating expense guidance. We expect our personnel expenses to be $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. At the midpoint, this is up 0.2% compared to our 2023 total of $1.447 billion, excluding restructuring charges.\nThe personnel expense drivers in 2024 include 2 items that are expected to offset each other. The restoration of target incentive compensation related to the expected improvement in financial performance will be offset by continued productivity improvements across the business and lower head count as the team continues to decouple volume growth and head count growth.\n2024 SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $575 million to $625 million, down 0.8% at the midpoint, excluding the restructuring charges in 2023. This includes 2024 depreciation and amortization expense, as expected to be $90 million to $100 million. Although most of our SG&A expenses are subject to inflation, we expect continued cost reduction efforts to offset the inflationary impact.\nShifting to expenses below operating income. Our Q4 interest and other expense totaled $38.1 million, which was down $4.3 million or 10.1% year-over-year. Q4 included $21.6 million of interest expense, which was down $3.1 million or 12.6% versus Q4 of 2022, driven by $394 million of debt reduction compared to Q4 of 2022.\nAnother factor that drove Q4 other expense was an $18.5 million loss on foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, which is compared to a $16.9 million loss in Q4 of 2022. The Q4 loss was driven primarily by weakness in the Argentine peso and euro relative to the U.S. dollar.\nAs a reminder, our FX impacts are predominantly noncash gains and losses related to intercompany assets and liabilities.\nOn a sequential basis, FX had an unfavorable impact of $18.4 million, and included an $8.9 million loss related to the significant devaluation of the Argentine peso prior to exiting the business in late December.\nAs you recall from our third quarter earnings call, operating in Argentina had become challenging due to its strict monetary policies and currency devaluation. The divestiture mitigates our exposure to the deteriorating economic conditions and the increase in political instability in that region. As a part of the divesting of our operations in Argentina, we converted the business to a local independent agent to ensure continued service to our customers with shipments in that region.\nThere were also a couple of large onetime tax-related items that impacted our results in Q4. Our Q4 tax provision of $38.3 million included a tax settlement of $19.2 million, and $4.7 million of tax expense related to the Argentina divestiture.\nIn regard to the tax settlement, the company came to an agreement with the IRS Appeals division, on a tax position related to tax incentives for domestic investments in the years 2014 through 2017. Although we maintained that our software investments were supportable deductions, we were only offered a partial settlement.\nFactoring in cost of litigation, expert advice and that other companies who have challenged similar positions have experienced unfavorable results, we decided it was in our best interest to settle the issue. The company has no ongoing financial exposure relating to this specific deduction as it was eliminated from the tax code, beginning in 2018.\nExcluding these onetime tax expenses, our effective tax rate came in at 19.5% for the quarter and 15.0% for the year, compared to 19.3% in 2022. Our lower tax rate in 2023 was primarily driven by our -- by lower pretax income and incremental benefits from foreign tax credits. We expect our 2024 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 19%.\nQ4 adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50, excludes $23.9 million of onetime tax expenses, $8.9 million of foreign currency losses on divested Argentina operations, and the $4.3 million reversal of restructuring charges.\nTurning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow generated by operations was $47 million compared to $773 million in Q4 of 2022. The year-over-year decline in cash flow was primarily driven by changes in net operating working capital.\nIn Q4 of 2022, we had a $650 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital, driven by the sharply declining costs and price of purchase transportation.\nIn Q4 of 2023, we had a $7 million sequential increase in net operating working capital.\nIn Q4, our capital expenditures were $16.1 million compared to $27.8 million in Q4 of 2022. We expect 2024 capital expenditures to be $85 million to $95 million.\nWe returned $74 million of cash to shareholders in Q4, which was down 85% year-over-year, primarily due to the decline in cash from operations.\nNow on to the balance sheet. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.0 billion of liquidity, comprised of $840 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $146 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q4 was $1.6 billion, which was down $394 million since the end of 2022.\nOur net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 2.34x, up from 2.10x at the end of Q3, driven by the lower EBITDA. Our capital allocation strategy is grounded in maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital. Our $619 million in debt paydown since Q3 of 2022 has helped maintain our strong liquidity position and investment-grade credit rating.\nKeep in mind that the cash that we use to reduce debt generally reduced the amount of cash for share repurchases.\nOverall, I'm encouraged by the much-needed progress that was made on our 2023 productivity initiatives and the plans in place to build on that progress in 2024. With the 17% productivity improvement delivered in NAST, and the 20% productivity improvement in Global Forwarding in 2023, combined with an expectation of an additional 15% in NAST and 10% Global Forwarding in 2024, each business is expected to deliver compounded productivity improvements of 32% or better over the 2-year period.\nA robust pipeline of process technology and waste elimination initiatives continues to be acted upon, by leveraging generative AI combined with machine learning, to take the capability of our people to an even higher level, Robinson is positioned well to further reduce waste and drive structural cost changes that improve our operating leverage and help deliver on the long-term operating income margin expectations.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his final comments.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mike. We share the sentiment of some of our peers and that we're happy to say goodbye to 2023. And although 2024 still presents some of the same challenges and headwinds, I'm excited about the work that we're doing to reinvigorate Robinson's winning culture.\nOver my first 6 months here, I completed my initial diagnosis, and we're taking actions to chart our path forward. At a high level, we need to focus on both our customer value proposition and revenue generation and our structural cost, and we need to aggressively seek the optimal balance.\nLet's review my findings. First, our structural cost base grew too much during the pandemic, and we made significant progress on reducing that cost structure in 2023, but it needs to continue to improve. We will do that by embedding lean practices, removing waste and expanding our digital capabilities. This will enable us to strengthen our productivity and optimize our organization structure, in order to be the most efficient operator, in addition to the highest value provider.\nSecond, as I listen to our customers, it's clear that their logistics needs are becoming increasingly complex, and robust capabilities are required to power vertical-centric and value-added solutions. I have found that C.H. Robinson has people with deep expertise in the freight market and long-standing trusted relationships with our customers and carriers. This is a competitive advantage, but we can do a better job of leveraging our unique expertise and information advantage and advance our cutting-edge technology to deliver more robust capabilities and market-leading outcomes.\nThird, we need to focus on profitable growth in our 4 core modes, North American truckload and LTL, and global ocean and air as the engines to ignite growth, by reclaiming share in eroded segment and expanding our addressable market through value-added services and solutions that drive new volume to the core modes.\nAnd fourth, we need to drive better synergies across our portfolio of services to accelerate profitable growth. One way that we're going to do this is by improving how we go-to-market as one company, with unified account management versus showing up as distinct business units. Our journey to unlock the power of our portfolio is underway, as we take action on all of these fronts.\nOne example of this as the recent launching of our enterprise strategy program management office and the addition of Jim Reutlinger to the senior leadership team, to lead our strategic approach to our critical planning activities.\nJim is an expert in continuous improvement and lean methodology, and he brings learnings from his leadership experience at Danaher, a company with a well-established reputation for continuous improvement. Jim will help us drive lean principles and continuous improvement deeper into the organization and create growth and success in our strategic priorities.\nI continue to see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth further reducing our structural cost and improving our efficiency, operating margins and profitability. I'm confident that together, we will win for our customers, carriers, employees and shareholders, and I'm incredibly excited about our future.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 1, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer; and Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer.\nDave will provide some introductory comments. Arun will provide an update on our initiatives to improve our customer and carrier experience and our operating leverage. Mike will provide a summary of our 2023 third quarter results and our expense guidance for 2023, and then we will open the call up for questions.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found on the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing.\nToday's remarks also contain certain non-GAAP measures, and reconciliations of those measures to GAAP measures are included in the presentation. I'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation list factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\nAs has been well-documented by many industry participants and observers, global freight demand continued to be weak in the third quarter. This, combined with ample carrier capacity continued to result in a loose market with low spot rates. Load-to-truck ratios remain near the low levels of 2019 and route guide depth in our managed service business of 1.15 in Q3 and indicates that primary freight providers are accepting most of the contractual freight tendered to them, resulting in fewer spot market opportunities.\nIn the freight forwarding market, ocean vessel and airfreight capacity continues to exceed demand, resulting in suppressed rates for ocean and airfreight. We are staying focused on what we can control by providing superior service to our customers and carriers, executing on our plans to streamline our processes by removing waste and manual touches and delivering tools that enable our customers and carrier-facing employees to allocate their time to relationship building and exception management.\nOur focus on delivering quality and improvements to our customers, such as enhanced visibility and increased automation has been reflected in very positive feedback from my meetings with customers and validated by Net Promoter Scores this year that are the highest on record for the company, which we believe sets us up well with customers for the eventual positive inflection in the freight market.\nOur customers value the quality, stability and reliability that we provide as they work to optimize their transportation needs. This has taken on greater importance to shippers who had exposure to transportation providers whose business models were not financially viable. During my many discussions with customers over the past 4 months, it's clear that they prefer partners who have financial strength and can invest through cycles in the customer experience. They also want partners who have the expertise to provide innovative solutions enabled by technology and people that they rely on to serve as an extension of their team. C.H. Robinson is that partner, with a combination of people, technology and scale to deliver an unmatched customer and carrier experience.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we're executing on our plans to streamline our processes by removing waste and manual touches. The result has been meaningful cost reductions and productivity gains across our business that are ahead of our stated targets. In our North American surface transportation business, our productivity improvements have translated into an 18% year-to-date increase in shipments per person per day. Assuming a typical seasonal volume pullback in Q4, we are on track to meet or exceed our target of 15% year-over-year improvement by Q4 of this year.\nFrom a cost reduction perspective, we reduced Q3 operating expenses and NAST by 22% year-over-year versus a volume decline of only 3.5%. In our Global Forwarding business, Q3 operating expenses, excluding $23.6 million of restructuring charges declined 12% year-over-year despite a slight increase in the number of shipments. For the full enterprise, Q3 operating expenses, excluding $24.5 million of restructuring charges declined 17% year-over-year compared to a 3% decrease in overall volume. As we continue to improve the customer experience and our cost to serve, I'm focused on ensuring that we'll be ready for the eventual freight market rebound. This means growing volume without adding headcount.\nWe believe our team's continuing efforts to streamline our processes and remove manual touches gets us there. Even though I'm pleased with the progress that the team has made, I've challenged them to increase our clock speed on decision-making and improvement efforts. I started by asking our employees company-wide to share what was impeding their speed and where they saw opportunity to create greater efficiency in their daily processes.\nThe incredible response rate confirm the desire of our employees to strengthen the company and the speak-up culture that exists. The response has validated some of our focus items and also highlighted some new opportunities. We're now driving focus on a handful of concurrent work streams that are addressing the highest leverage areas to eliminate productivity bottlenecks. We're bringing forward past lessons on team structure and on mechanisms to drive adoption in order to deliver an improved customer experience through process optimization.\nOur 18% year-to-date productivity improvement is an indicator of the progress that we're already making. I'll turn it over to Arun shortly to share more about this and how we're utilizing generative AI, but these focused work streams are an example of how the leadership team and I are making changes and driving focus so that we position ourselves for growth in our core business.\nUltimately, our focus on continuously improving the customer and carrier experience and removing waste from our workflows will result in a company that is quicker, more flexible and more agile in solving problems for our customers, providing better customer service and creating operating leverage and profitable growth. I'm excited about the work that we're doing to reinvigorate Robinson's winning culture, and I'm confident that together, we will win for our customers, carriers, employees and shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Arun to provide more details on our efforts to strengthen our customer and carry experience and improve our efficiency and operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs Dave mentioned, we've identified a handful of concurrent work streams that are addressing significant opportunities to eliminate productivity bottlenecks and deliver process optimization and an improved customer experience. We're leveraging the strength and experience of our single-threaded business process owners who are leading cross-functional teams across these work streams with dedicated product, engineering, data science and AI resources assigned to each work stream along with alignment of shared goals, incentives and process accountability.\nA couple of examples of these work streams on the productivity roadmap are quoting and order entry. In both of these areas, we are reducing manual touches and our response time to customers, driving faster speed to market and higher customer engagement. In addition to our past learnings, we're leaning more heavily on generative AI to deliver process improvements. In our quoting work stream, we've utilized gen AI to fill in the blanks where there's incomplete and unstructured information in an automated and efficient process, which has reduced the time to provide a quote from approximately 5 minutes to less than 1 minute, from the time the request is received via e-mail.\nIn the last week of the quarter, over 10,000 transactional quotes were created using a gen AI agent, and we have a significant opportunity to scale and grow in this area as we bring this capability to more customers, respond to more quote requests and leverage the ability to provide transactional quoting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nWith more data and history to leverage any other 3PL, we have opportunities to harness the power that this advanced technology now offers to further capitalize on our information advantage and we'll continue to look for and pursue those opportunities. In addition to improved customer service and engagement, these efforts are increasing our digital execution of critical touch points in the life cycle of an order from quote to cash, thereby reducing the number of manual tasks per shipment and the time for tasks. This translates to productivity improvements measured in terms of shipments per person per day, which creates operating leverage.\nFor example, a 15% productivity target translates to an ability to grow volume by 15% without adding headcount to support that volume growth. And our volume growth is less than 15%. The 15% improvement target would be achieved through a combination of volume growth and headcount reduction. Either of these creates operating leverage.\nAs Dave mentioned earlier, we surpassed our goal of a 15% year-over-year improvement in shipments per person per day by Q4 of this year with an 18% year-to-date improvement achieved through Q3. As we raise the bar on our clock speed and deliver further process optimization and an improved customer experience, we plan to deliver the compounded benefits of additional productivity improvements beyond 2023 with technology that supports our people and our processes.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for a review of our third quarter results.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nChief Financial Officer, United Natural Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone.\nThe soft freight market outlined by Dave resulted in third quarter total revenues of $4.3 billion, down 28% compared to Q3 last year. Our third quarter adjusted gross profit, or AGP, was also down 28% year-over-year or $252 million, driven by a 31.4% decline in NAST and a 31.6% decline in Global Forwarding and partially offset by a 4.6% increase in our other business units.\nOn a monthly basis compared to Q3 of last year, our total company AGP per business day was down 34% in July, down 26% in August and down 21% in September. The third quarter contained 1 less business day than both third quarter of last year and second quarter of this year. In our NAST truckload business, our Q3 volume declined approximately 6% year-over-year and 4.5% on a per business day basis. On a sequential basis, NAST truckload volume increased 2% versus Q2 and 3.5% per business day.\nDuring Q3, we had an approximate mix of 70% contractual volume and 30% transactional volume in our truckload business for the third quarter in a row as the spot market remains suppressed. The sequential declines that we have seen in our truckload linehaul cost per mile since Q2 of last year continued into Q3 of this year.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we saw a decline of approximately 13.5% in our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges. Due to the usual time lag associated with contract pricing resetting to follow spot market costs, our average truckload linehaul rate or price built to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, declined 16.5% on a year-over-year basis. With this price decline coming off of a higher base than cost, these changes resulted in a 34% year-over-year decrease in our Truckload AGP per mile and a 36.5% decrease in our AGP per load.\nWithin Q3, our Truckload AGP per load was relatively flat through the quarter. In our LTL business, Q3 orders were down 2% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. On a per business day basis, our Q3 LTL orders were down 0.5% year-over-year and up 0.5% sequentially. AGP per order declined 13.5% on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by soft market conditions and lower fuel prices. On a sequential basis, the cost and price of purchased transportation in the LTL market increased in Q3, resulting in a 2% increase in AGP per order. This was primarily driven by capacity that has likely temporarily exited the market. By leveraging our broad access to capacity in all modes of LTL, we were able to meet our customers' LTL needs at a high service level. In our Global Forwarding business, market conditions continued to be soft behind weak demand and plenty of capacity.\nIn Q3, Global Forwarding generated an AGP of approximately $170 million, a 32% decline year-over-year. Within these results, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by 35% year-over-year, driven by a 34.5% decline in AGP per shipment and a 0.5% decrease in shipments.\nOn a sequential basis, our ocean volume grew 2.5%. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, we have grown ocean market share through adding new customers, diversifying trade lanes and verticals and leveraging investments in technology and talent.\nTurning to expenses. Our productivity initiatives continue to enable us to deliver on and exceed our expense reduction expectations. Q3 personnel expenses were $343.5 million, including $3 million of restructuring charges, and that was down 21.5% compared to Q3 of last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, our Q3 personnel expenses were down 22.2% year-over-year, primarily due to our cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation.\nOur ending headcount was down 14.2% year-over-year in Q3 to 15,391. Q3 ending headcount was also down 2.4% sequentially compared to Q2. As a result of the progress on our cost optimization efforts, we now expect our 2023 personnel expenses to be $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion, below the $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion range that we previously provided.\nAs a reminder, our expense guidance excludes restructuring expenses. Moving to SG&A. Q3 expenses were $177.8 million and included $21.4 million of restructuring charges, primarily related to asset impairments driven by our decision to divest our global forwarding operations in Argentina. Operating in Argentina has become challenging due to its strict monetary policies and rapid currency devaluation and this divestiture will help mitigate our exposure to the deteriorating economic conditions and increasing political instability in that region.\nAs a part of divesting our operations in Argentina, we are pursuing a path for a local independent agent or agents to ensure continued service to our customers with shipments in that region. Excluding those Q3 restructuring charges, SG&A expenses of $156.4 million declined approximately 3.5% year-over-year primarily due to reductions in contingent worker expenses and legal settlements.\nWe expect our 2023 SG&A expenses to be near the midpoint of our previous guidance of $575 million to $625 million, including depreciation and amortization expense that is expected to be toward the high end of our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million. As you recall from our Q1 earnings call, we raised our cost savings commitment to $300 million of net annualized cost savings by Q4 of this year compared to the annualized run rate of Q3 of last year.\nWith the progress to date on our productivity initiatives, we are on track to deliver approximately $360 million in cost savings in 2023 at the midpoint of our updated guidance with the majority of cost savings expected to be longer-term structural changes. Consistent with our strategy, these cost savings improve our operating leverage and will help our operating margins as demand and a more balanced freight market returns. Q3 interest and other expense totaled $20.7 million, up $4.8 million versus Q3 of last year. Q3 included $21.8 million of interest expense, up $1 million versus Q3 of last year due to higher variable interest rates against a reduced debt load.\nThe reduced debt load drove a $1.4 million decrease in Q3 interest expense on a sequential basis. Our Q3 tax rate came in at 11.7% compared to 16.9% in Q3 of 2022. The lower tax rate was primarily driven by lower pretax income and incremental tax benefits from foreign tax credits. We now expect our 2023 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 15%, down from our previous guidance of 16% to 18%. Adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding $24.5 million of restructuring charges and $5.5 million of associated tax provision benefit was $0.84, down 53% compared to Q3 last year.\nTurning to cash flow. Q3 cash flow generated from operations was $205 million, which demonstrates our ability to generate cash and make meaningful investments despite the continued soft freight market. Our Q3 cash flow compares to $626 million in Q3 of last year. The year-over-year decline in cash flow was primarily driven by changes in our net operating working capital. In Q3 of last year, we had a $359 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital driven by the sharply declining cost and price of purchase transportation.\nWith the more moderated sequential declines in cost and price in Q3 of this year, we had a $55 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital. In Q3, our capital expenditures were $16.7 million compared to $31.3 million in Q3 of last year. We now expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be toward the lower end of our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million.\nWe returned $76 million of cash to shareholders in Q3 through $73 million of cash dividends and $3 million of share repurchases. The cash return to shareholders equates to 92% of Q3 net income, but was down 88% versus Q3 last year, driven by the $153 million of cash used to reduce debt.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. We ended Q3 with approximately $1 billion of liquidity, comprised of $837 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $175 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q3 was $1.58 billion, which includes debt paydown of $615 million versus Q3 last year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q3 was 2.1x, up from 1.1x at the end of Q2. Our capital allocation strategy is grounded in maintaining investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital.\nOur $615 million in debt paydown helped maintain our strong liquidity position and investment-grade credit rating. Keep in mind that the cash that we use to reduce debt generally reduces the amount of cash for share repurchases. Over the long term, we remain committed to growing our quarterly cash dividend in alignment with our long-term EBITDA growth. Our dividends and share repurchase program are important levers to enhance shareholder value.\nOverall, I'm encouraged by the progress that we continue to make on our productivity initiatives and look forward to our ability to build on that progress by leveraging generative AI combined with machine learning to take the capability of our people to an even higher level, we are positioned well to further reduce waste and increase operating leverage and value for Robinson shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his final comments.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Mike. Over my first 4 months here, it's become apparent. The C.H. Robinson has a secret sauce with people who have deep expertise in the freight market and long-standing relationships with their customers and carriers. Combined with Robinson's strong technology and large data set, our people are able to provide innovative tech-enabled solutions powered by our information advantage for the benefit of our customers and carriers. This secret sauce is not easy to replicate with a digital-only solution.\nRobinson has shown the strength of this model through cycles, and our balance sheet continues to be strong. The investments we're making to improve the experience and outcomes for our customers and carriers combined with the work that we're doing to accelerate our clock speed, waste reduction and productivity improvements should position us well for the eventual freight market rebound and to deliver improved operating leverage and returns for our shareholders. I continue to see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth, improving our efficiency and operating margins and increasing overall profitability. I'm incredibly excited about our future. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, August 2, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Dave Bozeman, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer; and Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer. Dave will provide some introductory comments. Mike will provide a summary of our 2023 second quarter results and our outlook for 2023. Arun will provide an update on our efforts to improve our customer and carrier experience and our operating leverage, and then we will open the call up for questions.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing.\nI'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation list factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying it is an absolute privilege to be leading C.H. Robinson, a market leader with enormous scale, a strong base of loyal customers and a resilient business model that generates profits and free cash flow through the entirety of the freight cycle.\nI know from my time in the transportation market that other freight providers and new entrants look to Robinson as an example of a commercial engine with the breadth, scale, expertise and financial strength that they aspire to achieve. However, there's always room for improvement, and I recognize the tremendous opportunity in front of us to accelerate growth in a very fragmented market.\nIn my first month, I've been spending time meeting with and talking to customers, employees and shareholders as I analyze the business. A customer-centric focus is in my DNA, and I have successfully implemented customer-focused strategies over my 30-year career at leading brands such as Harley-Davidson, Caterpillar, Amazon and Ford Motor Company. I look forward to applying that experience towards our goal of providing such a compelling offering that customers feel like C.H. Robinson is essential to the success of their supply chain.\nAs a Lean practitioner, I'm in a discovery and diagnosis phase, and I've been learning more and shaping my vision for the company each day. I'm digging in quickly with the leadership team. I'm looking at the portfolio of businesses with an open mind. And my intentions are to drive focus so that we position ourselves for growth in our core business.\nAs I aim to reinvigorate the winning culture, my focus will be on people, products, processes, technology, collaboration and excellence. My style is to: one, be accountable for driving improvement and be passionate about making people better; two, look around corners and anticipate in order to minimize surprises. And three, wake up every day, like you're working for a startup by being gritty, scrappy, innovative and change-oriented with a focus on improving clock speed and acknowledging every day that you can be better.\nThese practices have enabled success for the companies I've worked at and the people I've worked with. People are at the heart of Robinson, and I'm confident that together, we will win for our customers, carriers and shareholders.\nI'm passionate about continuously improving how organizations operate. Lean principles work and are applicable at Robinson to further improve efficiency. Robinson is a strong company, but all companies have waste that can be removed to make a company quicker, more flexible and more agile in solving problems for their customers, improving workflows and providing better customer service and experiences.\nI have helped build out and scale transportation businesses, most notably at Amazon, where technology is the starting point. I am certain, we can leverage technology as a force multiplier here at Robinson, and I've been discussing it with Arun and the team. As an example, when I look at C.H. Robinson, I'm excited about the potential benefits from Generative AI in conjunction with the machine learning and artificial intelligence that the company has already been utilizing.\nWith more data and history to leverage than any other 3PL, we have opportunities to harness the power that these advanced technologies now offer to further capitalize on our information advantage, and we'll continue to look for and pursue those opportunities.\nArun will touch more on this in his prepared comments. In summary, I look forward to leading this great company to new heights, and sharing our progress with all of you along our journey.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mike for a review of our second quarter results.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nChief Financial Officer, United Natural Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Global freight markets in Q2 continued to be impacted by weak demand, high inventories and excess capacity, which resulted in a more competitive marketplace with suppressed transportation rates.\nNorth American freight volumes and load-to-truck ratios remain near the low levels of 2019. In the freight forwarding market, ocean vessel and air freight capacity continues to exceed demand, which has kept ocean and air freight rates low during the period of significant declines that extends back to the second half of 2022.\nDespite the weak demand, new vessel deliveries are expected to continue to add capacity to the ocean market. This suggests that the influence of excess capacity may persist for several periods despite the steamship lines efforts to manage capacity through blank sailings, slow steaming and redeploying capacity to other lanes.\nWe are staying focused on what we can control, providing superior service to our customers and carriers and streamlining our processes by removing waste and manual touches. The result has been meaningful cost reduction and productivity gains across our business.\nWith our record quarterly financial results in Q2 of last year as a comparable, and the macro forces that I outlined as the backdrop, our second quarter total revenues of $4.4 billion declined 35% compared to Q2 last year. Our second quarter adjusted gross profit or AGP, was also down 35% year-over-year or [ $366 million, ] driven by a 45% decline in our Global Forwarding and a 36% decline in NAST.\nOn a sequential basis, total company AGP was down 3%, driven by a 6% decline in NAST that was partially offset by a 1% increase in Global Forwarding and a 6% increase in the total of our other segments.\nOn a monthly basis compared to Q2 of last year, our total company AGP per business day was down 30% in April, down 39% in May and down 37% in June. In our NAST truckload business, our Q2 volume declined by approximately 6.5% on a year-over-year basis. Within Q2, average daily volume in April was stronger than March, but weakened in May and held in June, which resulted in a 0.5% sequential decline in Q2.\nDuring Q2, we had an approximate mix of 70% contractual volume and 30% transactional volume in our truckload business. Routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business, which is a proxy for the overall market, declined from 1.4 in Q2 of last year to 1.1 in the second quarter of this year, which is the lowest level we've seen for a full quarter since the recession of 2009.\nThe sequential declines in our truckload linehaul cost per mile since Q2 of last year began to level off and increased sequentially in May and June, causing the June cost per mile to be only $0.02 below the March cost per mile. On a year-over-year basis, we saw a decline of approximately 19% in our average truckload linehaul cost per mile to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges.\nDue to the time lag for contract pricing to follow spot market costs, Q2 truckload linehaul pricing continued to decline on a sequential basis resulting in a 23% year-over-year decline in our average linehaul rate or price billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges. These changes resulted in a 41.5% year-over-year decrease in our Truckload AGP per mile and AGP per shipment with declines in both contractual and transactional AGP per shipment. This is the largest year-over-year decline in AGP per mile that we've experienced in the last 10 years and is in contrast to the 46.5% increase in Q2 last year.\nIn our LTL business, shipments were flat on a year-over-year basis and up 5% sequentially. By leveraging our broad access to capacity in all modes of LTL and our high level of service, our LTL team continues to onboard a pipeline of new business that is offsetting the softness in the LTL market.\nAGP per order, however, declined 19% compared to Q2 last year, driven primarily by the market conditions and lower fuel prices. As I mentioned, market conditions in our Global Forwarding business were also soft behind weak demand and plenty of capacity.\nDespite that, our ocean and air volume each grew sequentially, exhibiting the progress our Global Forwarding team has made through adding new customers, diversifying trade lanes and verticals and leveraging investments in technology and talent over the past several years. In Q2, Global Forwarding generated revenue of $780 million and AGP of approximately $179 million, which declined 45% year-over-year compared to the record high from Q2 last year.\nWithin these results, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by 53% year-over-year compared to 51% growth in Q2 of 2022. The Q2 results were driven by a 49.5% decrease in AGP per shipment and a 7% decrease in shipments.\nTurning to expenses. We delivered on our expense reduction and productivity expectations for the quarter. Q2 personnel expenses were $377.3 million, including $13.1 million of restructuring charges, down 15.2% compared to Q2 of last year. Excluding the restructuring charges, our Q2 personnel expenses were down 18.1% year-over-year primarily due to the cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation.\nOur headcount was also down significantly in Q2 with ending headcount at 15,763, down 13.1% year-over-year. In Q2, we elevated our cost optimization efforts, which began in Q4 of last year as we streamlined our workflows and removed waste to help ensure a more competitive and sustainable long-term cost structure. As a result, our shipments per person per day in NAST has increased by 12% year-to-date through Q2, and we remain on track to deliver on our target of 15% year-over-year improvement by Q4 of this year.\nI'd also note that we were able to achieve the productivity gains in a soft volume market, which sets us up well for when the market demand returns. Going forward, we expect continued improvements in shipments per person per day and the associated cost benefits through the remainder of 2023 as we streamline processes and improve customer outcomes with technology that supports our people and processes.\nAs a result of the progress on our cost optimization efforts, we now expect 2023 personnel expenses to be toward the lower end of the $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion range that we previously provided. As a reminder, our expense guidance excludes restructuring expenses.\nMoving to SG&A. Q2 expenses were $155.6 million and included $1 million of restructuring charges. Excluding the Q2 restructuring charges and last year's $25.3 million gain on the sale leaseback of our Kansas City Regional Center in Q2, SG&A expenses were up approximately 8.5% compared to Q2 of last year, primarily due to increases in claims and warehouse expenses.\nWe continue to expect our 2023 SG&A expenses to be $575 million to $625 million, including $90 million to $100 million of depreciation and amortization expense. As you may recall from our Q1 earnings call, we raised our cost savings commitment to $300 million of net annualized cost savings by Q4 of this year compared to the annualized run rate of the Q3 expenses from last year. We continue to be on track to deliver those expense reductions and the majority are expected to be longer-term structural changes to our cost base that will help us improve operating margins once demand returns.\nQ2 interest and other expense totaled $18.3 million, down $9.1 million versus Q2 last year. Q2 included $23.2 million of interest expense, up $6.3 million versus Q2 of last year due to higher variable interest rates against a reduced debt load. Q2 also included a $3.5 million gain on foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses compared to a $10.3 million loss in Q2 last year, with both driven by various foreign currency impacts on intercompany assets and liabilities. As a reminder, our FX impacts are predominantly noncash gains and losses.\nOur Q2 tax rate came in at 14.9% compared to 21.3% in Q2 of '22. The lower tax rate was driven by lower pretax income and incremental benefits from tax credits and incentives. We now expect our 2023 full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 18%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal, state or international tax policy.\nAdjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the $14.1 million of restructuring charges, was $0.90. Excluding the $25.3 million gain from Q2 last year, non-GAAP earnings per share was down 64% compared to the 75% increase in Q2 last year.\nTurning to cash flow. Q2 cash flow generated by operations was approximately $225 million compared to the $265 million in Q2 of 2022 demonstrating our ability to generate cash and make investments in the business through the freight cycle. The year-over-year decline in our cash flow was driven by a $251 million decrease in net income partially offset by $144 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in Q2, resulting from the declining cost and price of ocean and truckload transportation.\nOver the last 4 quarters, as the cost and price of purchased transportation have come down, we have realized a benefit to working capital and operating cash flow of more than $1.4 billion. In Q2, our capital expenditures were $24.4 million compared to $43.2 million in Q2 of last year, and we continue to expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million.\nWe returned $106 million of cash to shareholders in Q2 through $73 million of cash dividends and $33 million of share repurchases. The cash returned to shareholders exceeded net income but was down 74% versus Q2 last year, driven by the $137 million of cash used to reduce debt.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $859 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $210 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q2 was $1.74 billion, which includes debt paydown of $532 million versus Q2 last year.\nOur net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q2 was 1.81x, up from 1.39x at the end of Q1. Our capital allocation strategy is grounded in maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital. With the year-over-year earnings reduction and the $0.5 billion of debt pay down, we'll continue to manage our capital structure to maintain our investment-grade credit rating. As you would expect, the cash that we used to reduce debt generally reduces the amount of cash available for share repurchases.\nOver the long term, we remain committed to growing our quarterly cash dividend in alignment with long-term EBITDA growth. Our dividends and share repurchase program are important levers to enhance shareholder value as we are delivering quality, customer service more efficiently than anyone in the marketplace.\nAs we have demonstrated through the ups and downs of our highly cyclical freight market, the strength of our business model makes us a reliable partner for our customers and allows us to invest through the cycle. Our customers value the stability and reliability that we provide as we work to optimize their transportation needs.\nI'd like to close by adding that I am incredibly excited about the direction we are headed and our ability to build on the productivity and cost control progress that we've made. By leveraging Lean principles to reduce waste and the emerging benefits of our combination of machine learning and Generative AI across our scaled model, we are positioned well to deliver greater efficiency and improved competitiveness in the marketplace to generate greater value for Robinson shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Arun to provide more details on our efforts to strengthen our customer and carrier experience and improve our efficiency and operating leverage.\n\nArun D. Rajan\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter, our single threaded cross-functional teams made great progress on improving customer outcomes with technology that supports our people and processes. Our enhanced carrier advantage program has significantly improved our automated tracking and advanced visibility capabilities and those efforts are being recognized by our customers and multiple third parties.\nIn our LTL business, our team is leading the way as an early adopter of electronic builder rating, which has enhanced our digital connectivity with our LTL carriers and enabled us to eliminate unnecessary work and achieve gains in efficiency and accuracy.\nAll the initiatives and work streams of our teams are targeted at improving productivity and accelerating growth with disciplined product and change management. Over the last 6 months, we've increased our focus on opportunities to streamline processes that are core to improving the customer and carrier experience and enabling us to decouple volume and headcount growth and drive increased productivity. Shipments per person per day is a key metric that we use to measure our productivity improvements and as Mike mentioned earlier, we've achieved a 12% year-to-date improvement through Q2 as we progress towards our goal of 15% year-over-year improvement by Q4 of this year.\nIn order to reach our 2023 goal, we have accelerated the digital execution of critical touch points in the life cycle of a load, thereby reducing the number of manual tasks per shipment and the time per task. A few areas where we have seen this progress include increasing the automation of in-transit tracking, case management tasks and appointment-related tasks. As Dave mentioned earlier, we've also been using machine learning, artificial intelligence and our large data estate to improve outcomes for our customers and carriers.\nBut machine learning alone has limitations due to a need for standardization. Generative AI and large language models have the ability to work with unstructured and incomplete data and unstructured task flows to create an automation unlock. One example of where this can be used is in order management. Over the years, manual processes or workarounds have been put in place to serve our customers and carriers in customized and therefore, unstructured ways such as receiving orders and providing quotes through e-mail.\nAs you can imagine, these have highly variable levels of information completeness and a fragmented mix of formats. Generative AI can be used to fill in the blanks, whether it's incomplete and unstructured information in a highly automated and efficient process. Our early testing and results from Generative AI are promising, and we're excited about the potential for this technology to be an accelerant to automation and productivity improvements and to magnify our information advantage.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for his final comments.\n\nDavid P. Bozeman\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThanks, Arun. C.H. Robinson is a great company with the largest market share, the most developed freight brokers network, long-standing relationships with global blue-chip customers, deep carrier relations, strong technology and a larger data set than any other market participant. While the near-term freight environment presents some challenges, the strength of our people, scale network, financial model and investments in improving efficiency position us well for the eventual rebound.\nI see an opportunity for the company to reach its full potential and create more shareholder value by improving our value proposition, increasing our market share, accelerating growth, improving our efficiency and operating margins and increasing overall profitability. Robinson has great people with a passion for winning and the grit, grind and hustle needed to innovate and solve challenges for our customers and carriers.\nTo enable greater agility and flexibility and to accelerate our clock speed, I'm empowering our people to uncover new ways to challenge the status quo, move faster and act boldly to better anticipate our customers' needs, exceed their expectations and make us indispensable. Shippers are looking for stable and innovative logistics partners. Robinson has shown the strength of its model through cycles. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we plan to invest in initiatives that we expect to amplify the expertise of our people and generate high returns on investment. I'm excited about our opportunities and our future. This concludes our prepared remarks.\nI'll turn it back to Donna now for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson First Quarter 2023 Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, the conference call is being recorded, Wednesday, April 26, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles Ives\n\nThank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Scott Anderson, our interim Chief Executive Officer; Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer; and Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer. Scott and Mike will provide a summary of our 2023 first quarter results and our outlook for 2023. Arun will provide an update on our efforts to improve our efficiency and operating leverage, and then we will open the call up for questions.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing.\nI'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Anderson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Patterson Companies Inc\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our Q1 financial results reflect the softening market conditions that have transpired in the freight transportation market over the past 12 months. With shippers continuing to manage through elevated inventories amid slowing economic growth, the balance of supply and demand has shifted from a tight market a year ago to one that is now oversupplied. As spot rates approach the breakeven cost per mile to operate a truck, the market is likely at or near the bottom of the industry cycle, which typically results in capacity exiting the market. Contract rates are also declining as transportation providers adjust to the changing market.\nDuring this transition, we've continued to increase our focus on delivering an improved customer and carrier experience and a more efficient business model, and we're taking steps to foster profitable growth through cycles.\nIn his prepared remarks, Arun will provide an update on the progress we're making on increasing the digital execution within the life cycle of a load by streamlining certain processes that are core to our operating model. Mike will give you an update on our continuing restructuring effort. We are executing on the plan that was initiated in November and we're lowering our 2023 personnel expense by $100 million at the midpoint of our guidance. reflecting actions that have already been taken and additional opportunities to further reduce our costs.\nAs I've transitioned from my role of Board Chair to the interim CEO, I've met with many of our employees who remain highly engaged and motivated to win as we strive to amplify their expertise with new tools. I've also met with several of our customers, and I'm confident in the power of our commercial engine and our ability to deliver superior global services and capabilities and solve complex logistics challenges for our customers while continuing to execute on our sustainable growth strategy.\nI'll wrap up my opening remarks by providing an update on the search for the new permanent CEO. Jodee Kozlak, the Chair of the Board and former Chief HR Officer at Target is leading the search committee. With the assistance of Russell Reynolds, this role has attracted a strong pool of candidates. The committee is choosing a proven leader with broad operational experience who will accelerate our strategic initiatives and execute on the opportunities ahead for the company. The process is moving along as expected, and the Board anticipates naming the new CEO in the second quarter.\nI, along with the senior leadership team, am actively preparing for a smooth transition to a new leader. Now let me turn it over to Mike for a review of our first quarter results.\n\nMichael Zechmeister\n\nThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. As Scott mentioned, our Q1 results were impacted by a soft freight market. Prices for surface transportation and global freight forwarding have been declining with the weakening demand and excess capacity.\nWith these macro forces as a backdrop, our first quarter total revenues of $4.6 billion declined 32% compared to our record high of $6.8 billion in Q1 of last year. Our first quarter adjusted gross profit or AGP, was down $221 million or 24.3% compared to Q1 of last year, driven by a 45% decline in Global Forwarding and a 16% decline in NAST. On a sequential basis, total company AGP was down 11%, including a 15% decline in NAST and a 6% decline in Global Forwarding. On a monthly basis compared to Q1 of last year, our total company AGP per business day was down 23% in both January and February and down 27% in March as the typical seasonal acceleration in March did not materialize this year. So far in April, we've experienced similar freight market conditions to those we saw in March.\nIn our NAST truckload business, our Q1 volume declined 3.5% on a year-over-year basis. Within Q1, average daily volume in March was weaker than January and February, resulting in a 1% sequential decline in Q1 compared to Q4 of last year. Our AGP per truckload shipment decreased 19% versus Q1 last year, primarily due to a decrease in our transactional or spot market truckload AGP per shipment.\nDuring Q1, we had an approximate mix of 70% contractual volume and 30% transactional volume. Routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business, which is a proxy for overall market, declined from 1.7 in the first quarter of last year to 1.2 for the first quarter of this year. which is the lowest level we've seen since the pandemic impacted second quarter of 2020.\nThe sequential declines in truckload linehaul cost and price per mile that we experienced in Q2 through Q4 of last year continued in Q1. However, the declines in Q1 were the largest that we've seen in over 10 years on a percentage basis. In Q1, we saw a 28.5% year-over-year decline in our average truckload linehaul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges. Our average line haul rate or price billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased year-over-year by approximately 27.5%.\nWith the price decline coming off a higher base than cost, these changes resulted in a 20.5% year-over-year decrease in our NAST truckload AGP per mile.\nMarket conditions in our Global Forwarding business were also soft behind weakened demand and plenty of capacity, combined with the extended shutdowns around the Lunar New Year holiday. This contributed to significantly reduced import volumes and prices across the trade lanes for ocean and air freight.\nIn Q1, Global Forwarding generated AGP of $177.9 million representing a year-over-year decrease of 45% versus the record high for our first quarter last year, which was up 50%. Within these results, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by $111 million or 50% year-over-year compared to 63.5% growth in Q1 of last year.\nThe Q1 results were driven by a 41.5% decrease in AGP per shipment and a 14.5% decrease in shipments. Despite the soft market, our forwarding business continues to have success adding new customers and strengthening its geographic diversity behind many of the investments made in technology and talent over the past several years. In addition to our strength in the Trans-Pacific trade lanes, our forwarding team generated over 50% of new business AGP from customers outside of the U.S. in Q1.\nTurning to expenses. Q1 personnel expenses were $383.1 million down $30 million or 7.3% compared to Q1 of last year, primarily due to our cost optimization efforts and lower variable compensation. Our Q1 average head count declined 2% versus Q1 of last year and 4% compared to our Q4 average. As another point of reference, our Q1 ending head count declined approximately 6% compared to the end of Q4.\nOur cost optimization and restructuring efforts that began in Q4 of last year continued into Q1 as we found more opportunities to help ensure a more competitive and sustainable long-term cost structure. As we indicated on our Q4 earnings call, we continue to expect our head count to decline throughout 2023, as we streamline processes and leverage technology to allow our industry-leading talent to focus on more important work like growing the business.\nAs a result of the progress on these cost optimization efforts, we are now lowering our personnel expense guidance for 2023 by an additional $100 million at the midpoint. We now expect our 2023 personnel expenses to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion, compared to our previous guidance of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion. This updated guidance excludes the Q1 restructuring expense and additional restructuring costs that we expect to incur during the year. Excluding the restructuring charges in 2022 and 2023, the midpoint of our updated 2023 guidance for personnel expenses is now down approximately 12% year-over-year. These expense reductions are primarily long-term structural cost reductions with a lesser amount attributable to softer market conditions that we referred to earlier.\nMoving on to SG&A. Q1 expenses of $141.5 million were down $5.9 million compared to Q1 of last year primarily due to a decrease in credit losses and a reduction of purchased services, including temporary labor. We continue to expect our 2023 SG&A expenses to be about $575 million to $625 million. 2023 SG&A expenses are expected to include approximately $90 million to $100 million of depreciation and amortization expense.\nAs you recall from our Q4 earnings call, we committed to $150 million of net cost savings by Q4 of this year compared to the annualized run rate of Q3 last year. Our updated total operating expense guidance for 2023 now represents approximately $300 million of net cost savings compared to the annualized run rate in Q3 last year.\nAs mentioned earlier, the majority of the expense reductions are expected to be long-term structural changes to our cost base. Q1 interest and other expense totaled $28.3 million, up $14.1 million versus Q1 last year. Q1 of 2023 included $23.5 million of interest expense, up $9 million versus the prior year due to higher variable interest rates. Q1 results also included a $9.6 million loss on foreign currency revaluation and realized foreign currency gains and losses, up $8.1 million compared to Q1 last year, driven by the translation impact of the various foreign currency-denominated intercompany exposures that we had in Q1.\nAs a reminder, our FX impacts are predominantly noncash gains and losses, which is why we're not actively hedging them to reduce volatility. Our Q1 tax rate came in at 13.5% compared to 18.4% in Q1 of 2022. The lower tax rate was driven primarily by the incremental tax benefits that we typically see from stock-based compensation deliveries in Q1 as well as additional U.S. tax credits and incentives in proportion to the lower pretax income. We continue to expect our 2023 full year effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal state or international tax policy.\nQ1 net income was $114.9 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.96. Adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the $3.7 million of restructuring charges, was $0.98, down 52% compared to Q1 of 2022, which was up 60% versus the prior year.\nTurning to cash flow. Q1 cash flow generated by operations was $254.5 million compared to $13.9 million of cash used in Q1 of 2022. The $268.5 million year-over-year improvement was driven by a $235 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in Q1 driven by the declining cost and price of ocean and truckload in our model. Conversely, Q1 of last year included a $289 million sequential increase in net operating working capital as costs and prices were rising.\nOver the past 3 quarters, as the cost and price of purchased transportation has come down, we have realized a benefit to working capital and operating cash flow of more than $1.2 billion. That benefit highlights some of the inherent resilience in our model.\nIn Q1, our capital expenditures were $27 million compared to $26.2 million in Q1 of last year, and we continue to expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. We returned $125 million of cash to shareholders in Q1 through $73.4 million of cash dividends and $51.2 million of share repurchases. The cash returned to shareholders exceeded net income but was down 50% versus Q1 last year driven by the $101 million of cash used to reduce our debt.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. As we have demonstrated through the ups and downs of the highly cyclical freight market, the strength of our balance sheet and business model makes us a reliable partner for our customers and allows us to invest through the cycle. Our customers value the stability and reliability that we provide as they work to optimize their transportation needs. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.5 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.22 billion of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $239 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q1 was $1.87 billion, down $293 million versus Q1 last year.\nOur net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q1 was 1.39x, up from 1.29x at the end of Q4. Our capital allocation strategy includes maintaining an investment-grade credit rating to allow us to optimize our weighted average cost of capital. With the anticipated earnings reduction in 2023, we have reduced our debt to deliver our leverage targets. As you would expect, the cash that we used to reduce debt generally reduces the amount of cash available for share repurchases. Over the long term, we remain committed to growing our cash dividend in alignment with our long-term EBITDA growth. Our dividends and share repurchase program are important levers to enhance shareholder value, as is delivering quality customer service more efficiently than anyone in the marketplace.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Arun to walk through our efforts to strengthen our customer and carrier experience and improve our efficiency and operating leverage.\n\nArun Rajan\n\nChief Product Officer, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we've increased our focus on opportunities to streamline processes that are core to scaling our operating model. Streamlining these processes will enable us to decouple volume and head count growth and drive increased productivity while simultaneously improving the customer experience and service levels.\nShipments per person per day is a key metric that we use to measure our productivity improvements, and we achieved a 4% sequential improvement in Q1 as we progress towards our goal of 15% year-over-year improvement by the end of Q4 of 2023. In order to reach our 2023 goal, we have accelerated the digital execution of critical touch points in the life cycle of a load.\nIn Q1, the progress we made was primarily driven by increasing the automation of in-transit tracking and appointment-related tasks. Increased digitization and automation are key elements of delivering a superior customer experience as well as operating leverage. These efforts include operationalizing our information advantage at scale by giving customers insights on price and coverage and providing features to carriers that improve their utilization and cash flow.\nStreamlining processes and improving productivity creates operating leverage. Operating leverage gives us the pricing flexibility to unlock and accelerate market share growth while delivering on our long-term operating margin targets.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott now for his final comments.\n\nScott Anderson\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Patterson Companies Inc\n\nThanks, Arun. As inflationary pressures continue to weigh on global economic growth and freight markets present cyclical challenges, the competitive landscape has changed. With lower available demand, the competition for volume is intense, and shippers are looking for stable and innovative logistics partners. We've shown the strength of our model through cycles. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, and we plan to continue investing in initiatives that we expect to provide innovative solutions and generate long-term profitable growth.\nAt the same time, we're continuing to evolve our organization to bring greater focus to our highest strategic priorities, including keeping the needs of our customers and carriers at the center of what we do while lowering our overall cost structure. We expect this initiative will continue to drive improvements in our customer and carrier experience and amplify the expertise of our people, all of which we expect to drive market share gains and growth and lead to improved returns for our shareholders.\nAfter my first 100 days in this role, I'm even more excited about C.H. Robinson's opportunities in future. We have some of the best people in the logistics industry, and they're dedicated to solving challenges for our customers. As a result of the exceptional service that our people provide to customers during the period of extended market disruption, our customer experience scores are very high, and we're having more strategic customer discussions about our ability to provide an integrated service solution. So while the near-term freight environment presents some challenges, our differentiated value proposition and strength of our people, processes and technology provide many opportunities.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Fourth Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 1, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Scott Anderson, our Interim Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Scott and Mike will provide a summary of our 2022 fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2023. Arun will provide an update on our path to a scalable operating model to improve the customer and carrier experience. And then we will open the call up for questions.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found on the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing.\nI'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott P. Anderson\n\nInterim CEO & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start today's call by expressing my appreciation and the Board's gratitude for the contributions that Bob Biesterfeld made to C.H. Robinson over his 24 years with the company, including his 3 years as CEO. Under Bob's guidance, C.H. Robinson navigated the challenges presented by the pandemic and the ongoing supply chain disruptions. And he played an important role in positioning Robinson for long-term success. We wish Bob all the best.\nIn order to accelerate C.H. Robinson's strategic initiatives and take the company into its next chapter, the Board felt that a change in leadership was needed. Jodee Kozlak, the newly appointed Chair of the Board, is leading the Search Committee to find a new CEO. With Jodee's background and expertise, I can't think of anyone more qualified to lead the Board and the search process.\nTo give you a little of my background, I've spent over 10 years as a Director here at Robinson and the last 3 years as Chairman of the Board. I've spent the first 25 years of my career at Patterson Companies, most recently as CEO from 2010 to 2017 and also Chairman from 2013 to 2017. I look forward to working closely with Jodee and the Board as well as the whole Robinson team in the coming weeks and months.\nI'm excited to bring my experience and my knowledge of Robinson to the role of Interim CEO. I'm leveraging the relationships I have with the senior leadership team to ensure that we continue delivering superior global services and capabilities to our customers and carriers while continuing to execute with great focus on our sustainable growth strategy.\nDuring my first few weeks as Interim CEO, I've been meeting with our customers and employees who are highly engaged and motivated to win. And I'm confident in our ability to navigate this transition and deliver for our customers.\nThroughout the transition, we're increasing our focus on delivering a scalable operating model to lower our costs, improve the customer and carrier experience, and foster long-term profitable growth through cycles. The current point in the cycle is one of shippers managing through elevated inventories amidst slowing economic growth, causing unseasonably soft demand for transportation services. At the same time, prices for ground transportation and global freight forwarding are declining due to the changing balance of supply and demand. While a correction in the freight forwarding market was certainly expected, the speed and magnitude of the correction in only 2 quarters was unexpected, with ocean rates on some trade lanes already back to prepandemic levels. As a result, our operating costs were misaligned.\nAs was announced on our third quarter earnings call, we have taken actions to structurally reduce our overall cost structure. The actions are expected to generate net annualized cost savings of $150 million by Q4 2023 as compared to the annualized Q3 2022 run rate. If growth opportunities or economic conditions play out differently than we expect, we'll adjust our plans accordingly.\nI believe we're uniquely positioned in the marketplace to deliver for our shippers, carriers and shareholders through a combination of our digital solutions, our global suite of services and our network of global logistics experts.\nNow let me turn it over to Mike for a review of our fourth quarter results.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nCFO, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Scott, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q4 financial results reflect the price declines and slowing demand in the freight forwarding and surface transportation markets that Scott referenced earlier. Our fourth quarter total company adjusted gross profit or AGP was down $88 million or 10.3% compared to Q4 of 2021 driven by a 39% decline in Global Forwarding and partially offset by a 5.7% growth in NAST. The market softness was also prominent on a sequential basis, with total company AGP down 13%, including a 24% decline in Global Forwarding and an 11% decline in NAST. On a monthly basis, compared to Q4 of 2021, our total company AGP per business day was down 10% in October, down 7% in November and down 14% in December.\nIn our NAST Truckload business, our volume declined on a year-over-year basis for the first time in 7 quarters with shipments down 4%. Within the fourth quarter, monthly volume declined sequentially from October through December as freight demand weakened.\nOur AGP per truckload shipment increased 6.5% versus Q4 last year due to an increase in our contractual truckload AGP per shipment. On a sequential basis, however, our truckload AGP per shipment came down 6.5% but remained above our 10-year average.\nDuring Q4, we had an approximate mix of 65% contractual volume and 35% transactional volume compared to a 55%-45% mix in the same period a year ago. Routing guide depth of tender in our Managed Services business, which is a proxy for our overall market, declined from 1.3 in the third quarter to 1.2 in the fourth quarter, which is the lowest level we've seen since the pandemic impacted second quarter of 2020.\nThe sequential declines in our truckload linehaul cost and price per mile that we experienced in Q1 through Q3 continued in Q4 as excess carrier capacity, combined with slowing demand, led to the softening market conditions. This resulted in an approximate 24% year-over-year decline in our average truckload linehaul cost paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges.\nOur average linehaul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, decreased year-over-year by approximately 21%. With the cost down 24% and price down 21%, we saw a 3% increase in our NAST truckload AGP per mile on a year-over-year basis.\nIn our Global Forwarding business, higher customer inventory levels, combined with softening demand, contributed to significantly reduced import prices for ocean and air freight. In Q4, Global Forwarding generated AGP of $188.7 million, representing a year-over-year decrease of 39% versus the record high fourth quarter in 2021, which was up 72%. With these results, our ocean forwarding AGP declined $89 million or 43% year-over-year compared to an 86.5% growth in Q4 of 2021. The Q4 results were driven by a 36.5% decrease in AGP per shipment and a 9.5% decrease in shipments.\nAGP in our airfreight business declined by $33 million or 51.5% year-over-year compared to a 92% growth in Q4 of 2021. This was driven by a 40% decline in AGP per metric ton and a 19.5% decrease in metric tons shipped.\nDespite the soft market, the forwarding team continues to add new customers and diversify our industry verticals and trade lanes. In Q4, approximately 50% of our AGP from new business was generated from trade lanes other than the trans-Pacific lane.\nNow turning to expenses. Q4 personnel expenses were $427.3 million, up 1.7% compared to Q4 last year, including $21.5 million of severance and related charges driven by the restructuring that we initiated in November. The restructuring-related costs were partially offset by a decrease in equity compensation as we reversed some previously accrued expense due to financial results that came in lower than previously expected.\nOn a sequential basis, Q4 personnel expenses declined $10.2 million. Excluding the restructuring charges in Q4, personnel expenses declined $31.7 million sequentially due to lower incentive compensation and lower salaries and benefits associated with reduced head count. Our Q4 average head count declined 2% versus our Q3 average.\nThe workforce reduction initiated in November affected approximately 650 employees. While nearly 150 of those employees had left the company prior to December 31, over 600 had exited as of early January. As we continue to make progress on delivering a scalable operating model, we expect our head count to decline throughout 2023 as productivity improves.\nFor 2023, we expect our personnel expenses to be $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, down approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to our 2022 total of $1.72 billion, primarily due to reduced head count. Excluding the restructuring charges in Q4 of 2022, the midpoint of our 2023 guidance for personnel expenses is down approximately 6% year-over-year.\nMoving on to SG&A. Q4 expenses of $176.8 million were up $27.9 million compared to Q4 of 2021 driven primarily by $15.2 million of restructuring charges and a year-over-year increase in legal settlements, partially offset by a decrease in credit losses. The restructuring charges and SG&A primarily included an impairment to internally developed software related to the reprioritization of our technology investments that Arun will speak to shortly.\nOur approach to investments and investment prioritization is more data-driven and more focused on delivering a scalable operating model than in the past, which is improving the value of the benefits we are delivering and allowing us to pivot more quickly if investments are not delivering as expected.\nFor 2023, we expect our total SG&A expenses to be $575 million to $625 million compared to $603.4 million in 2022. The slight decrease at the midpoint includes an expected decrease in legal settlements in the absence of 2 onetime items that occurred in 2022. Those include the $15.2 million Q4 restructuring charge and the $25.3 million Q2 gain from the sale and leaseback of our Kansas City regional center. 2023 SG&A expenses are expected to include approximately $90 million to $100 million of depreciation and amortization expense compared to $93 million in 2022.\nQ4 interest and other expense totaled $42.5 million, up $24.1 million versus Q4 of last year. Q4 of 2022 included $24.8 million of interest expense, up $10.7 million versus the prior year, primarily due to higher short-term average interest rates. Q4 results also include a $16.9 million loss on foreign currency revaluation, up $10.4 million compared to Q4 of last year driven by the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar.\nAs a reminder, the FX impacts are predominantly noncash gains and losses on intercompany balances, which is why they are not hedged. Q4 tax rate came in at 20.9%, bringing our full year tax rate to 19.4%. We expect our 2023 full year effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal, state or international tax policy.\nQ4 net income was $96.2 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.80. Adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share, excluding the $36.7 million of restructuring charges, was $1.03, down 41% compared to Q4 of '21, which was up 61% versus the prior year.\nTurning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow generated by operations was a record $773.4 million compared to $75.9 million in Q4 of 2021. As we have talked about in prior earnings calls, we were expecting an improvement in working capital when the cost and price of purchase transportation came down. The $698 million year-over-year improvement was driven by a $650 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in Q4 due to the declining cost and price of ocean, air and truckload in our model. Conversely, Q4 of last year included a $200 million sequential increase in net operating working capital as costs and prices were rising.\nIf you look back at the period when cost and price of purchased transportation was rising from the end of 2019 to Q2 of 2022, our net operating working capital increased by approximately $1.5 billion. Between Q3 and Q4, as the cost and price of purchased transportation has come down, we have realized over $1 billion of benefit to working capital and operating cash flow. That benefit has come on a lag basis based on our DSO and DPO.\nDriven by the increased free cash flow generation in Q4, we returned $507 million of cash to shareholders through $438 million of share repurchases and $69 million of cash dividends. The Q4 cash returned to shareholders significantly exceeded net income and was up by 128% versus Q4 last year driven by the record cash flow.\nConsistent with our capital allocation strategy, to the extent that we have excess cash after managing through our commitments, investments and holding to an investment-grade credit rating, we are committed to returning that cash to shareholders through share repurchases.\nCapital expenditures were $27.8 million in Q4, bringing our full year capital spending to $128.5 million, up $58 million compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to an increase in internally developed software. We expect our 2023 capital expenditures to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. We ended Q4 with approximately $1.34 billion of liquidity comprised of $1.12 billion of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $218 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q4 was $1.97 billion, up $55 million versus Q4 last year, primarily driven by our expanded capacity to borrow given the strong EBITDA performance. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.29x, down from 1.42x at the end of Q4 last year.\nAs I mentioned, our capital allocation strategy is based on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, which allows us to optimize our cost of capital. As we anticipate reduced earnings in 2023, given the strong results in the first half of 2022, we are planning for a lower level of debt to deliver our leverage targets. To the extent that we reduce our debt levels, this may reduce the amount of cash used for share repurchases.\nIn December, our Board authorized and declared a 10.9% increase in our regular quarterly dividend taking it to $0.61 beginning with the dividend that was paid in January. We have now distributed uninterrupted dividends without decline for more than 25 years.\nOver the long term, we remain committed to growing our quarterly cash dividend in alignment with long-term EBITDA growth and using our share repurchase program as important levers to enhancing shareholder value.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Arun to walk through our strategy to deliver a scalable operating model and strengthen our customer and carrier experience.\n\nArun Rajan\n\nCOO, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. During the fourth quarter, we continued to focus our efforts on working backwards from customers and carriers' needs to build a scalable operating model. A scalable operating model improves customer and carrier experience and improves service levels while simultaneously reducing our cost to serve. These efforts include operationalizing our information advantage at scale by giving customers insights around price and coverage and providing features to carriers that improve their utilization and cash flow.\nIncreased digitization is a key element of the scalable operating model. There are a number of data points that demonstrate our progress in 2022, including 183% increase in loads booked digitally by carriers and increased digitization across the board as evidenced by 2.3 billion digital transactions with customers and carriers, which represented a 30% increase year-over-year.\nIn 2023, we will continue to deliver meaningful improvements to our customer, carrier and employee experience by accelerating the digital execution of all touch points in the life cycle of a load, including order management, appointments, in-transit tracking, cash advances and financial and documentation processes.\nWe made progress on this front in Q4 as well with the automation of appointment-related tasks, increasing 34% year-over-year and in-transit tracking automation increasing by 450 basis points versus Q3.\nWe are focused on opportunities to automate or make self-serve those processes that are core to our operating model, which we expect will enable us to decouple volume and head count growth and drive increased productivity while simultaneously improving the customer experience and service levels.\nThroughout 2023, we'll provide updates on the progress we're making on shipments per person per day, which is a key metric to measure our productivity improvements.\nDuring the recent restructuring efforts, we continued our ongoing evaluation and prioritization of our tech and software projects. Through the assessment of those projects, we determined that some were no longer relevant to the acceleration of our scalable operating model, and we incurred the restructuring charges that Mike described earlier. The remaining projects are better aligned to improve the customer and carrier experience and reduce our cost to serve. And therefore, we're allocating more of our investments to those projects.\nWe've also taken steps to align compensation and incentives to support our strategic priority of creating a scalable operating model, which is foundational to being the low-cost operator, which ultimately gives us the pricing flexibility to unlock and accelerate long-term market share growth while delivering our long-term operating margin targets.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott for his final comments.\n\nScott P. Anderson\n\nInterim CEO & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun. As inflationary pressures continue to weigh on global economic growth and freight markets present cyclical challenges, we need to continue evolving our organization to bring great focus to our highest long-term strategic priorities, including keeping the needs of our customers and carriers at the center of what we do while lowering our overall cost structure by driving scale.\nI believe in the strategy that the team is executing on to deliver a scalable operating model. We expect this initiative will continue to drive improvements in our customer and carrier experience and amplify the expertise of our people, all of which will drive share gains and growth. And as Arun said, we expect these efforts will also improve our productivity, which will reduce our operating costs and lead to improved returns for our shareholders.\nI'd like to close by saying thank you to our employees for persevering during the period of extended market disruption and the market correction that is followed and for continuing to provide industry-leading service to our customers and carriers.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 2, 2022.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. On the call with me today is Bob Biesterfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Mike will provide a summary of our 2022 3rd quarter results and outline some new cost reduction actions. Arun will provide an update on the innovation and development occurring across our digital platform, and then we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found on the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing. I'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our second quarter earnings call in late July, I talked about a deceleration in demand that we were expecting to see in the second half of 2022 in 3 large verticals for freight, including weakness in the retail market and further slowing in the housing market. We're now seeing those expectations play out and with slowing freight demand and price declines in both freight forwarding and surface transportation markets. Throughout the changes in the freight cycle, we've maintained our focus on continuing to improve the customer and carrier experience while scaling our digital processes and operating model to foster sustainable and profitable growth.\nToday, we believe that we're entering a time of slower economic growth, where freight markets will continue to cool from their pandemic peaks and will operate more reliably at more normalized rates with fewer disruptions. These changes in market conditions, coupled with many successful endeavors on our digital road map directed at scaling our model to be more efficient are allowing us to take actions to structurally reduce our overall cost structure. Compared to our third quarter operating expenses, the actions we're currently taking are expected to generate $175 million of gross cost savings on an annualized basis by the fourth quarter of 2023. Inflation, other headwinds such as annual pay increases and tailwinds such as lower incentive compensation, are expected to result in net cost headwinds of $25 million in 2023 that we expect to partially offset the gross savings resulting in net annualized cost reductions of $150 million by fourth quarter of next year.\nWe also continue to identify opportunities to accelerate our enterprise-wide digital and product strategy To drive greater impact and speed of execution, Arun Rajan has been promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer. Since joining C.H. Robinson in 2021, Arun has been a critical contributor to and strategic leader of our digital and product strategy. Arun is helping us to think and act differently as we accelerate our pace of digital transformation and scale our operating model. In his new role, in addition to leading the product organization, Arun have expanded direct responsibility for both technology and marketing organizations, bringing these 3 critical functions together under a single vision and leadership structure, will allow us to integrate these functions more deeply into single-threaded teams and to put the needs of our customers and carriers at the center of our organizational design to ensure that we're positioned well to meet the needs, while accelerating the impacts across the business units of C.H. Robinson. Arun's teams will work directly with the business unit presidents to operationalize these efforts.\nNow let me turn to a high-level overview of our third quarter results for North American Surface Transportation and Global Forwarding. In our NAST Truckload business, we grew our year-over-year volume for the sixth quarter in a row, albeit with a modest shipment growth of 0.5%. Volume growth in drop trailer, flatbed and temperature control was partially offset by a decline in our dry van volumes. Within the quarter, we saw mid-single-digit volume increases in July turned to declines in August and September as freight demand weakened.\nOur adjusted gross profit or AGP per shipment increased 20.5% versus the third quarter of last year, due to a meaningful increase in our contractual Truckload AGP per shipment. On a sequential basis, our Truckload AGP per shipment came down 15% from the record peak we saw in the second quarter, but remains above our historical average. The sequential decline was particularly pronounced in the spot market, where our AGP per shipment declined 25% as we continue to pursue volume in the spot market and collaborated with our customers the spot market as part of their procurement strategy.\nDuring the third quarter, we had an approximate mix of 65% contractual volume and 35% transactional volume compared to a 60-40 mix in the same period last year.\nRouting guide depth of tender in our managed services business, which is a proxy for the overall market, declined from 1.4 in the second quarter to 1.3 in the third quarter, which is the lowest level we've seen since the pandemic impacted the second quarter of 2020. Changes in the national drive-in load-to-truck ratio also reflect the softening of the freight environment. While this ratio was between 3 and 4 to 1 for most of the third quarter, it has declined throughout October, with the latest reading of approximately 2.6:1 in week 44.\nThe sequential declines in Truckload line haul cost and price per mile that we saw in first and second quarter continued throughout the third quarter. This resulted in approximately 17% year-over-year decline in our average truckload linehaul costs paid to carriers, excluding fuel. Our average linehaul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharge, decreased year-over-year by approximately 13%. This resulted in a year-over-year increase in our NAST Truckload AGP per mile of 15.5%.\nConsistent with historical patterns, we expect to reprice approximately 60% of our contractual Truckload business in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. Encouragingly, our win rate on large contractual bids in the third quarter improved year-over-year as we pursue profitable share gains and respond to a changing market.\nIn our NAST LTL business, we generated quarterly AGP of $161 million in the third quarter, up 23% year-over-year. This was through a 24.5% increase in AGP per order and partially offset by a 1.5% decline in volume. The LTL volume decline was driven by decreases in final mile, temperature controlled and consolidation while our common carrier business, which is the largest component of LTL had flat volumes.\nIn our Global Forwarding business, we're now seeing the market correction that has been anticipated. High inventories, reduced consumer spending due to rising inflation and a muted peak season have all contributed to reduced import demand which have also led to declining prices for ocean and air freight. For the third quarter, Global Forwarding generated AGP of $248.4 million, representing a year-over-year decrease of 20% versus a record high for a third quarter in 2021. Within these results, our ocean forwarding AGP declined by $55 million or 26% year-over-year. This was driven by a 24% decrease in AGP per shipment and a 2.5% decrease in shipments. This is compared to a 12% volume growth in the third quarter of last year.\nThe slowdown in global ocean demand was most evident on the U.S. West Coast, where rates and volumes declined more than other trade lanes and allowed port congestions to ease. Activity on the U.S. East Coast remains stronger as freight continue to be diverted from West Coast ports and due to relatively stronger demand in the transatlantic trade lane. Improving ocean schedule reliability and the ability for shippers to accept longer transit times has resulted in conversion of some air freight back to the ocean. This combined with the slowdown in global demand has impacted air freight volumes and pricing. Airfreight capacity also continued to improve and drive prices lower in many trade lanes due to increased belly capacity on more frequent commercial flights.\nAGP in our airfreight business declined $12.5 million or 21% year-over-year, driven by a 16.5% decrease in metric tons shipped and a 5.5% decline in AGP per metric ton shipped.\nOverall, the forwarding team continues to provide differentiated solutions and customer service, selling aggressively in the market and leading to further additions of new customers and diversification of industry verticals and trade lanes. In the third quarter, for example, 60% of our AGP from new business was generated from trade lanes other than the trans-pacific lane. Additionally, we've obtained the status of being the leading ocean freight forwarder from India to the U.S. and from the U.S. to Australia.\nAs shown on Slide 10 of our earnings presentation, expanding our capabilities and presence in key industry verticals, trade lanes and geographies is an important part of our sustainable growth strategy.\nFor the enterprise, we continue to believe that through combining our digital solutions with our global network of logistics experts and our full suite of multimodal services, we are uniquely positioned in the marketplace to deliver for our shippers and carriers regardless of market conditions. We believe our strategy and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for customers and in turn, win more business, increase our market share and enable sustainable profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call to Arun to walk you through the product innovation and development that's occurring across our digital platform.\n\nArun Rajan\n\nCOO, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by saying that I'm excited to take on an expanded role as the company's Chief Operating Officer. I look forward to further building the integration between our digital product strategy and our technology and marketing teams to accelerate delivery and adoption of our meaningful products, features and insights to both sides of our 2-sided marketplace.\nDuring the third quarter, we continue to deliver enhancements to our Navisphere product platform, while extending the penetration of our digital offerings with both our carriers and our customers. Due to the digital improvements that have been delivered, the number of carriers looking loads, the Navisphere Carrier in Q3 increased 77% compared to the third quarter of last year. Since providing carriers with enhanced capabilities to place digital offers and loads via Navisphere Carrier, which improves the carrier experience and our productivity, we saw a 34% sequential increase in digital offers from Q2 to Q3.\nAnother data point that demonstrates our progress is the execution of 615,000 fully automated bookings with carriers in our NAST Truckload business during Q3, which is an increase of 87% compared to the same quarter last year, and represented $1.2 billion in digital bookings in Q3 alone.\nBroadly speaking, we're focused on providing scalable digital solutions that deliver improved customer and carrier experiences and service levels by working backwards from their needs. Much of this is about operationalizing our information advantage at scale through features such as backhaul load recommendations for carriers. On the customer side, it's about giving customers insights around price and coverage. And one way to do this is to scale our Market Rate IQ and Procure IQ products.\nScalable digital processes will enable us to decouple volume and headcount growth and drive increased productivity and we are laser-focused on opportunities to automate or make self-serve processes that are core to our operating model. This includes increasing the digital execution of all the touch points in the life cycle of a load including order management, appointments, in-transit tracking, cash advances and financial and documentation processes. Scaling these processes are foundational to being the lowest cost operator which ultimately gives us the pricing flexibility to accelerate growth and gain market share in the new side of the marketplace that we serve while delivering our long-term operating margin targets.\nI'll turn the call over to Mike now to review the specifics of our third quarter financial performance.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nCFO, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good morning, everyone. Our Q3 enterprise results reflect truckload volume growth in NAST along with sequential and year-over-year price declines on softening demand in the freight forwarding and surface transportation markets that Bob referenced earlier. Our third quarter total company AGP was up $43 million or 5%, with growth in NAST partially offset by the decline in Global Forwarding. On a sequential basis, total company AGP declined 14% from our record AGP in Q2 with declines in both NAST and Global Forwarding.\nOn a monthly basis compared to 2021, our total company AGP per business day was up 20% in July, down 1% in August and down 2% in September. Q3 personnel expenses were $437.5 million, up 9.4% compared to Q3 last year, primarily due to a 13% increase in average headcount.\nOn a sequential basis, personnel expenses declined $7.2 million due to lower incentive compensation. Our Q3 ending headcount also declined 1% from the end of Q2, which is consistent with our stated expectation of flat to declining headcount in the back half of the year. For the full year, we continue to expect our personnel expenses to be approximately $1.7 billion, which is the high end of our original guidance. This excludes onetime restructuring expenses of -- in Q4 of $15 million to $20 million related to the cost savings initiatives that Bob described.\nMoving on to SG&A. Q3 expenses of $162 million were up $28.5 million compared to Q3 of last year, driven primarily by increases in legal settlements, purchase services and travel expenses.\nFor 2022, we now expect our total SG&A expenses to be in the high end of our original guidance of $550 million to $600 million, including the $25.3 million gain in Q2 from the sale and leaseback of our Kansas City Regional Center, which is largely offset by nonrecurring legal settlement expenses. We also now expect 2022 full year depreciation and amortization to be $90 million to $95 million, which is down from our previous guidance of approximately $100 million.\nInterest and other expense totaled $16 million, down $0.7 million versus Q3 last year. Q3 this year included $20.8 million of interest expense, up $7.7 million versus last year, primarily due to higher average debt. The increased interest expense was partially offset by a $5.2 million gain on foreign currency revaluation.\nIn Q3 of last year, FX revaluation was a $3.8 million loss.\nOur Q3 tax rate came in at 16.9% compared to 16.0% in Q3 last year. Our year-to-date tax rate is 19.2%, and we continue to expect our 2022 full year effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal state or international tax policy.\nQ3 net income was $225.8 million, down 8.6% compared to Q3 last year and we delivered diluted earnings per share of $1.78, down 4% versus last year, but up 78% compared to Q3 of 2020.\nTurning to cash flow. Q3 cash flow generated by operations was a record $625.5 million compared to $73.5 million used by operations in Q3 of 2021. The $699 million year-over-year improvement was primarily due to a $359 million sequential decrease in net operating working capital in Q3, driven by the declining cost and price of purchased transportation in our model. Conversely, Q3 of last year included a $412 million sequential increase in net operating working capital as costs and prices were rising.\nFrom the end of 2019 to Q2 of 2022, our net operating working capital increased by approximately $1.5 billion. As the cost and price of purchased transportation has come down, we have realized the benefit to working capital and operating cash flow on a lag basis based on our DSO and DPO. To the extent that freight prices continue to decline, we would expect a commensurate reduction to working capital.\nCapital expenditures were $31.3 million in Q3 compared to $22.7 million in Q3 last year. We expect our 2022 capital expenditures to be at the high end of our previous guidance of $110 million to $120 million.\nDriven by the increased cash flow in Q3, we returned approximately $607 million of cash to shareholders through a combination of $536 million of share repurchases and $71 million of dividends. The Q3 cash return to shareholders significantly exceeded net income and was up 156% versus Q3 last year, driven by the record cash flow.\nFrom a capital allocation standpoint, we remain committed to growing our quarterly cash dividend in alignment with long-term EBITDA growth and using our share repurchase program to deploy excess cash.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $896 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a cash balance of $188 million. Our debt balance at the end of Q3 was $2.2 billion, up $472 million versus Q3 last year, primarily driven by share repurchases due to our expanded capacity to borrow, given our EBITDA performance. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q3 was 1.36x, down from 1.39x at the end of Q3 last year.\nFinally, as Bob discussed, we are taking actions to reduce our costs by $175 million. When including expected net headwinds of approximately $25 million, driven by inflation and merit increases in 2023, we expect to realize net annualized cost savings of $150 million by the fourth quarter of 2023. This savings is in comparison to the annualized run rate of our operating expenses in the third quarter this year. Related to these actions, we are expecting nonrecurring restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of this year of approximately $15 million to $20 million, which are incremental to our 2022 expense guidance, as I mentioned earlier. These net annualized cost savings are intended to be long-term structural changes. Investments to scale our digital processes, particularly in NAST, enable us to take these actions and adapt to changing market conditions to foster long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his final comments.\n\nRobert C. Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. As inflationary pressures weigh on consumer discretionary spending and global economic growth, we continue to believe that our global suite of services, our growing digital platform, our responsive team and our broad exposure to different industry verticals and geographies, supported by our resilient and flexible non-asset-based business model put us in a position to continue to deliver strong financial results. But we also need to continue evolving our organization to bring focus to our highest strategic priorities, including keeping the needs of our customers and carriers at the center of what we do, while lowering our overall cost structure by driving scale.\nThe work that our team is executing on related to scaling our digital processes and operating model while working backwards from the needs of our customers and carriers is entirely focused on driving improvements in our customer and carrier experience which in turn will drive market share gains and growth. We're focused on improving productivity, which in turn reduces our long-term operating costs and increased profits, leading to continued strong returns to shareholders. This concludes our prepared comments.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 27, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna, and good afternoon, everyone. On the call with me today is Bob Biesterfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Product Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Mike will provide a summary of our 2022 second quarter results and Arun will provide an update on the innovation and development occurring across our platform, and then we will open the call up for questions.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found on the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com.\nOur prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing. I'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements. Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chuck. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter was another quarter of record profits as our business model performed as we would expect it to in this part of the cycle. Our investments in our customer relationships through the early part of the cycle, while the cost of purchased transportation was rapidly increasing, are paying dividends as we retain and gain share with these customers through the terms of our agreements.\nOur strong results were again driven by significant operating margin expansion in our North American Surface Transportation or NAST business as we further improve the profitability of our truckload and less than truckload businesses and grew truckload volume in a declining market. Our Global Forwarding team continued to deliver strong financial results while benefiting from the market share that they've gained over the past couple of years.\nAdditionally, our Robinson Fresh, Managed Services and European Surface Transportation businesses all increased their adjusted gross profit on a year-over-year basis. Now let me turn to a high-level overview of our NAST and Global Forwarding results. Our NAST adjusted operating margin in Q2 was 44.3%, up 970 basis points year-over-year and 830 basis points sequentially due to improved profitability in both truckload and LTL.\nIn our NAST truckload business, our volume grew 2% year-over-year compared to the cash freight index that reflected a 2% decline in shipments. Our adjusted gross profit, or AGP per shipment increased 48% versus Q2 last year and 26% sequentially as the cost of purchase transportation declined during the quarter and the percent of truckload shipments with a negative margin returned to historical levels.\nOur truckload volume growth included increases in dry van, flatbed and temp control services. And throughout the quarter, we pursued volume in the spot market and collaborated with our customers to use the spot market as part of their procurement strategy.\nThis included a 21% increase in volume that was driven through our real-time proprietary dynamic pricing engine. During the second quarter, we had an approximate mix of 60% contractual volume and 40% transactional volume compared to a 55-45 mix in the same period last year. Routing guide depth of tender in our managed services business, which is a proxy for the overall market, declined to 1.4% in the second quarter from 1.7% in the first quarter.\nBroadly speaking, route guides are performing well, as first tender acceptance rates are near prepandemic levels, and the first backup provider is accepting rejected tenders most of the time. Since the exceptional market tension in January caused by COVID-related absenteeism and winter storms, the truckload market has seen greater balance return to the spot market.\nWith the exception of Roadcheck Week, where many drivers seemingly temporarily leave the market, the national dry van load-to-truck ratio hovered around 4:1 throughout the second quarter. Between 3:1 and 4:1 for dry van is considered a reasonably balanced market versus the ratio closer to 5.75:1 that we saw in the extraordinarily tight year of 2021.\nThe sequential declines in truckload linehaul cost and price per mile that we saw in February and March continued throughout the second quarter. This resulted in approximately 5% year-over-year decline in our average truckload linehaul costs paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges. And although pricing declined sequentially in Q2, our average linehaul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased year-over-year by approximately 1.5%, which was supported by our contractual truckload portfolio that was negotiated in prior quarters. This resulted in a year-over-year increase in our NAST truckload AGP per mile of 46.5%.\nSlide 7 of our earnings presentation shows the historical trend of our truckload AGP dollars per shipment. The past 3 years have been volatile ones in the freight market and our truckload AGP per shipment reached a new low and a new high within the past 8 quarters.\nPutting this quarterly volatility aside, though, our average AGP per shipment on a trailing 2, 5- and 10-year view continues to remain relatively constant, which demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and our ability to obtain adjusted gross profit through cycles. Through it all, we worked tirelessly to help our customers optimize their freight networks and their costs. Carriers improve their equipment utilization and to provide strong returns to our shareholders. As we prepare for the second half of the year, we expect the truckload cost per mile will decline further, both sequentially and year-over-year due to demand deceleration in the 3 biggest verticals for freight. Weakness in the retail market is expected to persist, further slowing in the housing market as expected, and there are early signs of deceleration in the industrial or manufacturing space, although this vertical is holding up the best on a relative basis.\nOur truckload contracts continue to trend towards 12-month durations, and we are proactively repricing some contracts in order to remain competitive in a changing market and to grow our wallet share with customers. Although we're the largest provider of truckload capacity in North America, we only account for approximately 3% of the for hire market, which leaves us with significant market share opportunities to fuel our growth.\nIn our NAST LTL business, we again generated record quarterly AGP of $166.9 million in second quarter or up 30% year-over-year through a 37% increase in AGP per order that was partially offset by a 5% decline in volume. As was the case in the last few quarters, the second quarter decrease in LTL volume was mainly driven by a normalization of business levels as our LTL volumes in the second quarter of 2021 were bolstered by a few large customers that benefited from the stay-at-home trend during COVID, which contributed to 23% LTL volume growth in the comparable quarter last year.\nIn our Global Forwarding business, the team continues to provide solutions and excellent customer service in a market that's becoming more balanced. In this quarter, Global Forwarding generated another quarterly AGP record of $324.4 million, representing year-over-year AGP growth of 36%. Operating income also grew by $59 million or 55%. Against increasingly tougher comparables, Q2 marks the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total revenues, AGP and operating income for our global forting business.\nWithin these results, our ocean forwarding business generated Q2 AGP growth of $77 million or 51% year-over-year. This was driven by a 47.5% increase in adjusted gross profit per shipment and a 2.5% increase in shipments, which was on top of a 29% volume growth in the second quarter of last year. Global ocean demand is becoming more in line with the industry's overall capacity, and ocean rates while still elevated, have started to come down.\nChina ports appear to be back to normal operations. And while port congestion on the U.S. West Coast improved in the second quarter, congestion is edging back up again. Congestion on the East Coast has risen due to a higher percentage of freight being routed to their ports as shippers attempted to mitigate risk from a potential labor dispute in the West Coast.\nWith limited new vessel deliveries in 2022, we expect ocean rates will remain elevated compared to historical levels, but may taper a bit more in the second half of the year. Finally, our international airfreight business delivered AGP growth of $4 million or 7.5% year-over-year, driven by a 14% increase in AGP per metric ton shipped, which was partially offset by a 6% decrease in metric tons shipped.\nAirfreight capacity has improved in certain trade lanes due to increased belly capacity and we're seeing some conversion of air freight back to the ocean. Overall, the Forwarding team has a great foundation to continue providing excellent service to our customers and to collaborate with them to leverage our flexible solutions for their shipping needs.\nOur win rates in our forwarding business are strong, and we continue to implement our pipeline of new customer business. For the enterprise, we continue to believe that through combining our digital products with our global network of logistics experts and our full suite of multimodal services, along with our information advantage from our scale and data, we are uniquely positioned in the marketplace to deliver for our shippers and our carriers, regardless of the market conditions.\nWe believe that our strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for customers and, in turn, win more business and increase our market share while delivering higher profitability and shareholder returns.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Arun to walk you through the product innovation and development that's occurring across our platform.\n\nArun Rajan\n\nChief Product Officer, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As I said before, the role of our products is to relentlessly address customer and carrier needs, and we continue to make good progress on both fronts. During the quarter, we continue to deliver enhancements to our Navisphere product platform while expanding the penetration of our digital offerings with both our carriers and our customers.\nOur work is improving both the customer and carrier experience with Robinson as evidenced by the results outlined on Slide 12 in our earnings presentation. I won't touch on each of these data points in my prepared comments, but I'll highlight a few that are extremely relevant and show progress and the benefits of our digital investments.\nIn the second quarter, we executed nearly 600,000 fully automated bookings in our NAST truckload business, an increase of 107% compared to the same quarter last year. This represents $1.1 billion in revenue flowing through this digital channel. Because of the digital improvements that have been delivered, we've increased the number of carriers looking loads to our digital channels by 96% year-over-year.\nOn the customer side of our marketplace, through further integrating and scaling a real-time dynamic pricing engine, we priced 71% of our spot truckload volume through this digital tool, resulting in $597 million of truckload business. Extending this capability allows us to be more responsive to changes in the market, better meet the needs of our customers while also creating additional stickiness in our customer relationships.\nMore broadly, we're focused on designing and delivering scalable digital solutions for growth, such as the progress I just described by transforming our processes, accelerating the pace of development and prioritizing data integrity. The 4 main pillars of this effort are scaling capacity and procurement, scaling demand generation, scaling quality customer outcomes and scaling our marketplace dynamics as outlined on Slide 11 of our earnings presentation.\nThese 4 pillars are focused on improving both the customer and carrier experience by working backwards from their needs and increasing the digital execution of all touch points in the life cycle of the load, including order management, appointments, carrier offers and looking, in-transit tracking and financial and documentation processes.\nAs we do this, we will continue to fly the appropriate rigor to direct our test and investments towards products, features and insights that increase the rate at which we acquire, retain and grow share of customers and carriers, which in turn serve as the primary inputs to power our future growth in the 2-sided marketplace that we serve.\nI'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our second quarter financial performance.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nCFO, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, we continued to leverage the strength of our non asset-based business model to deliver another record quarter of financial results.\nOur second quarter total company adjusted gross profit or AGP, was up 38%, reaching a record high of $1 billion with growth in each of our segments and services. On a sequential basis, AGP was up 14% and also grew in each business segment. On a monthly basis, compared to 2021, our total company AGP per business day was up 43% in April, up 39% in May and up 31% in June.\nAfter 7 consecutive quarters of increasing price and cost per mile in our North American truckload business, both declined sequentially in Q2, with costs declining faster than price due to a softer demand environment and capacity that has grown over the past 12 months. The linehaul cost and price per mile, which excludes fuel surcharges, declined sequentially in each month of Q2.\nAs the cost of purchase transportation declined, our contractual truckload AGP per shipment improved and our NAST team managed our load acceptance rates to optimize our truckload AGP and look to the spot market to find additional volume opportunities.\nQ2 marked the seventh consecutive quarter of flat to increasing truckload AGP per mile. Truckload AGP per shipment improved 26% sequentially and by 48% compared to Q2 of 2021. Now turning to expenses. Q2 personnel expenses were $444.8 million, up 22.6% compared to Q2 last year, primarily due to increased headcount as we support growth and transformation opportunities across our business. We also incurred higher incentive compensation due to an increase in our projected annual financial results.\nFor the full year, we now expect our personnel expenses to be at the high end of our previous guidance of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion due to the higher expected incentive compensation. As we discussed in our last earnings call, we expect headcount additions to be weighted more towards the front half of 2022. For the remainder of the year, we expect our headcount to be flat to down.\nIf growth opportunities or economic conditions play out differently than we expect, we'll adjust accordingly. Moving on to SG&A. Q2 expenses of $117.2 million, were down $8.5 million compared to Q2 of 2021, excluding the $25.3 million gain from the sale and leaseback of our Kansas City Regional Center, Q2 SG&A was up 13.4%, driven by year-over-year increases in purchased services and travel expenses.\nFor 2022, we continue to expect total SG&A expenses to be $550 million to $600 million, excluding the gain from the sale and leaseback of our Kansas City Regional Center. We also continue to expect $100 million of depreciation and amortization in 2022. Q2 interest and other expense totaled $27.4 million, up approximately $13.9 million versus Q2 last year, primarily due to a $10.3 million loss on foreign currency revaluation due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar primarily versus the Euro and Yuan.\nThis FX loss was $8.4 million higher than the $1.9 million loss in Q2 of last year. Interest expense increased $4.3 million due to a higher average debt balance, but with lower net debt-to-EBITDA leverage. Our Q2 tax rate came in at 21.3% compared to 21.6% in Q2 last year, which brings our year-to-date tax rate to 20.0%.\nWe continue to expect our 2022 full year effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, assuming no meaningful changes to state federal or international tax policy. Q2 net income was $348.2 million, up 80% compared to Q2 last year, and we delivered record quarterly diluted earnings per share of $2.67, up 85% year-over-year. As a reminder, our Q2 net income included the $25.3 million gain from the sale and leaseback of our Kansas City Regional Center and a $10.3 million loss on foreign currency revaluation.\nTurning to cash flow. Q2 cash flow generated by operations was approximately $265 million compared to $149 million in Q2 of 2021. The $116 million year-over-year improvement was primarily due to the $154 million increase in net income. Over the past 2.5 years, our net operating working capital increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by the increasing cost of purchase transportation.\nThis reduced our operating cash flow by the same amount over that time. If the cost and price of purchased transportation come down, we expect a commensurate benefit to working capital and operating cash flow. In Q2, our accounts receivable and contract assets were down 1.5% sequentially and our days sales outstanding, or DSO, was flat sequentially. Capital expenditures were $43.2 million in Q2 compared to $16.3 million in Q2 last year.\nWe are raising our 2022 capital expenditure guidance from $90 million to $100 million to $110 million to $120 million, primarily due to higher level of internally developed software, which is tied to higher future returns.\nWe returned approximately $409 million of cash to shareholders in Q2 through a combination of $337 million of share repurchases and $72 million of dividends.\nThat level of cash to shareholders equates to approximately 118% of our Q2 net income and was up 100% versus Q2 last year. Over the long term, we remain committed to growing our quarterly cash dividend in alignment with long-term EBITDA growth and in using our opportunistic share repurchase program to deploy excess cash.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.1 billion of liquidity comprised of $826 million of committed funding under our credit facilities and a $239 million cash balance. Our debt balance at the end of the quarter was $2.27 billion, up $901 million versus Q2 last year, primarily driven by increased working capital and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q2 was 1.35x, down from 1.49x at the end of Q1 due primarily to increased EBITDA.\nLet me take a moment to comment on our return on invested capital, or ROIC, which is an important metric for many investors. With our asset-light business model, we operate with a relatively low capital base which naturally enhances ROIC relative to other asset-based logistics providers. In fact, 88% of our operating asset base is comprised of accounts receivable and noncash intangible assets with AR representing 67%.\nAs a result, all else equal, ROIC for Robinson is impacted more by changes in receivables driven by changes in the price of purchased transportation than from proportionate changes in our capital expenditures. In Q2, we delivered our highest ROIC in a decade at 32.1%, up 890 basis points from Q2 last year despite the contribution of a historically higher receivables balance to our operating asset base.\nGoing forward, if the price of purchase transportation continues to fall than receivables, which represent 2/3 of our operating asset base will follow and represent a tailwind to ROIC, all else equal.\nBy driving scalability into our model with focus on the 4 main pillars that Arun talked about, we expect to generate growth and efficiencies that support long-term growth in our total shareholder return. Thank you for listening.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his final comments.\n\nRobert C. Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. So as questions linger about global economic growth, inflationary pressures and consumer discretionary spending, our global suite of multimodal services, our growing digital platform, a responsive team of logistics experts, our broad exposure to different industry verticals and geographies and our resilient and flexible non-asset-based business model put us in a position to continue delivering strong financial results.\nWhile we're pleased with our performance this quarter and the fact that both NAST and Global Forwarding delivered operating margins above our publicly stated targets, we know that we have work to do to consistently deliver at these targeted levels. The work that the teams are executing that Arun referenced, related to scaling our model, eliminating internal legacy processes and improving quality while working backwards from the needs of our customers and carriers will drive continued improvement in operating profits long term.\nAs this work is focused on growth, customer satisfaction and productivity improvements, which will in turn reduce our cost to serve our customers. As we look to the second half of the year, we are watching economic conditions closely, and the management team and the Board continue to consider all strategies to grow operating profits and maximize long-term shareholder returns through all phases of the business cycle and various economic scenarios.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, April 27, 2022.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S.

Slide 2 in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our actual results to differ from management's expectations.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert C. Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chuck, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. During first quarter, we delivered record quarterly profits. Sequential improvement was driven by significant operating margin expansion in our North American Surface Transportation, or NAST, business as we improved the health of our contractual truckload business, continued to grow our truckload volume and improved the profitability of our less than truckload, or LTL, business. Our Global Forwarding team continued delivering excellent service to our customers and collaborating with our carriers, driving more business to our platform. And finally, our Robinson Fresh, Managed Services and Europe Surface Transportation businesses all improved their top line growth and operating income on a year-over-year basis.\nNow let me turn to a high-level overview of our NAST and Global Forwarding results. Our NAST adjusted operating margin in the first quarter was 36%, up 350 basis points year-over-year and 480 basis points sequentially due to improved profitability in both our Truckload and LTL services. In our NAST truckload business, our volume grew 4% year-over-year. And our adjusted gross profit, or AGP, per shipment increased 15% versus first quarter of last year and 6.5% sequentially as we repriced more of our contractual portfolio and continued to focus on profitable market share.\nTruckload volume growth included year-over-year increases in both our contractual volume and our transactional volume. This included a 65% increase in volume that was driven through our proprietary dynamic pricing engine. And 65% of our spot or transactional business was priced through this dynamic pricing engine in the first quarter, delivering real-time pricing with capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity in North America.\nDuring the first quarter, we had an approximate mix of 60% contractual volume and 40% transactional volume. This is compared to a 55-45 mix in the same period last year. Routing guide depth of tender in our Managed Services business, which is a proxy for the overall market, was flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis at approximately 1.7, as it was for all of 2021. But within the quarter, this metric declined in February and March and reached 1.5 by the end of the quarter. As more capacity entered the market, demand begin to soften in March and first tender acceptance rates climbed across the industry.\nThese changes in supply and demand drove a similar trend in dry van load-to-truck ratios, which increased from 6:1 at year-end to a high of 12:1 in early January due to winter storms and rising cases of COVID. They then declined throughout the quarter to approximately 4:1 by the end of March. This environment led to a decline in the truckload linehaul cost and price per mile in both February and March off of another record high in January. For the quarter, our average truckload linehaul cost paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased approximately 21% compared to first quarter of last year. Our average linehaul rate billed to our customers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased approximately 20.5% year-over-year. This resulted in a year-over-year increase in our NAST truckload adjusted gross profit per mile of 17%. The combination of our repricing efforts and the sequential decline in the cost of purchased transportation in February and March led to a sequential improvement in our AGP per mile in each month of the first quarter.\nIn our NAST LTL business, record quarterly AGP of $150.7 million grew by $31 million or 25.5% year-over-year through a 27% increase in AGP per order that was partially offset by a 1% decline in volume. The Q1 decrease in LTL volume was mainly driven by a normalization of business levels as our LTL volumes in the first quarter of 2021 continued to be bolstered by a few large customers that benefited from the stay-at-home trend during COVID. This contributed 15% LTL volume growth in the comparable quarter last year. Our value proposition and comprehensive set of LTL services continues to resonate with shippers of all sizes and across industry verticals.\nIn our Global Forwarding business, the team continues to provide creative solutions and excellent service in an environment in which demand still exceeds capacity. This resulted in year-over-year AGP growth in the first quarter of $108 million or 50% and operating income growth of $77 million or 85%. Q1 marks the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total revenues, AGP and operating income.\nWithin these results, our Ocean Forwarding business generated Q1 AGP growth of $86 million or 64% year-over-year. This was driven by 52.5% growth in AGP per shipment and 7% growth in shipments, which topped a 27% volume growth in Q1 last year.\nGlobal ocean demand continues to exceed the industry's overall capacity with limited vessel and container availability. Port congestion on the West Coast improved during first quarter, but has been on the rise since the end of March. Due to customers' desires to mitigate risk, ocean carriers have also shifted vessel capacity from the West Coast to the East Coast ports, partly due to continuing congestion issues and concerns surrounding potential labor disputes on the West Coast.\nCOVID lockdowns in China have also led to a slowdown in export volumes from Asia to the U.S. And as of April 19, there were 506 vessels awaiting berthing space at Chinese ports, up 95% from the 260 waiting offshore in February. When exporting to the U.S. returns to normal levels, congestion is likely to increase. And with limited new vessel deliveries in 2022, we expect capacity to be strained for much of the year. And although ocean rates may taper a little, we expect them to remain elevated.\nSpecific to Robinson, we have not seen a decrease in ocean cargo demand. Our win rates and our bookings are still strong while beneficial cargo owners or BCOs continue to move more volume to us, and we already have a healthy pipeline of business left to implement. Due to the growing strength of our global multimodal platform and the team's collaborative relationships with our carriers, we've been able to increase our capacity to better serve our customers.\nThe Global Forwarding team has also leveraged our technology investments and data advantage to improve pricing velocity, efficiency and precision, which has enabled us to participate in more quotes and to turn them around faster. In the first quarter, we also launched universal vessel tracking and prediction to automate container tracking and arrival prediction, which in turn feeds into our predictive algorithms for inland transportation.\nFinally, our international airfreight business delivered AGP growth of $15 million or 34% year-over-year, driven by 21.5% increase in AGP per metric ton and a 10% increase in metric tons shipped. This is on top of a 46% increase in metric tons shipped in the first quarter of last year.\nAirfreight capacity remains tight due to limited belly capacity, but we do expect this to slowly improve in the summer. We're also starting to see some conversion of air freight back to ocean, but we expect some pent-up demand when China fully reopens.\nOverall, the forwarding team has a great foundation to continue providing excellent service to our customers and to work with them to leverage our flexible solutions for their shipping needs. Our customers and our results are benefiting from the investments we've made in digitization, data and analytics as well as our global network, which supports our expansion initiatives in targeted geographies and industry verticals.\nFor the enterprise, we continue to believe that through combining our digital products with our global network of logistics experts, our full suite of multimodal services and our information advantage from our scale and data, we're uniquely positioned in the marketplace to deliver for our shippers and partners regardless of the market conditions. We believe our strategies and competitive advantages will enable us to create more value for customers and, in turn, win more business, increase our market share and deliver higher profitability and return on invested capital.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Arun to walk you through the product innovation and development that's occurring across our platform.\n\nArun Rajan\n\nChief Product Officer, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As I said last quarter, the role of our products is to relentlessly address customer and carrier needs, and our strategy is to go deep with data and research to inform technology investments that deliver value to both our customers and our carriers at scale.\nWe are more intentionally connecting our business, data science, digital marketing and technology teams to bring meaningful products, features and insights to both sides of the 2-sided marketplace that we serve and to our employees who are critical to our success. We are also taking a lean approach to delivering products and digital features, rapidly testing and evolving our digital features and functionality to deliver the outcomes we see.\nIn early February, we launched enhancements to our Navisphere Carrier product, including the ability for carriers to digitally place offers and loads and provide personalized load recommendations based on the unique behaviors of carriers on our platform. The initial results of these enhancements are promising. Visits per day to Navisphere Carrier are up 45% from January to March. We also saw a significant increase in the number of carriers booking loads via Navisphere Carrier, with a 51% increase from January to March. These input metrics, combined with a few others, resulted in a 100% increase in loads booked digitally by carriers from January to March and a 346% increase from March of 2021 to March of 2022.\nUltimately, providing a strong self-service solution for our carriers will give us access to additional carriers and create greater loyalty, which is critical to our ability to continue growing volume. Access to more capacity gives us the opportunity to cover more freight on behalf of our customers by meeting carriers where and how they want to engage with us. Working backwards from our carriers and customers' needs, we will continue to apply the appropriate rigor to direct our tasks and investments towards products that drive out the acquisition, retention and growth of carrier and customer share. Positive impact to these metrics is and will be the clearest signal that we are making the right investment decisions in the context of carrier and customer-facing products.\nThe digital investments we're making and the rigorous test-and-learn approach we are taking to inform these investments are essential to our continued and future success. The products we develop will aim to strengthen relationships with customers and carriers by delivering value on their terms. When we combine innovation and value with high performance and excellent service, we create sticky relationships with customers and carriers because they trust us.\nSuccess of every new product, feature or insight that we deliver will be evaluated on its efficacy to increase the rate at which we acquire, retain and grow share of customers and carriers, which in turn serve as the primary inputs to power our future growth.\nI'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our first quarter financial performance.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nCFO, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter, we continued to build on our results in 2021 with another quarter of record financial results from the top line to the bottom line as we continue to execute on our strategy in a favorable freight market.\nOur Q1 total company adjusted gross profit, or AGP, was up 29%, reaching a record high at $906 million. On a per day basis, Q1 total company AGP improved by 27% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. On a monthly basis, compared to 2021, our total company AGP per business day was up 22% in January, up 33% in February and up 27% in March.\nFor the seventh consecutive quarter, prices and costs rose across the North American truckload business and for the sixth consecutive quarter, they reached all-time quarterly highs. As Bob mentioned, the linehaul cost per mile and price per mile, which exclude fuel surcharges, increased in January and then dropped in February and March. However, if you include fuel surcharges, cost and price per mile continued to rise through the quarter, ending with another all-time high month in March.\nOur NAST team navigated through this environment in Q1 by managing our truck acceptance rates to optimize contractual truckload returns and on our commitments to customers. As we have done each of the past 7 inflationary quarters, we repriced a portion of the contract portfolio to reflect the higher cost of purchase transportation. As we repriced, our truckload AGP per mile continued to improve. Q1 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of flat to increasing AGP per mile. Truckload AGP per shipment improved sequentially each month of the quarter, with the full quarter up by 15% compared to Q1 of 2021.\nAGP per mile and AGP per shipment are key metrics for managing our NAST business. They reflect our business performance better than AGP margin percentage, which naturally rises or falls with the changing market cycle and fuel pricing. A rising fuel surcharge reduces the truckload AGP margin percentage even though we pass through the cost, leaving no impact on our AGP dollars per shipment. For example, the 75% year-over-year increase in fuel surcharge per mile resulted in approximately 50 basis point reduction to our truckload AGP margin percentage compared to Q1 last year without negatively impacting AGP dollars per shipment.\nOn Slide 7 of our earnings presentation, we've provided a chart that shows the historic trend of our truckload AGP per shipment and our NAST AGP margin percent. Here, you can see that our Q1 NAST AGP margin percent has declined approximately 90 basis points compared to Q1 2 years ago, while our truckload AGP dollars per shipment grew by 42% over the same time period.\nWith our customer-focused strong team and digital investments, we expect to continue to drive long-term growth and efficiency into our model.\nNow turning to expenses. Q1 personnel expenses were $413.4 million, up 14.6% compared to Q1 last year, primarily due to increased headcount as we continue to support opportunities across our business. On a sequential basis, Q1 personnel expenses were down 1.6% versus Q4, with average headcount up 4.3%. For the full year, we continue to expect our personnel expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, including some headcount additions that we expect to be weighted more towards the front half of 2022. If growth opportunities play out differently than we expect, we will adjust accordingly.\nMoving on to SG&A. Q1 expenses of approximately $147.4 million were up 24.7% compared to Q1 of 2021, primarily due to higher purchase services, a nonrecurring legal expense and increased travel expenses. For 2022, we continue to expect total SG&A expenses to be $550 million to $600 million, primarily due to a higher level of spending on technology initiatives in travel.\n2022 travel spending is expected to return to approximately half of our pre-pandemic levels. 2022 SG&A expenses are also expected to include approximately $100 million of depreciation and amortization. First quarter interest and other income expense net totaled $14.2 million, up approximately $2.9 million versus Q1 last year, primarily due to higher average debt balance.\nOur Q1 tax rate came in at 18.4% compared to 18.3% in Q1 last year. Recall that our first quarter typically has a lower effective tax rate due to the tax benefits related to the delivery of our annual stock-based compensation in the quarter. We continue to expect our 2022 full year effective tax rate to be 19% to 21%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal state or international tax policy. Q1 net income was $270.3 million, up 56% compared to Q1 last year, and we delivered record quarterly diluted earnings per share of $2.05, up 60% year-over-year.\nTurning to cash flow. Q1 cash flow used by operations was approximately $14 million compared to $57 million used in Q1 of 2021. The $43 million year-over-year improvement was primarily due to a $97 million increase in net income and partially offset by the change in working capital, which increased $288.5 million in Q1 compared to an increase of $251.8 million in Q1 of 2021. The Q1 increase this year resulted from a $479 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets, less $190 million increase in total accounts payable. When the cost of purchased transportation and subsequently, prices, including fuel surcharge, come down, we would expect a commensurate benefit to working capital and operating cash flow.\nAccounts receivable and contract assets were up 10.8% sequentially, while total revenue was up 4.8%. The resulting 2.1 day increase in days sales outstanding, or DSO, was driven primarily by sequential increases in total revenue that were more concentrated in the last 2 months of Q1 compared to Q4. From a quality of receivable standpoint, our percent past due is in line with our 2-year average, and our credit losses as a percent of revenue are at 4-year lows. Over the long term, we continue to expect AGP growth to outpace working capital growth.\nCapital expenditures were $26.2 million in Q1 compared to $13.5 million in Q1 last year. We continue to expect our 2022 capital expenditures to be $90 million to $100 million, primarily driven by technology investments. We returned approximately $251 million of cash to shareholders in Q1 through a combination of $178 million of share repurchases and $73 million of dividends. That level of cash to shareholders equates to approximately 93% of our Q1 net income and was up 13% versus Q1 last year.\nDuring Q1 this year, we repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares at an average price of $101.93 per share. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly cash dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program as important levers to enhance shareholder return.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. At the end of Q1, our cash balance was $243 million, up $25 million compared to Q1 of 2021. We will continue to look for ways to efficiently repatriate excess cash from foreign entities. We ended Q1 with $671 million of liquidity, comprised of $428 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023, and our Q1 cash balance.\nOur debt balance at quarter end was $2.17 billion, up $822 million versus Q1 last year, primarily driven by increased working capital and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q1 rose to 1.49x compared to 1.42x at the end of Q4. From a capital allocation standpoint, we remain committed to disciplined capital stewardship and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and generating sustainable long-term growth in our total shareholder returns.\nThank you for listening, and now I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his final comments.\n\nRobert C. Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. So as questions linger about the impact on global economic growth from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, higher energy prices and inflationary pressures, among other impacts, we believe that our global suite of multimodal services, our growing digital platform and our resilient and flexible non-asset-based business model will continue to deliver strong financial results through the cycle.\nWe will continue to benefit from our product and technology investments while delivering on opportunities to integrate our services to help our customers solve their complex global supply chain issues. We are uniquely positioned to orchestrate end-to-end supply chain success for our customers and to help them not only navigate on certain market conditions but to succeed in doing so. Our Robinson team and their responsiveness and ability to provide true value continues to be a key differentiator in our ability to win in the market.\nOne of the core values that we live by is we evolve constantly. To advance our industry leadership in a more digital environment, we're evolving to a product-led organization by reorienting the intersection of our growth strategy and our engineering and technology teams with the needs of our customers and carriers, and we'll continue to differentiate ourselves in the market by having great people that our customers can rely on.\nI'm excited by the initial results that Arun described related to the enhancements that were rolled out in February for our Navisphere Carrier product. We'll continue to build on our customer-centric commitment by continuing to invest in smart, customer- and carrier-focused products, and we'll launch several new products that we believe will benefit our customers and carriers as we continue to build out the most powerful supply chain platform.\nThis concludes our prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the Q&A portion of the call."

Robinson Fourth Quarter 2021 Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, February 2, 2022. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chuck Ives, Director of Investor Relations.\n\nCharles S. Ives\n\nDirector of IR, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Donna, and good morning, everyone. On the call with me today is Bob Biesterfeld, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Arun Rajan, our Chief Product Officer; and Mike Zechmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob and Mike will provide a summary of our 2021 fourth quarter results and outlook for 2022, and Arun will outline the innovation and development occurring across our platform, and then we will open the call up for live questions.\nOur earnings presentation slides are supplemental to our earnings release and can be found in the Investors section of our website at investor.chrobinson.com. Our prepared comments are not intended to follow the slides. If we do refer to specific information on the slides, we will let you know which slide we're referencing.\nI'd also like to remind you that our remarks today may contain forward-looking statements.

Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Within our industry, 2021 will be remembered as a year with some of the greatest disruption and tightest capacity ever seen. For me, it will be remembered as a year in which the global supply chain is at the forefront of conversations and where our organization effectively helped our customers and carriers navigate the unprecedented level of supply chain disruption, allowing us to provide the superior level of service that global customers have come to expect from C.H. Robinson.\nThe strength and the resilience of our model was evident in the fourth quarter and the full year as we generated record annual financial results in 2021. The positive momentum of our business remains strong as demand for our global suite of services and for our digital freight platform continues to grow.\nNow let me turn to a high-level overview of the results. In our NAST truckload business, we saw a strong demand for our services with a 6% year-over-year volume growth in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross profit or AGP per load continued to improve in both truckload and LTL as we repriced more of our contractual portfolio and focused on profitable market share. This repricing enabled us to reduce the amount of truckloads with negative margins in Q4 to their lowest level since Q2 of 2020. Yet that level does remain above our historical averages, and we remain focused on reducing them further.\nFor the quarter, NAST truckload grew AGP by $57 million or 22% year-over-year. This was driven by a 6% increase in volume and a 15% increase in AGP per load. This was the third consecutive quarter that we delivered year-over-year growth in both NAST truckload volume and NAST truckload AGP, demonstrating balanced growth in an extremely tight market.\nTruckload volume growth was driven by a 2% increase in contractual volume and a 12% increase in spot market volume due in part to an 85% increase in volume that was driven through our proprietary dynamic pricing engine. Nearly half of our spot or transactional business was priced through our dynamic pricing engine in the fourth quarter, where we delivered real-time pricing with capacity assurance from the largest network of truckload capacity in North America.\nFor the full year, approximately $875 million of revenue was recognized through this digital channel, which was 193% increase over 2020. During the fourth quarter, we had an approximate mix of 55% contractual volume and 45% transactional volume in our truckload business, which is consistent with our mix in the year-ago period.\nWe saw routing guide depth of tender in our Managed Services business remained at 1.7 in the fourth quarter as it did for most of 2021. As a proxy for the industry environment, this occurred despite all of the repricing actions that occurred throughout 2021, reflecting the extended period of market disruption.\nIn Q4, our average truckload line-haul cost per mile paid to carriers, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 18% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Our average line-haul rate build to our customers, excluding fuel surcharge -- excluding fuel surcharges, increased 18.5% year-over-year. This again resulted in the highest cost and price per mile on record and a 19% year-over-year increase in our NAST truckload adjusted gross profit per mile.\nIn the fourth quarter, we continued our efforts to attract carriers to our platform and achieved a new record of over 10,000 carrier sign-ups. Carrier utilization of our Navisphere platform continued to increase as well with a 40% year-over-year increase in both daily and monthly average users of our carrier products. As we continue to introduce enhancements to our digital products, we expect the carry experience to improve and the usage to continue growing.\nLooking at the market, load-to-truck ratios still remain at historic highs driven by the structural constraints around the expansion of truckload capacity, strong import demand, persistent congestion at the ports and the impacts of COVID and winter storms. We do expect truckload capacity to remain tight, and we expect to further increase the volume we handle in this environment. In short, we expect stronger for longer as we look at the market into 2022.\nIn our NAST LTL business, fourth quarter AGP grew by $21 million or 18% year-over-year. This was delivered through a 23.5% increase in adjusted gross profit per order. It was partially offset by a 4% decline in volume.\nThe Q4 decrease in LTL volume was mainly driven by a normalization of business levels as our LTL volumes in the fourth quarter of 2020 were bolstered by a few large customers that benefited significantly from some of the stay-at-home trends during COVID, which contributed to roughly 20% LTL volume growth in the comparable quarter last year. Overall demand in the LTL market remains strong with capacity remaining at a premium.\nOur value proposition in LTL continues to resonate with shippers of all sizes and across industry verticals. For the full year, I'm proud to announce that our LTL adjusted gross profit exceeded $500 million for the first time.\nNow transitioning to our forwarding business. The team here continues to execute well and provide creative solutions in an environment in which demand still exceeds capacity. This resulted in year-over-year AGP growth in Q4 of $130 million or 72% and marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in total revenues, AGP and operating income.\nBased on both inventory-to-sales ratios, robust demand expectations and the potential for further disruptions at West Coast ports due to upcoming labor negotiations, we believe the current forwarding environment will continue through at least the first half and potentially through a greater portion of 2022.\nIn our ocean forwarding business, we grew our AGP by $97 million or 87% year-over-year. This was delivered through a 78% increase in AGP per shipment and a 5% increase in shipment volume. Ocean demand continues to exceed the industry's overall capacity with limited vessel and container availability, compounded by a continued backlog of ships waiting outside of U.S. ports to unload cargo.\nStrong U.S. import demand is expected to persist as the ports work to debottleneck, which will likely cause ocean pricing to remain elevated and conversions from ocean to air to continue. Our team has the existing foundation to continue to provide excellent service to our customers and to work with them to develop flexible, multimodal solutions for their shipping needs.\nFinally, our international airfreight business delivered AGP growth of $31 million or 92% year-over-year. This was driven by a 38% increase in metric tons shipped and 40% increase in AGP per metric ton. Airfreight capacity also remains strained, but Robinson has been supporting our customers' needs by leveraging our broad network of air services providers.\nThe forwarding team continues to have a large backlog of new business to implement from both new and existing customers and expects to continue to grow wallet share. Our customers and our results are benefiting from the investments we've made in digitization, data and analytics as well as our global network, which supports our expansion initiatives in targeted geographies and industry verticals.\nBefore I transition to Mike to go deeper into the results, I would like to welcome Arun Rajan, our Chief Product Officer, to walk you through the innovation and the development occurring across our platform today and into the future. And we continue to believe that through combining our digital products with our global network of logistics experts and our information advantage driven by our scale and data that we are uniquely positioned in the marketplace to deliver for our shippers and partners regardless of market conditions.\nWe believe our strategies and competitive advantage will enable us to better create value for our customers and in turn, win more business and increase market share while delivering higher profitability and return on invested capital. A key unlock in our ability to effectively deliver on the strategy at scale, allowing us to lead in a digital environment, lies within how we are reorienting at the intersection of our growth strategy, our engineering and technology strategy and the needs of our customers and carriers by really evolving to being a more product-led organization.\nAs I searched for the right person to lead this change and to be our Chief Product Officer, it was critical for me to find someone who had experience at leading digital companies that participated in 2-sided marketplaces. Arun is a seasoned and inspiring leader, who brings nearly 3 decades of product and technology experience, developing and deploying products that enrich the customer experience and creating value at industry-leading companies such as Whole Foods, Zappos and Travelocity. Arun's deep product and leadership experience will be invaluable as we drive the next generation of innovation for our company while creating sustainable long-term value for our customers, our carriers and our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call briefly to Arun.\n\nArun Rajan\n\nChief Product Officer, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. It's nice to have the opportunity to address all of you today. I was really excited to join Robinson 5 months ago as I believe in the mission and see a clear opportunity to help digital transformation at scale within an industry-leading company.\nMy professional background is almost exclusively been in leading product data and engineering teams in digitally native companies such as Travelocity and Zappos. I also spent time in product and engineering roles at companies and industries that were going through a transformation, such as Whole Foods more recently and Sabre earlier in my career. This is in addition to serving the CTO and COO role at Zappos and my 10 years across the Amazon Enterprise.\nI understand the importance of amazing customer experience and service and putting the customer at the center of everything we do, something that is core to Robinson. Here, the role of product is to relentlessly trust customer needs and carrier needs and to go deep with data and research to inform technology investments in service of our customers and our carriers.\nRobinson exists at the center of a broad 2-sided marketplace in which we need to provide value to both carriers and customers. Both sides of the marketplace are demanding more real-time transparency, information and innovation.\nIn response, we will be more intentionally connecting our business, data science, digital marketing and technology teams to bring meaningful products, features and insights to both sides of the marketplace and to our employees. We will also be taking a lean approach to delivering products and digital features, testing our hypothesis and iterating our way to deliver the outcomes we seek.\nAs one example of this, we will soon launch enhancements to our Navisphere Carrier product that are focused on improving the digital experience for carriers, including features that will personalize the carriers' experience, bring more liquidity to the marketplace, provide the ability to digitally place offers of nodes and deliver personalized little recommendations based on the unique behaviors of carriers on our platform.\nWe will rapidly test and evolve our digital offerings as we iterate on features and functionality. Providing a strong self-service solution for our carriers will give us access to additional carriers and create greater loyalty, which is critical to our ability to continue growing volume.\nAccess to more capacity gives us the opportunity to cover more freight on behalf of our customers by meeting carriers where and how they want to engage with us: in their cab, at a truck stop or in their office. Working backwards from our carriers' needs, we will apply the appropriate rigor to direct on tests and investments towards products that drive up the acquisition, retention and growth of carrier share.\nI believe that positive impact of these metrics will be the clear signal that we are making the right investment decisions in the context of carrier-facing products. The digital investments we are making and the rigorous test-and-learn approach we are taking to inform these investments are essential to our continued and future success. The products we develop will aim to strengthen relationships with customers and carriers by delivering value on their terms.\nWhen we couple innovation and value with high performance and excellent service, we create customers and carriers who return again and again because they trust us. The success of every new product feature or insight that we deliver on either side of our marketplace will be evaluated on its efficacy to increase the rate at which we acquire, retain and grow share of customers and carriers, which, in turn, serve as the primary input metrics to power our future growth.\nI'll now turn the call to Mike to review the specifics of our fourth quarter financial performance and outlook for 2022.\n\nMichael Paul Zechmeister\n\nCFO, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThanks, Arun, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, Q4 was another solid quarter of year-over-year growth and record annual financial results as we continue to execute on our tech plus strategy.\nOur total company revenue increased 43% over Q4 last year. And our adjusted gross profit or AGP was up 34%, reaching another record high at $856 million. AGP increased across each of our segments on a year-over-year basis and compared to the prepandemic quarter of Q4 2019.\nNote that Q4 of 2021 had 1 less business day than Q4 of 2020 and 2019. On a per day basis, Q4 total company AGP improved by 3% sequentially, 36% year-over-year and 50% over the prepandemic quarter of Q4 2019. The AGP increases year-over-year were driven by both higher volumes and higher AGP per shipment in ocean, truckload and air as we pursued profitable market share gains. On a monthly basis compared to 2020, our total company AGP per business day was up 44% in October, up 32% in November and up 31% in December.\nFor the sixth consecutive quarter, prices and costs rose across our North American truckload business. And for the fifth consecutive quarter, they reached all-time highs. In October and November, cost per mile and price per mile were relatively flat sequentially before rising in December due to increases in load-to-truck ratios and average route guide depth.\nOur NAST team navigated through this environment in Q4 by growing spot truckload volume approximately 12% year-over-year, which marked the sixth quarter in a row of double-digit spot market volume growth. We also grew our Q4 contractual truckload volume by approximately 2% year-over-year despite the rising cost environment. We continue to manage our load acceptance rates to optimize contractual volume returns.\nAs we do each quarter, we also repriced a portion of our contract portfolio to reflect the updated cost of purchased transportation. As we repriced the contract portfolio and captured more spot volume, our truckload AGP per mile continued to improve. Q4 marked the fifth consecutive quarter of flat to increasing AGP per mile, which remains above both our 5-year and 10-year averages.\nTruckload AGP per shipment improved by 6% sequentially and by 15% compared to Q4 of 2020. In our LTL business, Q4 AGP per order also improved by 23.5% compared to Q4 of 2020. AGP per mile and AGP per shipment are key metrics that we use to run our NAST business rather than AGP margin percentage, which naturally rises or falls with changing market cycle pricing.\nFor those following AGP margin percentage, it is important to factor in that contractual price changes and lag cause changes in purchase transportation. That is, if or when the market loosens on the back side of the current cycle with greater than half of our truckload volume on fixed price contracts, we would expect to see an expansion of AGP margin percent and dollars as we typically have in past cycles. We continue to focus on overall AGP dollar growth by optimizing volume and AGP per shipment across our service offerings. With our customer-centric focus, strong team and our digital investments, we expect to drive long-term growth and efficiency into our model.\nNow turning to expenses. Personnel expenses were $420 million, up 35.8% compared to Q4 of last year primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, higher headcount and the impact of short-term pandemic-related cost reductions in Q4 of last year. On a sequential basis, Q4 personnel expenses were up 5% versus Q3, with ending headcount up 4%. Our Q4 average headcount increased 11.9% compared to Q4 of 2020. Despite the tight labor market, we were able to attract the talent we needed to support continued growth, particularly in Global Forwarding and NAST.\nLooking back at 2021, in Q2, we began responding to demand that was stronger than expected by adding personnel to support the business. With annual enterprise transportation volume growth of 7.9% versus average headcount growth of 4.2%, we delivered on our goal of growing volume faster than headcount in 2021.\nIn NAST, despite an increased level of hiring in the second half of 2021 to support our future growth expectations, we delivered a 620 basis point favorable spread in our 2021 NAST Productivity Index, which measures the difference between the year-over-year change in NAST volume compared to headcount.\nBefore I get into our guidance for 2022 personnel expenses, let me provide some perspective on our expectations for the year ahead. Similar to the way 2021 played out from Q2 forward, we plan to add more people to support growth opportunities across the business. We expect these additions to be weighted more heavily in the front half of 2022, but still result in growing volume at a greater rate than headcount for the full year. If growth opportunities in the market play out different than we expect, we'll adjust accordingly.\nWe're also prioritizing the importance of retaining our talent by increasing base compensation in line with the market in order to maintain high levels of service to our customers and carriers as we value the plus part of our tech plus strategy.\nIn 2022, we expect a year-over-year decrease in our incentive compensation expenses to partially offset the increased headcount and wage pressures. Recall that in 2021, our enterprise performance led to significant equity vesting due to the 70% year-over-year growth in our annual earnings per share and above-target bonus and commissions payouts driven by the 63% increase in pretax income and 31% growth in AGP.\nTaking all these factors into account and assuming current market conditions, we expect our 2022 personnel expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, up approximately 7% at the midpoint compared to our 2021 total of $1.54 billion.\nMoving on to SG&A expenses. Q4 was approximately $149 million, up 19.6% compared to Q4 of 2020 primarily due to higher technology-related purchase services and travel expenses. For 2022, we expect total SG&A expenses to be $550 million to $600 million compared to $526 million for 2021. The approximately 9% increase at the midpoint is primarily due to a higher level of spending on technology initiatives in travel as we expect travel spending to return to approximately half of our prepandemic levels.\n2022 SG&A expenses are expected to include approximately $100 million of depreciation and amortization compared to $91 million in 2021. Fourth quarter interest and other expense totaled $18.4 million, up approximately $6.4 million versus Q4 last year due primarily to the impact of currency revaluation.\nQ4 results included a $6.5 million loss on currency revaluation compared to a $1.1 million gain in Q4 last year. As a reminder, these are noncash gains and losses. Interest expense was up $1.8 million due to higher level of average debt.\nOur Q4 tax rate came in at 14.5%, making our 2021 annual tax rate 17.4%, which was lower than our expectations primarily due to a favorable mix of foreign earnings and U.S. tax incentives and credits. We expect to receive less benefit from these items in 2022, resulting in an expected 2022 full year effective tax rate of 19% to 21%, assuming no meaningful changes to federal, state or international tax policy.\nQ4 net income was $230.1 million, up 56% compared to Q4 of 2020. And diluted earnings per share was $1.74, up 61%.\nTurning to cash flow. Q4 cash flow generated by operations was approximately $76 million compared to $162 million in Q4 of 2020. The $86 million year-over-year decline was primarily due to a $200 million increase in net operating working capital in Q4 compared to a $92 million increase in Q4 of 2020.\nThe Q4 2021 increase resulted from a $279 million sequential increase in accounts receivable and contract assets minus a $79 million increase in total accounts payable compared to Q3. At some point in the cycle, when the cost of purchase transportation and subsequent pricing come down to their -- from their current all-time highs, we would expect a commensurate benefit to working capital and operating cash flow. Accounts receivable and contract assets were up 6.7% sequentially, while total revenue was up 3.8%.\nThe resulting 1.7-day increase in days sales outstanding or DSO was driven primarily by the mix shift associated with higher revenue growth in Global Forwarding, where our DSO runs at approximately double that of our NAST business. From a quality of receivables standpoint, our percent past due and our credit losses both improved compared to Q4 a year ago. Over the long term, we expect AGP growth to outpace working capital growth.\nCapital expenditures were $18.4 million in Q4, bringing our full year capital spending to $70.9 million. For 2022, we expect our capital expenditures to be $90 million to $100 million primarily driven by technology investments.\nWe continue to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders, including approximately $223 million in Q4 through a combination of $154.4 million of share repurchases and $68.4 million of dividends. We repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at an average price of $96.90 per share in Q4.\nThe Board of Directors also increased our share repurchase authorization by an additional 20 million shares in December, resulting in approximately 21.6 million shares of repurchase capacity remaining at year-end. For the full year, we returned $886 million to shareholders, which equates to 105% of our 2021 net income and was up 119% compared to 2020 when we paused our share repurchase program out of an abundance of caution due to the pandemic.\nIn December, our Board authorized and declared a 7.8% increase to our regular quarterly cash dividend, taking it to $0.55 per share from $0.51 beginning with the quarterly dividend that was paid in January of 2022. We have now distributed uninterrupted dividends without decline for more than 20 years. Over the long term, we remain committed to our quarterly cash dividend and opportunistic share repurchase program as important levers to enhance shareholder value.\nNow on to the balance sheet highlights. At the end of Q4, our cash balance was $257 million, up $14 million compared to Q4 of 2020. Over the long term, we will continue to look for ways to efficiently repatriate excess cash from foreign entities with the intent of only carrying the cash needed to fund operations.\nWe ended Q4 with $732 million of liquidity comprised of $475 million of committed funding under our credit facility, which matures in October of 2023 and our Q4 cash balance. Our debt balance at year-end was $1.92 billion, up $825 million versus Q4 last year driven primarily by increases in working capital and share repurchases. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of Q4 was 1.42x compared to 1.39x at the end of Q3.\nFrom a capital allocation standpoint, we continue to be diligent and thoughtful about high-return investments on a risk-adjusted basis as we drive further growth and efficiencies into our model. We remain committed to disciplined capital stewardship, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating and generating sustainable long-term growth in our total shareholder returns.\nOverall, 2021 was a year of record financial results for Robinson. We look forward to building off of our strong foundation for long-term growth.\nThank you for listening this morning. And now I'll turn it back over to Bob for his final comments.\n\nRobert C. Biesterfeld\n\nCEO, President & Director, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. So while global commerce continues to face supply chain disruption, at C.H. Robinson, our integrated nonasset-based business model has demonstrated resilience, growth and profitability through the cycle. We will continue to benefit from our investments while delivering on opportunities to integrate our services to help our customers solve their complex supply chain issues.\nAnd our Robinson team, their responsiveness and their ability to provide true value, continues to be a key differentiator in our ability to win in the market. I'm energized by the positive momentum that we're carrying into 2022.\nOur company is differentiated by our ability to deliver diversified growth across our intentional combination of modes, services and geographies. As I said before, customers are looking for solutions that span the globe and across all modes. And ocean freight solution alone doesn't solve the problems that our customers are facing nor is a stand-alone truckload or LTL solution.\nAnd one relevant data point that illustrates this is that over half of our 2021 total revenues and approximately half of our 2021 transportation adjusted gross profits came from customers where we provide both surface transportation and global forwarding services. And these top customers keep coming back to us as evidenced by a 99.6% retention rate in our top 500 customers.\nWe are uniquely positioned to orchestrate an end-to-end supply chain success for these customers and help them not only navigate these markets but to succeed in these markets. We're continuing to invest in smart customer- and carrier-focused products. And we're excited about the talent that we've added to the team and the runway that we have to launch several new products that we believe will benefit both our customers and carriers as we continue to build out the most connected supply chain platform.\nSo that concludes our prepared comments this morning. And with that, I'll turn it back to Donna for the live Q&A portion of the call."

This is Lauren Gaspar, Managing Director of Investor Relations, and I am joined by President and CEO, Rick Wurster and CFO, Mike Verdeschi.\nHopefully, everyone has had an opportunity to review our strong results for the third quarter were released about an hour ago. The team is looking forward to sharing additional insights into those results, along with the broader strategic and financial update as we head into the final chapter of 2025.\nAs always, let's quickly hit on the typical housekeeping items. The slides for the business update will be posted to their usual spot on the IR website at the conclusion of today's prepared remarks. Q&A remains structured as one question, no follow-ups. And please, let's try to avoid the multilayered questions disguised as one. This will allow us to address as many questions as possible during our time together.\nAs always, please don't hesitate to reach out to your friendly IR team with any follow-up questions after today's business update. And last but certainly not least, everyone's favorite part of these business updates, the forward-looking statements page.\nGiven the importance of these statements, I would like to break from tradition and read them out loud in their entirety. Just kidding, but seriously, they are important. So do take a look at them and remember that outcomes can differ from expectations, so please keep in touch with our disclosures. And now it is my pleasure to turn it over to Rick to start us off.\n\nRichard Andrew Wurster\n\nCEO, President & Director\n\nThank you, Lauren, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our fall business update. Our [ true ] client size strategy continues to drive growth on all fronts. In the third quarter, clients opened up 1.1 million new brokerage accounts and trusted Schwab at approximately $138 billion in core net new assets. Year-to-date, we've attracted nearly $356 billion in core NNA.\nClients are deepening their relationships with us by conducting more of their financial lives here, as seen by our record wealth and lending flows. Daily average trades remained above $7 million for the third consecutive quarter, and margin balances reached a record $97.2 billion. With engaged clients operative market and strong execution, we delivered another quarter of record results with 27% year-over-year revenue growth and a year-over-year adjusted earnings growth.\nAnd we returned excess capital in multiple forms. As we head into the final stretch of 2025, we are playing offense with ongoing investments that will continue to drive profitable growth through the cycle.\nEquity markets reached all-time highs in the third quarter and investor sentiment landed in bold territory. We are here to support investors through market cycles and make a difference in their financial lives. This quarter, I visited 19 of our branches across the country, several of our Schwab Wealth Advisory offices and met with multiple dozens of our RIA clients.\nBroadly speaking, our clients are happy because markets are up. Client wealth is at all-time high, and they are asking us how to protect it, pass it along and grow it. And this is when they turn to Schwab. We provide exceptional service platforms and advice in the channel of our clients' choice.\nIn the third quarter, we supported nearly 570 million digital logins, 7 million calls 36% growth in interactions with our research content and thousands of interactions in our 400 branches in local communities across our country and overseas. We are here for clients when, where and how they need us.\nOur Through Clients' Eyes strategy, combined with our diversified business model and ongoing investments in client experiences and capabilities is powering growth on all fronts with clients across our solutions and on all financial measures.\nStarting with client growth, investors opened more than 1 million new brokerage accounts, and we attracted in core net new assets in the third quarter, a 44% increase over last year. We said we'd make progress in getting back to our historic organic growth range. And as you can see, we've made substantial progress on our path to 5%.\nWe believe we are positioned incredibly well in the 2 fastest-growing areas of the market. Through the cycle, we remain confident in our ability to grow at levels consistent with our historic range. This quarter, our strong NNA was helped by the market environment, improvement with legacy Ameritrade clients and high client satisfaction and engagement.\nWe're continuing to deepen relationships with former Ameritrade clients who have been positive contributors to NNA throughout 2025. While they have not yet reached the organic growth rate levels we see among legacy Schwab clients, CPS scores among former Ameritrade clients have improved 11 points this year.\nTurning to our solutions growth. Clients are deepening their Schwab relationships by conducting more of their financial lives with us across our wealth, lending and trading solutions. Managed investing net flows increased 40% year-over-year with 30% of flows from legacy Ameritrade clients.\nSchwab Wealth Advisory, our flagship wealth offer achieved another quarter of record flows and continues to delight clients with a record Client Promoter Score of 85. Bank lending balances are up 24% overall with power balances reaching record levels.\nTraders continue to turn to us for our world-class offer. thinkorswim adoption among Schwab legacy clients has increased 98% over last year. We're also here for our clients who are looking for crypto exposure. Visits to our digital assets content on Schwab.com are up 92% year-over-year, and Schwab has approximately a 20% share of the spot crypto ETP market.\nWe know that our clients who have allocated a small portion of their portfolios in spot crypto at other firms are eager to bring those assets to Schwab. We remain on track to launch spot crypto in the first half of 2026, starting with Bitcoin and Ethereum. We'll watch this offer to Schwab way with a powerful combination of education, research, risk management and the service clients expect all at great value. Our offer will allow clients to access crypto directly alongside their existing investments and our banking capabilities, which will be a strong differentiator.\nOur financials are the third dimension of growth, and we delivered record results this quarter. Net revenues increased 27% year-over-year to a new quarterly record and we delivered record quarterly adjusted earnings per share of $1.31. As we look to the future, we're confident in our ability to continue driving growth on all fronts and across a range of environments and I'll spend the next few minutes highlighting why.\nOne we are in a strong competitive position. We serve 45 million client accounts and $11.59 trillion in assets, making us #1 among peers who report on that metric. We are #1 in RIA custodial assets and we're #1 in retail trading as measured by daily average trades with no close second.\nWe continue to receive recognition from respected third parties because we stand apart by putting clients financial well-being at the forefront of every decision. Our no trade-offs approach offers an unmatched breadth of capabilities, education, research and service with a combination of industry-leading digital experiences and deep client relationships to help clients achieve their desired outcome.\nTwo, our business fundamentals are healthy. We look at this across a few dimensions. First, clients are highly engaged with both Schwab and the markets. Total client interactions within our branches on chat, e-mail and on the phones are up 19% year-over-year. and we exceeded 500 million digital client log-ins across mobile and web for the third consecutive quarter. Daily average trades remained above $7 million during the quarter and clients have increased their use of margin to record levels, up 33% over last year.\nSecond, we're delivering world-class service. We're entering the phones in less than 30 seconds on average and more than 75% of questions are answered without the need to transfer the call. And third, most importantly, clients are happy. Overall satisfaction scores for our service organization are at an all-time high of 88%.\nClient Promoter Scores for IS and AS are at record levels, meaning we are delivering for clients when and where they need us. It's important to remember that for 50 years, we have championed our investors' financial goals and done everything we can to make clients better off in their financial life.\nThree, we're attracting a diverse range of clients. We're continuing to attract and serve RIAs of all sizes and our Advisor Services business is thriving. In our retail business, we are attracting and serving investors of all ages, and we see significant engagement from younger clients.\nWhen we think about our mission and the opportunity to get more Americans invested, it is encouraging that industry research shows Gen Z is 45% more likely to start investing by the age of 21 as compared to Millennials. And we see these trends playing out among our client base. This year, nearly 1/3 of new-to-firm retail households at Schwab are Gen Zers, investors between the ages of 13 and 28.\nOne of the reasons they're turning to Schwab is because we're meeting them in the channels where they turn for information about investing. We know they learn about finances primarily through social media and family. Their top online resource is YouTube, and we're the #1 financial services firm on YouTube by followers.\nAnd younger investors at Schwab are highly engaged in building their wealth over the long term. In fact, 1/3 of retail households who created a financial plan within the last 2 years are under the age of 40. While client assets are more concentrated among older generations today, the average age of our clients continues to get younger.\nFinally, a growing portion of new to firm households are traders. Traders of all ages and experience levels are coming to Schwab, including younger traders. Younger traders are turning to us because they recognize the potential that trading has in helping build wealth over time. And they're turning to Schwab because we have the platforms, tools, education, coaching, expertise and service they need to help them succeed, a combination that cannot find anywhere else.\nFinally, we remain committed to our 4 strategic focus areas to meet the evolving needs of our clients. At the start of the year, I laid out our priorities: growth, scale and efficiency, the brilliant basics and our people. I'll spend just a few minutes sharing highlights on progress we've made.\nOur first focus area is driving growth by deepening relationships with our clients. I'll highlight just a few ways we're delivering on this priority. In our Advisor Services business, we're deepening relationships with 16,000 RIA firms we serve by building a broader support ecosystem that extends beyond custody alone to add value for RIAs. We've grown our lending support, alternatives capability and expanded our institutional no transaction fee mutual fund platform to include funds from nearly 60 managers with no transaction fees for clients. We also launched [ Adviser Pro Direct], which helps breakaway advisers on their path to independence. Finally, we supported the largest adviser transition in the history of our industry by welcoming [ Open Arch ] to our platform in September.\nIn our retail business, we're expanding our branch footprint and hiring financial consultants and wealth consultants to serve even more of our higher net worth clients. These investments are important because we know that clients who have an [ Fc ] relationship have higher CPS scores, while also bringing in more than 2.5x the NNA and engaging more in our trading, wealth and banking solutions.\nWe're investing in deepening relationships within clients and enhancing how we support their financial life. We've enhanced Schwab Wealth Advisory adding a discretionary offer. We've launched alternatives. We've invested in tax, trust and estate capabilities, and we've added more experts to support more clients. Within our banking offer, our budget asset line experience continues to lead the industry with cycle times of about 1 day and clients can now borrow against most managed investing assets they hold at Schwab, meaning they can borrow more and we're continuing to invest in our trader experience.\nOur second focus area is creating value with scale and efficiency. These initiatives, which are primarily centered within service, operations and technology are a win for clients and are also helping enable us to keep our cost to serve clients low so that we can reinvest in our growth.\nWe're using AI to supercharge our professionals through capabilities like our Schwab Knowledge Assistant and the rollout of our service AI assistant, which helps our client-facing professionals create post call summaries and notes, among other capabilities. These efforts will help our reps serve clients more efficiently. We've also made progress on improving status notifications to clients and removing more paper from our system, reducing not in good order errors and saving time for our clients and professionals.\nOur third focus area is delivering on the brilliant basics. At the heart of it, this means being there for clients when and where they need us and delighting them in every interaction they have with us. It means our systems are available and experiences are easy. One measure of this is our client easy scores, which are near all-time highs. 94% for our retail client service organization and 93% ease of doing business score for adviser services.\nFinally, our finance team has done a great job of enhancing our approach to managing our balance sheet. Last but not least, the fourth focus area is investing in our people. We couldn't do what we do without 32,000 employees working together united by a single mission. We're continuing to invest in our people and culture to retain and attract the best talent in the industry.\nTo wrap up, we've sustained positive momentum through 2025 and are continuing to deliver growth on all fronts. We are looking towards the future from a position of strength continuing to play offense to power profitable growth over the long term. With that, I'll turn it over to Mike to dive into details on our financial results.\n\nMichael Verdeschi\n\nMD & Deputy CFO\n\nThank you, Rick, and good morning, everyone. Schwab delivered strong third quarter results across all fronts, highlighting our momentum as we continue to meet the evolving needs of individual investors and independent advisers.\nThe combination of our firms focused execution across key strategic objectives and favorable macro tailwinds yielded record results. We saw another step-up in our organic client growth trends during the period and client engagement across our broad suite of products and solutions also remained robust. This sustained momentum translated into record revenue and earnings for the quarter, including year-over-year revenue growth of 27% to $6.1 billion, adjusted pretax margins exceeding 51% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, an increase of 70% versus 3Q '24.\nClient cash levels continue to reflect normal behavior, inclusive of organic growth, seasonality and strong client engagement as equity markets reached record levels. We made further progress in reducing supplemental borrowings, which ended the quarter at $14.8 billion or just within the upper bound of our business as usual range.\nWe also returned meaningful excess capital via common stock repurchases. Inclusive of these actions, our capital ratios stayed relatively flat versus the second quarter finishing 3Q slightly above our target range.\nNow let's impact some of the key drivers influencing these record 3Q results before sharing our perspectives on the final chapter of 2025. Revenue increased 27% year-over-year to a record $6.1 billion for 3Q, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth across all major line items. Our further reduction in supplemental borrowings at the banks, client loan growth and another strong quarter for securities lending activity helped to expand net interest margin empowered a 37% increase in net interest revenue versus 3Q '24.\nStrong equity markets, healthy asset gathering and sustained client interest in Schwab's wealth and asset management offerings, drove 13% year-over-year growth in asset management and administration fees to a record $1.7 billion. Trading revenue was up 25% versus 324 as our leading retail trading platform facilitated another robust quarter of activity including 7.4 million daily average trades and approximately $6 trillion of gross notional value traded across equities, ETFs and mutual funds.\nBank deposit account fees moved higher year-over-year due to an improved net yield as lower-yielding fixed-rate obligations continue to mature and converted into the floating rate bucket. September marked an inflection point for the BDA as we transition into the new $60 billion to $90 billion operating range for the remainder of the agreement and we gained the flexibility to move balances between the BDA and our balance sheet. During the third quarter, we transferred $3 billion worth of balances to Schwab to accelerate the paydown of bank supplemental borrowings.\nTurning to expenses. Adjusted expenses for the quarter were up 5% versus 3Q '24 as we continue to make ongoing investments to support sustainable growth including opening new branches and hiring financial consultants, supported very strong and sustained client engagement across our broad suite of modern wealth solutions and seek to further unlock incremental efficiencies across our business.\nFurther progress in reducing high-cost borrowings at the banks, equity market strength and sustained trading volumes drove regular top line growth. In conjunction with balanced expense management, Schwab's adjusted pretax profit margin reached 51.3%. Quarterly adjusted earnings per share equaled a record $1.31, a year-over-year increase of 70%. Note that 3Q EPS included a $0.03 benefit related to state tax matters. With the majority of this benefit realized in 3Q '25, we expect our corporate tax rate to remain around the 23% to 24% zone in future periods.\nMoving on to our balance sheet. We supported our clients as their needs evolve against a shifting backdrop. Client demand for our lending solutions increased during the quarter. Outstanding power balances grew to $23.4 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 37%. Client margin loan balances rose to $97.2 billion at quarter end, up 16% versus year-end 2024, reflecting rising equity markets and improved investor sentiment and certain tactical client trading activities, such as long/short strategies.\nTransactional suite cash trends continue to reflect normal client behavior. Following modest outflows during July and August related to typical seasonality and client net buying activity we saw $19 billion of cash inflows in September to bring the quarter end balance to $425.6 billion. which represents a quarter-over-quarter increase of $13.5 billion or approximately 3%.\nThis sequential building cash, along with the use of investment portfolio proceeds and balances transferred from the BDA allow us to further reduce high-cost funding at the banks. We'd expect normal cash behavior to continue in 4Q including typical seasonality, such as adviser payments in October and the December cash build. Staying on high-cost bank funding for a moment, we made great progress during the third quarter, reducing supplemental funding balances by another $13 billion, bringing outstanding balances down to $14.8 billion or approximately 85% below the peak in May 2023.\nThis level is just inside the upper bound of our business as usual range of approximately $5 billion to $15 billion, which aligns with our long-term diversified funding profile. While outstanding balances may come down further and move around this range over time, we'll continue to support client loan needs and begin to focus more on new security purchases versus paydown activities.\nOur capital levels finished the quarter slightly above the upper bound of the firm's adjusted Tier 1 leverage objective of 6.75% to 7%. The quarter-over-quarter build was primarily driven by earnings and the continued pull to par of unrealized marks. The ratio also reflects our repurchases of common shares for $2.7 billion, bringing year-to-date total capital return across all forms to $8.5 billion. Looking ahead, we will continue to prioritize maintaining capital to support the needs of our clients and the growth of the franchise while returning excess capital in multiple forms as part of our through-the-cycle financial growth story.\nTurning to our full year 2025 scenario. During the summer business update in July, we provided an updated financial scenario informed by several inputs, including calling for 225 basis point cuts to the Fed funds target rate. Equity market appreciation of roughly 9% for the full year and client trading volume that represented a slight pullback from levels observed during the first half of the year.\nMoving forward to today, the interest rate curve now calls for a total of 325 basis point cuts during 2025 versus a previous expectation for only 2 cuts. Markets continue to move higher during the third quarter and client trading remains robust. However, the last couple of weeks remind us the environment can shift quickly. So in terms of the remainder of the year, we are likely to see various puts and takes as both rates and the broader markets evolve with the macroeconomic backdrop.\nSo far in October, we continue to see good engagement from clients, which can increase revenue as well as volume-related expenses. Assuming this engagement persists, we could see a lift in earnings of around 2% or a bit better relative to the upper end of the financial scenario range we shared back at the July business update.\nIn terms of next year, we are still working through our annual planning process, but we expect to keep building upon our 2025 momentum. And like most years, we will need to navigate in an evolving macroeconomic environment including potential shifts in sentiment and engagement levels. We remain confident in our ability to continue balancing the investments necessary to support the needs of our clients while delivering on our near-term financial objectives, such as top line growth and positive operating leverage across a range of environments. So please stay tuned, and we'll come back to you with a more detailed 2026 financial scenario in January.\nIn closing, as we approach the final months of 2025, we are excited with our progress to date. Momentum with clients continue to strengthen as they entrust us with an increasing amount of their assets and execute our broad suite of solutions, including wealth, trading, asset management and banking.\nSchwab's diversified model, along with record equity markets and strong client engagement have positioned us to deliver record financial results for the full year. While that is certainly a great position to be in, obviously, our time horizon extends beyond a single year. We remain relentlessly focused on maintaining the strength of our diversified model with the ability to efficiently serve the needs of individual investors and the independent advisers who serve them through a range of environments. And with that, let's move on to Q&A. Lauren, back to you.\n\nLauren Gaspar\n\nManaging Director, Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, can you please walk everyone through the instructions for the Q&A session?"

This is Jeff Edwards, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our Co-Chairman and CEO, Walt Bettinger; President, Rick Wurster and CFO, Peter Crawford. Before we jump into the presentation, I'd like to touch on a few housekeeping items. Today's setup is obviously a little bit unique with the business update immediately following this morning's release of our strong first quarter results. That being said, our time here today will still be dedicated to providing you with a broad strategic update of our growing business.\nSimilar to past events, I will be helping facilitate Q&A. So given recent events, the team has a fair amount they like to share with you. So dedicated Q&A time may end up being slightly shorter than usual. Therefore, it is very important that we all strictly adhere to the one question, no follow-up format that has been in place now for several quarters. And we also ask that you vector clarifying a more tactical questions regarding the recently reported quarter to the IR team.\nToday's slides should be available on the IR website momentarily. And finally, before we move on, let's not forget the mighty wall of words, which reminds us all that the future is uncertain, so please stay in touch with our disclosures. I'd like to turn it over to Walt then.\n\nWalter William Bettinger\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, The Charles Schwab Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeff, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our April business update. This is an important opportunity for our team at Schwab to speak directly with all of you to speak with accuracy and facts and to speak with clarity and transparency. We know that the past few weeks have been very challenging for long-term stockholders, which, of course, all of our executives at Schwab are also, me included.\nLet me start by making a few crystal clear statements. First, our clients, although curious and somewhat surprised about the downward movement in our stock price, remain fully engaged with us and are bringing substantial assets to Schwab on both the retail side and the RIA advisor side. We are winning in the marketplace among clients. Anyone suggesting otherwise, is mistaken.\nSimply put, our franchise strength and financial model remain very much intact. Second, we did not and have not changed our multi-decade approach to conservatively managing our bank balance sheet. Any suggestions to the contrary of that are false. And although our near-term cost of funding are higher than recent historical levels, and as a result, will impact our near-term earnings. This cost is temporary and should diminish over the coming quarters and could wind down between now and the end of 2024.\nAnd third, we are well into the execution of the conversion of the former Ameritrade clients to Schwab. And as we progress through this conversion and beyond, we will ultimately realize substantial expense savings, well beyond the remaining $500 million to $600 million we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade integration synergies.\nNow looking at the first quarter, it was a complex environment for investors. Although the equity markets overall performed quite well, investor sentiment was actually quite negative throughout the quarter. The Fed raised interest rates another 50 basis points, while the 5- and 10-year yield on treasuries fell by 39 and 40 basis points, respectively. And yet despite negative investor sentiment, this wasn't reflected in our clients' engagement with us.\nClients entrusted us with over $130 billion in core net new assets, with the monthly level increasing each of the 3 months of the quarter, peaking with over $50 billion in March and achieving an organic growth rate in excess of 7%, once again validating our long-term track record of growing client assets in every economic environment. In addition to growth in client assets, clients remained engaged with us in other areas with another quarter of over 1 million new client accounts, over 5 million daily average trades, a Client Promoter Score or Net Promoter Score of 66 and almost $9 billion moved into our investment advisory solutions.\nLet's go ahead and transition from our client results to discuss some of the corporate financial areas that have been in the press on the minds of investors. And in too many cases, falsely described by some competitors who have tried without much success, is evidenced by our near record March level of net new asset flows to scare clients into leaving Schwab.\nAgain, our franchise and financial model are strong. We have substantial liquidity. We have capital well in excess of regulatory requirements, and our strong profit margins deliver ongoing organic capital formation, which can be used to meet future capital needs. We have industry-leading levels of FDIC insured balances at our bank, our investors' bank. Our balance sheet and investments were and are conservatively managed and managed in a manner consistent with how we have managed our bank balance sheet for the last 2 decades.\nAnd for our long-term stockholders, we have great confidence, and our ability to deliver a combination of growth and capital return, just as we have for almost 50 years. So I'd like to go into a bit more detail now on each one of these statements. I've publicly stated multiple times and in multiple formats that we cannot foresee any plausible scenario where we would have to sell securities to meet the liquidity needs of our clients, and that's not an accident.\nBecause we have always planned for the potential of time periods where high liquidity needs exceed our available cash. Of course, these time periods tend to occur when the Fed is raising interest rates rapidly. And while this cycle of interest rate increases has been historically rapid, leading clients to realign their investment cash more quickly than we had predicted.\nOur advanced planning ensured that we would have the necessary liquidity to meet their demands. We prepare in part by minimizing the issuance of CDs and/or borrowing from the FHLB during more normal times, effectively keeping that dry powder for periods of higher liquidity needs. Of course, accessing this higher cost funding is not something we expect to be anything other than temporary, currently projected to wind down over the next 7 quarters and be largely gone by year-end 2024.\nI would certainly hope that by this point in time, the short driven speculation that we would find ourselves in a position where we would be forced to sell securities that have temporary paper losses has been put to bed. From a capital standpoint, we have solid levels today, well in excess of regulatory requirements. And we understand the possibility that the AOCI opt-out might well be eliminated and the questions that, that raises about the potential need for capital.\nAt this point, if this scenario does play out and a reasonable time frame is afforded to build the capital to support this change, we feel confident today in our ability to build the necessary capital organically, given our strong profit margins. Even in the stressed market environment this past quarter, we achieved an adjusted pretax margin of almost 46%. And even under some of the most pessimistic scenarios for the future, we are at least 40% pretax. And of course, our unrealized marks on certain securities decline over time, and they've also declined as interest rates have modestly moderated, declines that you'll see happening when you review our first quarter 10-Q. The conservative nature of our bank management is also reflected in the very high percentage of deposits insured under the FDIC limit. At quarter end, approximately 86% of our bank deposits were under the FDIC insured limits.\nIn addition, these deposits are spread among tens of millions of investor accounts. And lastly, there are no groups of investors or advisers who directly influence or encourage collective behavior. The 10 RIA firms whose clients hold the greatest amount of cash on our bank balance sheet, account for barely 2% of total bank deposits and the average transactional cash per account for those RIA firms is less than $13,000. I hope these facts remove any concerns about some sort of ordinated action potentially happening that would meaningfully impact our bank deposits.\nThis is a very important slide. I'd like to dive deeper into our clients' cash behaviors. I know this is a critical area of interest, particularly as it could apply to future levels of bank balance sheet cash and client cash realignments. As I've discussed in the past, when interest rates are near 0, clients tend to co-mingle their transactional cash and their longer-term investment cash together. Of course, there's very little incentive during times like that to move their investment cash into solutions that offer higher yields than bank sweep.\nBut when interest rates rise, we reach out to clients and suggest they consider realigning their investment cash into other solutions, whatever the client sees fit, whether that would be a purchase money fund -- a purchase money market fund, a CD, a treasury security or another appropriate cash solution that the client is interested in. And of course, this has been taking place, predominantly inside Schwab, as rates have been rising over the past year or so. The rate, pace and ultimate level of this realigning has a large impact on our near-term financial results. So not surprising, we study it closely, and we have models that estimate how it will unfold.\nBy several measures we study, we believe that this cash realigning process is now slowing and getting closer to its endpoint, which should then likely reverse to a stage where bank balance sheet cash begins to grow as a result of our organic net new asset growth as well as new accounts that we attract. Now in terms of the slide, we've included a chart that goes back to 2004, and it illustrates multiple time frames where interest rates were relatively high as well as several time frames where interest rates were near 0, often referred to as ZIRP periods.\nWhen we study this information, RIA per account basis, what we see as the most accurate way to model this. Transactional cash per account is down to an average of approximately $10,400, a level as low as we have seen in the past 20 years and down about 50% from the peak period during the COVID pandemic. From a percent standpoint, transactional cash per account is at a 20-year low of approximately 5%. Now could it go lower? Yes, of course, but we believe it is closer than ever to finding its ending point.\nHere's why. If you look at daily Schwab Bank cash movements, a key metric for identifying trends far more important than a quarterly summary. February of this year was lower than January. And if we adjust for the single day after the Silicon Valley Bank failure, where cash movement was modestly elevated, March was lower on a per day basis than February. And through the first half of April, even allowing for tax payments, April is also lower than March, measurably lower.\nLastly, it's important to recognize that while some clients did readjust their cash allocations in response to the Silicon Valley Bank failure by buying treasuries or CDs or moving from prime money funds to treasury or government money funds, we also saw a sharp increase in new cash coming into Schwab, consistent with being a safe port in the storm.\nNow this slide is also a particularly important one as it provides factual information around a topic that has been fraught with inaccuracies in the press and blogs alike that incredibly to me often relied on speculative information from short sellers and competitors. Schwab Bank is a bank for investors. We manage client cash at our bank conservatively and consistently. We manage this cash in the same way we've managed it for the 20 years that we've had our bank.\nWe make what we consider to be conservative loans, almost exclusively to our existing investment clients. Now these loans are either backed by our client securities portfolio or loans against their personal real estate. This makes up about 12% of our assets. We do not make commercial loans as speculated by one of our competitors on national television. The balance is invested primarily in securities.\nAnd with this balance, we look to manage credit risk by investing between 85% and 90% in securities backed by the U.S. government or its agencies. That's our approach to credit risk. Now let's talk about duration risk. Again, an area that has been fraught with misinformation. First, let me begin by saying it's important not to confuse as unfortunately some less than savvy alleged researchers and analysts have that maturity or weighted average life is not the same as duration.\nWe have many floating rate securities that have a long life, but essentially zero duration and therefore, do not contribute to negative marks with higher interest rates. And of course, offer increased yields as rates rise. Second, we do not now and never have tried to guess future interest rate movements. Doing so is a fool's game. It's like trying to guess stock market movements. We don't guess and we don't try to time interest rate movements.\nOur approach is very straight forward. We have historically managed our bank investment portfolio to a duration range between 2.75 and 4 years. And we were approximately 3.5 years as rates began to rise in mid-2022, admittedly, nearer the higher end of our historic range than the lower end of fair criticism. Importantly, our overall duration across the firm's aggregate balance sheets, which includes the banks and the broker-dealers, was about 2.5 years. That is it, not 5, not 10, but 2.5 years. And we all know that even at 2.5 years, this is not low enough to avoid temporary paper losses when rates rise close to 500 basis points in a year.\nWe just felt it was important to be transparent on where we were as this rising rate cycle began. So again, we did not change our historic approach during the COVID pandemic. Contrary to some items I've read and heard, we did not buy securities that would take us out of our historic duration range. But even more bluntly, we did not go out and load up our securities portfolio with long-dated bonds during the pandemic period. Now it can be a fair criticism that we should have changed our 2-decade approach to consistently maintaining a relatively short-term duration bank portfolio during the COVID pandemic in favor of holding primarily cash. That's fair to say. And if we would have known that the Federal Reserve was going to raise rates faster than they ever have in history, in retrospect, that would have been a brilliant move to make.\nWhat we did do was to begin to build up higher levels of liquid cash in late 2021 as transitory comments about inflation from the Federal Reserve waned and in early 2022 as the Federal Reserve began discussing increases in interest rates. We increased our normal cash allocation about $60 billion. But given the pace that the Federal Reserve raised rates and therefore, the pace of the resolving client cash realigning, again, in retrospect, $60 billion was not nearly enough, and that led to our need to execute on our other liquidity measures.\nI started my comments by making clear that our financial model and franchise strength are intact. So the obvious question is, how this manifests itself in terms of earnings growth and our ability to deliver for our stockholders? It's well understood that the temporary cost of higher funding from CDs and FHLB loans will impact our near-term revenue growth and earnings. Hopefully, it is also well understood that, as these borrowings are paid off, that will be an accelerant to our medium-term earnings.\nBut as client cash realigning moderates and eventually reverses and the headwinds from higher cost, temporary funding sources diminishes over the next 7 quarters, what remains? What remains is an extraordinary company. We have a diverse client base spread across approximately 35 million accounts. We have a track record of delivering exceptionally strong organic asset growth in every environment. We are completing the integration of the former Ameritrade client base and adding world-class trading capabilities, along with approximately 10 million new clients, who will be exposed to all the additional products and services that Schwab offers that were not available at Ameritrade, and millions of existing Schwab clients will be exposed to the world-class retail trading platforms that were previously only available to Ameritrade clients.\nAnd as a result of the integration process winding down, along with investments that we have made in enhancing efficiency during this integration process, we will be in a position to substantially reduce operating expenses. Again, as I stated, well beyond the remaining $500 million to $600 million we originally committed to as part of the Ameritrade integration synergies. It's a powerful formula. It's a winning formula, and I'm confident that it will be a formula that delivers for our long-term stockholders, as it has since we went public in 1987.\nSo Peter, let me turn it over to you to talk some more about our financial results and projections.\n\nPeter Brooks Crawford\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Charles Schwab Corporation\n\nWell, thank you very much, Walt. So there are 3 key points I want you to take away from my portion of the presentation today. First, we're navigating this extraordinary period from a position of strength with robust organic growth, high level profitability, strong and growing capital levels and access to significant liquidity. Second, although the volume of client cash allocation activity has exceeded the expectations embedded in the financial scenario we shared a few months ago, as Walt mentioned, we are seeing signs of the pace beginning to moderate, and we continue to expect a resumption of deposit growth in 2023.\nAnd third, our focus at Schwab remains on our clients. And while the various dynamics we're working through create some near-term headwinds, our business continues to power ahead, reinforcing our confidence about the long-term strength of our diversified model and our ability to keep delivering on our through the cycle financial formula. Let's start by briefly reviewing our first quarter results, which we released earlier this morning.\nAmong the many advantages we have as we navigate through this period is our financial strength, our sustained earnings power. There has been so much attention to the balance sheet and dynamics influencing net interest revenue that it feels like some have lost side of the fact that nearly 50% of our revenue comes from other sources such as asset management fees and trading. And while the remaining half is generated through net interest revenue, roughly 1/3 of our interest-earning assets are floating rate, meaning the yield on those assets has increased dramatically in the last 12 months.\nThat diversified all-weather revenue model is reflected in our strong Q1 financial performance, during which we grew revenue by 10% versus the first quarter of 2022. We grew adjusted earnings per share by 21%, and we delivered an adjusted pretax margin of nearly 46%, a level nearly unsurpassed in the financial services industry.\nTurning to the balance sheet. The evolution of our balance sheet during the quarter reflected continued client cash realignment. We supported this by utilizing temporary funding sources, including issuing more CDs and securing additional advances from the FHLB. Our usage of these was front-loaded and increased modestly by our decision consistent with our conservative management approach to build extra liquidity within our banks, almost doubling the amount of cash on hand in the month of March.\nNow we also opted to suspend our buybacks during the quarter. And our strong earnings supported organic capital formation, which allowed us to maintain our Tier 1 leverage ratio at 7.1%, well above the regulatory minimum. I know there's been much written -- we'd argue too much written about the tangible common equity ratios, our banking subsidiaries. But those ratios have all increased significantly from the 12/31 levels due to both a $2 billion reduction in the unrealized mark-to-market losses and continued strong capital formation.\nThose of you who followed the company for a while know that we have a long-term orientation executing a strategy and business model that has delivered for clients and stockholders for multiple decades. I want to emphasize that the current challenges we're facing are quite manageable and the impact on our financial performance is near term, which means that Schwab's long-term financial model of growth plus capital return remains firmly intact.\nThough, as we have discussed, there are some early signs of moderation of the client cash allocation activity, the overall level to start the year has exceeded the assumptions incorporated within the scenario shared with winter business update. That means we've utilized a higher level of supplemental funding with the vast majority of that now expected to be paid off by the end of 2024. This temporary -- emphasis temporary mix shift toward higher cost of funds is expected to pressure the next few quarters of revenue at which point the impact should start to decrease, reverse. We now expect Q2 revenue to be down a mid- to upper single-digit percent versus the second quarter of 2022.\nBut it will have very minimal impact on our long-term financial performance, with our NIM, net interest margin still poised to increase throughout 2024 and approach 3% by the end of 2025, even if rates fall from current levels as the market anticipates. Now it's important, I think, to put that NIM outlook into perspective. As I mentioned earlier, net interest revenue only accounts for half of our revenue. And with an adjusted pretax margin well in the upper 40s, we can continue to produce margins that would be the envy of most other financial services firms even as we navigate these dynamics.\nAnd remember, that all this has been happening, we have been adding clients, adding net new assets, increasing the adoption of advice and lending and moving forward on the Ameritrade integration. Regarding expenses, disciplined expense management has been a hallmark of our financial formula. And throughout our history, we have taken steps to pull back on our spending when we're facing environmental headwinds without sacrificing the client experience or undermining long-term growth.\nAs Walt said earlier, we feel very confident about our ability to deliver over $500 million of expense synergies by the end of 2024, as we complete the integration of Ameritrade. And as we do so, it's also a good opportunity for us to take a step back and examine our overall spending levels to look for additional efficiencies as we continue our decade's long focus on driving down our expense on client assets, or EOCA, which we view as a key competitive advantage.\nAnd finally, our capital ratios -- our capital position, our capital ratios remain very strong. As Walt noted in his remarks, even if we have to eventually absorb AOCI into our regulatory capital ratios, we see a clear path organically for our Tier 1 leverage ratio, inclusive of AOCI, to exceed 5% within the next year and cross 6.5% by the end of 2024, even if rates stay flat, thanks to our strong earnings, a reduction in balance sheet assets even after deposit growth rebounds as we pay off the supplemental funding and the continued reduction of our AOCI as our securities portfolio matures.\nAnd I note that, again, even if rates remain flat, we'd expect those mark-to-market losses to decrease by a further $7 billion between now and the end of 2024. And obviously, more if rates fall as the market is expecting. Putting it all together, we're not blind to the near-term dynamics we're navigating, but we're very confident that our financial formula will reassert itself as we emerge from this period. And that formula, of course, starts with taking care of clients, growing accounts and assets, deepening relationships, building our capabilities, expanding our moat.\nThat is what builds long-term earnings power and will be the driver of performance for our stockholders over time. And to tell you more about the strength of our franchise and how we're continuing to serve our clients, it's my pleasure to turn it over to Rick.\n\nRichard A. Wurster\n\nPresident & CEO of Schwab Investment Management, Inc., Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Peter, and hello, everyone. In the winter business update, I described how well Schwab is positioned to sustain our organic growth rate of 5% to 7% over the long term through a combination of growth from existing clients, attracting new clients and growth from our strategic initiatives. First quarter was a great example of this as we grew net new assets by over 7%. As I shared with you our business results, I'd like to leave you with 3 takeaways.\nFirst, our business is thriving, and we again delivered strong organic client growth. Second, through the volatility in March, we saw an increase in net new assets and client engagement and asset flows that the bank remains steady. We emerged from a crisis not weaker, but stronger. Third, our strategic initiatives are paying off and lots of opportunity remains. Let's dive into the results in more detail. To put it simply, we are winning across all fronts. We're winning with existing clients, with new clients and on both the retail and RIA sides of our business.\nWithin Investor Services, we attracted $60 billion in core net new assets. In addition, we saw an 18% year-over-year increase in high net worth, net new assets in the quarter. Our note trade-offs approach continues to attract clients and engender trust from our existing clients, and that was particularly true in a period of uncertainty. As I mentioned in our winter business update, our client base continues to get younger with 56% of new-to-firm households under 40 this quarter. This is notable because with an average age under 50, our clients are still accumulating assets.\nWithin Advisor Services, we had an outstanding quarter of growth with $71 billion in core net new assets. When the going got tough in March, our growth accelerated with $32 billion in NNA in March alone in Advisor Services. In periods of uncertainty and heightened volatility, advisors win. They win because they are trusted fiduciaries with clients' best interest in mind. And we win because we are the trusted partner of RIAs and partner with them to deliver for clients in all environments.\nOur TOA ratio remained high and was in excess of 2% for the quarter. We are committed to helping RIAs of all sizes grow by delivering the leading custody platform with no fees, alongside practice management support, industry advocacy and relationship support RIAs can count on. There are no trade-offs. In summary, our business is thriving. Our note trade-off approach was recognized by the industry. The third-party accolades you see on the screen speak to the way we serve our clients each and every day.\nWe were recognized by Investor's Business Daily as the #1 online retail broker overall, by J.D. Power as the #1 full-service broker and for the sixth consecutive year Schwab was named one of Fortune Magazine's top 50 World's Most Admired Companies. I'd like to turn now to our strategic initiatives of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. We are continuing to advance these initiatives within our strategic focus areas. And as I mentioned, these are paying off with tangible wins in the first quarter of this year.\nLet me start with scale and efficiency. Integration remains our top priority. We successfully completed our first client transition group in February, bringing over around 500,000 client accounts, including a small number of advisors. Service teams achieved an average speed to answer of just 6 seconds during the conversion, a good indication of how seamlessly the transition went after years of preparation. We remain on track to bring over 13 million clients this year, representing 97% of Ameritrade clients, with the remaining 3% our most active traders coming over in 2024.\nAnd as Walt mentioned earlier, we are on track to achieve $1.8 billion to $2 billion in run rate expense synergies by the end of 2024. Most important is the client benefit we see. In retail, clients will benefit from the combination of our modern wealth management platform, alongside the leading trading and education platform in the industry. For advisors, we will add iRebal and thinkpipes, 2 capabilities advisors love to an offer that as it stands as no trade-offs. Turning now to win-win monetization. One of our priorities is growing our wealth business. Wealth is an area in which we delight clients, as the Client Promoter Scores of wealth clients are typically the highest at Schwab. Our clients are increasingly asking for help and advice, providing us with a growth opportunity, and wealth offers a diversifying source of economics to us as a business. We've been investing heavily to deliver for clients and accelerate our growth, and we saw meaningful progress in the first quarter.\nNet flows into the Wasmer Schroeder strategies were $1.5 billion and assets under management surpassed $17 billion. This is a clear example of a win-win opportunity for clients in Schwab. The offer brought down the cost of access to fixed income managed accounts on Schwab's platform and interest from clients has been strong as Wasmer represented the majority of net flows in the fixed income managed accounts.\nWe launched several key enhancements to Schwab Personalized Indexing, including more customization and digital capabilities. Retail clients who work with Schwab FC can now exclude more individual stocks as well as entire industries and sub-industries from their portfolios. We also launched a digital dashboard for retail clients that shows a real-time view of their account value and highlights clearly the value of tax loss harvesting.\nAnd clients continue to turn to Schwab for advice during market volatility. Schwab Wealth Advisory had $3.2 billion in net flows in the first quarter, the highest quarter of net flows in the history of the offer, as both Schwab and Ameritrade clients increasingly find the offer attractive. Finally, we continue to meet the specific needs of our client segments. We are launching this year Schwab Private Client Services and Schwab Private Wealth Services for our high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients. We are winning with this client segment today and the differentiated service, support and offering will further add to our no trade-offs experience for this client segment.\nOur world-class trader offering remains unparalleled in the industry. We released new features on thinkorswim while preparing to convert thinkorswim clients and preparing to make the offer available to Schwab clients this year. Another key priority in this focus area is to provide tailored solutions and experiences for RIAs of all sizes.\nIn the first quarter, we acquired Family Wealth Alliance, a membership organization that provides resources to the family wealth community serving ultra-high net worth clients. The acquisition continues a relationship that has existed between the 2 companies for years. And together, we'll be able to expand the services we offer for multifamily offices and single-family offices. We are thriving and our growth initiatives are paying off. I shared in the winter business update some of the statistics you see on the left side of this page. They show we have lots of opportunity in front of us. We remain confident we can close the share of wallet opportunity I described by introducing clients to the collective capabilities of our integrated firm. We also believe we can accelerate the growth of our wealth business, both at Schwab and by introducing it to Ameritrade clients.\nWe saw very positive signs this quarter as it was our strongest quarter of flows ever into full-service wealth solutions. And 95% of eligible Ameritrade FCs enrolled a client into a wealth solution, a very promising sign for the future. We continue to invest in our lending platform to increasingly be there for clients in the future. And finally, the combination with Ameritrade allows us to enhance our trading capabilities for a highly engaged and important client segment. Investing in a thinkorswim platform and bringing the powerful platform tools and education to our trader clients will be an important differentiator for Schwab as we look to the future.\nI'd like to wrap up where I started. We are in a position of strength. Our business thrived in the first quarter and our growth accelerated through the recent market volatility. The virtuous cycle will continue to help us sustain attractive organic NNA growth from both new and existing clients. We are continuing to execute on our key strategic focus areas of scale and efficiency, win-win monetization and client segmentation. We saw meaningful impact from some of those initiatives in the first quarter, while other initiatives will help accelerate the growth of our business into the future.\nWe are delivering wins for clients and the firm each quarter. The future is bright. With that, I will turn it over to Jeff for Q&A.\n\nJeff Edwards\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nOperator, let's turn to the queue and please remind everyone how they can ask a question that they'd like."

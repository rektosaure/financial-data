After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThank you, Kartik. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. We had a very strong quarter with revenues up 11% year-over-year to a record $18.4 billion and earnings per share up 19% to $4.14. Card Member spending in the quarter accelerated to 9% or 8% on an FX-adjusted basis, with particularly strong retail spending and a bounce back in travel and our credit performance continued to be excellent. Based on our strong performance through the first 3 quarters, we're raising the guidance we provided in January. We now expect full year revenue growth of 9% to 10% and EPS between $15.20 and $15.50.\nThe big news in the quarter was the launch of our refreshed U.S. Consumer and Business Platinum cards, which reinforces our leadership in the premium space. I'm very pleased to say that the initial customer demand and engagement are exceeding our expectations. In fact, while it's still early, this is the strongest start we've seen for a U.S. Platinum card refresh.\nBefore I get into more details on platinum, I want to provide some context. We are fortunate to have a global premium customer base that is unmatched in the industry. And our goal is to provide our customers with the best experience in the industry but continually investing and innovating our value propositions. The recent Platinum launch is yet another example of our proven strategy of refreshing our products on a regular basis to drive customer engagement and growth. In fact, we've done over 200 refreshes across our portfolio globally since 2019.\nAnd this is the third U.S. Platinum refresh we've done in the past decade. Our refresh strategy leverages and strengthens the competitive advantages of our membership model. It starts with understanding what our customers and our prospective customers want and then enhancing our value propositions with access to compelling benefits, services and experiences at a price point that delivers outstanding value. The scale of our premium customer base gives us a distinct advantage. Our consumer and business Platinum Card franchise alone accounts for approximately $530 billion of annual spend globally. This scale gives us deep insights into customer spending patterns and emerging trends. which informs our product enhancements and where we invest.\nAnother key advantage is the relationships we have with 160 million merchants around the world who accept our cards. We've grown the number of Amex-accepting merchants by nearly 5x since 2017, getting our card members more places to use their cards and giving more merchants access to our high-spending customers. who spend on average nearly 3x more annually on American Express cards than the average spend per card on other networks. Ultimately, product refreshes fuel a virtuous cycle of growth for the company by continually enhancing our offerings, we drive the engagement and scale of our premium customer base.\nOur high spending Card Members attract a growing number of world-class merchant partners who add more value to membership, which drives more engagement. And this enables us to generate more dollars that we can reinvest in enhancing our products. The result of all this is a loyal and growing premium customer base. mutually beneficial relationships with our merchants and strong returns for our shareholders, including higher revenue growth, excellent credit quality, expense leverage and increased profit across our product portfolios.\nThere's no better example of how we execute the strategy in our Platinum cards. We launched our first Platinum Card over 40 years ago. It was the first premium part of its kind in the industry and remains the category leader. Platinum was initially designed for well-established affluent frequent travelers. Several years ago, we made a conscious decision to widen our aperture for our premium products, so that we could also attract new generations to the franchise and grow with them as their needs change. With the value enhancements we've made over the past decade, the Platinum Card has evolved into the leading premium lifestyle card than it is today with a wider range of benefits and experiences that appeal broadly across generations, including millennial and Gen Z consumers who are very comfortable paying for exceptional value and are highly engaged in a product.\nA good example of these value enhancements is the previous U.S. Platinum refresh we did in 2021 coming out of the COVID pandemic. We learned that our card members, particularly the younger cohorts, love the benefits we've added in categories like digital entertainment, wellness and delivery services in addition to our travel offerings, which we also continue to enrich with investments in new Centurion lounges and the expansion of our hotel programs. That brings me to our most recent platinum launch. Here again, we continued our strategy of enhancing the card's benefits and services with more world-class partners across the areas we know our customers love to deliver industry-leading value that far exceeds the card's annual fee. In addition, we continue to enhance our award-winning digital capabilities, introducing a new app experience for our U.S. Platinum members that makes it even easier to engage with the cards benefits.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the initial results are very strong, exceeding our expectations. For example, New platinum account acquisitions are running at twice the level before the refresh. In the first 3 weeks, we saw very strong engagement in the new benefits and over 500,000 requests for the new Miracard. And while the annual fee increase won't go into effect for a few months, retention rates have been stable post refresh. In addition to these results, we saw record bookings through Amex travel following the Platinum refresh and the launch of our new all-in-one travel app, which we introduced earlier in September in the U.S.\nLooking ahead, I'm confident about our ability to sustain our growth by continuing to build on our powerful membership platform with a growing set of high-value products, benefits, services and experiences. We'll also continue expanding our digital capabilities for consumers and businesses, including the upcoming integration of center's expense management solution for commercial customers. and we'll focus on continuing to grow merchant coverage outside the U.S. to give card members more places to use their Amex cards.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Christophe to walk through more detail on third quarter results.\n\nChristophe Y. Le Caillec\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a few highlights for the quarter. Our business model is performing really well. Revenue growth accelerated to 11% this quarter with broad-based growth across revenue lines. Annual card fees are now approaching $10 billion annually and have grown at double digits for 29 consecutive quarters. Credit performance remains excellent, with both U.S. consumer and small business delinquency rates still below 2019 levels. And we've driven leverage from expenses and provision even as we have invested in our premium value propositions, marketing and technology. As a result, we continue to deliver very strong returns. EPS growth was 19% this quarter with an ROE of 36%.\nTurning to bill business trends for the quarter. Total spend was up 8.5% FX adjusted, about 2 percentage points higher than Q2. The step-up in growth was driven by strong retail spending, up 12% and as well as a rebound in T&E. Airlines spending picked up this quarter. In restaurants, our largest T&E category continued to be very strong, up 9%. Premium T&E bookings saw good momentum with spending on front of cabin airline tickets up 14%. The momentum we've seen from younger customers also continued Millennials and Gen Z now account for 36% of total spend, making up the same share as GenX. International had another strong quarter. We spent up 13% FX adjusted. Momentum remains broad-based across markets with 3 of our 5 top countries growing by 18% or more this quarter.\nIn addition, to the strong early performance we are seeing in the U.S. following the refresh, spent on platinum cards issued outside the U.S. is up 24% this quarter, consistent with what we have seen over the last 2 years. Overall spend growth continues to be driven by transaction growth, up 10% in Q3, a good indicator of engagement from our customer base. I will note that we see strong engagement from millennial and Gen Z card members with the average number of transactions per U.S. customer about 25% higher than older cohorts. We acquired 3.2 million new cars in the quarter. And even more important than the overall number of cards, demand for our premium products remain very strong with over 70% of new accounts acquired on fee-paying products.\nTurning to balance growth and credit. Loan and card member receivables were up 7% year-over-year, broadly in line with Bill business. There was about a 1 percentage point impact on balanced growth from our held-for-sale portfolios again this quarter. Credit performance remains very strong and stable. Q3 delinquency and write-off rates were low with delinquency rates flat to last quarter, while write-off rates declined. This performance is supported by our focus on premium products, which tend to attract high-income, highly creditworthy customers. We're seeing the outcome of this strategy in the latest platinum refresh, where the credit profiles of consumer applicants following the refresh or even better than what we were seeing before with average FICO score up 15 points, contributing to 2x the number of acquisitions. Overall provision expense of $1.3 billion this quarter included a reserve build of $125 million, reflecting balanced growth.\nTurning to revenue on Slide 14. The Revenue was very strong this quarter, up 11% with momentum across revenue lines. Net card fees were up 17% FX adjusted, a pace that we have now maintained since 2019. Car fee growth moderated as we expected and will continue to moderate before we see an inflection upward in 2026 as a result of our product refreshes. As a reminder, Com members who held platinum costs prior to the refresh get to experience the new benefits for a few months before the increase in the annual fee goes into effect. The new car fee will then be applied at renewal anniversaries over the next 12 months. Additionally, card fees are amortized over a 12-month period.\nPutting those factors together, it takes roughly 2 years to fully lap the impact of the refresh on card fees with the contribution to growth peaking 12 months following the effective date of the new annual fee. Of course, the overall trajectory of card fees is also dependent on many other factors such as volume and mix of acquisitions, retention and the food suite and cadence of product refreshes globally. Net interest income was up 12% again this quarter. We continue to grow balances largely in line with spending while driving higher NII growth by expanding the margin earned on balances. And at the same time, we've maintained best-in-class credit results.\nThis quarter, the service fees and other revenue line includes the impact of a transaction at the Global Business Travel Group, which contributed about 5 percentage points to year-over-year growth in this line. In addition, this is the first quarter that we have fully lapped the sale of the acidify business last May. The main takeaway here is that growth in service fees and other revenue is running higher than the low single digits that we saw in the second half of last year and earlier this year. Overall, we feel good about the momentum we have at this point in the year, and we are on track for full year revenue growth of 9% to 10%.\nTurning to expense performance. VCE was up 14% in the quarter, with the VCE to revenue ratio coming in at 42%. Car member service growth stepped up for the first stepped up from the first half of the year, driven by strong early engagement with the refreshed U.S. Platinum benefits, especially some of the quarterly credits that were available to customers. This is a good early sign of interest in the product and the new benefits. And as we noted previously, the cost of benefits occurs immediately while the realization of fee revenue is lagged, given the timing and accounting of those fees. Our model also benefits from partners that offer value to our customers. Over the last 12 months, our partners have offered over $3 billion of value across Embedded benefits, Amex travel and Amex offers. We also manage our VCE expenses through constant innovation of our rewards and benefits, the latest 1 being the introduction of amount-based redemptions.\nAs we've noted previously, we expect the VCE ratio to increase over time as a result of our investments in the value proposition and the mix shift to a more premium portfolio. We also feel good about the ability of these investments, together with the expense leverage to drive sustainable mid-teens EPS growth under our long-term aspiration.\nMoving on to capital. We returned $2.9 billion of capital to our shareholders, including $0.6 billion of dividends and $2.3 billion of share repurchases. Our business continues to generate very strong returns with an ROE of 36% this quarter. Our strong ROE enables us to return a high level of earnings to our shareholders around 70% over the past 3 years. Over the same time period, our dividend is up 58%. That brings me to the outlook for the year, while there continues to be uncertainty in the environment, given the strength of our performance. We are raising our full year guidance. We now expect revenue growth of 9% to 10% and earnings per share between $15.20 and $15.50. This assumes a stable macroeconomic outlook as we get to the end of the year. Stepping back, we feel really good about our momentum year-to-date and we are very pleased with the initial demand and engagement following the platinum refresh.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik, and we'll take your questions.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just 1 question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?",

So thank you. We had another strong quarter. Revenues reached a record $17.9 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Earnings per share, $4.08, up 17%, excluding last year's gain from the sale of the Certified. Total Card Member spending was up 7%, which was consistent with the pattern we've seen this year, while spend in some of the travel categories like airlines and lodging was softer overall, spending was a quarterly record. Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we are reaffirming our full year revenue growth and EPS guidance that we provided in January.\nLast month, we received the results of the Fed's annual CCAR process, which set our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement at the lowest permissible level of 2.5%. The results once again demonstrated that we had the lowest projected credit card loss and highest profitability rates under the Fed stress test among all banks subject to CCAR. These results were a testament to the earnings power of our resilient business model and our strong capital position. Looking ahead, we're very excited about the upcoming refresh of our U.S. Consumer and Business Platinum cards this fall. The competition for premium customers, while always intense, has been especially heated for over a decade. And it's been a very good thing for our customers, for the category and for us. In fact, the past decade has been one of the very best in terms of growing our premium card portfolios and scaling our card member base. As the industry leader in premium cards, we benefit from a strong interest in the category.\nThe total addressable market is growing at a healthy rate globally, driven by several factors, including our own value proposition innovation, the investments of competitors and generational shifts in the appeal of premium products. As a result, the basis of competition has shifted, especially among affluent consumers away from cashback and no-fee products and towards partnered value access, experiences and superior customer service where we do excel. We believe we can continue to lead in this space as the category and competitive interest continue to grow, but let me tell you why. To start with, we've led the premium card category for over 40 years. We achieved that position by creating a multifaceted membership-focused business model, which includes a wide range of assets that set us apart and when taken together, are very difficult to replicate.\nTo build on our success, we've increased our focus on the premium space over the last several years, strategically investing in refreshing our products regularly all around the world. Our refreshed strategy focuses on enriching our value propositions with more benefits and offerings in areas that our customers value most at a price point that delivers outstanding value. A key element of this strategy is our ability to attract a growing number of premier partners to fund offerings to gain access to our large-scale high-spending customer base. Beyond the individual product value propositions, we're also constantly evolving our suite of experiences and benefits that set the competitive standard, giving our card member access to over 27,000 of the most sought-after restaurants, wineries and other venues through Resi and Top, the largest airport lounge network in the industry, which includes 30 proprietary Centurion lounges today with more on the way as well as access to all Delta lounges, exclusive experiences across sports, fashion and entertainment and a wide range of benefits at over 2,600 premium hotels and resorts worldwide.\nThis strategy has worked especially well for us. For example, in each of the recent refreshes we've done for our U.S. consumer Gold, Delta and Hilton cards over the last 2 years, customer demand has increased, driving double-digit account growth. Revenue growth in each of the 3 portfolios is up over 30% with card fee revenues up at least 60%. And spend retention remains very high at 98%, and we've seen no meaningful change after the refreshes. Additionally, the high credit quality of the new customers we're bringing in has helped us widen the gap between our credit metrics and the rest of the industry. As we look ahead to our U.S. Platinum launches, you can expect to see the same formula, providing the best premium experience to card members with more differentiated benefits and more world-class partners joining us to offer card members more value that substantially exceeds the annual fee. Longer term, when you combine our proven product refresh strategy with our global premium customer base at scale, our network of world-class partners, our lifestyle-orientated membership defined brand and an addressable market that is growing at a healthy annual rate globally especially in key areas we're focused on the premium sector and younger consumers. These are all the reasons why we believe we have a long runway for growth and can sustain our momentum in our leadership in the premium space going forward.\nI'll now turn it over to Christophe to provide more detailed on quarterly results.\n\nChristophe Y. Le Caillec\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the highlights for the quarter on Slide 2. As Steve noted, we reported revenue growth of 9% and earnings per share of $4.08, up 17%, excluding the gain from certified last year. On Slide 2, you'll see a list of several notable developments in the quarter. We've selected these highlights because they are great indicators of the progress we're making towards our long-term strategy across key areas of the business, technology, partnerships or products. .\nBefore we get into the details of this quarter's results, let me step back for a moment to reflect on what the trends from this quarter indicate. When you look at our performance across spend, transactions, demand for new cars, retention and credit in the context of the significant macroeconomic and geopolitical developments of the past few months, what you see is remarkable resilience across our customer base. and why there may be a bit of prudence around the edges, this performance indicates the strength of our business model and\nstrategy. Turning to bill business trends. At the overall level, spend was consistent with Q1, up 7% for the quarter. Goods and services spending, which accounts for over 70% of our business continue to grow at a similar pace to Q1. And T&E growth was down a bit versus Q1, driven by softer airline and lodging spend, while restaurant spending continued to be very strong, up 8% FX adjusted. Our fastest-growing cohorts kept up the momentum. In the U.S. Consumer business, millennial spend was up 10% and and Jense spend was growing around 40%, though starting from a smaller base. And our international business continued to grow in double digits, up 12% FX adjusted in the quarter.\nTransaction growth was up 9% is another indicator of strong customer engagement and is largely consistent with what we've been seeing over the past few quarters. We acquired 3.1 million new cars in Q2 within the range of recent quarters. We sometimes get asked how we can sustain this space. Starting this quarter, we are breaking out the number of cards we acquired by segment. As you can see, we've acquired about 1.5 million new cars per quarter in the U.S. consumer business over the past few quarters. When you compare that to industry-wide new account originations, even among customers with FICO scores above 660. It's a relatively small share, indicating continued runway for growth. Turning to balance growth and credit. Loans of Card Member receivables increased 6% year-over-year FX adjusted, growing at a similar pace to build business. This quarter's results at about a 1 percentage point impact of the held-for-sale portfolios that we previously closed. Our premium products continue to be the primary driver of that growth. with our pay over time, and co-brand portfolios driving around 80% of growth in Card Member revolving loans in the quarter.\nOur growth in premium products over the past few years has further strengthened the credit quality of our portfolio, resulting in very strong credit performance. Q2 delinquency and write-off rates remained low with delinquency rates flat to Q1, while write-off rates decline. Our strong credit performance is remarkable across all age groups. In fact, the delinquency rate for our U.S. millennial and Jens customers are not only better than the industry average of those age groups, but they are also nearly 40% better than the industry average for older age groups. The strength of our premium model all in a stressed environment. As demonstrated by the Fed [ CCAR ] results, which showed that we have the highest and lower credit card loss rate across all banks subject to the stress test. Total provision expense was $1.4 billion for the quarter, which includes a reserve build of $222 million reflecting growth in loan volume and a worse macroeconomic outlook. As a reminder, there's scenarios used in the reserve model at the end of Q1 did not incorporate the changes in the outlook that we started to see in early April.\nTurning to revenue on Slide 14. I'll hit on a few key points. FX-adjusted revenue growth was 9%, both for the quarter as well as for the first 6 months of the year. We continue to see strong momentum in net card fees, which reached record levels and were up 20% effect adjusted again this quarter. the exceptional growth we've seen in car fees over the past several years, averaging 17% per year since 2019 really speaks to our strategy as we've increased our focus on the premium space.\nThis is the result of, first, acquiring new customers onto fee-based products, then driving strong retention of our customer base. And finally, consistently increasing value through product refreshes and pricing accordingly. The result is a net card fee line that has more than doubled since 2019. Taking a look next at our premium lending business. Net interest income grew at a double-digit pace against this quarter. One question we sometimes get is around the drivers of our strong growth in NII over the past several years.\nStarting this quarter, we've aimed to give you a picture of how both volume and margin have led to this growth. The takeaway here is that since 2019, a bit more than half of the increase in NII has come from balance sheet growth. This volume growth has been about the same as growth in card member spending. The reason that NII has grown faster than volumes is because we've increased the margin generated on these balances. We have achieved that margin expansion by improving pricing for risk by rolling out more lending features, especially across our historically painful charge card products and by growing our deposit business. Most importantly, we've achieved this growth while maintaining very low credit risk.\nIn fact, widening the gap to peers. And looking ahead, we believe we have a long runway for growth in our premium lending business. To sum up our revenue performance. We feel good about the momentum we have half way through the year. with the overall revenue growth tracking in line with our full year guidance. Let's turn to expense performance on Slide 18. If you think about the way we manage the expense base, we generally expect VCE to grow a bit faster than revenue as a result of the mix shift towards premium products and the investment we make in products to drive acquisition, engagement and strong credit outcomes. At the same time, we look to drive leverage from marketing and OpEx over time as we generate efficiencies and economy of scale. That continues to be how you should think about our expense base for the full year.\nIn Q2, VCE expenses grew a bit faster revenue and marketing grew in the mid-single digits. OpEx, excluding [indiscernible] was up 9% in the quarter, a bit higher than our expectation coming into the year. The year-over-year growth is predominantly driven by investment in our enterprise risk management capabilities and technology of the company's [indiscernible]. Looking ahead, for the full year, we expect OpEx growth to be in the mid-single digits versus last year, Accertify, predominantly driven by the weaker dollar. As you think about the ability of our business model to drive expense leverage, I'd note that since 2023, we have driven 4 points of operating leverage with operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, down from 25% in 2023 to 21% this quarter. Moving on to capital. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6% within our 10% to 11% target range. We returned $2 billion of capital to our shareholders, including $0.6 billion of dividends and $1.4 billion of share repurchases. In Q1, we increased our dividend by 17%.\nBased on the CCAR results, our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains at 2.5%. The lowest prescribed level, allowing us to continue executing our disciplined capital management strategy while returning excess capital to our shareholders. Our business continues to generate very strong returns with an ROE of 36% in the quarter, providing us with capital flexibility. That brings me to our 2025 guidance. We're now halfway through the year, having delivered 9% FX-adjusted revenue growth and EPS of $7.71. Trends across the business have been largely stable. While there continues to be uncertainty in how the coming quarters will play out, we have increased confidence in our path forward. As a result, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings per share between 15% and 15.50%.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik and we'll take your questions.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nThank you, Christophe. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator? .",

And we generated net income of $2.6 billion, or $3.64 per share. During the Q1, our premium customer base continued to spend at healthy levels. Total card member spending grew 6% in the quarter, or 7% excluding the impact of leap year, with spending on goods and services continuing to grow at a faster rate than in 2024. In T&E, while we saw a sequential slowdown in airline billings growth, billings in restaurants, and lodging remained strong in the quarter, and overall T&E growth was in line with the steady levels we saw through most of last year.\nWe also continued to grow our customer base, adding 3.4 million new cards in the quarter. As in past quarters, Millennial and Gen Z consumers made up over 60% of new consumer accounts acquired globally in Q1. In addition, card fee growth was up 20% on an FX-adjusted basis. Retention continued to be high, and our credit performance remained excellent. While it's still very early in the Q2, through the first week and a half in April, overall spending levels have remained consistent with what we saw in the Q1 in both goods and services and T&E and across all customer segments. Based on the steady spend and credit trends we've seen to date, we're maintaining our full-year revenue growth guidance of 8% to 10% and EPS of $15 to 15.50.\nWhile we recognize that uncertainty in the environment has increased, the guidance incorporates the changes that we see in the macroeconomic outlook as of today. As we think about the near future, we have a resilient and differentiated business model that positions us well to navigate a range of economic environments. First and foremost, we have a global premium customer base at scale. In fact, as our customer base has grown over the past several years, it has gotten even more premium. Our card members have high incomes, are loyal, high spending, and have excellent credit profiles. And as you know, we underwrite all our card members through the credit cycle. Another key differentiator of our model is our mix of revenues.\nWell, the combination of spend and fees accounting of 75% of our overall revenue base, which makes us less reliant on lending revenues and less sensitive to credit cycles compared to our competitors. Also, we have significant expense leverage and flexibility that has grown as our scale has increased over the past several years, enabling us to effectively control our cost while continuing to invest for the long term. In addition to the natural hedges and our customer engagement expenses, we have several levers across our marketing and operating expense lines, enabling us to quickly pivot if the environment changes. Looking ahead, we'll need to see how things play out in the coming months. That said, we are operating from a position of strength, and we have a set of principles that guide us.\nOur fundamental objective, as it is with everything we do, is to manage the company for the long-term growth for our shareholders. As we do so, we are focused on four core principles. Above all, we'll back our customers through ongoing enhancements to our products and services, as well as providing support for those who may need it. We'll also back our colleagues so they continue to focus on innovating for our customers and providing a world-class experience that is core to our brand. We'll exercise disciplined expense management using the various levers in our business model to maintain financial flexibility. And we'll continue to invest strategically for the long term in areas that strengthen our foundational capabilities, such as technology, control management, and customer acquisition, as well as capitalizing on opportunities that emerge for expanding our membership model with new and enhanced products, services, and experiences.\nAs we move ahead, we are committed to following these principles and leveraging the advantages of our business model, which makes me confident that we are well-positioned for continued growth over the long term. I'll now turn it over to Christophe to provide more color on our Q1 results, and then we'll answer your questions.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, we generated 8% FX-adjusted revenue growth, or 9% excluding the impact of leap year and earnings per share of $3.64. These results are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year. Key business indicators such as spend, retention, credit performance, and demand for our premium products continue to be strong and stable in the quarter. While the level of macroeconomic uncertainty has increased, the activity that we see across our customer base is consistent with, and in many cases, better than what we saw in 2024. Turning to billed business performance, starting on slide three, I'd remind you that the rollover from leap year in 2024 drove about a percentage point drag on year-over-year growth rates across segments and spend categories.\nAs we look at spend trends over the next few slides, I'll speak to billings growth rates that are adjusted for leap year, as well as FX. Total billings was up around 7.5% year-over-year. This growth is around a percentage point higher than what we saw for the full year 2024. Goods and services spending sustained the uptick we saw in Q4 of last year, continuing to grow at a faster pace than what we saw in 2024. And T&E grew in line with the steady levels we saw for most of last year, reflecting continued strength in restaurant and lodging spending. We did see a deceleration in airline spending relative to 2024 trends, although spending on front-of-cabin tickets remained strong, up around 11% in the quarter.\nAs we break down spend trends across our business over the next few slides, there are a few key points I want to highlight. We continue to see solid growth across our affluent US consumer base. We spent up 8%. Millennial and Gen Z customers once again drove our highest bill business growth within the segment. Commercial services spend was up 3% versus last year, consistent with the trends we saw in 2024. US SME spending at wholesale merchants saw a modest acceleration in growth over the quarter, possibly reflecting higher purchases in advance of potential price increases. International card services spend was up 14%. This strong growth was seen across geographies, with each of our top five markets growing by double digits. We continued to see strong demand for and engagement with our products.\nTurning to lending performance on slide seven, loans and Card Member receivables increased 7% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. Our premium products continue to be the primary driver of that growth, with our Pay Over Time and co-brand portfolios driving around 80% of growth in Card Member revolving loans in the Q1. These products tend to attract high-creditworthy customers, supporting our model of growing lending while maintaining best-in-class credit performance. Turning to slides eight and nine, our credit performance continues to be very strong. Both delinquency and write-off rates were below pre-pandemic levels and flat to the prior year. The profile of the portfolio has strengthened over the past few years. Looking at our recent acquisitions, the delinquency rate of low-tenure customers, defined as those with 24 months or less of tenure, is about 30% lower than 2019 levels for US consumer Card Members.\nThis quarter, we had about $1.2 billion of provision expense. This included a small reserve release, mostly reflecting the strong quality of the portfolio and the macroeconomic outlook as of quarter end. Turning next to revenue on slide 10, total revenues were up 8% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, or 9% excluding leap year. Before we discuss this quarter's trends, I'd remind you that the strengthening of the US dollar that occurred throughout last year continues to be a headwind to reported revenue growth, although a bit less than we anticipated earlier in the quarter. Also, starting this quarter, we consolidated process revenue within service fees and other revenue. Starting with discount revenue, our largest revenue line was up 5% year-over-year FX-adjusted, and it's mostly driven by the spend trends I discussed earlier.\nNet card fees were at record levels and increased 20% FX-adjusted, as shown on slide 12, reflecting our 27th consecutive quarter of double-digit card fee growth. We saw strong demand for our products as we acquired 3.4 million new cards in the quarter. A key driver of our strong card fee growth over the past few years has been the acquisition of new Card Members on fee-paying products, which accounted for around 70% of new accounts in the quarter. Another important contributor has been our ability to attract customers on higher fee products over time. Over the past three years, the average card fee per new account acquired has increased by around 40%, reflecting strong demand for our premium products and our success in pricing for the increased value we provide customers as we refresh our products.\nTurning to slide 13, net interest income increased 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, growing slightly faster than loans and receivables as we saw increases in net yield versus last year. Turning now to expense performance on slide 15, the VCE to revenue ratio came in at 43% this quarter. Rewards expense grew 16% year-over-year. As a reminder, this quarter, we are growing over the benefit we saw in Q1 of last year from changes to our URR model. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, some small changes we made to the program that are good for both customers and our overall economics are driving a small increase in the URR in the short term. Now that we have lapped the impact from the URR model change last year, we expect rewards to grow more in line with the historical trend for the remainder of this year.\nAs you can see, marketing and OpEx continue to be key sources of expense leverage for our business. Our flexible model is an important advantage that allows us to dial up or down expenses as needed through different economic environments. Let me move to capital on slide 16. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7% within our 10% to 11% target range. We returned $1.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, including $0.6 billion of dividends and $0.7 billion of share repurchases. This quarter, we increased our dividend by 17%. Our differentiated spend and fee-driven business model generates a strong ROE, which was 34% in the quarter, providing us with very strong capital flexibility. Before we turn to our 2025 guidance, let me talk about the trends we're seeing in recent weeks.\nAs Steve discussed, looking at the first week and a half of April, overall spending trends are consistent with Q1. We are seeing this performance for both T&E and goods and services, as well as across our US consumer, international, and commercial customer segments. Given the environment, we have also seen SME purchases accelerate with wholesale merchants. Additionally, demand for our products is in line with our expectations. This brings me to our 2025 guidance. Given the stability of our performance to date, we are maintaining our guidance of revenue growth of 8% to 10% and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50. This guidance incorporates a macroeconomic outlook with a peak-weighted average unemployment rate of around 5.7%, higher than the outlook as it stood at quarter end.\nOf course, there are clearly many uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment, but given the balance of factors, we believe this guidance is appropriate. More importantly, we remain confident and focused on the long-term growth of the company. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Kartik, and we will take your questions.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. You'll hear a tone indicating that you've been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star, then two. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nSanjay?\n\nOperator\n\nSanjay, just make sure your phone is not on mute.\n\nSanjay Sakrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nSorry, I was on mute. Good morning.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nNo problem.\n\nSanjay Sakrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nSorry. So Steve, we've heard a lot about pull forward of spending, and I'm just curious if you guys have seen any indication that that's sort of propping up spend volumes. And then just sort of along the lines, if we do see some volatility or weakness in spending and revenues, how far do you want to go in terms of sort of protecting earnings? How low does revenues need to go for you to sort of just cut the line in terms of expense reductions? Thanks.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nSo look, we really haven't seen any pull forward at all. I think when you look at the entire Q1, and I think you'd really want to focus in on March and early April, there's really been no pull forward at all. We see a little bit in small business, a little bit in wholesale pull forward, but I mean, you're talking a couple of points here. You're not talking about anything significant. So I don't think that has been a phenomenon. Having said that, it's still early in the game, right? I mean, we're early innings here, and we'll just have to see how it all plays out. But just to be clear, from a consumer perspective, we've seen no pull forward at all.\nPeople continue to book, and we didn't talk about this in the call, but we had the highest number of travel bookings that we've had that we've ever had. That includes a high in international as well, international bookings from our travel-related services. So I think that we haven't seen a pull forward. We're seeing our customers act as they have acted in the past. The other two points I'll make, and then I'll get to the revenue one, is that one thing that has not been associated with our Card Member spending has either been what's happened with the stock market or what's happened with consumer confidence. Our Card Members may say they don't have any confidence in the economy, but they still continue to spend, and they're not spending off what's in the market.\nSo those two factors, which I get asked a lot about, are not really factors in our customer spending. I think, look, as we've said before, from a guidance perspective, and I said this at conferences, we believe that at that 8% range, we can make our EPS number. But the other thing that I will say is that I'm not going to pass up good opportunities to invest for the future just to hit a number. I mean, it's not how I've run the company over the last seven years or so. And as I said, even during COVID, we continued to invest when others might have pulled back. And so I just want to reinforce we are running this company for the longer term. If I see a good opportunity, I'm going to continue to invest in it.\nI do believe where we are right now with the macroeconomic situation the way it is, that we can continue to be within our guidance range on both revenue and EPS. As we've said in the past, we have the aspirational goal of 10% revenue. However, we also have said that we can hit our EPS range if revenue goes lower.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMark DeVries\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. So if some of these steeper tariffs go through as initially proposed, Steve, can you just talk about which segments of your business you would expect to be under the most pressure? And is there anything you can do from a risk management perspective to get out in front of that?\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, I mean, look, from a risk management perspective, we're constantly, on a daily basis, modifying our inputs and modifying our models and looking on that. So we always like to think we're way out in front of that anyway. But I think that where you would wind up looking is you would look at small businesses first. I think small businesses might be the ones that would be impacted first. And if you think about our consumers, what our consumers tend to do is what they would tend to do is they spend a little bit less, revolve a little bit less. And I'll just take you back to COVID. Remember, we have really a self-liquidating balance sheet, right? And so our balance sheet's made up a lot of our AR. And as consumers spend a little bit less, that's how they regulate risk.\nAnd so, but small businesses, I think, small businesses are the ones that we would pay a lot more attention to just because cost may not—they could be put in a situation they will not be able to compete effectively in the market. So we'll continue to look at small businesses as this situation evolves. But rest assured, we're looking at this proactively right now, much like we did pre-COVID in terms of looking at people's lines, looking at who we bring into the franchise. And what I would say is that if you look at our card base now versus our card base in 2019, it is more premium than it was at that point with higher FICOs.\nThe other thing that I'll say, because people will start looking at millennials and low-tenure card members, our Millennials and Gen Zs are performing significantly better, both from a FICO perspective and from a delinquency perspective, than the industry. Secondly, our low-tenure card members, their delinquency rates are actually lower than our low-tenure card members were back in 2019.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Steve, can you talk a little bit about card refresh and fee growth? I know one of your competitors recently raised fees on co-brand cards. In this environment, do you still feel like you have the ability to sort of grow fees?\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nI think that, look, we're still committed to doing refreshes. We've refreshed over 150 products over the last five years or so. We've got a bunch of refreshes in progress. How many we wind up doing, we'll see how it all plays out. It's more due. I think there's a lot of them in progress. The question becomes how, from a value proposition development, technology development, how they all get through this through the pipeline this year. But we're still committed to doing refresh. As far as raising fees, we don't raise fees indiscriminately. You raise fees when you add value. And our playbook has been, we will raise the fee when we raise value that is even more commensurate than with the fees.\nSo as we think about refreshes, what I will tell you is that whatever fee we wind up raising, and look, the reality is we don't do a lot of refreshes without raising the fees, but we also don't do any refreshes without significantly enhancing the value that we put in. So you can rest assured that when someone does a rational calculation of what the fee raise is and what the value is, it becomes an easy decision to continue with the product or even a better decision to get the product at that particular point in time. So the environment will not impact our fee decisioning with our cards because that fee decision is totally based on value, and our card members wind up getting back more than they put in.\nOne might argue it might even be a better investment at this time than in a good environment.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRick Shane\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Hey, Steve, you talk about investing across the cycle basically as a strategic initiative. I'm curious, tactically, given where we are, where you see opportunities, and I'm curious sort of where you're going to be more aggressive, where you're going to be more defensive. And I did note that the amount of capital you retained from Q1 profits was the highest it's been since COVID. So I'm curious how you're looking at capital offensively, defensively as well.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So I'll let Christophe answer the capital question. I mean, there's always we look to return about 80% of our earnings to our shareholders. And you'll notice from quarter to quarter, it does swing. And particularly in the Q1, just go back historically, the Q1 is usually one of our lowest quarters where we do return capital. But the capital that we returned this particular quarter was only about $300 million less than we actually returned in the Q4 of last year. So it wasn't all that much. They're checking the slides to make sure that my comment was correct there. But look, from an investment perspective, you just saw that we just completed the Center acquisition. We believe that that's an important acquisition for us, for small business, and for middle market.\nThat obviously has some capital implications, especially in the Q2 as we closed it. But when you look at our business, and specifically in technology, we're constantly upgrading our technology infrastructure. When I talk about technology infrastructure, I'm not only just talking about the hardware aspects of it, but I'm talking about all the systems that run behind it. And the reality is that some of these projects go for a couple of years, and some of them are months, and what have you. But you can't stop the upgrading and the investment from a technology infrastructure because you anticipate times may be a little bit tough. It has to continue because we're running this company for the long term. Anybody that's ever been involved in this realizes you don't stop and start long-term projects.\nThe other thing that you don't stop and start is you don't stop and start your refresh strategy. I mean, we have been committed to continually enhancing and developing our products and services over the long term. And we're on a program that basically says we're going to refresh all of our products, and I'll put all in quotes, from a three- to four-year cycle. And so you just can't stop that. If you did, then I think you're doing a disservice to your customers, and you're doing a disservice to your shareholders. And this goes back to Sanjay's earlier question about how much potentially would you cut to make EPS guidance. And my perspective is that, again, we're running it for the longer term.\nFor me to stop a technology project or for me to stop a refresh or an enhancement because I want to make another $0.20 for the year is foolhardy. It's not something that you shouldn't ever expect me to do. We're looking to make sure that this company continues to become stronger day by day. You do that by continuing to invest and continuing to stay true to what your core principles are.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nSo maybe to add a bit of color on capital, there's not a lot to add, as a matter of fact, because we covered most of it. As you know, Rick, the governor here is our CET1 ratio. That is what will define the amount of share repo that we're going to do. We target between 10 and 11. We're a little bit on the high side, at 10.7%, but you shouldn't read anything in that. If you look at over time, we've been at 10.8, 10.5. We're ending up a little bit on the high side at the end of the quarter, and that's it. We distributed exactly the amount that we had in our plans in terms of capital. I will mention, though, that this is the Q1 where we increased the dividend by 17%.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Erika Najarian of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Diretor and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi. Thank you. I just wanted to confirm the 8% to 10% revenue guide. You said something to the effect of that now takes into account a 5.7% unemployment rate. I just wanted to confirm that, A, you feel like you can generate 8% to 10% revenue growth even in light of an unemployment rate that we haven't seen in a while. And to that end, I think, Steve, you mentioned that the stock market really didn't impact spend. I'd be curious to understand, since your data is so good, in terms of how spend progressed January through March, particularly in your affluent consumer segment, as you had mentioned in the last call that January was off to a strong start.\nJust wondering whether or not the resilience had sort of carried through, even though we had all the headline risk and stock market volatility in March?\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So I'll give you a little color on the spending here. The reality is January, February, and March pretty much looked exactly the same. 0.2% here, 0.2% there. And the first 11, 12 days in April are slightly stronger than that. So it has been consistent. There has been really no movement, really up or down. The only thing I would say is that when you looked at small business, you did see a little bit of a tick up as we moved into the end of March, but I'm talking minor, half a point or something like that. And then you saw a little bit of a pickup in the first 11 days. But we'll see how all that plays out. And I think April will be an interesting month because you have Easter. And traditionally, you don't have as much corporate spend.\nYou may not have as much small business spend, retail spend, and so forth and so on. We'll see how April plays out. Last year, Easter was, I think, at the end of March. As far as unemployment, look, we have 5.7% incorporated in our macro. I think for us, when we really look at unemployment, it's really more white-collar unemployment that is more of a driver of potentially spending than it is total overall unemployment because of how our card base tends to skew. We'll watch that very carefully. But we feel really comfortable with the unemployment, even though the unemployment level that we have in our outlook is higher than it's been. We feel comfortable with holding the guide at this particular point in time. Obviously, there'll be more to come as the months go by. Right now, from a spend perspective, very consistent.\nWe feel comfortable, I mean, we feel comfortable where the unemployment level is as far as our guidance goes.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nLet me maybe, Erika, give you a bit more color in terms of how to think about that 5.7. We thought it would be useful to investors, to analysts, to share with you how we've been thinking about their credit reserve. As you know, we run multiple scenarios. The math is very complicated. It's lifetime losses. The 5.7 represents the peak unemployment rate for the purpose of this reserve calculation. It doesn't mean that we are anticipating that tomorrow, unemployment will jump to 5.7 and we'll stay there for the balance of the year, right? You have to think about it in the context of the CECL calculation.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Steve, I know the Millennial and Gen Z cohort continues to be a source of strength for AMEX. You're calling out the continued 60% plus of acquisitions, the better FICO and DQs versus industry, and your spend growth is running higher there. But just curious, are you noticing any sort of under-the-hood issues with that group from things like student loan repayment starting? There's been some reporting of some servicing issues for that group with the repayments starting. And I'm just wondering if there's any stats you can give on maybe spend per card or account for that cohort, just given that it's represented so much of your account growth so far. Thanks.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. We haven't seen anything. And I'll just take you back to we'll just throw a couple of statistics out. When you look at spend growth for that cohort for the quarter, it was up about 15% in the US consumer business, and it's representing about 35% of our overall spend. When you look at it internationally, it actually was up 22% in the quarter. So Millennial and Gen Z is even a larger contributor internationally. I'll take you back to Investor Day, where we talked about how they continue to grow year to year. And so we're still seeing that. The thing I will point out is that our Millennial not every Millennial and not every Gen Z have our card. As I think I mentioned a little bit earlier, the delinquency rate that we're seeing is a lot less than what the industry sees.\nThe FICO is a lot higher. A lot of them tend to be lower tenure as they come into the franchise. That delinquency rate is better than it was back pre-COVID. We don't disclose the actual card account billings on it. We did disclose it as we did that last at the Investor Day. Maybe we'll do that at another point in time. Today, I'm not going to share that because I don't have it at my fingertips either.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nSo maybe what I can add to those, if you're looking for numbers, the Millennial and Gen Z combined spend about 20% less than the older generation. So they do spend a bit less. They revolve a bit less as well. The other data point that we have shared in the past as well that echoes what Steve just said is that at acquisition, the average FICO of this cohort is 750. So very strong, very strong.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nDirector of Research and Managing Director, FT Partners\n\nYeah. Thanks. Appreciate taking the questions. I wanted to go back to something you said earlier. Investors are spending time hardening their books for what is expected to be a significant change in the economy over the next sort of nine to 12 months. So you had mentioned FICO scores, consumer confidence, wealth effects. Not to channel John Wick, but the boogeyman of the last recession was FICO creep. And it was FICO creep and companies getting caught thinking they were making better loans. Plus, with consumer confidence falling and the wealth effect, especially how that might impact the younger cohorts. Maybe you can talk about what you're basing your view on that consumer confidence and wealth effect won't impact spend. And sorry not to sneak this in, but could you also let us know what percentage of SMB build business is related to e-commerce businesses? Thanks.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. I don't have the sneak peek, I can't answer because I don't have that at my fingertips here either. But I guess that will become potentially more important as time goes on. And so we'll look into that. Craig, as far as what we're basing it on in terms of the wealth effect and consumer confidence history, the history of our cardholders. I mean, it just look, I've been here for 40 years and been through 9/11, financial crisis, COVID, and everything else. And the reality is that that has not been sort of the determining driver from a credit crunch perspective for us. And again, look, I think we'll continue to look at FICO scores. And I think there has been we've said this, and I think the industry has said this. There has been an acceleration probably in some of the FICO scores.\nBut it's not the only thing we look at. It's an easy metric to talk about. But certainly, that's not what was in our models. It's not what's in our models. The only thing in our models is a lot more in our models that go into making credit decisions. But look, we look at, historically, what our card base has done and what has impacted our card base. And I would say that white-collar unemployment from a credit perspective has probably been our John Wick, if you will, more than anything else.\nSo just one thing, Craig. If you take a step back away from FICO and you look at, say, delinquency rate, as you would expect, the variability from a credit standpoint is higher with the low-tenure card members. And therefore, we are looking, and that's why we might prepare a remark.\nI share this new data point for you guys to get an appreciation in terms of how we're thinking about that credit risk. If you look at the low-tenure Card Members, so those who have been with us less than two years, and you look at their delinquency rate today for those balances versus what it was for this same group of customers back in 2019, the delinquency rate is 30% lower, right? So that reflects a lot of things, including the skew that we saw in the five, six years in the previous five, six years in terms of acquiring premium Card Members and managing the book very, very carefully. So delinquency rate is just; it's a good metric to look at. And that looks much better than where we were pre-COVID. And at that time, we were already best in the industry.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Chris Kennedy of William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Kennedy\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Steve, you mentioned the acquisition of Center that comes after a string of other deals, whether it's Kabbage, Nipendo, others. Can you just talk about that journey and kind of give a state of the union on the SME technology investments and then how can that translate into better organic spend over time? Thank you.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. I think, look, what we've been on a journey here is to build more capabilities up for our SME customers. If you look at it, one of the things that we've said is we wanted to increase our relevance with our SME customers. Kabbage has become the platform where we want our SMEs to live. Within that platform, obviously, you have the ability to look at your card information, to do cash flow analysis, to have a checking account, to apply for loans. When you look at One AP and Nipendo, that's really all about automating the B2B piece of it. Then I think one of the things that was missing for us, and we were doing this through partnerships, but it became apparent it needed to be more core to us overall, is the expense management piece.\nWe already have the travel piece with our travel service. And so what we're doing is we're constantly building out the offerings that we have for our small businesses. How that affects organic spend, we'll have to see. But I think what it does, it'll certainly help from a retention perspective and an acquisition perspective as well. I think from an organic perspective, the more we can utilize 1AP and Nipendo, the more we can get more B2B payments in there through that channel. But we're on a journey. And now it all needs to continue to be knitted together. Obviously, Center is not integrated into the Kabbage solution to the Kabbage platform. But ultimately, what you will do is you'll have one ecosystem where all of these things live. And I think that will help drive more retention, more acquisition, and potentially more organic spending.\nI mean, organic spending traditionally is more of how they're running their businesses. And we saw pre-COVID or just during COVID how all that organic spend went down. And then we saw post-COVID how it went up as they stocked up on inventory. So we'll have to see how that plays out. But we're excited about Center. And we're excited about the suite of capabilities that we've built out from an SME perspective now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Terry Ma of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Thank you. Good morning. Maybe to just follow up on your comments around the refresh strategy. You called out about 35 to 50 planned product refreshes for this year, last quarter. I get that you want to invest in the long term, and you don't want to stop the refresh strategy. But just given that there's so much macro uncertainty and maybe potential uncertainty around the ROI of those refreshes, do you kind of adjust or delay some of those until there's more clarity? And what does that mean for your marketing budget for the year? Thank you.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So at the moment, no changes to the marketing budget at all. I don't think the refresh itself, when you're looking at the refresh, I think that, as I said before, we haven't stopped refreshes in the face of even the pandemic. I mean, we were working through our Platinum refresh and Green at that particular point in time, and also working on others behind the scenes because, as I've said before, refreshes don't happen overnight. Years ago, we got a lot of credit for reacting to the Chase Sapphire, but it's something that we started nine to 10 months ago. So no, we're not going to stop the refresh strategy. I don't think that from an ROI perspective, there would be, as I would say, a reason to do that.\nAs we go to acquire cards, we look at where the credit box is at that particular point in time. So we'll see. But that's. These refreshes happen over a period of time. So it's hard to stop them once they're in progress. And I think we have a lot of confidence once they're done to put them out into the marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Gus Gala of MCH. Please go ahead.\n\nGus Galá\n\nAnalyst, Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.\n\nHey. Good morning, Steve. Good morning, Chris. I wanted to ask about restaurants. It seems like a lot of the work done there has been key in winning Gen Z Millennial share versus other premium value props available in North America. How do you think about enhancing the value proposition there? And in a similar vein, can you talk about other categories where maybe your experiential differentiation, where you're not really competing on the rewards, but more like the services, could further help capture that Gen Z Millennial base? Thanks.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, millennials and Gen Z are spending way more in restaurants from a transaction perspective than any other cohort that we have. And if you just look at the refresh strategy, look at what we did with gold. I mean, gold could have been renamed the restaurant card between the rewards accelerator, the Resy credit, and the Global Dining Collection. I think, look, you go back to the acquisition of Resy, you go back to the acquisition of Tock, you look at Rooam. All three of those things are really targeted at sort of trying to build a moat around the restaurant industry, not only from a Card Member perspective, but also from a restaurant perspective. I mean, it is a microcosm of our closed loop, right?\nWhen you think about what we've done with Resy and Tock, and then as we integrate the Rooam capabilities in, it's a closed loop within a closed loop. And I think that's something that's really appealing to our restaurant customers. And it's also appealing to our card members, and especially millennials and Gen Z. Look, we'll look for other verticals where that makes sense. Look, one would argue that the other verticals where it does make sense with our travel business is also with lodging and with airline, right? I mean, if you think about it, look at the Platinum Card and being able to book through Platinum Travel Services. It's another example of a closed loop within. And when you look at the Platinum Card value proposition with Fine Hotels + Resorts, it is really a way to provide value, especially to our younger customers.\nI mean, when you book a Fine Hotels + Resorts, the value proposition there is pretty good, right? I mean, it's early check-in, late checkout, upgrades, free breakfast, $100 credit. So that's another example of where we're connecting our Card Members with our partners from a hotel perspective. And obviously, we've been doing that with airlines for years. So I think when you think about Millennials and Gen Z, I think leaning in in those areas for them are pretty critical. And the Gold Card relaunch is a really good example. And our partnership with Dunkin' was a really good example of really leaning in to the transaction affection that they have for dining and for all things that are dining.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Rob Wildhack of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRob Wildhack\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nMorning, guys. I wanted to follow up a little bit more on the SMB technology side with Kabbage, Center, etc. Steve, I think you mentioned eventually having one ecosystem. Could you speak to the integration effort there, how all these platforms come together, how that looks for the end customer today? And then when do you expect you can go to market with the full expanded product suite inclusive of Center? Thanks.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, we just closed on Center yesterday. So it'll happen over time here. But if you look at, if you're an SME customer and you go onto the Kabbage platform, you can reach MyCA, which is if you're a cardholder, and a lot of our cardholders just do business right now with us through the app anyway. But pre-app, it was through my card account. And so as you go through Kabbage, you can access my card account. You can apply for the loan. You can access your transaction checking account. So that's pretty much there at this point. What the next step is to really then, as we integrate Center on in, is to link that right in. I don't have an exact time on that. As a bank holding company, there is certain hardening that we need to do, let's say, that around the Center project, product.\nAnd so we're going to do that. But part of all of that will be integrating it on into that platform. But again, just to remind everybody, we closed on it yesterday.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question today is coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Steve and Christophe, you're not striking a pretty confident tone on the call today about the outlook in a variety of macro environments. I think you've also talked before about being more confident in achieving the mid-teens EPS versus maybe some noise in year-over-year revenue. I just wanted to go back to where we started the Q&A, where Sanjay started the Q&A. Can you just talk a little bit more about the cost structure and the potential for cost optimization if things get choppy? I understand there's rewards, costs, and things like that that naturally get lower. Big picture, just talk a little bit about the expense flex in the model as you continue to invest. Thanks.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. I mean, here's what you can expect. I mean, obviously, you've got the story as it relates to rewards and as it relates to sort of cost of Card Member services. As spending goes down, those go down. From a technology perspective, we're not going to veer off our technology plan. I mean, it just doesn't make any sense to stop and start from a technology perspective. Our marketing budget is a lot bigger than it ever has been. And in an environment of uncertainty, you would raise the thresholds. You may not have as much line of sight into the credit box as you'd like to have. And so there's a tremendous amount of expense flexibility within that line, and there's expense flexibility within our OpEx line as well.\nBut what we will not do, as I said earlier, and I started this way, we're not going to just cut expenses to make the EPS number if we see good opportunities for growth. One of the things that we did during COVID was we really ratcheted back on acquisition tremendously because we didn't have good line of sight into creditworthy cardholders. But what we did do is we pivoted a large percentage of that money and added incremental value to our value propositions at that particular point in time, which the end result of that was twofold. Number one, it led to higher retention for us, and it led to more stickiness in terms of where we actually made those value proposition investments. So we'll play the whole thing out.\nBut again, quarter to quarter, year to year, it's about really investing for the long term here and making the right longer-term decisions. But there is flex in the model as it relates to marketing and as it relates to OpEx.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nSVP and Head of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nWith that, we will bring the call to an end.

Please go ahead.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations and SVP, American Express\n\nThank you, Daryl, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Stephen Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results.\nAnd then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Stephen and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Stephen.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nThank you, Kartik. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. 2024 was another strong year for American Express. We delivered record revenues of $66 billion for the year, up 10% on an FX-adjusted basis, achieving our long-term aspiration. We had record net income of $10 billion, with earnings per share of $14.01, up 25% for the year, which is higher than our long-term aspiration. The great work of our colleagues around the world drove 2024 results that were strong across our key metrics, setting new records in many categories. In addition to record revenues and net income, we had record levels of annual card member spending, record net card fees, and a record 13 million new card acquisitions. We also saw continued high card member retention, best-in-class credit performance, and disciplined expense management.\nNotably, we exited the year with increased momentum as Q4 billings growth accelerated to 8% overall, driven by robust holiday spend. We continue to enrich our membership model, refreshing over 40 products globally in 2024, including the US Consumer Gold Card, which is particularly appealing to millennial and Gen Z consumers, as well as refreshing our Delta Co-Brand cards. We also enhanced our dining portfolio with the acquisitions of Tock and Rooam, and we launched several new top-tier sponsorships and experiences, such as our multi-year global partnership with Formula 1. Our US small and medium-sized enterprise customer base continued to grow, with strong new card acquisitions throughout the year. We saw an improvement in small business sentiment in the Q4, which linked to stronger organic spending by our small business customers through the holiday season.\nA key driver of our growth is the ongoing global expansion of our merchant network. We added millions of new merchant locations globally in 2024, and we reached an average of 80% coverage across our top 12 international countries, with coverage in travel and entertainment categories well above 80%. That's an increase of 8 percentage points from three years ago. These results clearly show that our strategy of backing our customers by investing in our value propositions, coverage, marketing, technology, and talent is working. As we look ahead to 2025, American Express will be celebrating a major milestone: our 175th year in business. Our company's history is one of innovation and growth.\nFrom our start in 1850 as a freight delivery company operated with horses, wagons, and trains to becoming a global travel services company in the early 20th century, pivoting into a card-focused payments company by the 1960s, and ultimately evolving into the global premium financial and lifestyle company powered by technology we are today. Our longevity has been fueled by talented colleagues who have delivered a steady stream of innovative products and services that are focused on serving premium consumers and businesses of all sizes, and who have stayed true to our brand that has been built on trust, security, and service since our earliest days. As I've discussed over the past several years, we've continued the cycle of customer-focused innovation, which has been largely responsible for resetting the growth trajectory of the company. We believe our growth is sustainable.\nWe're confident that we will continue to bring in large numbers of new premium customers, especially millennial and Gen Z consumers, and small businesses, while also maintaining high growth across our international business. In looking at the external marketplace, we continue to see strategic opportunities to sustain our growth. For example, in the US, fee-based consumer premium cards are the fastest-growing part of the industry, and we have about 25% of those cards, indicating a continued upside opportunity. Across the industry, the number of millennials and Gen Z consumers with premium products is growing at an even faster rate, and we're adding highly creditworthy customers in these cohorts faster than the industry, with substantial room to continue this growth.\nIt's clear that our premium products are resonating well with these age groups, whose spending needs will continue to expand as they move forward in their lives and careers, with many likely to also start new small businesses in the coming years. In SME, we see continued growth opportunities in the US, where we expect to continue adding new small business customers and expanding our offerings to meet more of their needs beyond the card, such as lending, checking, and cash flow management. When we look at international, which is our fastest-growing segment, we are underpenetrated in both consumer and SME. We have an average of 6% spend share across our top five countries, which represent almost 1/3 of the revenues outside the US. International SME, in particular, is growing off a small base.\nAnd with the differentiated products and capabilities we offer, we have an opportunity to continue our rapid growth in this part of our business. The long runway for growth we see both in international consumer and SME, coupled with the opportunities we have to continue expanding our merchant coverage across the globe, gives us confidence that we can sustain our growth trajectory outside the US. So, as we look at this year and beyond, we're going to continue with our strategy of investing at high levels in innovative value propositions, marketing, and technology to drive growth. This includes our ongoing focus on our product refresh strategy. Currently, we're refreshing between 35 and 50 products a year, and we're planning to maintain that pace in 2025, along with other enhancements to our membership model for both our consumer and commercial customers.\nTurning to guidance for the year, we expect 2025 revenue growth of 8% to 10% and EPS of $15 to $15.50, or a 12% to 16% increase over 2024, adjusted for the Accertify gain. Regarding our thinking in establishing this year's guidance, as we've said, card member spending is the largest component of our total revenues. In putting our plan together, our assumption had been that steady billings growth we saw through most of 2024 would continue in 2025, but the fourth-quarter spend numbers were stronger than we expected. While it's too soon to tell how this year will play out, we're encouraged by that increased momentum we saw exiting 2024. For now, we're assuming 2025 billings growth will be similar to full-year 2024 number.\nHowever, if spend growth continues at the elevated Q4 level throughout this year, we would expect to come in at the higher end of our revenue range, all else being equal. I'll now turn it over to Christophe for additional commentary about our results and our 2025 guidance.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThank you, Stephen, and good morning, everyone. Given we are at the year-end, I will discuss both our Q4 and full-year results. Starting first with our full-year performance, 2024 was a strong year with 10% revenue growth on an FX-adjusted basis and EPS of $14.01, up 25%. We continue to deliver superior returns driven by our spend-and-fee-led model as we ended the year with an ROE of 35%. Notably, we also returned $7.9 billion of capital to shareholders this year, which included the certified gain. We saw a stable spending environment for most of 2024, with an acceleration in spending as we exited the year. We continued to see healthy loan growth, and we achieved record net card fees. We achieved these results while maintaining our best-in-class credit performance, investing at high levels for growth, as well as driving significant operating leverage.\nIn sum, the building blocks of our financial model are performing well and drive our confidence in the year ahead. Now, taking a closer look at total billings business performance on slide three, robust spending during the holiday period by our premium customer base helped generate 8% FX-adjusted growth year over year in Q4, an uptick from the 6% range we saw for the past few quarters. The increase in growth was broad-based across both T&E and goods and services categories, across geographies, and across every customer segment, as we'll see in a moment. In addition, transaction growth also accelerated to 10% in the quarter, reflecting greater engagement from our card members. I'll highlight a few key points as we look at spend trends across our businesses over the next few slides. US\nConsumer spend was up 9% year over year in the quarter, as strong holiday spend drove momentum versus Q3. Growth accelerated in both GNS and T&E categories, with performance a bit more concentrated in this strong holiday shopping period compared to the rest of the quarter. Looking across generations, millennial and Gen Z spend continues to grow faster than the other age cohorts, up 16% in Q4 versus last year. Notably, all generations saw an uptick in spend this quarter compared to Q3. Commercial services spend was up 4% versus last year for the quarter, with US SME growing 3%, a bit of an uptick from the past few quarters, as organic spend growth improved a bit sequentially. We also saw an increase in spending from our large and global client base, with improvement in T&E spend across client industries, as well as improvement in goods and services spend.\nLastly, international grew 15% in Q4 versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis, as we continue to make strides in our international business. This rapid growth was visible across spend categories and across our consumer and commercial businesses, with each of our top five markets growing in mid to high teens. As you can see, Q4 spend results were strong across our businesses, and we feel good about the spend acceleration we saw. While growth in Q1 will be impacted by the extra day from leap year in 2024, so far, the first three weeks of January look more in line with Q4 trends. At the same time, we need to see if the momentum will sustain. So, as we think about 2025, we are assuming at this point a similar spend environment to what we saw in 2024 on a full-year basis.\nMoving on to loans on slide seven, Q4 total loans and card member receivables grew at 9% on an FX-adjusted basis versus last year. As a reminder, these growth rates moderated over the course of the year, as expected, as we left the period when customers were still building back revolving balances coming out of the pandemic. With that process largely behind us, for 2025, we expect loans and receivables growth to continue to grow a bit faster than spend, and we continue to meet more of the borrowing needs of our premium customers. Turning to slides eight and nine, our credit performance continues to be excellent. Delinquency rates and write-off rates are stable versus last quarter and are still below levels from five years ago. Total provision expense was down from a year ago as we built fewer reserves.\nThese results are an outcome of our premium strategy that attracts high-credit quality customers. Combined with our risk management capabilities, this strategy has widened the margin of safety and ensured profitable growth. We continue to expect some modest upward bias to write-off and reserve rates over time as we continue to acquire new customers at elevated levels and increase our share of lending from existing customers. Turning next to revenue starting on slide 10, we saw another strong year of revenue growth, with revenues up 10% on an FX-adjusted basis for both Q4 and the full year. Discount revenue grew 8% FX-adjusted in Q4, in line with billings growth.\nOur cycle of product refreshes helped drive card fee growth to 19% FX-adjusted in the quarter and fueled new card acquisition to a record level of 13 million for the new year, for the year, with around 70% of new accounts acquired on fee-paying products. We expect card fee growth in 2025 to continue to grow in the mid to high teens, but to moderate as we progress through the year. Turning to slide 13, Q4 NII was up 13% on an FX-adjusted basis. Growth was driven by increases in revolving loan balances and net yield versus the prior year. As expected, growth moderated this quarter as it has over the course of the year. An important long-term driver of yield is our ability to improve our funding mix as a result of our growing deposits program. Our high-yield savings account balances grew 17% in 2024.\nAs with our premium cards, we see that our high-end product is resonating with younger customers. Millennial and Gen Z customers make up over 1/2 of the accounts and about 1/3 of the total balances today. As we think about 2025, we expect NII growth to outpace the growth in total loans and receivables, supported by growth in revolving balances. While there is uncertainty in the rate outlook, as a reminder, we are mildly liability-sensitive, with a relatively small impact from changes to the Fed funds rate. I'll turn next to expenses on slide 15. In Q4, the VCE to revenue ratio was 43%. Rewards expense, in particular, grew 15% in the fourth quarter, largely driven by the slow growth in rewards expense in the prior year.\nIn addition, as we mentioned last quarter, we made some small changes to the program that are good for both customers and the overall economics of the program, but drive a very small increase in the URR in the short term. Stepping back, we expect overall VCE expenses to grow slightly faster than revenues in 2025 as we continue to invest in our products and drive card member engagement, and as our portfolio continues to become more premium. We expect rewards growth to remain a bit elevated in Q1 as a result of the URR model changes from a year ago, before growing more in line with the historical trend. We ended the year with $6 billion in marketing expenses, up 16% for the full year, as we invested at elevated levels based on the attractive growth opportunities we saw.\nGiven the significant increase of the investment pool in 2024, we expect a modest increase in marketing expense for 2025. Finally, operating expenses for the quarter were down 1% versus last year at $4.2 billion. On a full-year basis, operating expenses of $14.6 billion were down 2%. Excluding the gain on sale of the certified business in Q2, operating expenses were up 1% for the full year. In 2025, we expect operating expenses to grow in low single digits versus 2024 levels, adjusted for the certified gain. This continues our strong record, track record of disciplined expense management as we maintain the low levels of growth from last year while still investing in key areas such as technology. Let me move now to capital on slide 16. Our Q4 CET1 ratio was 10.5% and continues to be within our 10% to 11% range.\nWe returned $7.9 billion of capital to our shareholders for the year, including $2 billion of dividends and $5.9 billion of share repurchases. In 2025, we also expect to increase our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.82 per share, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings and our 20 to 25% target payout ratio. With this plan increase, we expect to more than double the dividends since the beginning of 2019. We have also reduced the share count by 17%, demonstrating our confidence in the sustainability of earnings of our differentiated model. This brings me to our 2025 guidance. We continue to run our business with an aspiration to achieve 10% plus revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth. As Steve noted, for the full year 2025, we expect revenue growth between 8% to 10% and earnings per share between $15 and $15.50.\nThe EPS range reflects 12% to 16% growth year over year, adjusted for the certified gain in 2024. I'll note that the revenue guidance reflects a balance between the spend environment we saw for the most of the year and the acceleration in spend growth we saw in Q4. If the spend momentum we saw in Q4 were to continue, we would expect revenue growth to be closer to the high end of the range, all else equal. Our guidance also factors in a range of scenarios based on what we are seeing in our business today. It assumes a stable economy and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. At the same time, there is uncertainty in the environment, whether in tax policy, interest rates, or currency movements. Our outlook is based on the FX rates as they are today.\nAs a global company, the strengthening of the US dollar is a headwind to our growth. In closing, as you heard, 2024 was a strong year for the company. We are well positioned to continue our track record of strong growth into 2025, and we feel good about the year ahead. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Kartik, and we will take your questions.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations and SVP, American Express\n\nThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation, and with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press Star, then 1 on your touch-tone phone. You'll hear a tone indicating that you've been placed in queue.\nYou may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star, then 2. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRyan Nash [Equity Research [Goldman Sachs)\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nMorning, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash [Equity Research [Goldman Sachs)\n\nI didn't want to disappoint you, Steve, so I'm going to ask about revenue growth. So you gave a lot of different comments, obviously, 8 to 10. You're exiting at 10. You highlighted that billings started the year at an elevated level, similar to the fourth quarter. So, Steve, maybe just talk a little bit about what could be the potential headwinds to revenue growth that would put you towards the lower end. And I guess, given GDP is strong, you've acquired a ton of cards in 2024.\nWhy is 2025 not in line with sort of the aspirational revenue growth, given it feels like this is sort of the right kind of environment where we could see that type of top-line growth? Thank you.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So I would say that it is in line. I mean, we give a range, and that range has our top end. The 10% at the top end is in line with our long-term aspiration. Just like this year, we did hit our long-term aspiration, not only for the quarter, but for the year on a full-year basis. So what would cause you to go sort of below, middle, or at? I think what you have to look at last year is a lot of our consumer customers were building balances.\nAnd so you had some pretty strong NII growth, and that sort of moderated a little bit as we got into the year. So if you look at it, it really does come down to a billing story for 2025. And I think the way that we've guided it is absolutely right. We've guided that if, in fact, billings are like they were in the fourth quarter, you will see us at the top end of the revenue range. And as Christophe said, and I said, all else being equal, you don't have any sort of surprises. And as we've said at your conference, just giving you another plug for your conference, it really becomes billings. And I think if billings continue at where they were in the fourth quarter, then I think what you will see is us at the top end of that revenue range.\nIf you see them where they were for the whole year, you can assume we'll be in the middle. And I don't think this will happen, but this is why you give ranges. If they were below last year, you would be at the lower end. So I think it really truly is a billing story. I think we're very confident with card fees. I mean, we've had 26 consecutive quarters of double-digit card fees. We expect that to continue more to the mid-teens to the lower high teens. And NII will continue, albeit at a little bit of a lower growth rate than you saw in the first two quarters of last year. So I think the guide is truly in line with what we said. I mean, last year, we went 9 to 11, and we came in at 10, and we said it was about billings.\nWe got billings in the fourth quarter, which pushed us over the line. So we're just providing guidance that incorporates all those scenarios.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakrani with KBW. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you. Good morning. Maybe just, well, thank you, Steve, for getting in front of that question on the revenue guide. I guess just a follow-up. If we were to think about where the acceleration came from in spending, I know, Christophe, you kind of mentioned it was balanced, but maybe can we get a little bit more deeper into that so that we can figure out how much could sustain itself over the course of the year? And then so is it more discretionary versus travel type?\nThen if we think about the upside to the revenues, I mean, do you think that there would be an upside to the EPS range, or that's pretty static?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nSo let me deal with the EPS range. I mean, one of the things that we've done over the years is if we've had opportunities to invest, we've invested. Now just take a look at this year. This year, we provided our guidance at the beginning of the year. It was obviously lower than what we ended the year with. And our expectation was that we were going to reinvest the Accertify gain, but we wound up using that to buy shares back. And we increased our marketing by $800 million. So we want to keep the flexibility if we have good investment options to invest back in the business.\nHaving said that, if, in fact, we had a year like we had this year, where not only do we have good investment options, but we could also exceed EPS, we would do that. So I think, well, as you start to get to the high end of that revenue range, what winds up happening is management has to make a decision. Do we reinvest in the business? Do we drop some more of that back to shareholders? And that'll be a decision that we will make on an ongoing basis as we see what the opportunities would be, whether those would be opportunities in technology, whether those would be opportunities in marketing, more value proposition, and so forth. So we want to leave ourselves that flexibility to be able to make those investments. But having said that, there is a top end that ranges 15/50.\nIt is at 16% growth. That is more likely to happen if you have higher revenue growth, again, with the commentary that I made, that we could make a decision that we want to invest that back in. So it's plausible that that, in fact, would happen. As far as billings go for the quarter, and I'll let Christophe comment a little bit more, I think what you saw across the board, you saw consumer come up. It was 9%, which was two points above where we had been running. We saw more organic spend lift in SME, which made SME from 1 to 3. That's still not where we want to be from an SME perspective. International continues to perform very, very well, both from an SME perspective and from a consumer perspective, also picking up two points.\nTravel was higher this particular quarter, and particularly airline. Airline doubled sequentially quarter over quarter of 13%. The more surprising number, I think, was front of the cabin of 19%. And restaurant continues to be strong. So T&E was very, very strong in the quarter for us. And Christophe, I don't know if you want to add anything else.\nI don't have a lot because you covered most of it. The only thing I will say is that the holiday shopping season was especially strong for us. And you asked the question about the sustainability, and that's the key word, right? And the team here is looking at whether it's going to expand into 2025. That's the key question. And that's really hard to answer this in a definitive way.\nAs I said in my remarks, the first three weeks of January very much looked like in line with what we saw in Q4, but there's like 49 more weeks to come, and we don't know how it's going to play. So more to come on this, but what we saw so far looks very strong.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erica Najarian with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nErica Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi. Good morning. Just wanted to continue to unpack the billing story for 2025. When I look at the proprietary net cards acquired, it looked like it slowed down a bit in the fourth quarter after being up double digits in the second and third quarter, of course, up 6.5% year over year.\nAs we think about what's going to drive the billing strength in 2025, particularly in light of, Christophe, your comment about modest increase in marketing expenses, should we think about what is the split between an increase in new cards acquired versus that 6.5% versus better spend per account? We noticed, of course, that spend per account was up a little bit in Q4, up 3% versus 2% for the year.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So there's a lot in your question, Erica. Let me try to address most of the points. The first thing is that it's very hard to read a lot in the quarterly distribution of NCA. And there is definitely not a good alignment between the marketing spend in the quarter and the NCA in the quarter. There is a time difference between the two because of the accounting around how we account for the welcome incentives.\nThe point here is that we invested a lot in 2024, and we got a lot of cards, 13 million cards, which is a record for the company. As you think about how this is going to play out and the math we're doing about the 2025 spend, as you know, the way we think about billing growth is we split it between what's coming from these recently acquired card members, what's coming from organic, which are the growth coming from the 10-year card members, and the last piece of the puzzle is attrition. The expectation that we have for 2025 around attrition is consistent with what we've seen over the last, I would almost say, the last four or five years, is that it's going to be very stable, very low. There's not a lot of attrition going on here in terms of the billing growth.\nThe contribution coming from organic is the one that is the hardest to predict. That's the source of the softness we saw in Q4. That's what is the positive performance that we saw sorry, the softness we saw in 2024. That's the organic that was stronger in Q4. It's hard to say how that organic is going to perform in 2025, but it's the source of the volatility for sure. We provided some of the details in the past, but I would say a good 7% of the billing growth comes from these new customers, and the balance is typically the organic spend and the attrition.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark DeVries\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. As we've been discussing, you're seeing accelerating billing business growth into year-end.\nWe're also getting consumer and business confidence. It's really been climbing. So, Steve, I was hoping to hear about what you may have learned, both from any conversations you've had with customers recently about kind of their optimism on spend, and also just looking at your historical billing business numbers and how that has historically kind of responded to rising confidence.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, look, I think we saw rising confidence in Q4. Certainly, you saw it from a consumer perspective, 9%. And I think, as I'll just go back and comment on travel. I mean, travel traditionally for us, especially airline in Q4, is not a big number, but it doubled sequentially and front of the cabin.\nI think front of the cabin is a really good indicator of consumer confidence because what you do is when people don't have confidence, they may not cancel a trip, but they may downgrade the hotel, downgrade the airline, the class of service, and so forth. So I think we're seeing more consumer confidence. We've done a survey of small businesses, and the sentiment is really, really good. And it's higher than it's been in a long time. And I think we saw that come up from an organic growth perspective. International has just been strong. International has been a strong story for us since two years after COVID. It has just been; it's been marching on. So I think that that's what gives us hope for the year, that this will continue. But again, hope is not a plan.\nAnd so we do our plan based upon what we saw at the time of the plan. And as we look at the first couple of months in the first quarter, we'll see where we are. And provided that we have this continued growth, we would expect, again, to be at the high end of the range from a revenue perspective. The only thing that I will throw out there from a timing perspective is that we will have one less day in this first quarter due to leap year. So we'll manage that. But we like to look at things on a days-mix-adjusted basis anyway. And so we'll be able to see through that and determine what that will mean for the second quarter. So I think there's more to come. But I think the basic story here is there is consumer confidence at this point.\nThere is small business confidence. We just don't want one quarter to color what a whole year is going to be. We'd like to see that be repetitive before we do anything with it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nYeah. Good morning and thanks. Wanted to I had two questions. The first on SME. We've seen very strong growth from some of your competitors, some newer competitors like RAMP. And was wondering how you feel about your customer-facing tech in SME and whether that might be an area of potential acquisition in the future. And second, Delta had very strong commentary about the co-brand card growth and their expectation for 2025, that that growth will be at least as good.\nSo I wanted to ask you how that lines up with your thought process on the travel space and how the Delta book's been comping versus the rest of the book. Thanks.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. I think, well, remember, look, we align very closely with Ed and his team. And so we're aligned with that. But also remember that the Delta book is not just what's spent on Delta. It is spent what Delta card members, American Express card members, spend on everything else. And so, look, I think the remuneration that we provide Delta, we would expect that to continue to increase. We're happy to see that increase because that means spending is increasing, and we're getting our piece of the pie. We're getting our piece of the pie as well. So I think it bodes well for travel.\nI think that we saw that in the fourth quarter, and we hope that that continues. I know in my conversations with Ed, he feels very confident about this year. I think that's how he spoke about it during his earnings call. As far as SME tech, look, we constantly look at ways to improve the customer experience. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on acquisitions or things like that. We feel good about where we are and the progress that we're making, especially with our Kabbage acquisition and so forth. Yes, we keep our eye on Ramp, Brex, and everybody else that's out there. They are working from a smaller base, but they have good products, and they're making some inroads. We will make sure that we are responsive to that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning. Steve, it looks like the Capital One Discover merger is going to go through. Any thoughts on the competitive impact? I know they don't have incremental affluent consumers, but it's more scale, ability to build lounges, and they do compete in SME.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. Look, I think Rich is a really smart CEO, and I think it's a really good deal for them. It picks up a debit network and picks up a lot more scale, and I think he becomes the largest credit card lender in the United States with that. Discover is a multifaceted company, not only with debit and credit cards, but with a bunch of loans and what have you, from car, student, and so forth.\nSo I think it fits very nicely in with their strategy. Capital One with Venture X is making inroads within the premium space. I think we continue, though, to more than hold our own. And look, they're a formidable competitor, but I think also they'll have their hands full with integrating Discover over the next couple of years. And we will continue to evolve our products with our product refreshes. And we look forward to competing with them.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nThanks for taking my question. Hey, Steve, one of the key initiatives of your team and your tenure is the increased focus on experiences and incentive versus reward. The impact on account growth has been significant, well understood.\nIs it fair to say that the other benefit besides growth is that there's higher operating leverage because there's more fixed costs associated with experience than there is with traditional rewards?\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. I mean, it's a good point. I think that you're absolutely right. I mean, you do have more fixed costs when you're doing sort of experiential sponsorships. You have more fixed costs when you're doing lounges and things like that than you do when you're on a variable rewards basis. The trick is with that piece of it, though, is that as you continue to grow, it's just like technology, right? You have X amount of mainframe capacity or servers or what have you. And then as you get big, you need to add a little bit more. But then you grow into that scale. And so I think that's what you're seeing.\nAnd as we expand some of our lounges, we'll be making some more investments, not only in new lounges, but we'll be expanding some of the existing lounges as well. But I think that's part of the calculus for us, is that our card members, while they like the rewards, they also like all the experience and the access that we put around it. And so by making sure that we're balancing our investments in these areas, we're able to give people the best of both worlds. And that's what we strive to do. And it also enables us, again, to lever a little bit more fixed costs across a wider base.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nSteve, I was wondering if you could shed a little bit more light into the planned product refresh strategy for this year, where you might go with that. I know you previously talked about refreshing every three to four years, and Platinum, US Platinum, is one that's sort of been sitting out there since 2021. And Christophe, I was wondering if you could maybe shed a little bit more light into your credit commentary. The credit's been doing pretty well. It seems like it's outperformed what you've been looking for, stable this year. You talk about why you might be expecting a little bit of a modest increase from here. Is that conservatism on your part, or do you think you could actually see a better result than that?\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So I'll disappoint you with the first answer. But so look, we're going to do between 35 and 50.\nI'm not going to comment on which ones and pre-announce. I think that we'll let you speculate on what's going to happen. But yeah, we look to refresh products on an ongoing basis and also when we feel the need that those products need refreshed. And so you'll just have to wait and see what we come out with. But we have 11 more months to go.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nGood morning, Jeff. On the credit metrics, the first thing that I'm going to say is that we are still materially below where we were pre-COVID, unlike, I think, most of our competitors. So that tells you something about the performance from a credit standpoint. It says as well that all the growth that we generated over the last few years was very much focused in the premium space. So I like that.\nSo the comment on the outward buyers, I made a similar comment at the beginning of last year, and it turned out that the credit metrics were actually fairly stable, especially towards the later part of the year. I still believe that those metrics should trend up a little bit while remaining best in class. They're going to trend up because we're acquiring a lot of customers, and there's going to be some seasoning happening for those vintages. And the performance, those metrics are so low, so good that to some extent, they can only go up a little bit from here. But these, we're very comfortable with the performance on the credit side. The premiumness of the strategy is just working and translating really well in the credit performance. We're issuing premium products, and that attracts a lot of very low credit risk customers.\nSo where we are, it's just like a very good position. I hope that by the time we get to the end of the year, we're looking at these rates, and I can say I was wrong and the credit was stable. But I think in the long run, the trend is that you should expect those metrics to trend up a little bit, very modest, but a little bit.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kennedy with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\n\nChris Kennedy\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Marketing investment has increased a lot in recent years. Can you just talk about how the allocations have evolved between the different buckets, such as customer acquisition, general brand marketing, and sponsorship activity? Thank you.\nGeneral brand sponsorship has been fairly stable over the past years.\nThe lion's share of the growth that you saw in marketing, so say over the last 12 months, the $800 million between last year and this year, the lion's share of that is going into acquisition. We split it between what we call consumer acquisition versus prospect acquisition. Consumer acquisition, customer acquisition, sorry, refers to upgrading and companion cards. These are very attractive investments. We try to find the right balance between investing in deepening the relationship with our current customers and prospect acquisition. I don't have the split between the two, but we typically try to fund first that customer acquisition, which is the most attractive in terms of return. We look at the opportunities that exist in the market, and we maintain our very strict standards in terms of underwriting and returns and try to maximize that.\nSo we have a, as you know, sophisticated process to optimize those marketing dollars. But at a very high level, I think that's the story.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nMana,ging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Most of my questions have already been asked and answered. But maybe could you drill down a little more on the SME business? You saw a little bit of acceleration in the fourth quarter. Any thoughts either about the trends and momentum there more specifically or plans? I know, Steve, you said you didn't really want to talk about plans for refresh. But are there things that we should be looking for in 2025?\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, I think mostly what I would say about SME, which is we still continue to acquire the same amount of SME customers that we've been acquiring, and our attrition is the same. It really continues to be an organic story. Organic spending has still not come back to the levels that we saw sort of pre-COVID. So if you look at what's happened from an SME perspective during COVID, organic spending went all the way down. Coming out of COVID, it really started to ratchet up. Then it sort of normalized a little bit. Then you had inflation, higher interest rates, and so forth. So I think we started to see the deceleration of organic spending stop and start to turn around.\nWhat I think the story will be with SME is if we can get that back to a 3% organic lift, you will see that you will see SME then be more of a contributor to overall billings than it is right now. So it truly is an organic story. And as I said, as you pointed out, I'm not going to talk about refreshes, but I think it really comes down to small business confidence. And it's not an acquisition story. It's not an attrition story. It truly is still an organic story for us. And I think the industry is still seeing that as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBrian Foran\n\nStock Analyst, Truist Securities\n\nHey, good morning. I hate to use my question on FX, but is the 8 to 10 FX-adjusted guide or GAAP?\nBecause I think you mentioned you assume the dollar stays here. And then can you remind us the EPS impact? I know there's some expense and hedging. So is there any appreciable EPS drag we should think about embedded in the $15 to 15.50 range?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So thank you for your question, Brian. The first thing that I'm going to say on this is that we talk about FX adjusted and FX reported because we think it is useful to you and to us to think about the momentum that we see, say, from a revenue, from a billing standpoint, stable currency, like once we control for currency movements, because that reflects the true momentum in terms of transaction and either no FX noise. So for that reason, we speak about it in FX adjusted terms.\nAs we think about forecast and predictions, it's impossible for us to predict where we're going to be from an FX standpoint. So we cannot talk about it in terms of FX reported at year-end because we don't know which way the dollar is going to go. And therefore, we're not trying to. The way to think about the impact of these currency movements, you saw it in Q4, right? Here we have actual movements. The difference from a revenue growth standpoint was one percentage point, right? FX adjusted revenue growth was 10%. FX reported, GAAP reported was 9%. So the impact is material, is one percentage point of revenue growth. In terms of EPS impact, it's a far more complicated story because we have expenses spread out across the world. We have centers of excellence. So it's really a complicated one.\nI'm going to refer you. I think it's in the K or in the Q where we have sensitivity. It goes something like this. You can check the numbers precisely, but a 10% increase in the dollar or 1% increase, or a 10% increase in the dollar translated into $136 million negative impact on PTI. That's the kind of sensitivity. So it's not hugely impactful, but it is a little bit impactful still.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe we can double-click a little bit on the international businesses you talked about. I think you said each of your top five markets, you grew mid to high teen, the mid-high teen range.\nCan you just comment on what some of the drivers are, what kind of momentum you're seeing in terms of merchant acceptance, how the sales changes you made a couple of years ago are impacting it? And I guess I'm just trying to get at how you feel about the trajectory and the sustainability of that kind of growth.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, we feel really good about the trajectory and the sustainability. Merchant acceptance in international continues to grow. I mean, we acquired millions of merchants. And a comment that I made is we're at 80% LIF coverage in the key markets. And from a T&E perspective, we're over 80%. You saw that go up by eight points over the last three years. So merchant acceptance internationally continues to grow very, very rapidly for us. As far as overall growth, we invest quite a bit in card acquisition in international.\nOur opportunities in international for card acquisition are still really, really good. A lot of that growth comes from new cards for us. So we think with less than 6% market share in the top five markets and in an SME environment, which is really nascent at this point, we think there's still big opportunities in SME, and in consumer for us. Our expectation is that double-digit billings will continue into the foreseeable future. Remember, pre-COVID, that's what we saw. International was the fastest-growing part of our business because we added merchant locations, and we added more cards. During COVID, international, if you recall, was almost more than a two-year stoppage, but it's right back to where it was pre-COVID. We continue to feel that that's going to continue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question comes from the line of Terry Ma with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to ask about net card fee growth. I think you guided to mid to high teens growth in 2025 with some moderation. So maybe just unpack that a bit. You've historically had more of a runway to accelerate that kind of growth when you've done major refreshes. I'm just curious why that would actually moderate this year.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express",
    "content2": "I mean, the first thing is that these growth rates have been very strong for a very long period of time. As a matter of fact, this quarter marks the 26th consecutive quarter where we've seen card fee growth in double digits. And it's like when I say double digits, I think the CAGR is like 13% over this period of time, right? Something of that magnitude.\nSo very strong growth. At the beginning of the year, we started the year at like 16%, and we said we should expect to exit the year with an acceleration, which is exactly what happened, right? We were at 18% last quarter, 19% in Q3, 19% in Q4. So very strong growth, which is always a complicated picture. There's always a lot of moving parts here. So it's not easy to simplify too much. But the big driver of that acceleration was actually the cycle of product refreshes. And we can see it in our models. And therefore, as you think about 2025, that acceleration that we saw in Q3, Q4 is still going to play out in Q1, 2025, and afterwards. It should trend a little bit more like what you saw at the beginning of 2024, which is this mid-teens growth rate.\nSo still continuing on a very strong trajectory of card fee growth. And I just want to remind as well that on these 13 million cards that we acquired this year, 70% are joining the franchise on a fee-paying product, right? So that supports that growth together with the very strong renewal rates that we see as well. So it's been a very successful story for us, not only recently, but over the last five years. And that success is going to keep on in 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Mahir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. And thank you for taking my question. Maybe I just wanted to take a little bit of a step back and a big picture question for you just about competition from fintechs and how that has been evolving.\nYou talked a little bit about it on the commercial side earlier in response to Craig's question. But maybe just talk about it on the consumer side as well. Specifically, I was wondering, we've been seeing some pretty rich cashback offers from some of the newer entrants in the market, if you will. Is that starting to have any impact on drawing customers away from the traditional rewards card? And just what are you seeing on competition there from the fintech in the consumer side? Thank you.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nI would say I'll go back to the answer I gave before. I think Rick Shane asked the question before about how we invest. I think our card member is a little bit different. And they're really not really focused on cashback. We have cashback products for those that like it.\nBut our card members are more focused on a balance between rewards, experience, and service. So from a fintech perspective on the consumer side, we really have not seen anything. Not that we don't look at it, not that we're not aware of it. But again, it's about knowing your customer. Our customer is one that really does value that experience, access, and service as well as having rewards with it. And that's not something that the fintechs have been able to really replicate. Again, it is more of a cashback, more of a cashback product. On the SME side, it's technology integrated with card. And we're very aware of that. And as I said, we'll take the appropriate steps to address that. So on the consumer side, though, no, we have not seen any inroads at all.\nAnd if you look at it, our card acquisition, we don't unpack it, but our card acquisition from a consumer perspective was at record levels as well. So we had high, high consumer cards that we've acquired. So nothing to see there at this point. But again, we'll continue to watch it.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations and SVP, American Express\n\nSteve, thank you. With that, we will bring the call to an end.

I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Kartik Ramachandran. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nThank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slide and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discuss.\nAll of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results, and then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. As you saw in our earnings release issued a short time ago, we reported strong Q2 results and raised our EPS guidance for the full year. Based on the continued momentum we're seeing in our core business, revenue in the quarter reached an all-time high and earnings grew 44% year-over-year or 21% after excluding the gain of $0.66. We realized from the sale of Accertify. The strong performance of our core business year to date and our expectations for the balance of the year will enable us to increase our investments in marketing and other strategic areas that drive our growth without using any of the proceeds from the Accertify sale while still delivering exceptional earnings results.\nIn fact, we now expect to invest around $6 billion in marketing this year, up about $800 million versus last year, all of it funded from the results of our core business. As a result, we are raising our EPS guidance range for the full year to $13.30 to 13.80, up from $12.65 to 13.15 previously, and we continue to expect revenue growth in line with our 9% to 11% range for the year. As we've seen through the first half of the year, our core business continues to generate strong momentum even against the backdrop of a slower growth environment.\nThe continued momentum we're generating reflects the earnings power of our business model, which is driven by several interrelated factors including, first and foremost, the quality of our loyal premium customer base, plus the increasing scale of our business, a well controlled expense base, the success of the strategic investments we're making to enhance Amex membership, and our talented colleagues around the world. Our continued strong performance starts with our premium customers who are high spending, long tenured, and have excellent credit profiles, and we continue to attract large numbers of high quality premium customers with our superior products as seen in the consistently strong new account acquisitions and 24 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in card fee revenue we've delivered.\nNext is scale. Over the past few years, the scale of our business has grown significantly compared to year-end 2021. Revenues have grown by nearly 50%, card member spending has increased by almost 40%, cards in force globally have risen by around 23 million or about 20%, and the number of merchant locations on our network has grown by over 30 million or nearly 50%. This increased scale drives growth and gives us significant flexibility in running our business for the long term. At the same time, our operating expenses are growing well below revenues as we drive efficiencies across the business. The combination of our increasing scale and our well-controlled expense base produces significant operating leverage that generates more investment dollars we can inject into our business.\nAnother key factor driving our momentum is the success of the strategic investments we've been making in critical areas like marketing, value propositions, technology, control, management capabilities, and talent. To sustain our growth and to keep the momentum going, we're continuing to invest in enhancing our unique membership model through ongoing product innovations, new capabilities, and benefits. For example, as we execute our strategy of regularly refreshing our products, we focused on embedding additional value in our premium cards to make them highly attractive to customers across generations and geographies. This enables us to add large numbers of new premium card members to our customer base, drive greater engagement with existing customers, and price to the value we add. We are on track to refresh approximately 40 products globally by the end of the year.\nAs part of that number, we look forward to announcing our refreshed US Consumer Gold Card in the coming weeks, adding to the nearly two dozen refreshed and updated products we've announced through the first half of the year. We also continue to add new capabilities and benefits through both internal innovation and bolt-on acquisitions. For example, our Resy dining reservation platform has seen significant growth since its acquisition in 2019, and our planned acquisitions of Tock and Rooam will further expand our dining portfolio, giving our customers access to more great restaurants and increasing the digital offerings we provide to restaurants and merchants in the food and beverage industry. Finally, our talented colleagues across the company are the engine that drives our growth.\nTheir creativity, determination, and deep commitment to providing the best customer experience every day is what has made American Express what it is today and will continue to make us successful in the future. The combination of all these factors is what drives our premium business at a scale that can deliver superior earnings on a sustainable basis. The power of our unique business model and the ongoing momentum we're seeing in the business, driven by our loyal customers and dedicated colleagues, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our expectations for the year and our long-term aspiration for the business. With that, I'll now turn it over to Christophe.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our Q2 results, which reflect another quarter of strong performance. Starting with our summary financials on slide 2, Q2 revenues were $16.3 billion and grew 9% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. Net income was $3 billion in the quarter, generating earnings per share of $4.15. Our Q2 results also reflect the sale of our Accertify business, which closed during the quarter. We recognized an after-tax gain on the sale of $479 million, equating to $0.66 of EPS impact. Excluding this gain, EPS grew 21%, reflecting the power of the business to generate stronger earnings growth even in a slower growth environment as Steve noted.\nOn slide 3, Billed business grew 6% versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis, reflecting stable growth and in line with the softer spend environment we've seen in the past few quarters. The stability in spend growth was also visible by category, where we saw 6% growth in Goods and Services, 7% growth in Travel and Entertainment spending. We did see some slower growth in certain T&E categories versus the prior quarter, such as in airline and lodging. At the same time, growth in our largest T&E category, restaurants, remained strong, and Goods and Services strengthened a bit versus the prior quarter when excluding the impact of leap year.\nStepping back, while spend growth in certain categories was slightly higher or lower versus the prior quarter, overall spend growth was stable, and we continued to see strong growth in the number of transactions from our card members, which grew 9% this quarter. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses.\nStarting with our largest segment on slide 4, US consumer grew billings at 6% this quarter with balanced growth across both goods and services, and T&E. Our premium customer base continues to demonstrate steady growth. We also saw growth across all generations. Millennial and Gen Z customers grew their spending 13% and continue to drive our highest billed business within this segment. These younger card members continue to demonstrate strong engagement, and we see that they transact over 25% more on average than our older customers and in some categories like dining they transact almost twice as much. Turning to commercial services on slide 5, overall growth came in at 2% this quarter. Spending growth from our US small and medium enterprise customers increased a bit sequentially versus last quarter but remained modest.\nLastly, on slide 6, we see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services, up 13%. We continue to see double digit growth in spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers, and we are also seeing double digit growth across all regions. Stepping back, we continue to see stable spend growth across customer segments, spend categories, and our US and international geographies. While we are not in a high growth spend environment, particularly in the US, our spending volumes are tracking in line with our expectations and support our revenue expectations for the year. Moving on to loans and card member receivables, on slide 7, we saw year-over-year growth of 11%, demonstrating strong growth but continuing to moderate as expected.\nAs we progress through 2024, we expect loan growth in particular to continue to moderate by a few percentage points, but to still grow in double digits as we exit the year. Turning next to credit and provision on slide 8 through 10, our credit performance remains very strong and is a direct result of our disciplined growth strategy which has been focused on growing our high credit quality premium customer base, including through the younger customers we attract to the franchise. This strategy coupled with our robust risk management practices are an important aspect of our business models. Going forward. We expect our write off rates to remain generally stable for the remainder of 2024.\nTurning now to the accounting of this credit performance on Slide 9, the quarter over quarter reserve build of $101 million is mostly driven by growth in our loan balances, largely offset by lower delinquencies. This reserve build combined with net write offs drove $1.3 billion of provision expense in the Q2. As you see on Slide 10, we ended the Q2 with $5.6 billion of reserves, representing 2.8% of our loans and card member receivables, a slight decrease compared to Q1. It's worth noting that there is a seasonality component to reserves, although we are also encouraged by the strength of the performance we see in the portfolio. Moving next to revenue on Slide 11, total revenues were up 9% year-over-year, benefiting from the diversification across revenue streams, customer segments, and geographies.\nLooking at the components of our revenue, our largest revenue line, Discount Revenue, grew 5% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see on slide 12, this growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net Card Fee Revenues were up 16% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you can see on slide 13, we're now generating over $2 billion in quarterly card fee revenue as the differentiated value and experiences we offer on our products continues to resonate with our card members globally. This is an important metric for us because it also reflects the choice that our customers make each year to renew their membership. We're pleased with the growth and expect to exit the year with further momentum.\nIn the quarter we acquired 3.3 million new cards, demonstrating the demand we're seeing for our products and the investment we've made. Acquisition of our premium fee-based products continues to account for around 70% of new accounts, and importantly, as we have increased the total number of cards acquired, we have maintained disciplined underwriting standards.\nMoving on to Slide 14, net interest income was up 20% year-over-year. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances which also contributes to the continued net yield expansion versus the prior year. As we've shared before, we continue to expect this growth to further moderate as we progress through the year. To sum up revenues on Slide 15, the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum even in a slower growth environment, as our results in this quarter were fueled by growth in all our major revenue lines across each of our different business segments and across geographies. Moving to expenses on Slide 16, starting at the top of the page, variable customer engagement expenses came in at 42% of the total revenues for the Q2.\nLooking forward, I expect variable customer engagement expenses as a ratio to revenues to be in line with this level for the balance of year. On the marketing line, we continue to invest at an elevated level at $1.5 billion in the Q2. Given the strong performance in the core business, we now anticipate our full year marketing spend to be around $6 billion or 15% higher versus last year as we plan to invest at high levels to sustain our growth momentum. To put this in perspective, this is an incremental $800 million above what we spent in 2023. At the same time, we intend to deploy those investments in a disciplined way.\nAs I discussed at Investor Day, our Investment Optimization Engine is engineered to make profitability-based decisions at the margin, and there is a high bar for returns on these substantial incremental investments.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 16 brings us to operating expenses. Operating expenses were $3 billion in the Q2, down 13% versus last year due to the $531 million pre-tax gain we recognized from the sale of our Accertify business. Excluding the gain, operating expenses were up 3% in the quarter, well below the pace of revenue growth. Even as we continue to invest in technology and our control management capabilities.\nExcluding the impact of the Accertify gain, we continue to expect operating expenses for the year to be fairly flat to 2023. This quarter's results demonstrate how the scale of the business and strong expense discipline enable us to generate significant efficiencies, and those efficiencies are enabling us to invest at elevated levels while still generating significant leverage to drive strong earnings growth. Turning next to capital on Slide 17, our CET1 ratio was 10.8% at the end of the Q2 within our target range of 10% to 11%.\nWe also returned $2.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion of share repurchase. This is the highest level in over two years, and the recent CCAR results further demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and the resilience of our business model. The stress test results show that under a severely adverse scenario our portfolio remains profitable.\nIn fact, we are the most profitable financial institution as a percentage of asset growth across all the banks subject to CCAR and have the lowest credit card loss rate under stress as well. This results in our stressed capital buffer remaining at 2.5%, the lowest prescribed level. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth.\nWe do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach. This brings me to our 2024 guidance on slide 18. Let me step back and make a few observations about the growth in the business and the way we see the balance of the year unfolding. First, we have a core business that is comfortably generating mid-teens EPS growth even in a slower growth environment and before the gain from the Accertify sale.\nSecond, the pace of earnings generation in the core business combined with the strong demand we are seeing in the market for our products is enabling us to invest around 15% more in marketing compared to last year. As a result, we are able to fund significantly more investments from our core business than our expectation at the start of the year without relying on the one-off gain from Accertify. With that, as Steve mentioned, we are raising our guidance for EPS for the year to a range of $13.30 to 13.80, and within that range we now expect to drop all $0.66 of the Accertify gain to the bottom line. This is a departure from our usual practice of reinvesting a significant portion of one-off gains in growth initiatives.\nBut we are confident in the ability of our business to support the year-over-year growth of around $800 million in marketing while delivering mid-teens EPS growth. Finally, we still expect to deliver revenue growth in the year in line with our initial 9% to 11% range. With that, I turn the call back over to Kartik to open up the call for your questions.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to one question. Thank you for your cooperation. With that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star then 1. On your touch-tone phone, you'll hear a tone indicating that you've been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star then two. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Rash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning, Steve. Good morning, Christophe.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nMorning.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nMorning,\n\nRyan Rash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nSteve. Can you maybe expand on what you're seeing in the US consumer and SMEs? US consumer, we saw a little bit of a slowdown from 8% to 6%. Are you seeing a broader slowdown in the consumer? Maybe just talk about what you're seeing on the same store sales basis. Then on the SME side, you obviously saw a slight uptick. So maybe if you could just expand on those both. Thank you.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, so I think look, in US Consumer you saw a little bit of a sequential decline. But also remember last quarter we had the extra day. So, you know, it's not really apples to apples. But listen, the US Consumer was 6% up for the quarter, continued to be strongly influenced by Millennial and Gen Z growth. It's now up to 33% of our total billings, and they're up 13%. And so we feel, you know, we feel good where the US Consumer is, obviously organic spending, we'd like to see a little bit higher, but it is a, it is a slower growth economic environment. But one thing I will point out before touching on SME, you know, when our consumer, a lot of their spending is, you know, is discretionary.\nFor our consumer, if they decide they're going to pull back, they'll pull back a little bit on a discretionary, but they'll continue to pay their bills, which is why our credit numbers continue to be so strong and we continue to widen the gap between us and our competitors. We feel that, look, the US consumer has been pretty consistent, and we think it's going to be pretty consistent throughout the year from a small business perspective.\nYou know, while there still is an organic decline year-over-year, that organic decline is less than it was last quarter and the quarter before that. So, you know, we're seeing slight improvement in both the US Consumer and in small business. Retention is still strong and acquisition is still strong. And so what I like about where we're sitting is as the economy rebounds, whenever that may be, organic will pick up, driving future growth. And then just the last comment on International, you didn't ask about it because probably it is so strong. It's up 13% in the quarter. And even small business and commercial within, you know, within International is up 14%. So we feel, you know, we feel good about where we are right. Now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go. Ahead.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYes. Can you talk a little bit? I know you're reiterating your revenue guide for 2024 of 9% to 11%, but, you know, just given results, do you think you're sort of more leaning towards the mid to lower end? And then can you talk about where you're investing in marketing in terms of US Consumer, commercial, and international?\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nSo, I think, look, quarter to date we're at about 10%, both reported and FX. And for the quarter we were at 8% and 9%. And so I think we're going to wind up within that range. And I think depending upon how organic either rebounds or stays where it is, will determine where we wind up within that range. But we're very comfortable with.\nSort of the 9% to 11%. As far as investment. You know, what we do is we will look at the myriad of opportunities that we have to acquire more cardholders and depending upon at any given point in time, because.\nOur acquisition engine is a very dynamic engine, and things change all the time. We will allocate those investments either US Consumer, small business, or international. Traditionally, the US Consumer business would get more of that investment. Followed either by international and small business.\nBut as I sit here today, it's hard to say exactly what percentages will be, but it will be focused on acquiring more cardholders. And the key about that is, is that when we acquire cardholders in the second half of the year, it's really not going to drive spending for us this year. It will. What we're doing here is we're investing for the medium and the longer term, and it'll acquire cardholders that will spend for us, for us next year. So I think the takeaway from, you know, the point that Christophe made and the point that I made is, so we feel the business is strong right now that we're able to invest more and we have line of sight into those opportunities without compromising on credit.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThe only thing I will add to that, Don, is that the revenue growth was exactly as we were expecting it to be. And as we talked about it on the Q1 call, we talked about stable billings, which is exactly what we got. We talked about card fee remaining in terms of growth where it was in Q1 before, picking up a bit of momentum in the balance of year. We still think that is the right way to think about card fees. And we talked about NII growth rate moderating a little bit. So that revenue growth is where we thought it would be.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThanks. Good morning, Steve. I think I heard you say a Gold card refresh will probably be announced shortly. I guess just can we contextualize what that means? I assume it probably helps card fees next year, and then just the spend trends intra quarter. Were those pretty stable? It sounds like they were, but just clarifying.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So not going to get into the details of, of the card, but what I would say is, you know, one of the big advantages of the refreshes is it makes the marketing dollars work a lot harder. Right. So what happens is when you, when you do a product refresh, whether it's Gold, whether it's Delta, you know, whether it's Hilton or whether it's another gold or platinum card that we do internationally. What happens is you're able to.\nProvide more value to those cardholders that already have the product. You may be able to upgrade a Green to a Gold, and obviously you're able to acquire even new cardholders with that. And what happens is as you go out and acquire new cardholders, you'll have buzz around the fact that we have a new card and it has obviously a different value proposition, and you'll have the marketing that goes with it. And so when you do a refresh and you have your marketing spend, your marketing dollars work a little bit, the overall value proposition is a lot stronger, and it works a little bit harder for.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nWhen it comes to their intra-quarter billings, we typically don't talk about those, and there's nothing much to say here. So there's nothing noticeable in terms of monthly billing growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go. Ahead.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nDirector of Research and Managing Director, FT Partners\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nI wanted to ask about the marketing spend and it seems like you're putting the pedal down. So typically when American Express does this, it's because, or at least in the past you've seen this happen because Amex is either anticipating or already seeing a slowdown from competitors in terms of their market activity and you see a significant opportunity to gain share. Is that, is any of that thought process going into this here? And second, business development costs were lower than what was being forecast. So I'm curious if that's due to some slower partner growth that might have meant less incentives or what went into that. Thanks.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, so a couple points. I think $6 billion for the year in total marketing is not an area we've ever been in before. And an $800 million year-over-year increase is a pretty significant increase. I think that.\nWhen we make a decision, Craig, to put more marketing dollars in, it's because we see the opportunity. And if you look at where we have been from a marketing spend for the first two, for the first two quarters, that would show a trajectory of $6 billion. So we're really keeping all of our marketing spending consistent quarter-to-quarter because we do see the opportunity, and we see the opportunity within, you know, within the, within the credit box and within the dimensions of who we're looking for for our cardholders.\nYou know, it's not due to a slowdown in billings. We're not making this investment because of a slowdown in billings. This was something that we had planned to do at the beginning of the year where billings were, where they weren't going to be. As far as competitors pulling back, I don't see competitors pulling back at all. I think competitors right now, you know, the environment is just as competitive as it's ever been. Obviously you make these investments because you know, obviously you want to gain, you want to gain more traction with your cardholders and you want to gain more share.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nCraig, let me add a few things, and I will also answer your question about business development expenses. So the other element here to factor into the decision to invest more is the visibility we have in the balance of your performance.\nThe business is generating a lot of earnings. We have more visibility in terms of the credit performance and the balance of the year in terms of the opex as well. That gives us confidence in our ability to actually deploy more marketing dollars.\nTo get to your question about business developments. Expenses, there's nothing here significant.\nThere was, in the quarter, some efficiencies. I would use that word in terms of the commercial spend and the incentives that we have with some card members and partners here. It gave us a bit of efficiency. But there was nothing related specifically to co-brand partners or anything of that nature.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question, that question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRick Shane\n\nDirector of Research and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks, everybody, for taking my question, and I apologize. I can't see my computer this morning. So it's a little hard to get context on the marketing spend. But what I'm trying to understand is the following. What I've heard is that given the strength of the underlying business, the incremental marketing spend is going to be funded organically as opposed to from the Accertify gain. What I'm wondering is that $800 million year-over-year, has that changed materially from your prior guidance? Have you in fact increased your expectations and funded it organically or is it roughly the same and it's just a matter of how you're going to pay for.It?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah, let me take that question, and I hope you fix your computer problem soon.\nThe way to think about this is, we always entered the year thinking we want to invest, and we want to invest more because we see the opportunities, and they are compelling investments with attractive returns.\nThe fact of the matter is that their core business, which I would define as like the business excluding the Accertify gain, is generating more earnings than we had anticipated. So you're right, we can afford to spend more and to fund it through the core business. But on top of that, we also raised a little bit our marketing dollars. Now, it's not a significant amount. As we've said in the past, in a given week we spent $120 million on average of marketing dollars. So $100 or $200. A bit more. A bit less is actually not that material. But the key thing here is that in terms of the funding, it's going to be funded all from the core business, and because it's generating more earnings than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go. Ahead.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, Steve.Kristof.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nMorning.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nMorning\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nJust wanted to revisit the credit quality a little bit. I know last quarter, Christophe, you were talking about, you know, your expectation for write-offs to kind of continue ticking up from here, and it seems like your view has now shifted to a more stable outlook over the rest of the year. You just need to talk about what you're seeing from your core customers' health, maybe what's driving some more confidence in the outlook there. And then, you know, should we also be thinking about a stable reserve rate from here versus, I think, you were talking about more of an uptick over the rest of the year as well previously. Thank you.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning, Jeff. So you're right, we have changed a little bit the way we think about credit write-offs for the balance of year. You know, we are at the beginning of Q3 now. We had good visibility in terms of what's going to write off in Q3 and Q4. So we can be more confident in terms of providing a direction here. And to your point, the direction we're providing now is that it's going to be like stable at about the level you saw.\nIn Q2, around 2.1%. Now I need to say this specifically to address your question on the reserve and how to think about it. For the balance of year, a big driver of the reserve is going to be the delinquency levels. Right. Those card members that are showing signs of signal of stress early on, the delinquency improvement in the quarter, there is seasonality in that improvement. Right. And so we expect that delinquency rate is just going to probably tick up a bit in the balance of year, and that will drive a bit of incremental reserve together with the volume growth that we expect to see. But from a reserve rate standpoint, we are 2.8%. It's a good reference point for what to expect for the balance of year. It might increase a little bit. We'll see.\nIt's hard to predict where CECL is just going to land exactly at the end of Q4, but it's a good guide in terms of what to expect for the balance of year. I would expect 2.8%, maybe 2.9%, but we're going to be in that range. And to your point, credit losses, we expect stability from where we are now for the balance of the.Year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go. Ahead.\n\nMark DeVries\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. You know, as I think you pointed out, it is pretty unusual for you to let a gain like the Accertify gain fall to the bottom line. And I realize you don't give 2025 guidance, but Steve, just kind of wondering, you know, if you still expect to target that mid teens EPS growth off this higher 2024 EPS Level.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, I'm actually glad you asked that question because it is a one-time gain. And, and so as we do give guidance for next year, we certainly do expect.\nYou know, to be in that mid-teens EPS range. However.\nWe will be, you know, and we'd expect that people would adjust for that one-time gain. I think by calling out that one-time gain the way that we have and not using it within the business, I think it makes your job a little bit easier to just sort of remove that and then build from there. Because when you look at it, it's a one-time gain. That's why they call it a one-time gain. But the thing that I would also point out is that because we have elevated our marketing spending to where it is using the core business and not use the one-time gain. That gives us the opportunity to actually reset our marketing at a much higher level for next year, which will allow us to drive even more growth as we go forward.\nSo that's the, you know, that's the big advantage that we look at this by not using a one-time gain and saying, hey look, that's what we didn't have in our core. By adjusting up our marketing, by using core earnings, you know, our anticipation is we'll be able to keep that marketing there and grow from there going forward versus, you know, going back to the $5.2 for the $5.2.Billion.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Cris Kennedy of William Blair. Please go.\n\nCris Kennedy\n\nResearch Analyst of Financial Services and Technology, William Blair\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question at the Investor Day. Digital banking was one of the key areas of investment over the next couple of years. Can you just talk about those investments and what the goal is?\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, look, the overall goal is to be more engaged with both our small businesses and to be more engaged with our consumers. And I think digital banking is a bit of a journey for us. We now have multiple accounts, and we're just going to continue to invest not only in capabilities, but continue to invest.\nIn making sure that our customers are using that. So there'll be more to come on that. But we're at the beginning of this journey and there's still a long way for us to go.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Terry Ma of Barclays. Please go. Ahead.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Just want to get some more color on how your announced product refreshers are going in terms of just acquisitions, retentions, and just overall receptiveness and whether or not you still feel pretty good about having net card fees exit the year higher than last year?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nIn terms of acquisition or the product refreshers.\n\nTerry Ma\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nIn terms of just overall how product refreshes are going and whether or not you still feel pretty good about having net card fee growth exit the year?\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nThe net card\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah, so we feel very good about either adding a bit more momentum, as we said, in terms of the card fee growth; we are at like 16% FX adjusted. And we are definitely expecting this to tick up a bit in the balance of year. It's on the back of the product refreshes. But not only on the back of product refreshes. I mean, they're the single most important. As I said in my prepared remark here, the single most important element of that is the renewed commitment that card members, tenured card members in the portfolio, make every year to actually renew their membership. Right. That's a super important element of the mix here.\nBut card refreshes, we're on track. We talked about 40 products, and we are tracking well against that. And as Steve said, Gold is nex to come.\n\nSteve Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, I mean, we're about halfway through on those product refreshes. Gold is the next big one to come. It's really a little bit too early to tell how each one individually has done, but what you look at is 3.4 million cards, 3.3 million cards acquired, and retention rates are still strong. You know, those are the things that you look at, but, you know, we'll be able to have more color as the year goes on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Please go.Ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nHead of US Financials Research, HSBC\n\nHey, good morning, guys. So a question on your EPS guide, the midpoint of your guidance range implies an EPS in the second half. That at the midpoint of the range suggests around 2.6% growth. I think at the higher end it's roughly a little under 7%. Now obviously the higher marketing explains the bulk of it if not all of it. But just wanted to ask, is there anything else there that is relevant that we should be thinking about driving that deceleration and maybe different than what you had anticipated? Because obviously you know, on a core basis your numbers trending out to Accertify have been better than expected in the first half. Yet you know, core basis kept the EPS guide unchanged.\nOn that second half outlook, I think you have said in the past, correct me if I'm wrong, the card deceleration end of the year closer to 20%, I think. I don't think you've given a specific number on this call other than to say you see some acceleration, but it's 20% still the bogey there. Thanks.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nSo we haven't given a number, so. And I'm going to stick to that. But your math is, you know, we've done the math as well and we're looking at those numbers and you need to factor as well into account the fact that last quarter we had like about $200 million of one-off gain as well, you might remember, linked to the URR Model. But as you think about the balance of year, there are a couple of additional items to bake into your forecast.\nThe first thing is that, as I said, it was one of the previous questions. I think it was from Jeff. We expect to build some balances in the balance of the year for credit reserves, CECL balance- CECL reserves, sorry. And so that will put a bit of pressure on the EPS. The second thing is that opex, we're investing in technology, as I said in my remarks, as well; we're investing in our control management capabilities, and typically, as well, it's a seasonal factor. At American Express, we've seen operating expenses pick up a little bit towards the end of the year.\nSo when you bake all of this into account, including a bit more marketing that we are projecting at this point in time in the balance of the year, you actually get back on your feet, and you'll see that the EPS cadence or run rate is actually not moving that much and remains very high.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director of Specialty Finance, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks. Is there, you know, Karthik, as you look at the net interest income, you know, that did decelerate about six points in the quarter?\nFrom the first quarter level, but still the growth rate of NII is still well above the growth rate in loans as you kind of approach the end of the year, do you think that those two kind of converge or will you know, will there be margin pressure and could that net interest income growth be lower than the growth in balances by then?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThank you for your question, Moshe. There are a couple of things to keep in mind here. The first one is that as I've said, we should expect the volume, the balances, the loans to growth rate to moderate a bit further in the balance of year, although it will remain in double digit. From a yield standpoint, we have a slide that shows the yield.\nWe had a bit of a yield improvement on the back of, I would say, a few things: year-over-year yield improvement on the back of their revolve rates are a bit higher, and they keep ticking up a little bit. And the second thing is, and as we covered during the Investor Day, on the funding side, we still have this dynamic around a bigger share of our funding mix going to high-yield savings accounts, which for us is an effective funding channel. And so that dynamic is still going to play out in the balance of year. And so you should expect to see the NII growth rate kind of like moderate a bit in the balance of year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will be coming from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go.Ahead.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to go back just on just staying on spending and revenue. Is it fair to say that you're planning for this softer spending environment to continue for the next couple of quarters? So discount revenue growth will be at like current quarter levels is probably a fair way to think about it, or are you thinking any change in that trajectory? And then just relatedly on spending, if I could just, if you could just discuss what happened in large and global spend. It looked like it decelerated a fair amount. So is there anything to call out there? I mean I know it's a smaller business, but so fairly meaningful deceleration.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nSo let me take the first one around how we're thinking about billing. So we are, as I said, we see a lot of stability across the last two, three quarters and even a bit further when you look at this in detail. So from a guidance standpoint, when we develop the guidance and the revenue guidance, that's what we bake in. If there is upside to that spend level, then it's going to be a good thing for us. But from a guidance standpoint, that's what we are assuming on the revenue side when it comes to global and large. Last quarter, you remember, there was like a tick up; it was at 5%. This quarter, there was; we're back to that 0%. There are a few things here.\nThere's really nothing meaningful outside of we noticed one specific client like a significant drop in terms of their card member usage, but there was nothing really material there. Not big change, not an inflection point in terms of what we see in terms of corporate card spend. Donna, back to you.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nAll right. Well, with that we will bring the call to an end.

After that we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nThank you. Q1 was another strong quarter with revenues up 11% year-over-year to $15.8 billion and EPS up 39% to $3.33. The trends we've seen for the past several years continued through the Q1 of 2024. Our double digit revenue increase was driven by strong spending growth, up 7% overall on an FX adjusted basis, with US consumer card spending up 8% in the quarter and spending from international card members up 13% on an FX adjusted basis. Spending by US SME card members continued to be soft, but new customer acquisitions, retention, and credit on our small business products all continue to be strong. Fee revenues again grew by double digits, up 16% on an FX adjusted basis. We continue to attract high spending, high credit quality customers to the franchise.\nWith new card acquisitions accelerating quarter-over-quarter, adding 3.4 million new cards in the quarter. Our fee based products accounted for approximately 70% of the new account acquisitions globally, and we continue to see strong demand from Millennial and Gen Z consumers who accounted for over 60% of the new consumer account acquisitions globally. Finally, our credit metrics continue to be best in class. The ongoing momentum in our business is a result of the great work of our colleagues across the company and the loyalty and engagement of our premium customers around the world. Based on our performance and the trends we've seen through the Q1, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 9% to 11% revenue growth and an EPS of $12.65 to 13.15.\nOur Q1 results continue to show that our strategy is working and we feel good about where we are and where we are heading. In 10 days we'll be hosting our 2024 Investor Day. At that session we'll have a series of presentations from our senior business leaders that taken together will demonstrate why we are confident that our long-term growth aspiration is the right one. We will discuss our strategy for growing our premium consumer base in the US through our membership model, our plans for winning the recovery in the US small business space, our runway for growth in international, our progress in expanding merchant coverage and enhancing our network capabilities globally, how we're driving efficiency, growth, and service through technology, and how it all comes together from a financial perspective. We'll end our Investor Day with a Q&A session.\nChristophe will now take you through a detailed look at Q1 performance.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThank you Steve, and good morning everyone. It's good to be here to talk about the Q1 results, which reflect another quarter of strong results and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year. Starting with our Summary Financials on slide two, Q1 revenues were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.4 billion and earnings per share of $3.33. On slide three, Billed Business grew 7% versus last year in the Q1 on an FX-adjusted basis in line with the overall spend environment we have seen in the past few quarters. As we expected, looking by category, we saw 6% growth in goods and services spending and 8% growth in travel and entertainment spending.\nThere are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses. Starting with our largest segment on slide four, US Consumer grew billings at 8% this quarter with growth across all generations and age cohorts. Millennials and Gen Z customers grew their spending 15% and continued to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment. In fact, we see that younger customers use their cards more overall, and this is even more pronounced in certain spend categories. For example, customers aged 35 and under use their cards at restaurants over 70% more on average than other customers in this segment. Looking at Commercial Services on slide five, overall growth came in at 2% this quarter. Spending growth from our US small and medium-sized enterprise customers remained modest given unique dynamics seen by small businesses.\nLastly, on slide six, you see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services, up 13%. We continue to see double-digit growth in spending from international consumers and from international SME, and large corporate customers as well as strong growth across our geographies. Overall, while we do continue to see a softer spend environment, our spending volumes are tracking in line with our expectations to support our revenue guidance for the full year, and we are pleased with the continued strong engagement of our customers as the number of transactions from our card members continued to grow double digits this quarter. Now, moving on to loans and card member receivables, on slide seven, we saw year-over-year growth at 12%. As we progress through 2024, we continue to expect this growth to moderate, but to still grow modestly faster than billings.\nTurning next to credit and provision on slides eight through 10. First and most importantly, we continue to see strong and best-in-class credit metrics. We attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our robust risk management practices, and our disciplined growth strategy. As we expected, our write-off and delinquency rates ticked up a bit, increasing very modestly quarter-over-quarter. Going forward we expect to see these delinquency and write-off rates remain strong with some continued modest increase in 2024.\nTurning now to the accounting of credit of this credit performance on Slide nine, the quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances combined with a modest increase in our cardmember loans and receivables delinquency rate resulted in a $148 million reserve build. This reserve build combined with net write-offs drove $1.3 billion of provision expense in the Q1.\nAs you see on Slide 10, we ended the Q1 with $5.6 billion in reserves representing 2.9% of our total loans and card member receivables. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2024 similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters. Moving next to Revenue on Slide 11, total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the Q1. Our largest revenue line discount revenue grew 6% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX adjusted basis. As you can see on Slide 12, this growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fees revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the Q1 on an FX adjusted basis.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, we are pleased with this growth and continue to expect to exit the year with some further momentum reflecting our cycle of product refreshes. In the quarter we acquired 3.4 million new cards demonstrating the demand we're seeing for our products and the investments we've made. Importantly, acquisition of our premium fee-based products accounted for around 70% of new accounts and the spend, revenue, and credit profiles of our new card members continue to look strong. Moving on to Slide 14, you can see that net interest income was up 26% year-over-year in Q1. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year.\nWe do expect this growth to continue to moderate as we move through the year, and I would remind you that for our business model we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from a lower interest rate environment this year. To sum up revenues on slide 15, the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue growth momentum. I would note as you think about the CFPB late fee rule that late fees from our US consumer segment make up a small portion, less than 1%, of our overall revenue. While we have no specific plans to mitigate as of now, we are always looking at our pricing and policies in the ordinary course of business. Moving to expenses on slide 16, starting at the top of the page, variable customer engagement expenses came in at 40% of total revenues for the Q1.\nAs you look at these costs, I would note that consumer Membership Rewards included $196 million benefit as a result of enhancements to our models for estimating future Membership Rewards redemptions, some of which we reinvested for growth in our remarketing line. Looking forward, I still expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue on a full year basis. As we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our consumer members. On the marketing line, we increased investments to $1.5 billion in Q1. We continue to be pleased with the strong, high-quality customer acquisition and engagement we see as a result of these actions, and we are on track to increase marketing spend in 2024 versus last year.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.6 billion in the Q1, flat to last year's expense and in line with our expectations for the year. When you look at the components of our operating expenses, salaries and benefits grew modestly versus last year compared to the growth we've seen in this line over the past years. This reflects the discipline with which we manage our expenses and is a great example of how we're able to drive efficiency while continuing to grow our business. We continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage and are focused on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done. Turning next to capital on Slide 17, we returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the Q1 on the back of strong earnings generation.\nOur CET1 ratio was 10.6% at the end of Q1, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near term changes to our capital management approach.\nThat brings me to our 2024 guidance on Slide 18. We feel really good about our Q1 results, which are tracking in line with our expectations for the year. These results continue to reinforce that our strategy is working and we plan to continue to invest to support our momentum. As Steve discussed, for the full year 2024, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 9% to 11% and earnings per share between $12.65 and 13.15, and we remain committed to running the business for the long term. As a reminder, this guidance and the items related to the full year 2024 that I just walked through do not include the potential impact from the sale of our certified business that we previously announced.\nWe expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business as we've done with similar transactions in the past.\nWe still expect the deal to close in Q2 and plan to provide more detail then. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open up the call for your questions.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourselves to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. With that, the operator will now open up the line. For questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star, then one, on your touch-tone phone. You'll hear a tone indicating you've been placed in queue. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star, then two. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please proceed with.\n\nSanjay Sakhrani\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nYour question. Thank you. Good morning. I guess question for both Steve and Christophe Le Caillec. You said that you guys are seeing a softer spending environment. I'm just curious, when you look at the data, what's driving that? Is it inflation? Is it just a bit of tapering off after the post-pandemic spending? And I'm just curious as we think about what gets that going again. What is it? Obviously the comparisons get easier as well, so that should help. But maybe you could just walk through that.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nThank you. Yeah, let me start and then Christophe can jump in. But when you look at overall spending, our overall spending is 7%, but consumer spending is 8%. And I think consumer spending is relatively strong. And when you look at international, international consumer spending is up 14% and overall international is up 13%. Where you're seeing some softness is in SME. And so SME is up approximately 1%. And so I think as SME comes back, which we look as an opportunity down the road, as SME comes back, that'll drive some stronger spending. And I think the good things that we see from an SME perspective is that we're still acquiring cards, credit looks really good. And even though organic has come down, organic transactions have gone up.\nYou know, I think in aggregate we see softness, and I think a lot of that softness is driven from a commercial perspective. But you know, 8% consumer growth in the US is not too bad.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mihir Bhatia with Bank of America. Please proceed with.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nYour question. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the Membership Rewards expense. It looks like there's a little bit of a change there with model announcements and stuff? Can you just talk about that a little more? Did the estimate for the URR, the redemption rate, change from the 96% at year end? Like, should we think of this $196 million benefit as a one-time thing or is that going to.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nHey Mihir, thank you for the question. So you should think about it as a one time thing. The URR is 96%. It's still at 96%. What we do is because it's such an important model for us. We on a regular basis redevelop the model. Every time we redevelop the model, we try to enhance the model. So we feed the model with more data and try to refine their URR calculation. That's exactly what happened. When we did that in Q1, we came back with a little bit of a benefit. I say a little bit because you have to remember that the entire Membership Rewards bank is about 14 billion. It's a bit less than $14 billion. So 196 million is very small compared to the size of the balance sheet and so it's a one-off and we don't expect something similar anytime soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark DeVries with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMark DeVries\n\nAnalyst of US Consumer and Specialty Finance Sector, Deutsche Bank\n\nYes, thanks. Could you discuss what drove the reacceleration in the new card growth this quarter?\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, I mean, so we invested more and I think, you know, when you go back and you look at the Q1 of last year, we had 3.4 billion, 3.4 million. Excuse me, 3.4 billion would be a pretty sizable amount of cards to acquire in a quarter. 3.4 million cards acquired. And if you remember, at that time you had the SVB situation. And so there was a pullback. There was not only a pullback on our side, there was a little bit of a pullback in the industry, and I think there was some consumer trepidation as well. And so as the year went on, we started to build up and culminated this year with, in Q1, 3.4 million cards.\nWe invested more in marketing, as we said we were going to do. But I'd also like to highlight that a key driver of that acceleration is the product refreshes that we do. We've talked a lot about how product refreshes really stimulate demand and how it makes our marketing dollars work a lot harder. We had the Delta product refreshes. We had a product refresh in Japan. We had a Hilton Small Business Card. We had a British Airways Card. We're on our way to those 40 product refreshes that we talked about. What product refreshes do. They do stimulate demand and it stimulates upgrades and so forth. That's really what's behind.The increase sequentially of cards, quarter-over-quarter. But we're sort of back to where we were at this time last year.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThe only thing I would add, Mark, is as we increase the NCA, the percentage of new cards that are coming in a fee-paying product remains stable at about 70%, right. So it talks about the quality of these 3.4 million new cards.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nYeah, good morning. Thank you.\nWanted to ask about your assumptions on page 23 of the deck. It looks like, you know, the Q2 and Q3 you're assuming a better macro scenario in the US, so just curious with in combination of. The rewards.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nPlease stand by, we are waiting for our operator.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nSorry, were you guys hearingMe or?\nI'm here. Okay, sorry. So what I was saying was, with what seems to be firmer macro assumptions for the second and Q3 and the rewards benefit, how come the EPS guide was held flat? I'm assuming there's probably a bigger buffer in there. Second, if you could comment on what the trends have been in your loan workout program. Have you been seeing higher or lower additions to that program, and how's progress been in terms of getting consumers on good payment plans and maintaining them? Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAmerican Express speaker line are you guys there?\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nOperator, can you confirm if you can hear us in the room?\n\nOperator\n\nI can hear you. Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. We'll continue with the next question in just a moment.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nHello, can you hear us?\nHi, I can hear you. Can you?\nHear.Me?\nHello?\n\nOperator\n\nHi, this is Rob. Can you.Hear me?\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nOperator, can you confirm if you can hear us now?\n\nOperator\n\nI can hear you Darrell, do you hear them?\nHi, this is. I can hear everyone. I'm not sure. Please stand by while we.\nWe are experiencing some technical difficulties\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nFor those attending the call. We are going to dial back in, so please stay on the line, or if the call does drop, we ask you to dial back in, thank you.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nIt.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, please remain on the line. We will call or resume momentarily.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYou guys are back. Are you able to?\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nHear me? Yes, operator. Thank you. Please.\nGo ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, so that last question was from the line of Craig Maurer with FT Partners. Craig, you may have to ask your.\nQuestion again.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nYeah, we didn't.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nHear it. No problem. Thanks and good morning again. So wanted to ask about the assumptions later in the deck. It looks like you're assuming a firmer economic environment for Q2 and Q3. So taking that with the benefit on rewards, you know, should we assume there's a larger buffer built into your guide because you didn't raise EPS? Guide and second.\nAlong the same lines, I wanted to ask about your loan workout program. Are you seeing any change in terms of the pace of loans being added or loans being worked out, and how loans are progressing through that program. Thanks.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nOkay. Hey, good morning, Craig Under how we think about the balance of year. So as I said, you know, we're going to stick to our EPS guidance. Not going to change that range at this point in time. There are still a lot of things that need to play out in the balance of year end. We think that that guidance best represent what we expect at this point in time. Specifically about how to think about that URR benefit. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I would say that a significant portion of that benefit was reinvested on the marketing line. We knew we saw that benefit coming in the quarter, and we took advantage of that as well to dial up the marketing. So all in all, it doesn't have a meaningful impact on EPS for the full year when it comes to their.\nYou know, what we call their financial relief program and the modified loans. So this is an important program for us. We have what is one of the best programs in the industry. We have innovated. For instance, we have a short-term program. We are also in that short-term program enabling the card members to retain some spend capacity and, you know, usage of the product. So we really think that it's a differentiator to help the consumer members that are experiencing stress. So that program is working really well for us. It's very effective. And what I can say is that the enrollment in the program has moderated in Q1, and that the performance of the consumer members within this program is very, very strong. And you know, we have a ton of metrics.\nWe, you know, one of the metrics we talked about in the past was we're looking at payment loyalty and how much the card members who are, you know, in delinquent status are paying us versus paying our peers. We like what we're seeing, right. We're typically front of their wallet in terms of repayments, and it's definitely contributing to the strong credit metrics that you've seen. We think it's, it's also consistent with our brand in terms of being there for our card members and having their back. So that program is working well. But just to be specific on your question, the enrollment in this program is moderating.\nIn Q1.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Hecht with Jefferies. Please proceed with.Your question.\n\nJohn Hecht\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nMorning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked, so I guess I'm going to ask about the Visa and Mastercard settlement, a reduction in interchange rates, and then some steering mechanisms. I know historically, given your premium brand and so forth and so forth, those actions haven't had any impact on the business, but we haven't talked about that for a while. So I'm wondering if you guys just have some updated thoughts about that.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, well, it's really hard to say how it's going to play out over time. I mean, this has been going on probably close to 20 years, and it still has to be approved by the courts, and we'll see. But what I would say is it really doesn't change sort of our strategy in any way. I mean, we're still focused on premium customers. Our customers still, you know, engage with the products, will demand to use the products, and, you know, we'll still maintain our virtual parity. So we'll see how it all plays out. But, you know, we're going to continue to focus on what we control. And the only other thing I would say is that, you know, our pricing is, you know, policies and structures are fundamentally different than the networks.\nOperator.\nScrew.\nAround dialing.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience and standing by our conference will resume momentarily. We are experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain on the line, and once again, your conference will begin shortly. Thank you so much for.\nJoining us.\nOkay, you are.\nBack in.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nOperator, we can hear you. Can you go ahead and ask for the next question, please?\n\nOperator\n\nSure. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Adelson with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with.\nYour question.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, we can. Okay, good. Yeah. I just wanted to ask on the prior comments you made last quarter about the card refresh plans for this year, 40 card products. You know, I think from a quick count on Earn, it seems like you've done eight so far this year with Delta, Hilton, and maybe a card in India, is that right? And maybe you could just talk a little bit about trajectory over the rest of the year, cadence over the rest of the year, and what the response has been to some of those refreshes so far. I think more notably the big Delta one you did earlier this year would be interested to hear the response you've seen from customers so far on that. Thank you.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, so the product refreshes will go out through the year.\nWe don't really talk about exactly when they're going to be going to be released, but you can rest assured all 40 will, or approximately 40 will be, will be done. You know, it's a little early to tell on the refreshes as it's still in, you know, the early stages here. But what I would say from a Delta Reserve perspective, it has really, really gone well, probably beyond our expectations. So that is a, it's a great, it's a great product. You know, it's a, we raised the fee $100 and added over $500 worth of, $560 worth of value. So that's going well. And you know, as I said, you know, refreshes really do help to drive demand. It drives awareness. It not only drives, and it drives more engagement with existing, with existing cardholders.\nIt's been a strategy that has worked very, very well for us over the last number of years, and it's one that we're committed to on a go forward basis because it's not only important to again drive demand, but you really want to, you want to reignite and reengage with the base. You know, what we really do is we look at what our customers really want, and you know, and make sure that we're adding that value that makes the most sense to them.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Shane with JPMorgan. Please proceed with.\n\nRick Shane\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYour question. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. And Steve, it ties in with what you're just talking about. When we think about the life cycle of a customer, its acquisition, its engagement, and then ultimately it's loyalty and retention. And I think the real strength of American Express is on the loyalty retention side. When you talk about refresh, that's acquisition and engagement. Can you talk about what you're doing investing on the back office side as the portfolio is growing so quickly to make sure that you maintain the loyalty and retention aspect of the business as well?\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nWell, I think, you know, it truly is a virtuous cycle and I think, you know, you've got it right.\nYou know, it's important to obviously acquire cards and then as you acquire a card, you really want to engage them and get those cardholders spending in as many areas as they can. And so you look at this ramp up period over maybe a 0 to 24 month period. And then at that point in time.\nWhat's important is that we are engaging with the customer as a customer who is, who is embedded within the franchise. And you know, part of our marketing dollars not only goes to acquiring new customers, but we look at how people are spending, we look at how they're spending relative to other people like them. And that's where you'll see offers to either upgrade cards, line increases, and other products that we have. And so it's that constant engagement, it's the analytics that go behind it that really leads to the retention. What you cannot do is once you have somebody, you just can't let them be stagnant.\nSo, you know, there's a lot of learnings out of our commercial business and out of our merchant business where, you know, we have tremendous account managers and you know, that work with our clients on a daily basis, weekly basis to help them grow their spend. Now obviously with, you know, tens of millions of consumer card members, you can't do that necessarily personally, all the time, but you can do that through communicating, through the channels that we have. And another big part of our value proposition and our service proposition is when people do call into us, our customer care professionals, you know, are able to look at their spending, look at how they're doing and offer them other opportunities to really grow with us either, you know, again from a lending perspective or from a card upgrade.\nA card upgrade perspective. So I think it's really important what happens on that back office as that continues to fuel that virtuous cycle.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, Steve and Christophe.\nAlthough you mentioned, Christophe, that the rewards benefit was one-off, are you seeing any evidence of customers deriving greater value from experiential and partner-funded rewards? I'm just wondering if there's a possibility that pressure on the rewards rate could potentially abate in a sustained way as customers generate greater value in.\nOther ways.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nSo first off, and get a little bit more into the detail, but I think you've hit on a really good, a good point and one that really is part of our value proposition. Whether it's embedded value that we get from our partners that's embedded in the value proposition and we're seeing that increase over time. And that's also as you look at refreshes, you see that within the refreshes, but it's also the Amex Offers and how we continue to work with our merchant partners to provide more benefits to our card members on an ongoing basis. So I think when you take that entire portfolio of the rewards opportunities that we have, the embedded value that comes within the value proposition and Amex Offers, all of that together and it gets back to what Rick's point was, all of that together leads to.\nMore loyalty and more retention\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nand to build up a little bit on the rewards side. We are constantly trying to innovate on the MR side on the number of partners engaged in the program, the ease of redemption as well. One of their latest innovation that is actually truly successful in terms of how many card members are using it is the ability just to select a transaction on your statement, your digital statement, and actually use MR points to pay for that specific transaction. And we're seeing a lot of card members using that. So we constantly trying to make it easier and better for our card members to redeem to make the product.\nThe MR Program competitive and more and more economical as well for us. So it's definitely a place of innovation that is a very.\nDynamic place.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with.\nYour question.\n\nDon Fandetti\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nYes, Christophe, your international billed business growth continues to be.\nVery strong. Do you continue, do you.\nBuild that into your guidance at this level for 2024 revenue growth? And can you give us an update on how your acceptance initiatives.\nAre going?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So we are, you know, ICS and International was the fastest growing segment of American Express pre-COVID and has been for several quarters now as well. The opportunity is just much bigger for us in International.\nWe're also investing, everything else being equal, proportionally a bit more in international.\nTheir brand out in international is probably a bit more premium as well than it is in the US. So there's definitely a massive opportunity for us and we're going after it. And that's baked in our guidance for this year. It's also factored in as we think about our long term aspiration, part of their, you know, part of the things that we're going to do to deliver on that, you know, guidance for this year. And that long term aspiration is actually to grow at a faster pace in international. It's a great opportunity for us.\nFor sure.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nSo we're going to talk more about international at Investor Day. We'll have a separate segment on that. But we're also going to talk about how we continue to grow international coverage, and if you remember a number of years ago, we talked about our international city strategy. We talked about industries we're going after, and so we'll provide some updates on that. But you know, the top line is international acceptance continues to grow and continues to improve. And when you look at the international business growing at the rate it's growing and coverage continuing to grow, we see that as a long runway for future growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gus Gala with Monness, Crespi, and Hardt. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGus Galá\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.\n\nHi guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to dig in and ask, can we talk about the opportunities to lower cost of funding and similar line of thought here. Can you talk a little bit about the Pay Over Time feature? Thanks.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So the Pay Over Time, you mean like how it's performing, how it's growing Pay Over time?\n\nGus Galá\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co.\n\nYeah, yeah. Let's talk about the performance and the unit economics if we can.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So Pay Over Time is a facility that is available on our charge product.\nIt's a service that, you know, a lot of card members are taking advantage of. If the opportunity for them to revolve some of their transactions or part of their balance, their performance is very strong. It's actually the segment of our balances that is the fastest growing. And you know, I would say from a performance standpoint because that product or that service is attached to our charge card products. So typically premium card members, the credit performance is also, you know, the best that we have in our lending products. So it's a very efficient way for us to grow balances by extending credit to premium card members. And the first question that was funding mix funding. And so the funding mix is still, you know, it's still evolving towards more deposits.\nAs you know, deposits is for us the most effective and the most economical source of fund. You know, it's a very stable source of fund as well for us. I think we are, we are at about 92% of our deposit, direct deposit balances are below the FDIC cap. It's a stable, resilient, growing source of funding for us and it's generating.\nA lot of good things for us, including supporting our growth, growth plan, and growth aspiration. When you look at the yield that I had on the lending slide, one of the driver behind the yield expansion year-over-year is actually a more effective cost of funding. It's not a one-off. Right. That has been a trend for several years now. There is more.\nTo come.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks so much. You know, if you look at your commercial spending, particularly SME growth, you know, it's been particularly weak the last couple of quarters, and you're noticing on slide 5, the goods and services has basically been flat to down for a couple of quarters. And you know, you mentioned things that are, you know, unique to small business, but maybe could you expand that a little more and talk about what things we might see that would, you know, cause that to start to turn and how long you can, you know, kind of maintain, you know, the kind of teens growth in loans while that, you know, is kind of flattish. You talk about those things. Thank you.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nAll right, let me start. I'm sure Steve will add to this.\nSo you're right. I mean, the SME billed business has been in that, you know, 1% to 2% range for a year now. We think that this is macro driven and we have a ton of data that confirms that it's not specific to American Express, and the rest of the industry is experiencing similar trends. I will note, as I think we said in the prepared remarks, that on the acquisition side, it's going very strongly. So the demand for the product is there. The quality of the applicant is there as well. And as we've said in the past, it's the, I would say, the tenured base that is moderating their spend. We'll see how it goes. Those card members, the SME, as we've said in the past, have been going through a lot. They're certainly experiencing as well their compounding effect of funding costs for several years now.\nThey are very careful in terms of how they're managing.Their cash flows and how they're spending. This being said, we are very focused on working with them, as I said, engaging with them, and we're confident that we have what it takes to win them back when they are ready to spend more.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah, I think that, Moshe, when you look at this, the SME has been, this entire space has been sort of disrupted over the last four years or so, maybe five years with COVID where it took a tremendous drop for 18 months or so. And then all of a sudden you had unbelievable unsustainable organic growth of 19% and 20% in given years. It was crazy growth in 2021 and 2022. And we saw last year, after the Q1, it really started to wane. And again, a couple. I think there's again a few reasons for that. I think there was a tremendous buildup in inventories. I think interest rates going up.\nDid not help from a small business perspective, especially as they thought about purchasing goods and services and buying those goods and services and stocking them in anticipation of another supply chain malady or meltdown. You know, what we do like is that our acquisition is still very strong. The transactions even within the tenured base continue to go up. It's the larger transactions that we've really seen the organic decline on. And a lot of that can be industry specific. Construction, a lot of that can also be.\nNot buying big inventories up front. So I think what's important for us to focus on right now is to continue to acquire, continue to work with them, and engaging with them. And then when they're ready to come back, we're there for them as they want to spend even more. You know, as far as, and I started the conversation with this, as far as overall spending, that's what makes me feel really good about our overall spending because we're able to grow 7% with our commercial business growing very low, and small business only growing at 1%. And it's an important part of the important part of the franchise, and that's why we feel good because of the credit and of the ew acquisition.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nMaybe to bring together some of the pieces of revenue growth. I think you were on the high end of the Q1, and I think Christophe, you said the expectation that NII was going too slow. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you think about the trajectory of the revenue growth. Do we need to see spend stabilize to remain in the range? Or, can we see the impact of?\nRefreshes and card acquisitions be enough to stabilize revenue growth within the range on a quarterly basis? Thank you.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So. Things in Q1 played out as we were expecting. Right. Billed Business came in similar to what we had experienced in the previous quarters. Card fee is moderating slightly from 17% to 16% FX-adjusted growth rate, and we're still expecting that it will pick up a little bit in the balance of the year. On the back of the things that you said, including the card refreshes and acquiring a lot of premium cards. NII at 26% is going to keep moderating because balances are moderating. The guidance for the full year is still to be between 9% and 11%. We'll see exactly how things play out. There are still a lot of things.\nTo find out how delayed payment charges are going to come in, what's going to happen with the interest rates. So, best at this stage, I think, is to stick to the full year guidance of nine to 11. But I would say Q1 validated the trends and the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nWith that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you again for joining today's call and for your continued interest in American Express. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions. Operator.

I will now turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Kartik Ramachandran. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nThank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation Sides and in our reports on file with the SEC. The discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials, as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results.\nAnd then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. 2023 was another strong year for American Express. We delivered record revenues of $61 billion for the year, up 15% on an FX-adjusted basis, and we had record net income of over $8 billion, with earnings per share of $11.21. In the fourth quarter, we continued to drive strong customer engagement and demand for our premium products. We had solid growth in billings, strong new account acquisitions, and continued strength in credit quality, which remains the best in the industry. As a result, we achieved fourth-quarter revenues of nearly $16 billion, which was another quarterly record, and EPS was $2.62.\nChristophe will provide detail on our quarterly results, but I would like to take a step back to talk about what we've accomplished over the last two years and tell you why I'm feeling good about where we are today and why I'm confident in our future. Coming out of the COVID pandemic in January 2022, we saw an opportunity to accelerate our growth, and we set an aspiration to sustain growth over the longer term at levels that were higher than what we were achieving prior to the pandemic. At that time, we laid out a growth plan with the objective of positioning the company to be able to deliver on our aspiration of driving annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth over the long term.\nIn executing the plan, we focused on listening to our customers and understanding their needs, and we invested in innovating our value propositions as well as uplifting our marketing and technology capabilities, and backing our colleagues to meet those needs. Looking back over the two years since we announced the growth plan, I'm pleased to say that we achieved what we set out to do, and in fact, we're ahead of where we thought we'd be on our journey, thanks to the millions of premium customers we have around the world and the American Express colleagues who support them. Today, we are a larger and stronger company. Since 2021, we've delivered record annual revenues, increasing the scale of our business by over 40% in just two years, from $42 billion to $61 billion in annual revenues.\nAnnual card spending over this period has increased 37% on an FX-adjusted basis to a record $1.5 trillion. We've added about 25 million new proprietary card accounts over the last two years, and over 70% of these new accounts are coming into the franchise on fee-based products. With the growth in new accounts we've seen over the past few years, we now have a total of over 140 million cards running on our global network. Our focus on continuously innovating our value propositions to meet the needs of our customers is driving increased brand relevance across generations, including Millennials and Gen Z consumers. These customers represent over 60% of the new consumer accounts we acquired globally in 2023, and 75% of new consumer platinum and gold accounts acquired in the US came from this cohort.\nAt the same time, retention continues to be very high, and our credit metrics remain strong and best-in-class. These strong results reflect the success of our strategic investments we've made in our business, along with the tremendous earnings power of our business model. Looking ahead, let me tell you why I feel really good about our future prospects. We have a business model that is delivering premium performance, and we have strong momentum, which is driven by four key features of our model that differentiate us from the competition and are difficult to replicate. First, our economic construct has a set of diversified revenue sources that include card fees, spending, and best-in-class lending, with our subscription-like card fees being a core and fast-growing component of our revenue mix. We have a singular focus on premium customers and superior innovative value propositions.\nOur premium customers are high-spending, loyal, and drive our strong credit performance. We have a large and growing partnership ecosystem that expands our brand value to card members and merchant partners around the world. We have a global brand and a servicing ethos that truly sets us apart. Our business model provides us with strong competitive advantages, and the way we've been able to leverage the model's unique elements and execute our strategy has strengthened those advantages, giving us the runway for continuing our momentum across generations, geographies, and both our consumer and small business customers. The power of our business model, combined with the global scale of our premium customer base, the dedication and focus of our talented colleagues, and the attractiveness of the many growth opportunities we see ahead are the key reasons why I'm confident in our ability to continue on our growth plan.\nIt's why going forward we'll remain focused on our long-term aspiration of delivering annual revenue growth of 10% plus and mid-teens EPS growth. We believe this aspiration is the right one, and we aim to achieve it every year. However, we manage the company for the long term, and we anticipate there will be a range of potential outcomes in any given year due to a variety of factors such as external environment, and actions we might take that we decide are best for the business. Looking at this year, the continued momentum we've seen in the business as we've executed our strategy gives us confidence in our guidance for 2024, which is in line with our long-term aspiration. For the year, we expect to deliver annual revenue growth between 9% and 11% and full-year EPS of $12.65 to $13.15.\nIn addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.70 a share, up from $0.60, beginning with the Q1 2024 dividend declaration. This represents more than a 60% increase in the dividend from when we introduced our growth plan in January of 2022. As always, we will continue to run our business for the long term, and we'll do that by listening to our customers and meeting their needs through innovative, unique value propositions, and exceptional service that reflects our brand built on trust and security, delivered and supported by a world-class colleague base. In keeping our focus on backing our customers and our colleagues, we are confident that we will continue to deliver strong growth on a sustainable basis over the long term. Thank you, and let me now turn it over to Christophe.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our 2023 results, which reflect another strong year of performance, and to lay out our expectations for 2024. I will discuss both our quarterly and full-year results this morning since it's year-end and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we run the company. Starting with our summary financials on Slide two, full-year revenues reached an all-time high of $60.5 billion, up 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. Our fourth-quarter revenues were $15.8 billion and grew 11% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported full-year net income of $8.4 billion and earnings per share of $11.21. For the quarter, we reported net income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.62.\nLet's now go to a more detailed look at the drivers of these results, beginning with billed business on Slide three. We reached record levels of spending for both the full year and the fourth quarter in 2023. Total billed business grew 9% versus last year on an FX-adjusted basis. In the fourth quarter, billed business grew 6% as we continued to see more stable growth rates after lapping the prior year impact of Omicron back in the first quarter. This 6% growth rate does reflect a bit of softening versus last quarter, but I would point out that the number of transactions from our card members continues to grow double digits year-over-year, a good indicator of the engagement of our customer base.\nOur growth was driven by 5% growth in goods and services spending, and although slower than last quarter, continued strong growth in travel and entertainment spending, up 9% for the quarter. Restaurant spending remains our largest T&E category and reached $100 billion for the full year for the first time, while airline spending growth slowed in the quarter. There are a few other key points to take away as we then break down our spending trends across our businesses. Starting with our largest segment on Slide four, US consumer group billings at 7% this quarter. We continue to see growth across all generations and age cohorts, with millennials and Gen Z customers again driving our highest billed business growth within this segment. Their spending was up 15% this quarter. Looking at commercial services on Slide five, overall growth came in at 1% this quarter, consistent with last quarter's growth rate.\nSpending growth from our US small and medium-sized enterprise customers remained modest, given unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Specifically, in 2022, we saw a large increase in organic spending as businesses restocked their inventories following supply chain issues during the pandemic. This caused a significant growth over challenge for spending from this segment in the industry in 2023. Importantly, we continue to see strong levels of demand for new accounts, high levels of retention, and strong credit performance on our small business products. Looking ahead, this positions us well for the future as spending growth rebounds. Lastly, on Slide six, you see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services. We continue to see double-digit growth across all regions and customer types. Spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers each grew 13% in Q4.\nOverall, while we're seeing a softer spend environment, we are pleased with the continued strong engagement and loyalty of our card members across the globe. As we think about 2024, we are assuming a spend environment similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. Now, moving on to loans and card member receivables on Slide seven, we saw year-over-year growth of 13%. We expect this growth, which has been elevated versus pre-pandemic levels, to continue to moderate as we progress through 2024, but to still grow modestly faster than billings. Turning next to credit and provision on Slide eight through 10. First and most importantly, we continue to see strong and best-in-class credit metrics. We attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base, our robust risk management practices, and our disciplined growth strategy.\nAs we had expected, our write-off and delinquency rates did continue to tick up this quarter, as you see on Slide eight. Going forward, we expect to see these delinquency and write-off rates remain strong with modest increases in 2024. Turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on Slide nine, the modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate, combined with a quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances, resulted in a $400 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.4 billion of provision expense in the fourth quarter. As you see on Slide 10, we ended the fourth quarter with $5.4 billion of reserves, representing 2.8% of our total loans and card member receivables and continuing to reflect the premium nature of our card member base.\nThis reserve rate remains about 10 basis points below the level we had pre-pandemic or day one CECL. We continue to expect the reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2024, similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters. Moving next to revenue on Slide 11, total revenues were up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 15% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 5% year-over-year in Q4 and 9% for the full year, as you can see on Slide 12. This growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 20% for the full year, as you can see on Slide 13.\nAs we expected, growth continued to moderate a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year, reflecting our cycle of product refreshes. In 2024, we expect to exit the year with some further momentum compared to the current growth, supported by continued product innovation and our focus on premium value propositions. We currently have plans to refresh around 40 products globally next year. In the quarter, we acquired 2.9 million new cards, and the spend, revenue, and credit profiles of our new card members continue to look strong. Moving on to Slide 14, you can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis in Q4 and 33% for the full year. This growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year.\nWhen you think about 2024, you should expect to see net interest income growth moderate as balance growth moderates, with some continued tailwind from our tenured customers continuing to rebuild balances. I would remind you that for our business model, we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from a lower interest rate environment next year. To sum up revenues on Slide 15, the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue momentum. Looking forward into 2024, we expect to see revenue growth between 9% and 11%. Moving to expenses on Slide 16, overall total expenses were up 5% in Q4 and 10% on a full-year basis, both growing significantly lower than revenue. This expense growth reflects the strong growth we are seeing in our business, the investments we've made, as well as our continued focus on expense discipline.\nStarting at the top of the page with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 40% of total revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full year. I would note that these costs came in a bit lower than our expectations, reflecting some of the natural hedges in our model. As T&E spend growth slowed a bit in the quarter, we saw lower rewards cost than we had expected. For example, a lower mix of redemptions for airline tickets and fewer points earned on airline spend. In 2024, I would expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our card members. On the marketing line, we invested around $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2 billion for the full year.\nThis is a bit below last year and our expectations to have marketing spend at around $5.5 billion. Marketing expense came in lower than we expected for the quarter, reflecting lower demand given the softer T&E environment. However, we saw demand increase as we moved through the quarter, and we continue to plan for increased marketing spend in 2024. We're confident that with our sophisticated acquisition engine, we'll do so in an efficient way. Moving to the bottom of Slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $14.9 billion for the full year 2023. This was above our original expectations, driven by a few notable items in the quarter. First, as part of the normal course of business, we set up a reserve to cover expenses as we continuously look to enhance the organization's effectiveness.\nWe also set up a reserve for exposure to a specific merchant. Like many others, we were impacted by the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which increased our OpEx in Q4 by $115 million. Looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage and our focus on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done. In 2024, we expect operating expenses to be fairly flat to this year's expense. We will, of course, continue to assess opportunities as we move through the year, and our flexible model will allow us to dial up or down investments as needed. Taking everything into account in 2024, we expect total expense to grow mid to high level digits for the full year, as we expect to drive continued leverage through our operating expenses.\nTurning next to capital on Slide 17, we returned $5.3 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2023, including $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter on the back of strong earnings generation. We ended the year with our CET1 ratio at 10.5%, within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 2024, as Steve discussed, we expect to increase our dividend by over 15% to $0.70 per quarter, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings and our 20 to 25 target payout ratio. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach. That brings me to our long-term aspiration and 2024 guidance on Slide 18.\nWe continue to run our business with a focus on our aspiration of revenue growth in excess of 10% and meeting EPS growth, and we believe that is the right aspiration. As Steve discussed, for the full year 2024 specifically, we are introducing our guidance of having revenue growth of 9% to 11% and earnings per share between $12.65 and 13.15. This guidance remains in line with our aspiration and also factors in a range of scenarios based on what we're seeing in our business today. We also recently announced an agreement to sell our Accertify business. Our guidance and the items related to 2024 that I just walked through do not include the potential impact from this sale.\nWe do expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business, as we've done with similar transactions in the past. We expect the deal to close in Q2 and plan to provide more detail then. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kartik to open the call for your questions.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press star, then one on your touchtone phone. You'll hear a tone indicating that you've been placed in queue.\nYou may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing star, then two. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. One moment, please, for the first question. Our first question comes from Don Fandetti of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nGood morning. Good to see the 2024 EPS guidance and REP guidance. I guess on January spend, some of your peers have noted a slowdown on weather. Can you comment on that, and then just maybe talk a little bit about billed business in 2024 in terms of SME?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So we don't talk about monthly numbers, so let alone about a few weeks into the month of January. So I think best is to wait until the end of the quarter, and we'll provide a lot more color and detail on the billing in January so far.\nAs far as how we think about billed business in 2024, our planning assumption is that we should expect, or we're expecting, billings to be consistent with what we've seen in the prior few quarters. We're ready to see an upside if there is some. But for now, that's the assumption we baked in our plans and how we constructed this guidance. On the SME side, it's the same assumption, if you want. We are assuming something similar to what we're seeing in Q3, Q4. We are very focused on winning the recoveries with SMEs. As I said in my remarks, these card members have been through a lot over the last two, three years, and we are focusing on providing the best experience, the best products. We're focusing on acquiring as many customers as we can and helping them grow their business.\nWe'll be ready when they're ready. Historically, this has been a volatile segment for us, how dynamic these customer segments are. We play a critical role in that industry, and we'll be ready when they're ready.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nGood morning.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nMaybe to build on Don's question, can you maybe just dig a little bit deeper on some of the drivers of revenue growth, so discount revenues, card fees, and NII? Christophe, I know you said that NII should decelerate. Are we assuming any sort of re-acceleration as we move through the year, particularly in areas like US consumer or SME? Thank you.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. Hey, good morning, Ryan. Thank you for your question. The building blocks of the revenue growth remain the same.\nAt a very high level, we expect billing and therefore discount revenue to grow at a pace similar to what we've seen in the recent quarters. We expect card fees, so Q4 is at 17%, full year at 20%. We expect card fees to be a key contributor to growth going forward, to remain a key contributor to growth going forward, and actually to exit Q4 at a higher level than where we are right now. I gave you the context in my remarks, very much supported by the constant strength in premium acquisition, the product refresh and renewals that we are committed to execute on, and very strong retention rates, which we have experienced for many years now.\nWhen it comes to the last component of our revenue pool, net interest income, you should expect that growth rate to moderate, very much driven by the fact that, and you've seen the trend, I'm sure, Ryan, their asset growth and their lending growth rate have been moderating over the past quarters, and we expect that moderation to continue. The very strong growth was a function of tenured card members rebuilding balances post-COVID. And at some stage, we're going to reach a more normal rate there, and that will naturally drive NII to a more moderate level of growth. I got to also mention that we believe that the interest rate dynamic and what the Fed will decide doesn't play a big role here in terms of what's going to happen to NII. And when you put all of this together, and you can, we run multiple scenarios.\nWhat if billing is a bit stronger? What if NII is a bit weaker? And we land in the same range of 9% to 11%. So that's very much how we think about the revenue guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Mark DeVries of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMark DeVries\n\nSenoir Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks. Was hoping you could dig a little further into kind of where the loan growth is coming from, how much of it is from new customers or relatively recently added customers versus older, and gaining share there, and also whether you're seeing any kind of difference in credit performance on kind of balances from newer customers versus older.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nOkay. So let me take loan growth first. The dynamic on loan growth has not changed, and for several quarters now, it's also our philosophy and how we run the company.\nAbout 70% of their loan growth comes from tenured card members. What we call tenured card members is card members who've been with us more than 12 months. That's very much how we think about acquisition. We acquire card members, we develop relationships with them, then we offer them we cross-sell products, we increase the lines, we nurture those relationships. We do that because we understand them better, we understand their spend patterns, and they understand our products better as well. That's the driver. We don't do much balance transfers, if any at all, and we don't have promotional offers, much promotional offers also. It's very much growing with our tenured card members. It's part of our strategy to contain, if you want, the credit risk and to control it.\nWhen it comes to the credit profile of the new card members, we haven't changed our credit underwriting models, right? We haven't changed as well our marketing channels and products. We still skew towards positive selection in terms of credit profile. That has not changed. I need to say that the prospects that we bring in and become recent card members have very good credit profile.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Bill Carcache of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nBill Carcache\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on your comments about customer engagement spending outpacing revenue growth. Can you speak broadly to your ability to continue to drive customer engagement with elevated investment spending while at the same time offsetting that margin pressure with operating expense leverage and other parts of the business?\nAnd I guess, do you anticipate positive operating leverage on an aggregate basis, with revenue growth outpacing the sum of that customer engagement and operating expense combined?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nOkay. There's a lot here. So let me first take you through customer engagement. The key thing for us, and you heard us say this for years, right? We build premium products and we price for that value. You heard us say as well that over the last years, the mix of the portfolio shifted more towards premium products. That premiumization of the portfolio is the key driver behind that ratio of variable customer engagement expenses to revenue. The more platinum card members we bring, the more variable customer engagement expenses you should expect to see. But at the same time, we have a lot of initiatives to actually optimize this. We have a lot of innovation in that space.\nI'm going to share with you one that is driving a lot of efficiencies for us. We recently introduced their Pay with Points option where you can actually go in the app or the website, select one specific transaction, and pay with points. So we have that constant innovation to try to delight the customers, make their life easier, and at the same time create efficiencies in terms of the weighted average cost per point. Specifically in Q4, one of the drivers of that efficiency or that variable card member engagement expense was the fact that we saw less point redemption with airline tickets, which is one of the most expensive cost per point that we have. That drove some efficiencies in that metric. We also saw, as there was some softness in some T&E categories, less point accelerators earned, and that created as well some efficiencies there.\nThe reason why I'm pointing that out is just to give you some example of some of the natural hedges that exist in our business model, where when you see a little bit of softness in the top line, that creates some savings as well in some expense lines. So we guided towards a little bit of an increase in terms of the variable card member engagement expenses, and we're going to keep monitoring that, but I feel good about that trend. And I think that that margin is still very strong and able to generate very strong earnings. We've committed to containing OpEx, and as I said, we expect 2024 operating expenses to be about flat to where we are ending 2023. And marketing expenses will dial up or down based on opportunities that we see, based on the efficiencies that we create as well.\nThe model works really well, as you can see, and I'm comfortable that the model is strong. We are stress testing that model running multiple scenarios, and it works well in terms of its ability to generate earnings over time. I would say risk-adjusted earnings because that powerful model, what we pay on variable card member engagement expenses comes back with a multiple on the credit line. We attract positive select. We generate positive select. We attract premium card members who have a very strong credit profile. I like paying for that as opposed to trying to control the credit risk down the road.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Adelson of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Adelson\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Chris and Steve, just wanted to dig into the softer T&E trends a little bit.\nIt looks like you're seeing some softness, particularly in airline spend. You're seeing some slower point redemptions for tickets there. Just maybe give us some insight into what you're hearing and seeing from your card members on that front. And then just maybe in the forward look, can you help us understand what you're kind of embedding in your expectations for T&E from here? I think in the past, you've talked about how the booking trends have been a pretty good indicator of what's to come. Maybe any comment on what you're seeing there?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So T&E, sequentially, the growth rate came down. I need to point out, though, that it's still up 9% year over year. So it's a pretty strong growth rate. In terms of airline spend, and if you heard, I'm sure the various airlines, they all made comments about a bit of a softer demand.\nAnd since many of those customers are using an American Express card to pay for the airline ticket, we saw a similar trend. This being said, booking remains very strong on our T&E segment. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I know they were strong. So, I don't know. We'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point, but we keep seeing a lot of strength, and the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations of new cards are very strong. Card members decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past. We've seen that choppiness as well in the past. I don't worry. It's one data point. For 2024, we haven't communicated on exactly what assumptions we're making by category, but I'm not too worried.\nWe have a card member base that loves traveling, and I'm sure they're going to keep traveling.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nRick Shane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking my questions this morning. Look, you guys had alluded to the fact that the reserve rate is going to go up or drift up in 2024. I'm curious if what's driving that. Presumably, it's a mixed shift between loans and card member receivables, but I'm wondering if at any level you're also suggesting that the reserve rate on the loan portfolio is going to go up as a reflection of either some sort of shift there, or is it just pure mixed shift as the loan portfolio grows faster than the card member receivables?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nSo thank you, Rick, for your question.\nThis is an important point, so I'm glad you're asking the question. The first thing I want to say is that the absolute levels, when you look at the delinquency rates or the write-off rates, are very low in terms of our historical performance. On the slide, I put as well their pre-pandemic levels. The write-off rate is 2% in Q4. It was 2.2% pre-pandemic, right? So we're still below where we were pre-pandemic. So in absolute, they're very low. Relative to our peers, which I know you know well, they're also very good. I'm sure you noted that every competitor or peer reported their numbers and experienced the same tick, but at a higher magnitude. Our tick up of 0.2 or 20 basis points is one of the lowest in the industry.\nSo I feel good about where we are, and I feel good about the trend. When it comes to the dynamic in the portfolio, the key driver behind this is that there's still some normalization going on here. We are moving from sub 1% write-off rate during the pandemic. As you all know on this call, this was not a sustainable level, and these rates are normalizing, and they are normalizing at a slow pace, and I like that. The 2% is, again, a place where I feel comfortable from a credit standpoint. The other thing to expand a little bit and take a step back in terms of what kind of loan growth we are seeing, the biggest contributors in terms of loan balances are the Pay Over Time facility that we offered with our charge products and the co-brand cards.\nAnd so both those portfolios have very strong credit profile and better credit profile than what we call internally proprietary lending, which includes Blue Cash Everyday, for instance. So if anything, the profile of the portfolio and the mix of the portfolio is shifting and evolving more towards products that have a strong credit profile and high velocity. This being said, that normalization is happening, and that's what's creating that little tick up. And as I said in my comments, we're not quite done with that normalization. There's still a bit more to come in our mind, but not a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Saul Martinez of HSBC. Please go ahead.\n\nSaul Martinez\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, HSBC\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe I'd just ask on capital. Is there any updated thoughts on how you're thinking about Basel Endgame?\nObviously, your preliminary expectations of the proposal, at least, are that it would take you down to closer to 7%. There is a lot of talk about that being softened. Just how are you thinking about capital management? You obviously increased your dividend, but how are you thinking about buybacks going forward in light of the uncertainty?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So thank you for your question. So not a lot has changed on that front outside of the fact that we've been meeting with regulators. Steve met with regulators. I met with regulators as well. And what I can tell you is that they are listening. They're engaged. And I think they understand our comments. The ball is back in their camp now, and they're incorporating all the comments they receive from the industry. And I'm sure you've seen a lot of those comments as well.\nSo they have a lot of work to do. Right now, we're in waiting mode, and I think we're expecting their, or at least their next version of the rules by the end of 2024. We'll see. It took 10 years to get to their First Draft, so we'll see when we get the next version. I'm not too concerned. I feel good about our starting point and our capital position. As you know, we generate about 30% return on equity, which means that we generate a ton of capital. For now, we're not going to change our capital policy. The first thing we do is, of course, fund the balance sheet. Then we distribute dividends. We feel very confident about the increase that we are planning to do this year.\nAnd the rest is going to go in share buyback so that we keep capital between 10% and 11% of our risk-weighted asset. That's what we've done for years. That's what we're going to keep doing. We're going to adapt to the Basel rule. We're running the company conservatively as well with a big buffer over the 7% rate that we have. So nothing has changed much on that front. More to come when we get the final rules.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Moshe Orenbuch of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nMoshe Orenbuch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks. Many of my questions have been asked and answered, but hoping to follow up on a comment that you had just made about the Pay Over Time business. Could you talk a little bit more about the characteristics of that?\nYou mentioned that obviously that's going to tenured charge card customers, so the quality is very strong. Could you talk a little bit about the yield and how much you've seen in kind of growth from that product?\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So your description is correct, Moshe. It's a facility that we attach to our charge card products where they can decide if they want to revolve a portion of their payout. This is the fastest-growing category for us in terms of loan growth. It was very well received. It was very well received by the card members. And I don't know what else I can tell you. Remember that their charge card has a no-preset limit, which is an important feature here. So it's a way for us to give them as well, and it's a painful product.\nSo it's a way for us to give them a facility where they can revolve over a period of time. And as I said previously, their credit profile is very strong on this product, very much because it is attached to a very premium base, right? Premium Gold Card members are using this facility and revolving from time to time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Sanjay Sakrani of KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nSanjay Sakrani\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, KBW\n\nThank you. Maybe I could ask the questions regarding what's embedded in the revenue growth expectations for 2024 differently. If we look at the fourth quarter exit run rate, would that sort of target us to the low end of the guidance range? And then, Christophe, you mentioned that lower rates shouldn't help, but aren't you guys liability-sensitive on the charge card portfolio? Thanks.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nSo let me take the second question first.\nWe are slightly liability-sensitive. The key assumption for us, but the comment remains that in its totality, our total balance sheet and total funding stack level, the impact of rate cuts is going to be very small to our NII. The big unknown here is what's going to happen to the beta. We've been, as an industry, trending around 0.7 on the way up. We're probably going to trend to 0.7 on the way down, but not immediately. It's hard to say exactly at this point in time where we're going to be when the Fed starts cutting rates. We are making assumptions that we think are conservative, but we don't know for sure, and we'll see where we are.\nSo there is a bit of uncertainty here, but what you know for sure is that you should not expect a big impact on NII depending on the rate curve. Going back to your first question around revenue, I don't have a lot to say on top of what I said earlier and what I said in my prepared remarks. I'm happy to be surprised on the upside if Billed Business is stronger. Card fees, we have good visibility. NII, I think the trend is very established. And on Billed Business, as I said, we are assuming at this point in time something consistent with what we've seen in the previous quarters. And we'll see where we are at the end of the year.\nBut if the economy rebounds, if the growth is a bit stronger than what is expected by economists and our card members are optimistic and keep spending, I'd be delighted to have a higher billed business to report.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer and Co.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nDominick Gabriele\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nHey, good morning, Steve and Christophe. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just curious about the total card growth. I mean, we all know that you've seen some really excellent account acquisitions over the last number of years. But I was just curious about total card growth versus proprietary cards and co-brand growth, in particular this quarter. If there's any color you can provide on why that may diverge or what the strategy is between maybe having more proprietary cards as a percentage of total cards, anything on that would be excellent.\nThanks so much.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So we have about 140 million cards that can transact on our network. Out of the 140 million cards, about 80 are issued by American Express. That's what we call the proprietary cards. They represent the bulk of the spend, and they drive the very vast majority of our economics. From a growth rate standpoint, if you look at cards in force, and you'll see that in the details of our disclosures, their proprietary cards in force are up 5% year over year, and the total cards in force, so including their cards issued by network partners, is up 6%. Does it answer your question?\n\nDominick Gabriele\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Oppenheimer\n\nVery much. I really appreciate that. Have a good day.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Arren Cyganovich of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nArren Cyganovich\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks.\nMaybe you could, I was wondering if you could talk about the plans for the next Platinum refresh in the US. I think the last one was done in 2021, and whether or not you have any plans to do that this year, and if that's in your guidance for the year as well.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So as you know, we have committed to refreshing 40 products this year, as Christophe had said. And strategically, we look at refreshing all of our products on a sort of three- to four-year basis. And it's important because it's really important to make sure that we keep our products fresh. We're listening to our customers and putting in those enhancements and the extra value that they want. And it enables us to make sure, from a generational perspective, we are modifying those products as trends change and as our customer needs change.\nAs far as specifically for the Platinum Card, we don't really pre-announce that. And so I think you just have to wait and see.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question is coming from Craig Maurer of FT Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nCraig Maurer\n\nManaging Director, FT Partners\n\nYeah. Good morning. Thanks. Two quick questions. Considering the strength of Delta Air Lines over the last number of years as consistently the top airline, you've clearly benefited a lot from that in terms of new card issuance and likely spend as they've been able to hold fares better. As we see airline spend slow, does that benefit diminish? And is it something you have to think about? And second, in terms of small business, we've been pretty flat now for a couple of quarters. Curious what you're seeing under the covers there. Are you still able to issue new cards?\nAre you seeing any reluctance from small business to take additional products that might increase their cost beyond the baseline? I'm just trying to understand the mood better of small business owners. Thanks.\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express\n\nYeah. So from a small business perspective, the drive is really organic spend. We're not seeing existing small businesses spend more than they spent the year before. And that's not an American Express phenomenon. That is an industry phenomenon. As far as card acquisition within small businesses, that still remains strong. As far as small businesses looking at our platform and looking at our loans and so forth, that remains strong. And the credit quality remains strong. I think, as Christophe said in his remarks, there is this phenomenon of inventory buildup, some interest rate shock, and so forth. And so small businesses tend to be very, very secular.\nI would be much more concerned if we weren't acquiring cards, if we weren't engaging in new small businesses, or if write-offs and delinquencies were higher. So at the moment, as we look at this, we truly believe this is an organic spending issue, and it's not American Express specific. I'll let Christophe talk a little bit about Delta.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nCFO, American Express\n\nYeah. So the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%. And we are originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip. Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.\nSo I don't see any softness there at all. And I will say as well that their credit quality of those new card members remains very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segments on the loan side, and it comes with very strong performance. People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality. And we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So I'm not worried about that at this stage.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from Mihir Bhatia of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMihir Bhatia\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi. Thank you for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to go back a little bit and maybe just unpack the billings growth a little bit.\nMaybe can you just talk about how much of that is being driven by adding new card members versus winning wallet share? And then just relate it to that same topic as just how are you thinking about the environment for new card acquisitions? Is this 3 million level that you have been at for the last couple of quarters the right level to think about for the next year? I understand that it's dynamic and you'll change, but what have you assumed in your planning?\n\nStephen Squeri\n\nChairman and CEO, American Express",
    "content2": "Let me talk about sort of card acquisition numbers. When we go out and we look at acquiring card members, we really focus on acquiring billed business and we acquire revenue.\nConsistently now, if you take Q1 out of last year where it was a little bit more of an anomaly of 3.4 million cards, we've been around that 3 to 2.9. As long as we have a line of sight into high credit quality premium card members, we will continue to be out there aggressively acquiring card members. That range will be where we see that range today between 2.9, 3.1. We don't really provide any guidance on that. But with the amount of money we're planning on spending, I think it's a pretty fair assumption. We report that, but what we really focus on is making sure that we're getting billed business acquired. When you look at the composition, obviously in a stronger environment, you're really looking for more organic growth from your existing cardholders.\nI just made the comment before, where small businesses, that's not what we're seeing. So when you look at any growth that you're seeing from a small business perspective, that is truly from new cardholders acquired. A lot of the growth from a consumer perspective right now is new cardholders acquired, which actually, as we think about engaging with our cardholders, gives me a lot of confidence going forward because as we continue to engage and not only get more wallet share, but as our card members get back to where they were probably before the third and fourth quarter, we believe there is upside there from a billings perspective. We've talked a lot about Millennials over time.\nWe get on this growth trend, we get on this trajectory with these Millennials and Gen Zers where we start with a higher share of wallet, and we start with that higher share of wallet because they're used to using their American Express card everywhere. As they move through their life cycles, their wallets increase. So we have a lot of confidence in the long-term lifetime value of the Millennial base and of the Gen Z base that we're now acquiring. You see, even in this Q4, that is 32% now of our total spending. The way to think about this right now is a lot of the growth that you're seeing is coming from new card acquisition, but there will be an organic step up as the economy gets better.\nThat gives us a lot of confidence in how we're positioned for future growth over the long term, which gives us confidence to say, aspirationally, we should be a 10% plus revenue company. That's why you see the guidance that we've given this year, both from a revenue perspective, and EPS perspective.\n\nKartik Ramachandran\n\nHead of Investor Relations, American Express\n\nWith that, we will bring the call to an end. Thank you for joining today's call and for your continued interest in American Express. The IR team will be available for any follow-up questions. Operator, back to you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, the webcast replay will be available on our investor relations website at ir.americanexpress.com shortly after the call.

Welcome to the American Express Q3 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Kerri Bernstein. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nKerri S. Bernstein\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call.\nAs a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC.\nThe discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.\nWe'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Christophe Le Caillec, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Christophe.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThank you, Kerri. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call.\nQ3 was our seventh consecutive quarter of strong performance, continuing the momentum we've built over the last few years and aligned with the growth plan we announced in 2022. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of record revenues, which reached $15.4 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $3.30 was also a new quarterly record.\nBased on our performance to date, we remain confident in our ability to achieve full year revenue growth and EPS growth that is consistent with the annual guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. And we are well positioned as we seek to achieve our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond in a steady-state macro environment.\nMy confidence is based on several factors, including the many attractive opportunities available to us because of the businesses and geographies we operate in; our unique membership model, which powers a virtuous cycle of growth; the success of the strategic investments we've been making in key areas of our business; and our ability to leverage our differentiated business model, which includes our premium global customer base, integrated payments platform, strong partner relationships and trusted brand. Together, these factors have driven our strong performance over the past 2 years, including the continued momentum we saw in the third quarter.\nIn the quarter, Card Member spending remained strong, up 7% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. Spending was strongest in our U.S. Consumer segment, up 9%, and International Card Services segment, up 15% on an FX-adjusted basis. And U.S. small business spending increased slightly from a year ago.\nMillennial and Gen Z consumers continue to be the fastest-growing portion of our card member base, with spending from this demographic in the U.S., up 18% year-over-year, and they accounted for more than 60% of all new consumer account acquisitions globally in the quarter. Demand for our products remain robust, particularly for fee-based products, which represented more than 70% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter.\nCustomers continue to be highly satisfied with our products and services, which drives high levels of engagement and retention. We were rated the #1 U.S. credit card company for customer satisfaction by J.D. Power for the fourth consecutive year and the 13th time in 17 years of the study.\nAnd our credit metrics remain best-in-class, as we continue our focus on growing with discipline and a strong focus on risk management across the portfolio. A key reason for the momentum we're seeing is the investments we've been making in innovating our value propositions to deliver generational relevance across all age groups.\nResy is a good example of some of the ways we're doing this. We acquired Resy and continue to invest in building out the platform because we know that dining is something that all generations of card members care about. We've seen that in our results as restaurants continue to be the largest and one of the fastest-growing T&E categories in the third quarter.\nThe number of Resy users, restaurants on the platform and reservations book booked all continue to grow significantly. In Q3, reservations on the platform set another quarterly record.\nOver the last few years, we've also ramped up the number of exclusive lifestyle experiences, sponsorships and access to events we offer that appeal to our card members across generations and geographies and reinforce the unique value of membership.\nOur highly popular experiences cut across entertainment, sports, food, art and fashion. They generate strong on-site engagement with our branded activities and offers and they help drive interest among prospects. They also continue to attract world-class partners who work with us to add new ways for our card members and prospects to experience the power of Amex membership.\nEarlier this week, we announced our latest sponsorship, an exclusive multiyear agreement with Formula One to be the official payments partner of Formula One in the Americas. This sponsorship is our first new sports vertical in over 10 years, and it represents a great opportunity to build on the rapidly growing popularity of Formula 1 racing around the world.\nAnother way we're delivering generational relevance is by regularly refreshing and adding value to our products on a global basis. These product enhancements are tailored to the interest and spending patterns of our customers of all age groups in each local market.\nSo far this year, we've made enhancements to over 20 premium products across the company. Some of the latest of which were refreshes of our Platinum Card products in Japan, our business Gold Card in the U.S. and just yesterday, our Hilton co-branded consumer cards. These examples and many others like them are further enriching our membership model, which helps us attract new premium customers, drive retention and deepen engagement with current customers and add more merchants and partners who provide offers and experiences that deliver additional value.\nLooking ahead, I feel very good about where we are and where we're going. We'll continue our strategy of investing for growth and adding more differentiated value to our membership model to deliver generational relevance, while continuing to leverage the strength of our business model, all of which gives us a competitive advantage.\nI'll now hand the call over to Christophe Le Caillec for additional detail on our quarterly results.\n\nChristophe Le Caillec\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to have my first earnings call, be one where we discuss our continued strong momentum, which is reflected in our record revenue and EPS in the third quarter.\nI would like to take a minute at the outset to share my perspective on the company as someone who has been here for a long time and through various business environments. The company is very focused on driving high levels of profitable revenue growth.\nA key enabler of that growth has been the discipline we use to deploy our resources. As a result, the underlying quality of our business is very strong, and I have confidence in the sustainability of the growth drivers that we are seeing.\nWe have accelerated the pace of our revenue and EPS growth since before the pandemic. That acceleration is a direct result of the strategy that underpins our growth plan, which Steve described. In the quarter, that strategy has driven $27 billion more in billings versus last quarter. The company is also generating almost $2 billion more in revenue and about $600 million more in net income compared to a year ago. This demonstrates the earnings power of our business model.\nNow let's take a look at the details of this quarter's performance, starting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Third quarter revenues were $15.4 billion. They reached a record high for the sixth straight quarter and were up 13% year-over-year. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.5 billion and earnings per share of $3.30, which grew 34% year-over-year.\nLet's now go through a more detailed look at the drivers of these results. In our spend-centric business model, that begins with a look at billed business, starting on Slide 3. Total billed business grew $27 billion this quarter versus last year, up 7% on an FX adjusted basis as we continue to see the more stable growth rates than we expected. This growth was driven by 6% growth in Goods & Services spending, consistent with last quarter's growth rate and sustained double-digit growth in Travel and Entertainment spending. This double-digit T&E growth has been driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences, with restaurant spending, our largest category, up 13% this quarter.\nTotal network volumes grew 6% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. As you look at these results, I'd note that we exited a small product last quarter that was reported in our process volumes. This is reflected in the Q3 growth rate. I'd expect to see the impact of the year-over-year growth rate continue for the next few quarters until we lap this exist.\nAs a reminder, process volume includes volumes from cards where we play more of a network role and from alternative payment solutions that we facilitate. The revenue associated with these volumes makes up a small portion of our total revenue, which you can see on Slide 11.\nAs we then break down our spending trends across our businesses, there are a few other key points to take away, starting with our largest segment on Slide 4. U.S. Consumer grew billings strongly at 9% this quarter. Our focus on attracting, engaging and retaining our premium card members is driving growth across all generations and age cohorts. Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment, with their spending up 18% this quarter.\nLooking at Commercial Services on Slide 5. U.S. SME growth came in at 2% this quarter, consistent with last quarter's growth rate. As Steve discussed on our Q2 call, organic growth in this segment has slowed given unique dynamics seen by small businesses over the past few years. Importantly, we do continue to see strong high-quality demand for new accounts within this segment. Looking forward, we focus on continuing to help SME clients run their businesses.\nBillings from our U.S. large and global corporate customers were flat year-over-year. As we have said for many years, these customers are not a major growth driver for our business, but they remain an important foundation for the company's business model.\nAnd lastly, on Slide 6, you see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services. We saw strong growth across our geographies and customer times, spending from international consumers and from international SME and large corporate customers each grew 15%.\nOverall, strength in spending growth from our U.S. consumers and card members outside of the U.S. continues to see -- offset the softness with commercial services that we've been talking about for the past few quarters. Taking everything into account, our spending volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the full year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were generating pre-pandemic.\nNow moving on to loans and card member receivables on Slide 7. We saw year-over-year growth of 15% as well as good continued sequential growth. As our customers continue to rebuild balances, the interest-bearing portion of our loans and receivables balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see. Importantly, over 70% of our revolving loan growth in the U.S. continues to come from our tenured customers.\nAs you then turn to credit and provision on Slide 8 through 10, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show in our best-in-class credit performance. As you can see on Slide 8, our card member loans and receivables, write-offs and delinquency rates both remained fairly flat to last quarter and below pre-pandemic levels. Going forward, as we've talked about for many quarters now, we continue to expect this delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, and they're likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.\nTurning now to the accounting of this credit performance on Slide 9. The quarter-over-quarter royalty in our loan balances, combined with a modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate, resulted in a $321 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.2 billion of provision expense in the third quarter.\nAs you see on Slide 10, we ended the third quarter with $5 billion of reserves, representing 2.7% of our total loans and card member receivables. This reserve rate remained about 20 basis points below the level we had pre-pandemic or day 1 CECL. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit in the balance of the year, similar to the modest increases we've seen over the past few quarters.\nMoving next to revenue on Slide 11. Total revenues were up $1.8 billion or 13% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our largest revenue line discount revenue grew 7% year-over-year in Q3, as you can see on Slide 12, driven by spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 19% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 13.\nThis growth remains very strong and is powered by the continued attractiveness to both new and existing customers of our fee-paying products due to the investment we've made in our premium value propositions. As we expected, growth moderated a bit this quarter from the high levels we saw earlier this year, reflecting our cycle of product refreshes.\nThis quarter, we acquired 2.9 million new cards. Importantly, the acquisition levels you see on Slide 13 remain consistent with our long-term growth aspirations. The spend, revenue and credit profile of our new card members continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic.\nMoving on to Slide 14. You can see that net interest income was up 33% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, driven mostly by the growth in our revolving loan balances. To sum up revenues on Slide 15, we're seeing broad-based revenue momentum across our diversified revenue lines. For 2023, we expect revenue growth to be within the range we communicated in January at around 15% growth for the full year.\nMoving to expenses on Slide 16. Variable customer engagement expenses came in at 40% of total revenues in the third quarter. Therefore, I now expect these costs to run at around 42% of total revenues in the full year -- on the full year basis. Looking forward, we view this cost as a key driver of our momentum as we continue to innovate our value propositions to deepen engagement with our premium card members and to attract new ones, as Steve discussed earlier.\nOn the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the quarter. I still expect to have marketing spend of around $5.5 billion for the full year, fairly flat to our 2022 expense. We feel really good about the quality of our new card acquisitions, which I talked about earlier, and I continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities. Given this strong set of opportunities, I would expect to increase our marketing spend in the balance of this year. And we're confident that our sophisticated acquisition engine will continue to do so in an efficient way.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 16 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.7 billion in the third quarter as we invest in critical areas, such as our talented colleague base and technology. Taking this into account, we now expect our full year operating expenses to be around $14.5 billion. Looking forward, we continue to view marketing and OpEx as a key source of leverage.\nTurning next to capital on Slide 17. We returned $1.7 billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter. This included common stock repurchase of $1.3 billion and $438 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation. As you can see on Slide 17, we target a CET1 ratio between 10% to 11%. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%, which is well above our current regulatory minimum of 7%.\nAs we think about the Basel III proposal, the RWA increase could consume the buffer above regulatory capital requirements if the proposal is adopted as written. Notably, we believe there are clear opportunities for improvements between the proposal and the final rule. In fact, the regulators themselves have post questions about potential issues in applying these rules broadly, and we are actively engaged in that dialogue. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while supporting our balance sheet growth. We do not expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach.\nThat brings me to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on Slide 18. As Steve and I discussed in our third quarter results, our third quarter results reflect a continuation of the strong momentum we've built over the last few years, evidenced by our performance across diversified revenue streams. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of around 15%, consistent with the revenue guidance range we provided at the beginning of the year. As I discussed before, we now expect variable card member engagement expenses to be around 42% of total revenues on a full year basis, modestly below our original expectation.\nOn marketing, we still expect to spend around $5.5 billion for the full year. And lastly, we now expect our operating expenses to be around $14.5 billion this year, modestly above our original expectation as we invest in areas critical to our success.\nTaking everything together, our earnings per share guidance remains between $11 and $11.40. Looking forward, we remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspirations of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of 10 and mid-teen EPS growth in a steady-state macro environment.\nWith that, we'll open up the call for your questions in a moment.\nA final point which relates to our Investor Relations team here at American Express. Steve and I have decided to move Kerri Bernstein to the critical goal of Corporate Treasurer. I'd like to thank Kerri for leading the IR function during a period of strong performance for the company.\nI'd then like to welcome Kartik Ramachandran, our new Head of Investor Relations. Kartik was most recently a key finance lead in our U.S. consumer business and has had a number of finance positions over his 11 years with the company.\nNow let me turn it back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\n\nKerri S. Bernstein\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Christophe. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question. Thank you for your cooperation.\nAnd with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?",

The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All [indiscernible] on our website at ir.americanexpress.com. We'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance.\nAfter that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of strong performance since we announced the growth plan in January of 2020. Revenues of $15 billion grew 12% year-over-year and reached a record high for the fifth straight quarter. Earnings per share of $2.89 is also a quarterly record and is also up 12% over the last year.\nBased on our performance through the first half, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year of delivering revenue growth of 15% to 17% EPS of $11 to $11.40. We also remain focused on achieving our growth plan aspirations of annual revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond in a steady-state macro environment. I continue to feel very good about our ability to achieve these long-term aspirations. Let me tell you why. As I've said on previous calls and at investor conferences, we have a business model that's differentiated from others in the industry which gives us some important advantages. Our business model is built largely around a fee-based premium -- our fee-based premium products, which drive our spend-centric economics and produce a fast-growing stream of subscription-like revenues.\nSpending is the largest contributor of revenues while lending plays a more modest role in our model. This revenue mix is a key differentiator for us. It all starts with our premium customer base, which is built on our trusted brand. We have a global scale that's unmatched in the industry and leadership positions with a diverse range of high-quality customers. We build long-term relationships through our unique membership model, which we constantly evolve to attract new customers and grow with them over time. Our high spending Card Members attract a wider and merchants and business partners, giving our customers and partners even more reasons to stay with us, which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth.\nPartnerships play an important role in our model. We have a long history of partnering with brands who share our values of backing customers with world-class products and services and who value developing broad-based and long-term relationships with us. Hilton is one of those long-standing partnerships. Our relationship started 70 years ago when we opened a travel office at a Hilton hotel in Madrid that grew into a merchant relationship after we began issuing cards. And then became our first co-brand partner in the 90s. The partnership has lasted and grown over time because we evolve together and put our customers at the center of what we do. Today, I'm pleased to announce that we've signed a 10-year extension of our relationship with Hilton which includes continuing as the exclusive co-brand issuer of Hilton consumer and small business cards in the United States as well as extensions of our travel and merchant relationships.\nThis extension builds on the strong foundation we've built over the years with Hilton and gives us a long runway to invest in products and services and [indiscernible] that attract new customers and deepen our relationships with existing ones. It's a great example of the strength of our business model and that it touches virtually all aspects of our business, providing our customers and our partner with exceptional value. Our philosophy of making continuous strategic investments in our business model, is what's driving our growth today, and it's the way we plan to run our business going forward. For our second quarter performance, the power of our differentiated model can be seen in our results. Card Member spending hit another all-time high in the quarter. with U.S. consumers and card members outside the U.S., both up by double digits, which offset some softness in U.S. small business.\nMillennial and Gen Z consumers continue to be the fastest-growing portion of our card member base with U.S. billings up 21% in the quarter. Of particular note, you'll recall that our international card business was our fastest-growing segment for several years prior to the pandemic, and it's again the fastest growing. We continue to see strong growth in travel and entertainment spending, which increased by double digits in the quarter and remains strong across customer categories and geographies. Q2 is a record quarter for restaurant reservations to our [ resi ] platform, and bookings to our consumer travel business reached their highest levels since before the pandemic. We also saw continued strong demand for our premium products in the quarter. With over 70% of the new accounts we acquired on fee-based products and more than 60% of new customer accounts acquired globally are coming from millennials and genes. While a number of new accounts is important, we pay particular attention to the quality and potential revenues they represent. And when you look at the accounts we've acquired over the last year compared to those we acquired over a comparable period pre-pandemic.\nThe overall revenue being generated by these new accounts is up substantially over 2019. Importantly, we continue to be thoughtful about who we grow with and how. And you see that in our results. Our credit metrics remain best-in-class, supported by the premium nature of our underwriting actions we take on an ongoing basis that we've discussed with you on these calls over the last several quarters. Before I turn it over to Jeff, I want to take a couple of minutes to talk about our CFO transition. As we announced last [indiscernible] -- next month, Jeff will be stepping down as our CFO on August 14, at which time, our deputy Control, our Deputy CFO, Christoph Laciak will become CFO of the company. First, I want to recognize Jeff and thank him for his outstanding tenure as our CFO for the past decade. He's been an invaluable partner and friend to me and to American Express throughout his time at the company. Jeff's Insights, strategic acumen and calm focused approach has helped us navigate through numerous challenges, including the unprecedented Covid Pandemic, while strengthening the company's overall financial position and the flexibility of our business model. Jeff is a person of exceptional integrity, and our company is stronger today because of him.\nWhile Jeff will officially be stepping down as CFO in mid-August, he'll be staying on as our Vice Chairman until next March, during which time he will be available to me, Christoph and our Executive Committee as we work on many of the important matters facing the company. Jeff, I speak for all of us at American Express when I say that it's truly been an honor and a pleasure working with you as our CFO these last 10 years. I also want to welcome Christoph who has been a trusted partner to our leadership team and a key contributor to our company's growth for 25 years. As our Deputy CFO, Christophe works closely with our executive in, Jeff and me to drive our financial strategy and performance. Over his tenure, he has served in finance leadership roles across the company. Christoph has gained a deep knowledge of all aspects of our business and his experience and thoughtful analysis play a key role in our strategic decision-making. I'm sure you all enjoy getting to know it.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Jeff for his 85th earnings call as a public company CFO and his 41st and final call as the CFO of American Trust.\n\nJeffrey C. Campbell\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, McKesson Corp.\n\nWell, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our second quarter results, which are tracking with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflects steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations.\nStarting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Our second quarter revenues were $15.1 billion, reaching a record high for the fifth straight quarter, up 13% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $2.2 billion and earnings per share of $2.89, up 12% year-over-year. This does represent a quarterly EPS record for the company and it also reflects the sequential strengthening we expected as we move through the year that I mentioned last quarter. Pretax pre-provision income was $3.9 billion, up 33% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the strong growth momentum in our underlying earnings. So now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, which in our spend-centric business model always begins with a look at volumes, which you see on Slides 3 through 7.\nIn total, you see on Slide 3 that we did reach a new record level for spending on our network this quarter, with total network volumes and build business up 9% and 8% year-over-year, respectively, on an FX-adjusted basis. Of course, I'd remind you that growth rates were particularly elevated last quarter as we lapped the impact of Omicron in the first quarter of the prior year. We are now seeing the more stable rates that we expect are more representative of the kind of growth rates we will see in the balance of the year. Goods and services spending grew 6% overall in the second quarter. We saw good growth in goods and services spending in U.S. consumer and international card services of 8% and 15%, respectively, while this growth rate in U.S. SME did continue to slow down a bit further from last quarter.\nIn contrast, we saw very strong growth in travel and entertainment spending across geographies and customer types, up 14% overall driven by sustained demand for travel and dining experiences. Looking forward, I would expect this growth rate to remain in the double digits through the rest of this year. Turning to our largest segment, U.S. consumer grew billing strongly at 10% this quarter. Millenial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest bill business growth within this segment. with their spending growing 21% year-over-year. You see our highest growth again this quarter in International Card Services with strong growth across both geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumers grew 16%, while spending from international SME and large corporate customers grew 19%.\nThis strength in spending growth from our consumers and card members outside the U.S. offset the continued softness in U.S. SME spending growth that we have been talking about for the past few quarters. Looking at Commercial Services, U.S. SME growth came in at 2% this quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to monitor these spending trends. Our U.S. large and global corporate customers also grew billings 2% in the second quarter, as we've said for many years, these customers, while not a particular growth driver for our business to remain an important foundation for the company's business model. Taking all of this into account, spending volumes are tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre pandemic.\nNow moving on to loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8. We saw good continued sequential growth as well as year-over-year growth of 15%. Year-over-year growth moderated a bit this quarter as we expected, but remains elevated versus pre-pandemic levels. The interest-bearing portion of our loan and receivable balances continues to grow faster than the overall growth you see as our customers continue to rebuild balances. Importantly, the majority of this revolving loan growth in the U.S. continues to come from our high credit quality existing customers. We also included a disclosure this quarter showing that only [ 8% ] of our U.S. Card Member loans and receivables comes from customers with a FICO less than 660.\nAs you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11, this high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our best-in-class credit performance. Our Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Delinquency rates remained flat quarter-over-quarter while write-off rates continue to move up a bit this quarter as we expected, as you can see on Slide 9. Going forward, as we've talked about for many quarters now, we continue to expect these delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, but they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023.\nTurning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10. The quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances was the primary driver of our $327 million for build. Although there was also a small component from incorporating a slightly worse macroeconomic outlook this quarter relative to last quarter. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.2 billion of provision expense in the second quarter. As you see on Slide 11, we ended the second quarter with $4.7 billion of reserves representing 2.6% of our total loans and card member receivables. This reserve remains about 30 basis points below the levels we had pre-pandemic or Day 1 CECL. We continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2023, while also reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio.\nMoving next to revenue on Slide 12. Total revenues were up 13% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Our largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 8% in Q2, as you can see on Slide 13, driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier. Net card fee revenues were up 22% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis as you can see on Slide 14. Growth remains quite strong, and continues to be driven largely by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards and the spend, revenue and credit profiles of these acquisitions continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre pandemic. Importantly, the acquisition trends you see on Slide 14 in this and recent quarters are consistent with our long-term growth aspirations.\nMoving on to Slide 15, you can see that net interest income was up 32% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth in our revolving loan balances. To sum up on revenues on Slide 16, we're seeing broad-based revenue growth across our revenue lines. We're tracking with our expectations. So looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth within our range of 15% to 17% for the full year of 2023. The revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 42% of total revenues in the second quarter and are tracking with our expectation for them to run at around 43% of total revenues on a full year basis.\nOn the marketing line, we invested $1.4 billion in the quarter, on track with our expectation to have full year marketing spend of around $5.5 billion. We remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow slower than revenues while continuing to drive the high-quality [indiscernible] that Steve discussed earlier. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17, brings us to operating expenses which were $3.4 billion in the second quarter, also tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around $14 billion for the full year. This quarter, you see that, as we expected, we have far less growth in OpEx relative to our high level of revenue growth. And looking forward, we continue to see OpEx as a key source of leverage.\nTurning next to capital on Slide 18. We returned $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter, including common stock purchases of $1.1 billion and $446 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation. Now as you know, this is an off-cycle year for Amex as a CCAR bank. Let me briefly remind you of our capital management approach. We generally increased our dividend roughly in line with earnings and target a 20% to 25% payout ratio. And you saw us do that as we increased our dividend by 15% to $0.60 per share last quarter. We target a CET1 ratio between 10% and 11%. we ended the second quarter in the middle of that range at 10.6%. As we think about the potential finalization of Basel III, I'd remind you that our 10% to 11% CET1 target range is actually well above our current regulatory minimum of 7%.\nWe plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth and we don't expect any material near-term changes to our capital management approach, driven by the evolution of these rules. So that then brings us to Slide 19 in the growth plan. To step back for a minute, I joined American Express 10 years ago in 2013 because I was excited about the long-term growth prospects for the company. Today, as I join you from my last earnings call, I'm actually even more excited about those growth prospects. Steve and I first introduced our new multiyear growth aspirations back in January of 2022. And I would point out that Christoph was in the room for every key decision we made as we developed that plan with the senior business leaders across Amex.\nNow in July of 2023, we have consistently achieved the aspirations we set out 6 quarters ago, thanks to the great efforts of our 77,000 colleagues across American Express. So we are reconfirming today, our 2023 full year revenue guidance of 15% to 17% growth with EPS in the range of $11 to $11.40. Our revenue momentum and customer acquisition trends are positioning us well for our growth operations this year in 2024 and beyond. So this momentum, combined with this being my 85th consecutive earnings call across 3 industries without a break makes this a good time for me to transition the CFO role to Christal. With that, I'll ask Christophe to say a few words before Steve and I take your questions.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to continue the strong legacy of performance that Steve and Jeff have delivered. I look forward to spending time with many of you on the call in the coming months. With that, I'll turn the call over back to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.",

After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThanks, Kerri. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our first quarter earnings call. Back in January, we laid out our guidance for 2023 of 15% to 17% revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. Our first quarter results are tracking to this full year guidance. Revenues were a record $14.3 billion in the quarter, up 22%, which is well above our full year expectations. Stronger spending growth outside the U.S. and in T&E offset some softness in U.S. small business spending. EPS came in a bit higher than our original plan expectation. Our plan calls for quarterly EPS to grow sequentially through the year as our revenue growth continues. Billed business was up 16% globally year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis.\nT&E spending was up 39% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis due to the grow over effect -- due to grow over benefit from the impact of the Omicron variant in last year's results. We saw strong demand across all T&E categories and customer types. Spending at restaurants continues to be a bright spot with growth accelerating to 28% on an FX adjusted basis year-over-year. In fact, March was a record month for reservations booked through our Resy platform. The platform now has more than 40 million users globally, an increase of 5 million in the last 6 months. Consumer level demand also remains high with Q1 bookings through our consumer travel business reaching their highest levels since pre-pandemic.\nAs you'll recall, we reorganized our international business last year, bringing together our consumer, small business and large corporate management teams outside the U.S. to increase agility, scale and efficiency and accelerate our growth. Our international issuing businesses were the fastest growing before the pandemic, and we're seeing a return to those trends. International Card Services billings continued to accelerate in the quarter, up 29% on an FX adjusted basis. Results were driven by robust growth in T&E spending, which increased 58% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis.\nWe also saw continued momentum in card acquisitions with 3.4 million new cards acquired in the quarter. U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold Business Platinum and Delta co-brand account acquisitions all reached record levels. Notably, over 70% of the new accounts acquired globally in the quarter are on fee-based products. As we noted for some time, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are driving our growth in billings and acquisitions of premium fee-based products. More than 60% of consumer new accounts acquired globally came from Millennial and Gen Z. These customers also continue to contribute the highest growth in billed business among all age cohorts in the U.S., up 28% in the quarter.\nOn credit, our metrics remain best-in-class, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our strong risk management capabilities and the thoughtful underwriting actions we've taken on an ongoing basis. Our customers have been resilient thus far in the face of slower growth and higher inflation economic environment. While the near-term economic outlook is mixed, our customers' spending and credit performance to date, along with the continued strong demand for our products from high-quality new customers, reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve our long-term aspirations. Our capital, funding and liquidity positions are strong and we continue to have significant flexibility to maintain a strong balance sheet in periods of [ uncertain ] stress.\nAs you know, we run our company for the long-term. We have a strategy in place to deal with swings in the economy, which has enabled us to be successful in navigating through the pandemic, the initial recovery period and the current environment of elevated inflation and higher interest rates. Through it all, we've continued to attract and retain high-quality customers and our strategic investments have resulted in the momentum we've seen throughout last year and into 2023. We feel good about the decisions we're making around growth, risk management and the economic environment. Our key metrics are strong. The market opportunities we see in our core businesses are plentiful. And our strategy of investing in value proposition innovations, customer acquisitions and global merchant coverage continues to drive our growth.\nBased on our performance to date, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering between 15% and 17% revenue growth and earnings per share of between $11 and $11.40. We remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspiration of delivering sustainable revenue growth greater than 10% and 15 bps growth as we get to a more steady-state macro environment. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Campbell\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, McKesson Corp.\n\nWell, thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our first quarter results, which are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year and reflect steady progress against our long-term growth aspirations.\nStarting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Our first quarter revenues were $14.3 billion, reaching a record high for the fourth straight quarter, up 23% on an FX adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported net income of $1.8 billion and earnings per share of $2.40. Given we had a sizable credit reserve release of pandemic-driven reserves in the first quarter of last year, we've also included pretax pre-provision income as the supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pretax pre-provision income was $3.2 billion, up 20% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings.\nSo now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, which in our spend-centric business model always begins with a look at volumes, which you see on Slides 3 through 7. Total network volumes in billed business were both up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Given that most of our spending categories have fully recovered versus pre-pandemic levels, we saw the more stable growth rates we expected this quarter with first quarter billed business growth of 16%, just above last quarter's growth of 15%.\nAs Steve noted earlier, we did see particularly strong growth in Travel and Entertainment spending in Q1 of 39%, driven by continued demand for travel and dining experiences. As expected, this growth rate was elevated early in the quarter as we lapped the impact of Omicron in January of the prior year, so I would expect to see growth moderate moving forward but to remain high given the strong demand we are seeing across geographies, customer types and T&E categories. We also saw solid growth in Goods and Services spending for the quarter, up 9% year-over-year. I would note that we did see this growth rate slow sequentially in the U.S. for both SME and consumer as we went through the quarter.\nSo we are continuing to monitor these spending trends. That said, overall billed business reached a record level in the month of March, and our largest segment, U.S. Consumer, grew billings 16% in the first quarter, accelerating a bit above last quarter's growth. Millennial and Gen Z customers again drove our highest billed business growth within this segment with their spending growing 28% year-over-year this quarter.\nTurning to Commercial Services. We saw a year-over-year growth of 10% overall. U.S. SME growth came in at just 6% this quarter, but was somewhat offset by really good growth in U.S. large and global corporates, up 34% year-over-year. And lastly, you see our highest growth in International Card Services. We are seeing the early benefits of the organizational changes we announced last year start to play out, demonstrated by strong growth across geographies and customer types. Spending from international consumer and international SME and large corporate customers, who were among our fastest-growing pre-pandemic, grew 27% and 34% year-over-year, respectively. International Card Services Travel and Entertainment growth was especially robust at 58% for the quarter. This segment is still in a recovery mode given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments. Overall, our spending volumes are currently tracking to support our revenue guidance for the year and our long-term aspirations for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic.\nNow moving on to Loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8. We saw year-over-year growth of 25% in our loan balances as well as continued sequential growth. This growth continues to come mostly from our existing customers who are rebuilding balances, and as a result, the interest-bearing portion of our loan balances is growing faster than the 25% growth we see in total loans. Specifically, over 70% of this growth in the U.S. is coming from our existing customers. We are pleased with this growth and with the overall lending economics we are generating. That said, looking forward, you may see the growth rate of our loan balances moderate a bit as we progress through 2023, but we would expect it to remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels.\nIf you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11. The high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our best-in-class credit performance. Our card member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, though they did continue to move up this quarter as we expected, which you can see on Slide 9. We view these consolidated write-off and delinquency rates as more comparable to pre-pandemic rates than the individual loans and receivable rates because, as we talked about last quarter, our charge products in many instances now have embedded lending functionality. Going forward, we continue to expect these delinquency and write-off rates to increase over time, but they are likely to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023.\nTurning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10. The expected increases in delinquency rates, combined with the quarter-over-quarter growth in our loan balances, resulted in a $320 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with net write-offs, drove $1.1 billion of provision expense in the first quarter as we move past much of the volatility in this line item that CECL reserve builds releases caused during the pandemic. As you see on Slide 11, we ended the first quarter with $4.4 billion of reserves, representing 2.5% of our total loans and current member receivables. This reserve rate remains about 40 basis points and below the levels we had pre-pandemic or day 1 CECL. We expect this reserve rate to continue to increase as we move through 2023 but to remain below pre-pandemic levels.\nMoving next to revenue on Slide 12. Total revenues were up 22% year-over-year in the first quarter or 23% on an FX adjusted basis. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that service fees and other revenue was up 34% in the quarter driven largely by the year-over-year increases in travel-related revenues that accompanied the tremendous demand we've seen for travel.\nAs you can see on Slide 13, our largest revenue line discount revenue grew 17% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX-adjusted basis, which, similar to spending volumes growth, is just above last quarter's growth rate. Net card fee revenues were up 23% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 14. Growth, which did moderate slightly this quarter as expected from the extremely high level we saw last quarter, remains quite strong. This growth continued driven largely by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions. This quarter, we acquired 3.4 million new cards demonstrating the demand we're seeing, especially for our premium fee-based products.\nMoving on to Slide 15. You can see that net interest income was up 36% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis accelerating versus last quarter, primarily due to the growth in our revolving loan balances. I'd also note that net yield on our Card Member loans increased 50 basis points sequentially, reaching pre-pandemic levels this quarter as our customers increase their revolving balances. We have been able to increase our net yield while maintaining net write-off rates below pre-pandemic levels, expanding our net credit margin.\nTo sum up on revenues on Slide 16. We're tracking well against our expectations. And looking forward, we still expect to see revenue growth of 15% to 17% for the full year 2023.\nThe revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made. Those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in at 43% of total revenues in the first quarter, tracking right with our expectation for them to run around 43% of total revenues on a [ full year ] basis. On the marketing line, we invested $1.3 billion in the quarter, on track with our expectation to a marketing spend that is fairly flat to our full year 2022 expense of $5.5 billion. We remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenues, as we did for many years prior to the pandemic.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.6 billion in the first quarter. There's usually some quarterly volatility in this number. In this quarter, for example, we saw a $95 million impact from net mark-to-market losses on our Amex Ventures investment portfolio. But you can see, based off of our first quarter results that similar to marketing, we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around $14 billion for the full year. We continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage, and moving forward, expect to have far less growth in OpEx relative to our high level of revenue growth.\nTurning next to capital on Slide 18. We ended the first quarter with our CET1 ratio at 10.6% with our target range of 10% to 11%. I would note that AOCI already flows through our regulatory capital today. So any unrealized gains or losses on our investment portfolio are fully reflected in the 10.6% that I just quoted. I'd also point out that we hold only $4 billion of investment securities, most of which are short-dated U.S. treasuries. In the first quarter, we returned $600 million of capital to our shareholders. With our strong capital position, we have both the capacity and the intent to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth.\nI'd also note that our liquidity position remains extremely strong as we ended the quarter with $41 billion of cash, our highest ever balance, excluding the pandemic period. We also saw a 10% increase in our deposits this quarter, including the inflows in the weeks following recent volatility in the banking sector.\nOn Slide 25 of the appendix. We have provided a bit more detail on deposits than we typically do, if you'd like to look at some of the numbers.\nThat brings me then to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on Slide 19. For the full year 2023, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 15% to 17% and earnings per share between $11 and $11.40. At this level, year-over-year revenue growth, we expect to see a significant sequential increase in the amount of revenues as we go through the year. In contrast, our marketing and operating expenses were already more in line with the run rate for the year in the first quarter, but there's always some quarter-to-quarter volatility. So the simple math then gets you to the sequential growth in our underlying earnings, consistent with our full year EPS guidance.\nThere is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment. But as Steve discussed, our customers have remained resilient thus far in the face of the slower growth, higher inflation economic environment. Our outlook is based on the blue chip macroeconomic consensus which continues to expect slowing growth, though not a significant recession. In any environment, though, we are focused on running the company for the long-term. Looking forward, we remain committed to focusing on achieving our aspiration of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth as we get to a more steady-state environment.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\n\nKerri Bernstein\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Jeff. And before we open up the lines for Q&A, [Operator Instructions]. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?",

Welcome to the American Express Q4 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Kerri Bernstein. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nKerri Bernstein\n\nThank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call. As a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC.\nThe discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.\nWe'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results and then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance.\nAfter that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jack. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThanks, Kerri. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. It's great to be with you to talk about our 2022 results and our outlook for 2023. As I go through our results, I'll tell you why they strengthen my confidence in our plan to generate strong growth over the long term. A year ago, we introduced our growth plan, which provided a road map for delivering annual growth rates for revenue and earnings per share at levels that are higher than the strong growth rates we were delivering before the pandemic.\nOur results over the last 4 quarters demonstrate that our strategy is clearly working. We exceeded the full year guidance we laid out in our growth plan for both revenues and EPS, and we did so against the mixed economic environment. Revenues, which reached all highs for both the quarter and the year were up 25% for the full year, exceeding the 18% to 20% guidance we started the year with. An earnings per share of $9.85 was well above our guidance of $9.25 to $9.65. The momentum we saw through the year in Card Member spending, engagement and retention continued in the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter billed business reached a record quarterly high of $357 billion and was up 25% for the full year demonstrating our continued ability to acquire, engage and retain high spending premium card members. Customer retention and satisfaction remained very strong. In addition to strong internal metrics, we were recognized once again by our customers for providing industry best products and services, ranking #1 in customer satisfaction in both the 2022 J.D. Power U.S. Consumer Credit Card Study and the U.S. Small Business Card Study.\nThe investments we've made in our value propositions continue to attract large numbers of new premium customers. We acquired 3 million new card members in the fourth quarter, even as we increased our already high credit thresholds through the year. For the full year, new card acquisitions reached a record level, growing to 12.5 million and nearly 70% of our new accounts acquired are on our fee-based products.\nMillennial and Gen Z customers continue to be the largest drivers of our growth, representing over 60% of proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter and for the full year. Credit metrics remained strong, supported by the premium nature of our customer base, our exceptional risk management capabilities and the thoughtful risk actions we've taken for the year.\nLooking ahead to 2023 and beyond, let me tell you why these results increase my confidence that we're positioned to deliver on our growth plan aspirations. First, we're in a great business. We operate in the most attractive segments and geographies of the fast-growing payment space. As highlighted by our leadership positions with premium consumers, including Millennials and Gen Zers, small- and medium-sized businesses, as well as serving the largest corporations in the world. We bring to this space a number of advantages that are very difficult for our competitors to replicate.\nThese include our brand, our unique membership model, a premium global customer base and an integrated payments model. Forming the foundation of these advantages is our talented, dedicated colleagues who deliver unparalleled service to our customers. Put together, the marketplace opportunities we see and the competitive advantages we can leverage create a long runway for growth.\nWe intend to capture these opportunities and build on our momentum by continuing to invest at high levels in several key areas, continuously innovating our consumer and SME products, refining our powerful marketing and risk management engines and capturing our fair share of lending. Growing merchant acceptance with a particular focus outside the U.S. and expanding partnerships to drive customer value across the enterprise, continuing to introduce new digital capabilities that deliver seamless, intuitive customer experiences in their channels of choice, and expanding into adjacencies that reinforce our core, such as new lifestyle and financial services for consumers and SMEs, which adds more value to our membership model.\nAll this investment happens while continually focused on gaining efficiencies in our marketing and operating expenses. As we've demonstrated consistently over the past 2 years, executing this investment strategy builds scale, which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth, that starts with a high spending, highly engaged premium customer base.\nThese premium customers attract a growing network of merchants and partners who add more value to our membership model, which in turn enables us to attract more premium customers who attract more merchants and partners, which creates more scale. This scale enables us to generate more investment and operating efficiencies in our membership model making it more difficult for our competitors to catch up.\nSo what does this mean for 2023? Our plan for this year is built on continuing our investment strategy in the areas I mentioned, while factoring in the blue-chip economic consensus of slowing macroeconomic growth. And as always, we have plans in place to pivot should the economic environment change dramatically.\nThis translates into 2023 guidance consistent with what we originally laid out in our growth plan last year. Specifically, we expect revenue growth of 15% to 17%, which is higher than our long-term growth plan aspirations and EPS of $11 to $11.40. In addition, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to $0.60 a share, up from $0.52 beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration.\nTo sum up, our 2022 performance shows that our strategy is working. And based on our performance to date and what we see for 2023, I'm even more confident in our ability to achieve our aspirations for double-digit annual revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond.\nI'll now turn it over to Jeff to provide more detail about our performance. As always, we'll have a Q&A session after Jeff's remarks.\n\nJeffrey C. Campbell\n\nVice Chairman & CFO, American Express Company\n\nWell, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's good to be here to talk about our '22 results, which reflects steady progress against our multiyear growth plan that we announced last January and also to talk about what our 2022 results mean for 2023. I'll also spend some of our time this morning focusing on our full year trends since it is year-end, and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we actually run the company.\nStarting with our summary of financials on Slide 2. Full year revenues reached an all-time high of $52.9 billion, up 27% on an FX-adjusted basis. Notably, our fourth quarter revenues of $14.1 billion also reached a record high for the third straight quarter and grew 19% on an FX-adjusted basis. This revenue momentum drove reported full year net income of $7.5 billion and earnings per share of $9.85.\nFor the quarter, we reported net income of $1.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.07, which did include a $234 million impact from our net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio. As I've said throughout the year, year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the sizable credit reserve releases we had in 2021.\nBecause of these prior year reserve releases, we have also included pretax pre-provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pretax, pre-provision income was $11.8 billion for the full year and $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, up 27% and 23%, respectively, versus the prior year, reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings.\nSo now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, beginning with volumes, starting on Slide 3. We saw good quarter-over-quarter growth in volumes. I would note that we reached record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full year 2022. Total network volumes and billed business were up 16% and 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% and 25% for the full year, all on an FX-adjusted basis.\nNow of course, growth rates for quarters earlier in the year included more of a recovery on the lower levels of volumes in 2021. And we are now to the point where we have lapped the majority of this recovery. We are pleased with this growth and the fact that it is being driven across customer types and geographies.\nOn Slides 4 through 7, we've given you a variety of views across our U.S. Consumer Services, Commercial Services and International Card Services segments and the various customer types within each. There's a few key points I suggest you take away from these various perspectives.\nStarting with our largest segment, U.S. consumer billings grew 15% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumers. Our focus on attracting, engaging and retaining younger cohorts of card members through our value propositions, drove the 30% growth in spending from our Millennial and Gen Z customers on Slide 5, and who you can now see make up 30% of spend within the segment.\nTurning to Commercial Services. You see that spending from our U.S. small and medium-sized enterprise customers represents the majority of our billings in the segment, supported by our strategic focus on expanding our range of products to help our SME clients run their businesses.\nWe saw another quarter of solid growth in U.S. SME, though you can see that it was the slowest growing customer type this quarter, up 8% year-over-year. As you heard Steve talk about a bit last month at an investor conference, our SMEs have recently started to slow down spending in service categories such as digital advertising, so we continue to monitor spending trends.\nMoving to our U.S. Large and Global Corporate customers, the one small customer type that has not come back to pre-pandemic spend levels, they did continue, though their steady recovery this quarter with overall billings now 11% below pre-pandemic levels. And lastly, you see our highest growth in International Card Services, as this segment is now in a steep recovery mode given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments.\nSpending from International Consumer and International SME and Large Corporate customers grew 23% and 32% year-over-year, respectively, in Q4. Across all customer types, T&E spending momentum remained particularly strong in the fourth quarter. While we also saw a nice sequential growth in the amount of goods and services spending versus last quarter, there were a few pockets that slowed, such as the digital advertising spend in SME, that I mentioned earlier.\nSo what do all of these takeaways mean for 2023? At this point, on a dollar basis, most of our spending categories have fully recovered. So I would expect more stable growth rates this year across spending categories with the exception that year-over-year growth rates for T&E spending will likely be elevated in Q1 as we lap the impact of Omicron from the prior year.\nImportantly, all of the things that Steve just talked about that make up the strategy underlying our growth plan, have created a foundation for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing pre-pandemic.\nNow moving on to Loans and Card Member receivables on Slide 8, we saw a year-over-year growth of 24% in our loan balances as well as good sequential growth. This loan growth is now exceeding our spend growth as customers steadily rebuild their balances. Given that volumes, of course, have now lapped, there's a steep phase of recovery. We do expect the growth rate of our loan balances to moderate as we progress through 2023, but to remain elevated versus pre-pandemic levels.\nThe interest-bearing portion of our loan balances, which surpassed 2019 levels last quarter also continues to consistently rebuild with over 70% of year-over-year growth in the U.S. coming from our existing customers, which is about 10 percentage points more than what we saw in the years leading up to the pandemic.\nAs you then turn to credit and provision on Slides 9 through 11, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain below pre-pandemic levels.\nSo they did continue to pick up this quarter as we expected, which you can see on Slide 9. Going forward, we expect delinquency and write-off rates to continue to move up over time, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2023, for card member loans.\nTurning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10. And for this year-end, because the pandemic has clearly impacted the timing of quarterly reserve build and release adjustments across the industry, I think it's helpful to look at our full year provision results. Full year 2022 provision expense was $2.2 billion, which included a $617 million reserve build, primarily driven by loan growth, the continued steady and expected increase in delinquency rates and changes in the macroeconomic outlook as the year progressed.\nThe $2.2 billion number is, of course, still unusually low by historical standards relative to the size of our loan balances and card member receivables. Of the full year $617 million reserve build, we saw $492 million of it in the fourth quarter. Since earlier this year, we were still releasing a significant amount of the credit reserves we had built to capture the uncertainty of the pandemic. At this point, we no longer have any of these pandemic-driven reserves remaining on our balance sheet.\nMoving to reserves on Slide 11. You can see that we ended 2022 with $4 billion of reserves, representing 2.4% of our total loans and card member receivables. This reserve rate is about 50 basis points below the levels we had pre-pandemic or day 1 CECL reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio and the strong credit performance we have seen. We view this consolidated reserve rate as more comparable to day 1 CECL than the individual loans and receivables rates. Because as we talked a bit last quarter, our charge products in many instances now have some embedded lending functionality.\nWe expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through 2023, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels. Taking all of this into account, in 2023, you should expect to see provision expense move back towards more of a steady state relative to the size of our loan balances and Card Member receivables for the first time since we adopted CECL in early 2020.\nGiven the combination of our strong loan growth and the unusually low level by historical standards of provision expense in 2022, I would expect a significant year-over-year increase in provision expense.\nMoving next to revenue on Slide 12. Total revenues were up 17% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and up 25% for the full year. This is well above our original expectations, driven by the successful execution of our strategy and is part of which strengthens our confidence in our long-term aspirations.\nBefore I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that you see a 200-basis point spread between our FX-adjusted revenue growth and reported revenue growth for this quarter. While this is less of an impact from the strong dollar than what we saw in the prior quarter, it does remain a modest headwind.\nOur largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 16% year-over-year in Q4 and 27% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 13. This growth is primarily driven by the momentum seen in our spending volumes throughout 2022. Net card fee revenues continued to accelerate throughout this year, up 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 21% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 14.\nIn 2023, I expect net card fees to be our fastest-growing revenue line. I would expect growth to moderate from the extremely high level we saw this quarter. This steady growth is powered by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products due to the investments we've made in our premium value propositions, as Steve discussed earlier, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold Card members and U.S. Business Platinum Card members, all reaching record highs in 2022.\nMoving on to Slide 15. You can see that net interest income was up 32% year-over-year in Q4 and 28% for the year on an FX-adjusted basis due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances. The rising interest rate environment has had a fairly neutral impact on our results in '22, as deposit betas lagged the rapid and steep benchmark rate increases during the year. However, when you think about 2023, deposit betas are now in line with more historical levels.\nSo I would expect the year-over-year impact from rising rates to represent more of a headwind in 2023. To sum up on revenues, we're seeing strong results across the board and really good momentum. Looking forward into 2023, we expect to see revenue growth of 15% to 17%.\nNow all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made in those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs, as you see on Slide 17, came in at 42% total revenues for the fourth quarter and 41% for the full year.\nBased off the Q4 exit rate, combined with our continued focus on investing to innovate our products, I'd expect variable customer engagement cost to approach 43% of total revenues in 2023. On the marketing line, we invested around $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.5 billion in the full year. As a reminder, our marketing dollars mostly represent the things we do to directly drive the great customer acquisition results we are seeing.\nAs we look forward, we remain focused on driving efficiency so that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenues, as we did for many years prior to the pandemic. As a result, in 2023, we expect to have marketing spend that is fairly flat to 2022. Moving to the bottom of Slide 17, brings us to operating expenses, which were $4.1 billion in the fourth quarter and $13.7 billion for full year '22.\nIn understanding our OpEx results, it's important to note the net mark-to-market impact to our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio that I mentioned earlier with reference to Q4, these gains and losses are reported in the OpEx line and totaled $302 million in losses for full year 2022, while in the prior year, we had a $767 million benefit in net gains. Even putting this aside, as Steve and I have discussed all year, our 2022 operating expenses do represent a step function increase compared to prior years, as we have invested in key underpinnings to support our revenue growth and this inflation has had some impact on our expenses.\nMoving forward, similar to marketing, we are focused on gaining efficiencies and getting back to the low levels of growth in OpEx that we have historically seen. For 2023, we expect operating expenses to be around $14 billion and see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to the high level of revenue growth in our growth plan.\nLast, our effective tax rate for full year 2022 was around 22%, our best estimate of the effective tax rate in 2023 is between 23% to 24%, absent any legislative changes.\nTurning next to capital, on Slide 18. We returned $4.9 billion in capital to our shareholders in 2022, including $1 billion in the fourth quarter with $639 million of common stock repurchases and $389 million in common stock dividends, all on the back of strong earnings generation.\nWe ended the year with our CET1 ratio at 10.3% within our target range of 10% to 11%. In Q1 '23, as Steve discussed, we do expect to increase our dividend by 15%, to $0.60 per quarter, consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings and our 20% to 25% target payout ratio. We'll continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth going forward.\nThat then brings me to our growth plan and 2023 guidance on Slide 19. 2022 was a strong year, where we exceeded our full year guidance that we laid out in our growth plan last January for both the revenues and EPS. These results have strengthened our confidence in our 2023 guidance. First and most importantly, we expect the strategies that Steve laid out earlier to deliver continued high levels of revenue growth, leading to our revenue growth guidance for 2023 of 15% to 17% and setting us up well for 2024 and beyond.\nAs you think about the drivers of EPS growth in 2023, first, we expect to return to the low levels of growth we have historically driven in our marketing and operating expenses producing some nice leverage. Going the other direction, the 2 notable headwinds that should be just 2023 challenges are around the year-over-year impacts of provision and of interest rates, as I discussed earlier.\nCombining all of these factors together, it leads to our EPS guidance of $11 to $11.40 for 2023. There is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment. But as Steve discussed, our 2023 guidance factors in the blue-chip macroeconomic consensus, which is for slowing growth though not a significant recession. I'd also say that our guidance is based on what we are actually seeing in terms of behavior from our customers around the globe.\nAnd of course, it reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. We feel good about the momentum we see in our business and in any environment. Remain committed to running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond as we get to a more steady-state macro environment.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.",

Welcome to the American Express Q3 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Kerri Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nKerri Bernstein\n\nThank you, Darryl, and thank you all for joining today's call.\nAs a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC.\nThe discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.\nWe'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThanks, Kerri, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call.\nAs you saw in our release this morning, we had another strong quarter. Revenues grew 27% on an FX-adjusted basis and earnings per share was $2.47, up 9% over last year. Our investments to drive customer engagement, acquisitions and retention once again generated great results, and our credit quality remained strong.\nCard Member spending remained at near record levels in the quarter. Billed business was up 24% on an FX-adjusted basis over the record growth we delivered a year earlier, led by the continued strength in Goods & Services spending and the ongoing strong rebound in Travel & Entertainment. As we said earlier this year, we expected the recovery in travel spending to be a tailwind for us, but the strength of the rebound has exceeded our expectations throughout the year.\nIn the quarter, total T&E spending was up 57% from a year earlier on an FX-adjusted basis, driven by the continued strong demand from consumers and small business customers. Particularly noteworthy is the strength we're seeing in T&E spending in our international markets, which exceeded pre-pandemic levels for the first time this quarter on an FX-adjusted basis. Business travel also continued to recover and overall activity remained strong through September.\nImportantly, we're seeing increased customer engagement with a wide range of travel and dining benefits and services we offer as part of our membership model. For example, bookings to our consumer travel business reached their highest level since before the pandemic in the third quarter. And in dining, our Resy reservation platform continues to see strong growth. Since we acquired the platform in 2019, Resy users have tripled to reach 35 million, and we quadrupled a number of restaurants available around the world on Resy.\nGoods & Services spending grew 16% year-over-year. The continued growth in Goods & Services is supported by the structural shift to online commerce that was accelerated by the pandemic and has been sustained since then (inaudible) the new online and mobile-oriented benefits we added to our value propositions. These benefits are particularly attractive to our millennial and Gen Z customer base, which is our fastest-growing customer cohort.\nThe investments we've made in our value propositions are also continuing to drive momentum in new card acquisitions. We added 3.3 million new proprietary cards during the quarter, our highest quarterly level of acquisitions since the pandemic began.\nAnd we continue to see strong uptake of our premium fee-based products with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold cards as well as U.S. Business Platinum cards reaching record quarterly highs. millennial and Gen Z customers are powering this growth, comprising more than 60% of our proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter.\nAs we sit here today, we see no changes in the spending behaviors of our customers, and our credit metrics continue to be strong, with delinquencies and write-offs remaining at low levels even as loan balances are steadily rebuilding. Of course, we are mindful of the mixed signals in the broader economy. As always, we have plans in place to pivot should the operating environment change dramatically. And we've been taking thoughtful risk management actions to be prepared in the event of a downturn.\nBut as I've emphasized many times before, we run the company for the long term and make through-the-cycle investment decisions. Our strong third quarter results show that our strategy investing in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage continues to pay off, and our performance is consistent with our long-term growth aspirations.\nLooking ahead, we continue to see many great growth opportunities, and we will continue to take actions to best position our business for the long term. As you will recall, our international businesses were among the fastest-growing prior to the pandemic. As more countries relax their cross-border travel policies and life returns to normal, we see tremendous opportunities for growth in key regions despite ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties.\nTo that point, we made an organizational change a few months ago to help seize on these opportunities. We brought together our international consumer, small business and large corporate management teams under one leader, which will increase our speed, agility scale and efficiency in our operations outside the U.S. As a result, you'll see this quarter we've introduced a new International Card Services reporting segment.\nLooking ahead, we remain confident that the successful execution of our strategy, driven by our outstanding leadership team and the talented colleagues throughout the company, positions us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond.\nBased on our performance through the third quarter, we also remain confident in our full year revenue growth guidance of 23% to 25%, and we expect to be above our original full year EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to provide a detailed overview of our Q3 results.\n\nJeffrey C. Campbell\n\nVice Chairman & CFO, American Express Company\n\nWell, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here to talk about our third quarter results, which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan.\nStarting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Most importantly, our third quarter revenues were $13.6 billion, reaching a record high in a second quarter in a row, up 27% on an FX-adjusted basis. Now I would point out that we continue to see a much stronger U.S. dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which we operate. So you do see a 300 basis point spread between our FX-adjusted revenue growth of 27% and our reported revenue growth of 24% as we absorb some significant foreign exchange headwinds.\nOf course, the overall impact on our earnings, still a headwind, is less significant because we do have some offsetting positive impacts on the expense side. Our revenue performance in the third quarter drove reported net income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.47, representing EPS growth of 9% year-over-year, a great result considering the sizable credit reserve releases we had in the third quarter last year.\nBecause of these prior year reserve releases, we have also included pretax provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter. On this basis, pretax provision income was $3.2 billion, up 43% versus the same time period last year, reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings.\nBefore getting into a more detailed look at results, let me spend just a minute briefly explaining how we've evolved our financial reporting for the organizational changes that Steve discussed earlier. You will see in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release that, beginning this quarter, we have moved from 3 to 4 reportable operating segments.\nWe first took Global Consumer Services and split the U.S. into its own segment, creating U.S. Consumer Services. We then combined the international consumer business with the international portion of small- and medium-sized enterprises and large corporate, creating the new International Card Services segment. Commercial Services, that includes U.S. SME, U.S. large corporate and select global corporate clients.\nAnd lastly, our Global Merchant and Network Services segment remains largely unchanged and, as always, includes our global payments network and network partnerships. You will see in the appendix of our disclosures that we have recast prior periods to conform to these new operating segments. The new segments will also be reflected in our third quarter Form 10-Q.\nNow let's get into our results, beginning with overall volumes. Looking at Slides 3 and 4, you can see the continued strength in our Card Member spending behavior that Steve noted earlier. Total network volumes and billed business were each up year-over-year at 23% and 24%, respectively, on an FX-adjusted basis in the third quarter. If you were to compare to 2019, third quarter billed business grew 30%, accelerating above last quarter's growth rate of 28% relative to 2019.\nAnd importantly, despite the uncertainties in the current economic environment, our spending trends with performance relative to 2019 strengthened as we went through the quarter. We are really pleased with this growth. And the fact, you see strong growth across all customer types and geographies, driven by both sustained growth in Goods & Services spending and continued T&E momentum.\nOn Slides 5 through 8, we've given you a variety of views of this strong growth across our U.S. Consumer Services, Commercial Services and International Card Services segments, and the various customer types within each.\nStarting with our largest segment, billings from our U.S. consumer customers grew at 22% in the third quarter, reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium U.S. consumers. Millennial and Gen Z customers, again, drove our highest billed business growth within this segment, with their spending growing 39% year-over-year this quarter.\nTurning to Commercial Services. You see that spending from our U.S. SME customers represents the majority of our billings in this segment, and that spending from these customers continued its strong growth, up 17% in the third quarter.\nOur U.S. large and global corporate customers, though a smaller part of billings in the segment, remain an important foundation for the entire company. And these customers continued their steady travel recovery this quarter, though overall billings are still 13% below pre-pandemic levels. We do continue to expect, though, that this group will fully recover over time.\nAnd lastly, international consumer and international SME large corporate customers within the new International Card Services segment were amongst our fastest growing pre-pandemic, as Steve said, and are now in a steep recovery mode. You can see our high levels of growth in Q3 at 34% and 43% year-over-year, respectively.\nAnd if you were also to look at international consumer growth by age cohort, you would see, similar to the U.S., that the highest growth levels are from our millennial and Gen Z customers, who make up an even larger portion of overall billings than they do in the U.S.\nOne other note on overall billings. The majority of our high level of growth this quarter was again driven by the number of transactions flowing through our network, with some modest impact from inflation. Overall, then, we are pleased with the momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in line with our expectations for both the year and for our long-term aspirations.\nNow moving to loan balances. On Slide 9, we saw year-over-year growth accelerate to 31% in our loan balances as well as good sequential growth. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to consistently increase quarter-over-quarter, surpassing 2019 levels in the third quarter as customers steadily rebuild balances.\nAs you then turn to credit and provisions, on Slides 10 through 12, the high credit quality of our customer base continued to show through in our strong credit performance. Write-off rates for Card Member loans remain well below pre-pandemic levels, flat to where they have been for the last 3 quarters, as you can see on Slide 10. As expected, you do now see that delinquency rates for loans have started to modestly pick up, but also remain well below pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning now to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 11. As you know, there are 2 components to our provision expense: our actual write-off performance in the quarter, which, as we just discussed, remains strong; and second, changes in our credit reserves, where there are a few key drivers.\nOur loan balances, especially our revolving loan balances, grew strongly quarter-over-quarter. And the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our models, which was informed by third-party macroeconomic forecast as well as the latest Fed outlook, was slightly worse this quarter relative to last quarter. The combination of our strong loan growth and the updated macroeconomic assumptions resulted in a $387 million reserve build. This reserve build, combined with low net write-offs, drove $778 million of provision expense for the third quarter.\nAs you see on Slide 12, we ended the third quarter with $3.5 billion of reserves, with reserves for loans representing 3.2% of our balances. I would point out, even with this quarter's reserve build, this remains well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic, driven by our improved portfolio quality today compared to that prior time period.\nGoing forward, we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time, but to remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. I do expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet and where we ended this quarter, given our expected loan growth, the overall level of reserve adjustments will again be influenced by how the macroeconomic (inaudible) evolves in the fourth quarter.\nMoving next to revenue on Slide 13. Total revenues were up 24% year-over-year in the third quarter or 27% on an FX-adjusted basis. Before I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that service fees and other revenue was up 39% year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was largely driven by a recovery in travel-related revenues.\nOur [last] revenue line, discount revenue, grew 26% year-over-year in Q3 on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 14, driven by both our sustained growth in Goods & Services spending and the continued momentum in T&E spending that you saw in our spending trends.\nNet card fee revenues were up 23% year-over-year in the third quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth continuing to accelerate, as you can see on Slide 15, largely driven by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products through the investments we've made in our premium value propositions. This quarter, we acquired 3.3 million new cards, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold Card members and U.S. Business Platinum Card members all reaching record highs in the quarter and now each more than 2x higher than pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating the great demand we're seeing, especially for our premium fee-based products.\nMoving on to Slide 16. You can see that net interest income was up 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances. While, generally speaking, a rising rate environment would be a modest headwind for us due to our sizable noninterest-bearing charge balances, an actual fact, it has been fairly neutral in terms of impact for us year-to-date. Over time, though, I would expect rising rates to represent a modest headwind.\nTo sum up on revenues, we're seeing strong results across the board and really good momentum. When looking at Slide 17, I would point out that we have now seen 6 consecutive quarters of revenue growth above 24% on an FX-adjusted basis as we are now showing strong growth even on top of the strong recovery-led growth in the prior year quarter.\nI would also point out that we have a couple hundred basis points of difference when looking at revenue growth on an FX-adjusted basis versus our reported results. So while we are leaving our full year reported revenue guidance at 23% to 25% for 2022, I would expect to be above that growth rate range on an FX-adjusted basis.\nNow all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 18. Starting with variable customer engagement costs, these costs, as you see on Slide 18, came in at 41% total revenues for the third quarter, roughly in line with what I still expect variable customer engagement costs to run for the full year at around 42% total revenues.\nOn the marketing line, we invested $1.5 billion in the third quarter, on track with our expectation to spend over $5 billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong demand for card acquisitions, especially premium card acquisitions, as we showed on Slide 15. And more importantly, we feel good about the spend, credit and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing into American Express membership, which continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 18 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.3 billion in the third quarter, essentially flat to last quarter. As Steve and I have both discussed all year, these results reflect the impact inflation has had on our operating expenses, in addition to our investments in other key growth underpinnings to support our tremendous revenue growth.\nYou can see, based off our third quarter results, that we are tracking with our expectation for operating expenses to be around $13 billion for the full year. And looking at the year-over-year OpEx growth of 22% this quarter, it is also important to note that we see an impact from the prior year, including a sizable benefit from net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio, while this year, we saw a modest impairment charge. More generally, we continue to see operating expenses as a key source of leverage moving forward, and we'd expect to have far less growth in OpEx than revenues in our ambitious growth plan.\nTurning next to capital on Slide 19. We returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in the third quarter, including common stock repurchases of $600 million and $391 million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6% at the end of the third quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while supporting our balance sheet growth.\nThat then brings me to our growth plan and 2022 guidance on Slide 20. With each quarter of this year, we have demonstrated consistent progress against our 2022 guidance and our long-term growth aspirations of delivering sustainable high levels of revenue and EPS growth.\nFor the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our reported revenue growth guidance of 23% to 25%, although, I would point out, as I said earlier, that I would expect our FX-adjusted revenue growth to be above that range. And we now expect to be above our original EPS guidance range of $9.25 to $9.65.\nAn uncertainty in the level of our final EPS for the year remains the possible impact on credit reserves and how the macroeconomic outlook evolves in the fourth quarter. While I expect our actual credit performance and metrics to remain healthy, it's harder to predict exactly how the macroeconomic outlook might evolve. In addition, we are working towards our 2023 plan and expect revenue growth to remain above our long-term aspirational targets, which should create a platform for producing strong EPS growth.\nOf course, we'll have to see how the economic environment evolves versus where we are today. In any environment, though, we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\n\nKerri Bernstein\n\nThank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just 1 question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?",

Welcome to the American Express Q2 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Head of Investor Relations, Ms. Kerri Bernstein. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nKerri Bernstein\n\nThank you, Donna, and thank you all for joining today's call.\nAs a reminder, before we begin, today's discussion contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future business and financial performance. These are based on management's current expectations, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements are included in today's presentation slides and in our reports on file with the SEC.\nThe discussion today also contains non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this quarter's earnings materials as well as the earnings materials for the prior periods we discussed. All of these are posted on our website at ir.americanexpress.com.\nWe'll begin today with Steve Squeri, Chairman and CEO, who will start with some remarks about the company's progress and results. And then Jeff Campbell, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a more detailed review of our financial performance. After that, we'll move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff. With that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThanks, Kerri, and welcome to the IR team and your first earnings call. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our second quarter call.\nWe had an outstanding quarter. Revenues were up 31%, reaching a record high, and earnings per share were $2.57. Card member spending was at record levels. Billed business was up 30% from a year earlier on an FX-adjusted basis, led by a vigorous rebound in Travel & Entertainment spending and continued strong growth in Goods & Services. We added 3.2 million new proprietary cards in the quarter, driven by continued strong demand for our fee-based premium products. Acquisitions of our U.S. Consumer Platinum, Gold and Delta co-brand Cards were all at record highs. Customer retention and credit quality both remain at exceptionally strong levels.\nWhile our strong growth may be somewhat surprising given the uncertainties in the external environment, there are a number of reasons for our continued momentum. First, the decisions we made through the pandemic continue to pay dividends. At the outset, we made it a priority to be there for our customers, focusing on delivering great service, providing financial relief programs, expanding our Shop Small initiatives, and injecting new value into our premium consumer and business products with benefits that were relevant for the times. We then ramped up investments early in the recovery to rebuild our momentum and grow our customer base, refreshing our premium products through a series of new benefits that enhanced our generational relevance. And we accelerated our acquisition engine. These decisions lay the foundation for the strength in customer retention, engagement and acquisitions that you've seen over the past year and our results today.\nOther key factors driving our performance include the many competitive advantages that we have that differentiate us, as well as several structural shifts, some near-term recovery tailwinds, which you remember we discussed at our Investor Day.\nA critical competitive advantage is our global premium customer base, which is, at scale, unrivaled in the industry, with millions of high-spending super prime, loyal consumer and business customers across generations and geographies. Importantly, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are a large part of our existing customer base and our fastest-growing age cohort, making up 60% of all new consumer card members we're acquiring and around 75% of new U.S. consumer Platinum and Gold Card members. Our new customers have excellent credit profiles, are highly engaged in the premium benefits that come with American Express membership, and are spending more from the start of their relationship with us than previous newcomers, giving us a long runway for growth. In fact, spending by this age group grew 48% in the second quarter, significantly outpacing other generations.\nOur momentum is also being aided by several structural shifts, which we believe give us significant opportunities to sustain our growth across all lines of business over the longer term. These include the growth in the premium consumer card space around the world, the ongoing increase in online commerce and digital engagement among consumers, the strong pace of small business creation and the acceleration in the digitization -- digitizing of commercial payments.\nFinally, in the near term, we're benefiting from recovery tailwinds in our businesses outside the U.S., in the large and global corporate space and in Travel & Entertainment. The travel rebound in particular has been faster and stronger than anyone expected. Total T&E spending exceeded pre-pandemic levels in April for the first time. It was at 108% of 2019 levels for the quarter, led by strong growth in Global Consumer and SME spending, and a significant uptick in large and global corporate travel. And we don't see demand in the T&E categories declining significantly anytime soon. Based on the strength of future bookings coming through our consumer travel agency and the trends our partners in the travel industry like Delta are experiencing, particularly in the premium space.\nOf course, we are wary of the uncertainties in the current economic environment and the impact it's having on our business. The historically low unemployment rate is a positive factor as it's helping to drive our strong credit metrics. And we continue to see no significant signs of stress in our consumer base.\nInflation is a bit of a mixed bag. It's a modest contributor to our strong growth in volumes. But inflation when combined with low unemployment also puts pressure on operating costs. For example, like everyone else, we're seeing intense competition for the best talent. But because our colleagues are a key driver of our success, we continue to invest in talent, which is having an impact on our operating expenses.\nLooking forward, as I've emphasized many times before, we run the company for the long term, and our investment strategy is grounded in this principle. As we sit here today, we have an abundance of great opportunities. And we'll continue to make our decisions with a longer-term view like we did during the pandemic. That means we will continue to invest at high levels in those areas that will drive sustainable growth, including our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage. We remain confident that the successful execution of this strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond.\nThank you. And I'll now turn it over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey C. Campbell\n\nVice Chairman & CFO, American Express Company\n\nWell, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Good to be here to talk about our second quarter results, which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan.\nStarting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Most importantly, our second quarter revenues were $13.4 billion, up 33% on an FX-adjusted basis, strengthening sequentially from last quarter's already strong 31% year-over-year growth rate. Our reported second quarter net income was $2 billion, with earnings per share of $2.57.\nNow as I said last quarter, given that year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the volatility that the pandemic caused in credit reserve adjustments, we are including pretax pre-provision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter, which we believe gives you additional insight into the trends of our underlying earnings. On this basis, second quarter pretax pre-provision income was $3 billion, up 27% versus the same time period last year.\nSo now let's get into a more detailed look at our results, beginning with volumes. Turning on Slide 3. You can see the continued momentum in spending from our strong customer base that Steve noted earlier. Billed business and total network volumes were up around 30% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis in the second quarter. We feel really good about both our year-over-year growth as well as our sequential growth. The second quarter saw us achieving our highest ever level of quarterly billed business. And if you were to compare to 2019, the first quarter grew [19%], while the second quarter growth rate accelerated even further to 28%. Importantly, our spending volumes strengthened as we went through the quarter, with the month of June also reaching a new monthly record high. And as we sit here today, this momentum has continued into early July.\nNow I would point out that when you think about year-over-year growth rates, volumes in 2021 were, of course, in a steep phase of recovery as the year progressed. So I do expect that our year-over-year growth rates will moderate as we progress through the rest of 2022.\nOur spending metrics are being driven by both sustained growth in Goods & Services spending and by an acceleration in T&E recovery in the second quarter.\nStarting first with Goods & Services spending on Slide 4. We saw a year-over-year growth of 18% in the second quarter. We are now multiple quarters into seeing the effects of the structural shift in online commerce spending patterns, which is accelerated by the pandemic, with our growth rates remaining steady. Specifically, online and card-not-present spending grew 15% in the second quarter.\nIn contrast, total T&E spending, as you see on Slide 5, showed an acceleration in its recovery this quarter even more than we and many others would have expected, reaching 108% of 2019 levels. The high demand for travel will be a steep recovery across all customer types. This strength in both goods and services and T&E spending is also evident as we break spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses, with a few other key points that I'd suggest you take away.\nFirst, beginning on Slide 6, Millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest global consumer Billed business growth, with their spending up 48% year-over-year. I'd also call out that this quarter, all other age cohorts have now reached the pre-pandemic levels of T&E spending, including baby boomers, who had been slower to recover.\nIn our commercial business, on Slide 7, spending from our small- and medium-sized enterprise clients continues to drive our overall growth, with spending up 25% year-over-year. While a smaller part of our business, it is worth noting the significant acceleration in growth of 58% of the large and global corporate customers, significantly above last quarter's growth rate. This is a sign of a more meaningful business travel recovery.\nSo overall, we are pleased that our strength in spending volumes has exceeded our original expectations for the year. And again this quarter, the majority of our high level of growth was driven by the number of transactions flowing through our network, with some modest additional impact from inflation. This positions us well for our long-term growth aspirations.\nMoving on now to receivable and loan balances on Slide 8. We saw a good sequential growth in our loan balances, which are now well above pre-pandemic levels this quarter. The interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to consistently increase quarter-over-quarter, but remains a bit below 2019 levels, as paydown rates have remained elevated.\nAs you then turn to credit and provision, on Slides 9 through 11, the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our extremely strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels. And though they did continue to tick up slightly overall this quarter, as we expected, they are trending a bit better than our expectations when we started the year.\nTurning then to the accounting for this credit performance on Slide 10. As you know, there are a couple of key drivers of provision expense. First, actionable credit performance, which, as we just discussed, is extremely strong, and second, changes in credit reserves under the CECL methodology. We built a small amount of reserves this quarter as our loan balances grew and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our CECL models got slightly worse relative to the outlook back in Q1, both partially offset by improved portfolio quality. This reserve build, combined with our low net write-offs, drove $410 million of provision expense for the second quarter.\nAs you see on Slide 11, we ended the second quarter with $3.2 billion of reserves, representing 3.1% of our loan balances and 0.2% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. This remains well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic.\nGoing forward, we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time, but to remain well below pre-pandemic levels this year. I do expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, given our expected loan growth. But the overall range and timing of reserve adjustments will be heavily influenced by how the macroeconomic outlook evolves between now and the end of the year.\nMoving next to revenue on Slide 12. Total revenues were up 31% year-over-year in the second quarter or 33% on an FX-adjusted basis, as we continue to see a stronger U.S. dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which we operate. Overall, these results were above our original expectations.\nBefore I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that service fees and other revenue was up sharply at 79% growth year-over-year, largely driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues that accelerated this quarter, with cross-border spend in particular surpassing pre-pandemic levels.\nOur largest revenue line, discount revenue, grew 32% year-over-year in Q2 on an FX-adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 13, driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and the accelerated T&E recovery that you saw in our spending trends.\nNet card fee revenues were up 19% year-over-year in the second quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth continuing to accelerate, as you can see on Slide 14, largely driven by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our fee-paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions.\nThis quarter, we acquired 3.2 million new cards, with acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum card numbers again reaching a record high and increasing 20%, above last quarter's record levels, demonstrating the great demand we're seeing, especially for our premium fee-based products.\nMoving on to net interest income. On Slide 15, you can see that it was up 31% year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis, accelerating above last quarter's growth rate due to the continued recovery of our revolving loan balances. Looking forward, while I would expect our loan balances to continue to recover at higher growth rates, the rising rate environment will likely cause our net interest income growth rate to slow given our sizable non-interest-bearing charge balances.\nTo sum up on revenues on Slide 16. We're seeing continued strong results and sustained momentum across the board. So looking forward, we now expect to see revenue growth of 23% to 25% for the full year of 2022.\nSo the revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments we've made in our brand, value propositions, customers, colleagues, technology and coverage. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 17.\nStarting with variable customer engagement expenses, these costs came in as expected, at 42% of total revenues for the quarter, and are tracking with our expectations for variable customer engagement costs to run at around 42% of total revenues on a full year basis. On the marketing line, we invested $1.5 billion in the second quarter.\nWe feel really good about the strong demand for new card acquisitions , as we showed on Slide 14. More importantly, we feel good about the spend, credit and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing in to American Express membership, which continue to look strong relative to what we saw pre-pandemic. I would now expect to spend a little over $5 billion on marketing in 2022.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 17 brings us to operating expenses, which were $3.3 billion in the second quarter. There's often some quarterly volatility in this number due to the varied timing of certain accruals and entries. This quarter, for example, we see the impact of the prior year including a sizable benefit from net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio.\nAs I said last quarter, and as Steve discussed earlier, inflation, while driving some modest positive impact on volumes, it's also putting pressure on our operating expenses, particularly in our compensation costs. Taking everything into account, we now expect our full year operating expenses to be around $13 billion, as we invest in our talented colleague base, technology and other key underpinnings of our growth given our tremendously high levels of revenue growth.\nTurning next to capital. on Slide 18. We returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter, including common stock repurchases of $611 million and $394 million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3% at the end of the second quarter, within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth.\nGiven the concerns about the macro economy and the market, it is worth noting that in the Fed's CCAR stress test results released last month, American Express was again one of the few firms that remained cumulatively profitable under the Fed's macroeconomic stress scenario and we had the highest profit margin as a percentage of assets of any participating bank.\nThat brings me to our growth plan and 2022 guidance on Slide 19. Our performance year-to-date and our full year guidance reinforce several points that Steve and I have now both discussed. First and most importantly, we clearly have momentum across all of the areas critical for us to drive sustained high levels of revenue growth, including customer acquisition, engagement and retention, evidenced by our strong Q2 results. Inflation is additionally providing some modest benefit to our revenues. The combination of all of these things led us to increase our expectations for full year revenue growth to 23% to 25%, up from our original range of 18% to 20%.\nFor now though, our EPS guidance remains unchanged, from between $9.25 and $9.65. Let me walk you through our thinking here. As I talked about earlier, we feel really good about the strong results generated by our marketing investments this year. And that's why we now expect to spend a little over $5 billion for the full year, modestly above our original expectations. Both Steve and I also talked about the fact that there are some pressures on our operating expenses, particularly around compensation and partially fueled by inflation. And therefore, we now expect our operating expenses to be around $13 billion this year. Lastly and most importantly, as we think about our EPS this year, as I talked about in the credit section, while our credit performance and metrics remain extremely healthy, we can't predict how the macroeconomic outlook will evolve. That makes it difficult sitting here today to predict a precise range of outcomes for any potential CECL reserve adjustments for the balance of the year.\nThat said, should the macroeconomic outlook not change meaningfully between now and the end of the year, and therefore, not have a large impact on current reserves in the balance of the year, we would expect to be at or even a bit above the high end of our EPS guidance range. In any environment, we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Kerri to open up the call for your questions.\n\nKerri Bernstein\n\nThanks, Jeff. (Operator Instructions) Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Operator?",

After that, we move to Q&A on the results with both Steve and Jeff.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThanks, Vivian, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter earnings call. At our Investor Day last month, we took you through a detailed discussion of our strategies for driving sustainable growth across our businesses and explain why we are confident we can achieve our growth plan aspirations for 2024 and beyond. As we said then, our confidence is based on 3 interrelated factors: The success of the strategy we've been pursuing over the past several years, which focuses on investing in our brand, customers, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent to build share, scale and relevance; the momentum we've been generating through the effective execution of that strategy; and a number of structural shifts in the payment industry that are contributing to our momentum.\nThe strong first quarter results we announced today are tracking in line with our expectations for the full year despite the uncertain macro environment, and they reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve our longer-term aspirations. For the quarter, were $11.7 billion, up 29% year-over-year, and earnings were -- earnings per share were $2.73. These results reflect continued momentum in our core business in areas that are critical to sustainable long-term growth, including customer acquisition, engagement and retention as well as outstanding credit performance.\nNew proprietary card acquisitions remain at their strong pace, reaching 3 million this quarter, which continues to be driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products, particularly among millennial and Gen Z consumers, and small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. We had an all-time high in acquisitions of U.S. Consumer Platinum and Gold cards as well as U.S. Business Platinum Cards this quarter. [Tilte] Card acquisitions reached an all-time monthly high in March an indication of the growing demand for travel-related products and services.\nRegarding customer engagement, we look at a variety of indicators to measure progress. For example, Card Member engagement with our digital capabilities continues to grow with daily active users across the web and mobile, up double digits over last year. We're also seeing strong engagement with the new benefits we added to our -- recently regressed consumer Platinum card, particularly among millennial and Gen Z card members nearly half in whom have used at least one of the new travel and lifestyle benefits to date. And we continue to see an acceleration in customer engage with our resi dining platform, including strong double-digit growth over the last quarter in a number of Amex cards on file and a number of restaurants participating in our global dining access program. March was one of resi's best month record for reservations, up nearly 16% over February.\nUltimately, the key metric to gauge customer engagement is spending growth. Overall bill business grew 35% in Q1 global year-over-year on an FX-adjusted basis. And we saw our highest volumes ever in March, surpassing our previous highest of December of 2021. Spending growth was led by the acceleration of volumes from millennial and Gen Z consumers of 56% and SME is up 30% on an FX adjusted basis over last year.\nGoods and services spending continued to accelerate in the quarter, growing 21% on an FX adjusted basis over last year. Travel and entertainment spending was up 121% globally on an FX adjusted basis year-over-year, driven by strong growth in consumer travel spending.\nCard retention remains at the very high levels I mentioned at Investor Day, an indication of the value our customers continue to place in Amex membership. A major contributor to our success across all of these areas is the ongoing expansion of many partnerships, which go well beyond our large strategic partners like Delta, Hilton and Amazon. We continue to extend relationships with a variety of companies that are adding differentiated value to our membership model. For example, last week, we announced a new financial advice service with Vanguard, exclusive for our U.S. consumer card members, which brings together Vanguard's digital financial planning and investment management expertise with our industry-leading membership rewards. This is just the latest example of how we're expanding our value propositions beyond their traditional card offerings to meet more of our customers' financial and lifestyle needs.\nIn addition, we're accelerating our focus on fintechs to drive more innovation, including our new partnership with ITC, which will enable fintechs to more seamlessly and quickly issue new products on the American Express network. We also continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives, which are important components of our overall business strategy because we recognize that when our customers, communities and colleagues thrive so does our company.\nOn a diversity equity inclusion front, we are more than 3/4 away towards our goal of investing $1 billion in a wide range of actions by 2024, including increasing spend with diverse suppliers, providing resources and financial assistance to minority-owned SMEs in the U.S. and maintaining pay equity across genres globally and ethnicities in the U.S. among other efforts.\nOur DEI progress was cited as one of the key reasons, along with our flexible work policies for our #8 ranking on Fortune's 2022 list of the Best U.S. companies to work for, which was announced last week. This is the third consecutive year we've been in the top 10, which helps us attract and retain talent. And we recently announced a series of initiatives coinciding with Earth month that are designed to engage our customers, community partners and colleagues in our climate efforts including the goal of significantly expanding the use of recycled plastic in our card products. These initiatives build on the work we've already done and continue our efforts to reduce our own carbon footprint, including our commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2035.\nIn summary, with this solid start to the year, the continued tailwinds we expect from the ongoing recovery from the pandemic, we're reaffirming our full year guidance of delivering revenue growth in the range of 18% to 20% and earnings per share of between $9.25 and $9.65. Furthermore, we remain confident that successful execution of our strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our long-term growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth in 2024 and beyond.\nI'll now turn it over to Jeff for a deeper dive on the quarter. Thank you.\n\nJeffrey C. Campbell\n\nVice Chairman & CFO, American Express Company\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our first quarter results, which reflect a solid start to 2022 and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year and with our aspiration to build growth momentum beyond 2022.\nStarting with our summary financials on Slide 2. Most importantly, our first quarter revenues were $11.7 billion, up 31% on an FX-adjusted basis, consistent with the momentum we have built and our longer-term growth aspirations. Our reported first quarter net income was $2.1 billion with earnings per share of $2.73.\nAs you know, year-over-year comparisons of net income have been challenging for the industry over the past 2 years due to the volatility that the pandemic has caused in credit reserve adjustments. For that reason, we thought it would be a helpful supplemental disclosure this quarter to include our pretax pre-provision income. That number was $2.7 billion in the first quarter, up 16% versus the comparable number in 2021, reflecting growth in our core earnings.\nSo now let's get into a little more detailed look at our results, starting with volumes. As you can see in our slides, we have mostly gone back to reporting our volumes on a year-over-year basis, moving away from the comparisons to 2019 that we have done in recent quarters. We think that returning to a focus on year-over-year comparison gives you a better view of the momentum we have built and the momentum we are seeking to maintain as we look towards our longer-term growth objectives.\nStarting on Slide 3. Total network volumes and build business were both up over 30% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, strengthening further from the strong growth rates seen in the past few quarters. And as Steve highlighted, intra-quarter, while Omicron slowed growth in January and early February, we then saw a strong acceleration in March, with that month achieving our highest ever level of monthly build business. And I would point out that the majority of this high level of growth was driven by the momentum we have built and the number of transactions flowing through our network with only a modest impact from inflation.\nNow as I talked about at our Investor Day last month and as Slide 4 reiterates, the majority of our build business is spending on goods and services from our consumer and small and dime-sized enterprise customers.\nAnd as you can see on Slide 5, goods and services spending remained robust in the first quarter. with year-over-year growth reaching 21%, slightly above the 2021 exit rate. This momentum is from strong growth in online and card-not-present spending that continued in the first quarter even as offline spending growth strengthened, demonstrating the effect of the structural shift in online commerce that we've seen accelerated by the pandemic.\nAnd while T&E spending is a smaller portion of our total billings, you see on Slide 6 that it is now strongly supporting our growth momentum, with overall T&E spending growing 121% year-over-year. T&E spending did show a dip in January and early February due to the Omicron variant, but spending then rebounded tremendously, reflecting pent-up travel demand and essentially reached 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic in the month of March. And this kind of T&E spending growth has continued right into early April.\nWhen you then break these spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses, as we begin to do on Slide 7, there are a few other key points I'd suggest you take fully. First, our millennial and Gen Z customers continue to drive our highest consumer growth with their spending up 56% year-over-year and spending growth from all other age cohorts increasing as well in the quarter. Also of note, global consumer T&E volumes overall were back above 2019 levels as of the first quarter, led by the growth in the U.S.\nSecond, our commercial businesses strategic focus on helping SME clients run their businesses continues to drive strong growth in overall SME spending up 30% in the first quarter with acceleration in growth across both the U.S. and international. While a smaller part of our overall growth is in this segment, I would point out that our large and global corporate clients have begun to show signs of business travel recovery, especially in the latter part of the quarter with a year-over-year growth rate for the quarter of 42%. So overall, we are pleased with the growth momentum we see across the board in our spending volumes, which is tracking in line with our expectations for both the year and for our long-term expectations.\nAs you then move to receivable and loan balances on Slide 9, you see that our growth momentum has brought our ending loan balances roughly back to pre-pandemic levels in this quarter. As I said at Investor Day, the interest-bearing portion of our loan balances also continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, but is still below 2019 levels as paydown rates remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base.\nThis liquidity and strength is also, of course, evident as you turn to credit and provision on Slides 10 through 12, as we continue to see extremely strong credit performance. Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels and in line with our expectations, but they did tick up a bit this quarter.\nAs you then turn to the accounting for this credit performance, you will see that this quarter, we released a large part of the remaining credit reserves we built to capture the significant uncertainty of the pandemic, which lacked a comparable precedent. As we have seen a sustained recovery from the pandemic-driven economic shutdowns, we have been able to reduce pandemic-driven reserves. While there clearly is still plenty of uncertainty today related to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment, we believe that our CECL models are better able to capture our expected credit risk related to these uncertainties to determine the appropriate level of reserves required.\nOur strong credit performance combined with the adjustment to our reserves drove a $33 million provision expense benefit for the first quarter as the low write-offs were fully offset by the net reserve release as shown on Slide 11.\nAs you see on Slide 12, we ended the first quarter with $3.1 billion of reserves, representing 3.3% of our loan balances and 0.1% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre-pandemic, given the strong credit performance we've seen. Going forward, as loan balances, especially the interest-bearing portion of loan balances, build more meaningfully, we expect delinquency and loss rates to continue to slowly move up over time but remain below pre-pandemic levels this year. We would also expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter, although there could be some quarterly volatility in reserve adjustments throughout the year.\nAs we move to revenue on Slide 13, I do need to explain some changes we've made to our revenue reporting before moving on to results. As a reminder, we began reporting processed volumes in the first quarter of last year to better differentiate between volume and cards we issue versus those who are we play more of a network role. For added transparency, we now have moved all of the revenues associated with these volumes out of discount revenue, other fees and commissions, other revenue and combined them into a newly created line called Processed Revenue, which you can then match up against our processed volumes. We have also consolidated the remaining balances from other fees and commissions and other revenue into one line named Service Fees and Other Revenue with the largest components of this line item being service fees earned from merchants like those generated by our loyalty coalition business; and foreign currency-related revenues, such as FX conversion fees. This revenue line was up strong with 42% growth year-over-year in the first quarter, as you will see on the next slide. This growth was primarily driven by the uptick we have seen in travel-related revenues. And as I said at Investor Day, we expect this to be a pandemic recovery tailwind throughout this year. You will see we have recast prior periods in the disclosures that accompany our earnings release. A description of these reporting changes and definitions for key terms will also be included in our Form 10-Q.\nWith these changes out of the way, let's move to our actual revenue performance beginning on Slide 14. Total revenues were up 29% year-over-year in the first quarter with broad-based revenue growth across all lines.\nOur largest revenue line, discount revenue grew 38% year-over-year in Q1 on an FX adjusted basis, as you can see on Slide 15. This growth was driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and continued recovery of T&E spending.\nNet Card fee revenues were up 16% year-over-year in the first quarter on an FX-adjusted basis, with growth reaccelerating versus the 10% to 11% growth rate seen in 2021 as you can see on Slide 16.\nAs I said at Investor Day, this growth is largely driven by bringing new accounts onto our fee-paying products as a result of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractive of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. This quarter, we acquired 3 million new cards with acquisitions of U.S. consumer and U.S. business Platinum Card members reaching record high, as Steve noted earlier, demonstrating great demand for our products, especially our premium fee-based products.\nMoving on to net interest income. On Slide 17, you will see that it surpassed 2019 levels for the first time this quarter, mainly driven by lower interest expense, in part due to our increased mix of deposits, which is generally our lowest cost funding source, particularly in today's rising rate environment.\nFirst quarter year-over-year net interest income growth of 20%, while very strong, remains slower than the growth in our lending AR as revolving loan balances continue to rebuild, and so we expect net interest income to be a pandemic recovery tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022.\nTo sum up, on revenues on Slide 18, we're tracking well against our expectations. And looking forward. We still expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20% for the full year of 2022.\nSo all of the revenue momentum we just discussed, was driven by the investments we've been making in marketing, value propositions, coverage, technology and talent. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses, the strong spending growth and customer engagement that Steve discussed earlier is driving the growth in these expenses lines. In total, these costs came in at 41% of total revenues for the first quarter and are tracking in line with our expectations for variable customer engagement costs to enter around 42% of total revenues for the full year.\nOn the marketing line, we invested $1.2 billion in the first quarter, on track with our expectation to spend around $5 billion in 2022. We feel really good about the strong momentum of our new card acquisitions, as I talked about earlier. And more importantly, about the revenues from those acquisitions, which is trending significantly higher than what we saw pre-pandemic. We continue to see great demand for our products across a wide range of attractive investment opportunities even beyond those we are currently funding.\nMoving to the bottom of Slide 19. Operating expenses were $3.1 billion in the first quarter, tracking with our expectation to spend a bit over to $12 billion for the full year. While OpEx was up 26% year-over-year this quarter, it is important to note that we were growing over a benefit of $384 million in net mark-to-market gains in our MX venture strategic investment portfolio from the first quarter of last year, including in the OpEx line.\nI would point out -- but while I said earlier that inflation is having some modest positive in volumes, it is also putting some pressure on our operating expenses, but we'll have to wait to see how material any impact might be for the full year. In any event, I still expect to have far less growth in OpEx compared to revenues and see these costs as a key source of leverage.\nTurning next to capital, on Slide 20, we returned $1.9 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion, and $394 million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation. Our CET1 ratio was 10.4% at the end of the first quarter within our target range of 10% to 11%. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth.\nThat brings our growth plan on Slide 21, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. For the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of 18% to 20% and earnings per share between $9.25 and $9.65. We continue to expect the amount of our volumes, revenues and core earnings to sequentially strengthen throughout the year, driven in part by our pandemic recovery tailwinds.\nAs I mentioned earlier, clearly uncertainty as it relates to the current geopolitical and inflationary environment. As we sit here today, despite that uncertainty, the combination of our investments successful execution of our strategy and a number of structural shifts have all come together to deliver our strong first quarter results and build growth momentum. We remain committed to executing against our new growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.\n\nVivian Y. Zhou\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, American Express Company\n\nThank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just 1 question. Thank you for your cooperation. And with that, the operator will now open up the line for questions. Alan?",

After that, we will move to a Q&A session on the results with both Steve and Jeff.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Steve.\n\nStephen Joseph Squeri\n\nChairman & CEO, American Express Company\n\nThanks, Vivian, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our press release a short while ago, we reported strong quarterly and full year revenue growth and earnings for 2021, thanks to the efforts of our dedicated and talented colleagues around the globe. We also provided revenue and EPS guidance for 2022, and we announced a new growth plan that resets our longer-term aspirations for revenue and EPS growth to levels that are higher than what we were delivering in the years before the pandemic.\nI want to spend my time today talking about why these results and our progress over the last few years has me excited about the future and our aspiration to deliver higher levels of sustainable profitable growth. As we've seen in our results for Q4 and the full year, the capabilities we've built over the past few years by investing in our customers, our brand and our talent are helping us drive share, scale and relevance that leads to profitable growth. And we believe that will continue as the global economy continues to improve.\nOur strong performance across a number of key business metrics helped deliver revenue growth of 30% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $2.18 and $10.02 for the full year. In the near term, we expect full year revenue growth to remain at elevated levels, reaching 18% to 20% in 2022, driven by the execution of our growth plan and the recovery tailwinds we anticipate from continued improvement in the macroeconomic environment. We expect EPS of between $9.25 and $9.65 in 2022.\nAs we think about 2023, the continuation of the recovery tailwinds could drive revenue growth in the mid-teens, which, in turn, should provide a platform for mid-teens EPS growth. Looking further out, as we return to a more steady state economic environment, we aspire to achieve revenue growth in excess of 10% and EPS growth in the mid-teens under our new growth plan for 2024 and beyond.\nWe've learned a lot over the past few years that we believe will help us achieve our growth plan aspirations. The business imperatives and strategies we focused on pre pandemic, the decisions we made when COVID-19 first hit to protect our customers and colleagues and our pivot early in the recovery cycle to ramp up investments in a number of key areas all proved to be the right moves that have been good for our business.\nMost importantly, our experience through this period has reinforced our conviction that investing strategically in our customers' brand and talent is absolutely critical to driving high levels of growth. We've seen that play out in the results we delivered throughout 2021. Our fourth quarter performance continued the trends we saw all year in a number of areas that are core to our growth over the long term.\nSpending growth reached a record quarterly high, driven by continued increases in goods and services spending, which was 24% above pre-pandemic levels. Global Consumer goods and services spending in the quarter grew 26% versus 2019. And we saw continued robust growth in small business B2B spending, which increased 25% over Q4 2019 levels. Overall, T&E spending also continued to improve, reaching 82% of pre-pandemic levels, driven by stronger consumer travel spending.\nCustomer retention and satisfaction continue to be very strong and remained above pre-pandemic levels. For example, retention rates in Global Consumer are above 98%. And for the second year in a row and the 11th time in 15 years, we ranked first in J.D. Power's annual credit card satisfaction study of U.S. consumers. Credit performance also continued to be outstanding, with key metrics near historical lows. And our Card Members are building loan balances at a modest pace.\nCustomer engagement with our products, services and capabilities continued at high levels in the quarter. The strong engagement, which is fueled by our ongoing investments in value propositions, marketing and new digital services, is helping to drive the results I just spoke about in billings and loan growth as well as customer retention and satisfaction levels.\nAdditionally, our customer-focused innovation strategy, which has driven increases in customer engagement, has continued to attract large numbers of new customers. New card acquisitions reached 2.7 million in Q4, driven by strong demand for our premium fee-based products, where we saw acquisitions nearly double year-over-year.\nIn Consumer, millennials and Gen Z customers are driving the growth in acquisitions, representing around 60% of the new accounts we acquired globally in 2021. In Commercial, Q4 closed out as one of the best years we've ever seen for U.S. SME new account acquisition.\nThe momentum we generated throughout 2021 further strengthens our resolve to continue our focus on the strategic imperatives we laid out back in 2018: expanding our leadership position in the premium consumer space by providing a differentiated and ever-expanding range of services and lifestyle-focused value propositions, building on our strong leadership position in commercial payments by being the key provider of payments and working capital solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, expanding our merchant network globally to give our card members more places to use their cards and staying on the leading edge of technology and digital payment solutions to make American Express an essential part of our customers' digital lives.\nWe are entering 2022 in a position of strength. And based on the momentum with which we exited 2021 and the opportunities we see ahead, we feel very good about the future. We believe that continuing our strategy of investing at high levels in our customers' brand and talent as we implement our growth plan will position us well as we seek to achieve our growth aspirations in 2024 and beyond.\nI'll now turn it over to Jeff to provide more details on our performance for the fourth quarter and our expectations for the future. And after that, we'll take your questions. Thank you. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey C. Campbell\n\nCFO & Co-Vice Chairman, American Express Company\n\nWell, thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's great to be here to talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, the ambitious new growth plan that Steve just talked about and what it all means for 2022 and beyond.\nYou see the growth momentum that Steve just discussed in our summary financials on Slide 2, with fourth quarter revenues of $12.1 billion, up 31%, and full year revenues of $42.4 billion, up 17%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. In understanding our full year net income of $8.1 billion and earnings per share $10.02, I would point out that we had around $3.5 billion of significant impacts from items that we do not expect to repeat in the same magnitude going forward, including a $2.5 billion credit reserve release benefit in provision as well as a few sizable net gains on equity investments.\nGetting into a more detailed look at our results, let's start with volumes. You'll notice in the several views of volumes on Slides 3 through 9 that we continued to show 2021 volume trends on both a year-over-year basis and relative to 2019. There are a few key insights that I would highlight across these slides that strengthen our conviction in the investment strategy we have been focused on to deliver our new growth plan.\nTo start, we saw a record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full year 2021, with total network volumes and Billed business volumes both up more than 10% relative to 2019 on an FX-adjusted basis in the fourth quarter, as you can see on Slide 3. This growth in Billed business, as shown on Slides 4 and 5, is being driven by continued momentum in spending on goods and services, which strengthened sequentially and grew 24% versus 2019 in Q4.\nThis momentum is from the strong growth in online and card-not-present spending that continued throughout 2021, even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth, demonstrating the lasting effect of the behavioral changes we've seen during the pandemic. Importantly, this 24% growth versus 2019 in Q4 represents a cumulative growth rate over the past 2 years that is well above the growth rate we were seeing pre pandemic.\nIn our Consumer business, our focus on attracting and engaging younger cohorts of Card Members through expanding our value propositions and digital capabilities is fueling the 50% growth in spending from our millennial and Gen Z customers you see on Slide 6. And spending from all other age cohorts also showed steady improvement throughout 2021 and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in Q4.\nOur strategic focus on helping our small and medium-sized enterprise clients run their businesses by expanding the range of products and capabilities that meet their B2B payments and working capital needs is driving the strong SME spending trends you see on Slide 7. Global SME spending, particularly B2B spending on goods and services, has been driving the growth of our Commercial Billed business throughout 2021 and reached 25% above pre-pandemic levels in Q4.\nNow turning to T&E spending. You can see on Slide 8 that it continues to recover in line with our expectations, with overall T&E spending reaching 82% of 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. We did see some modest impacts from the Omicron variant and T&E spending as the pace of recovery slowed a bit in December. But even with that modest slowdown, U.S. Consumer T&E was not only fully recovered in the fourth quarter, but actually grew 8% above 2019 levels.\nOn balance, the T&E trends we have seen throughout 2021 reinforce our view that travel and entertainment spending will eventually fully recover, but at varying paces across customer types and geographies. And we remain focused on maintaining our leadership position in offering differentiated travel and lifestyle benefits to our Consumer and Commercial customers as they return to travel.\nFinally, on Slide 9, you see that our Billed business momentum continues to be led by the U.S., where spending improved sequentially throughout 2021 and grew 16% above 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. International Billed business has also shown continued steady, though smaller, improvements, with spending almost fully recovered in Q4. Importantly, though, growth in goods and services spending continues to be strong, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S.\nSo what do all of these takeaways mean for 2022 and beyond? Most importantly, we expect the strong momentum in goods and services spending to continue, given the investments we've made in premium Card Member engagement; prospect acquisition; value propositions that particularly appeal to our millennial, Gen Z and SME customers; growing our coverage; and expanding relationships with key partners.\nFor T&E, we expect the total Global Consumer and SME T&E spending will be fully recovered by the end of 2022, led by the growth in the U.S. The recovery will be slower for the international and cross-border components of the spend. We've also long said that large and global corporate T&E spending would be the last to recover across our customer types. So these spending types may represent a steady tailwind in both '22 and 2023 as they gradually recover.\nMoving on to receivable and loan balances on Slide 10. We are seeing good sequential growth in our lending balances, but it is led by spending. And so the portion of our lending balances that are revolving is recovering more slowly. Because our balances are spend-driven, we do expect to continue to see a strong rebound, with loan balances surpassing 2019 levels in 2022. But we expect it to take more time for the interest-bearing portion of these balances to rebuild as paydown rates continue to remain elevated due to the liquidity and strength amongst our customer base.\nTurning next to credit and provision on Slides 11 through 13. As you flip through these slides, there are a few key points I'd like you to take away. Most importantly, we continue to see extremely strong credit performance, with Card Member loans and receivables write-off and delinquency rates remaining around historical lows. As loan balances begin to rebuild more meaningfully, we do expect delinquency and loss rates to slowly move up over time, but we expect them to remain below pre-pandemic levels in 2022.\nThe strong credit performance, combined with continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook throughout 2021, drove a $1.4 billion provision expense benefit for the full year as the low write-offs were fully offset by the reserve releases, as shown on Slide 12. As you see on Slide 13, we ended 2021 with $3.4 billion of reserves, representing 3.7% of our loan balances, and 0.1% of our Card Member receivable balances, respectively. This is well below the reserve levels we had pre pandemic, given the strong credit performance we've seen.\nIn 2022, we will be growing over the $2.5 billion reserve release benefit we saw in 2021 since I would not expect to see reserve releases of the same magnitude going forward. In fact, depending on credit trends and the pace at which our balance sheet grows, it's possible we may need to build some modest level of reserves.\nMoving next to revenues on Slide 14. Total revenues were up 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, up 17% for the full year. This is well above our original expectations for the year, driven by the successful execution of our investment strategy, and it is part of what emboldens us to launch our new growth plan.\nBefore I get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides, I would note that other fees and commissions and other revenue were both up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and for the full year, primarily driven by the uptick in travel-related revenues we began to see in the second half of 2021. These travel-related revenues still remain well below 2019 levels, however, and their complete recovery will likely lag and be a tailwind into 2023, along with international and cross-border travel.\nTurning to our largest revenue line, discount revenue, on Slide 15. You see it grew 36% year-over-year in Q4 and 25% for the full year on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth is primarily driven by the momentum in goods and services spending we saw throughout 2021. Net card fee revenues have grown consistently throughout the pandemic and, for the full year of 2021, were up 10% year-over-year and up 28% versus 2019, as you can see on Slide 16.\nThe resiliency of these subscription-like revenues demonstrates the impact of the investments we've made in our premium value propositions and the continued attractiveness of those value propositions to both prospects and existing customers. As a result, I expect net card fee growth to accelerate from these already high growth rates in 2022.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 17. You can see that it was up 11% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth as we clearly hit an inflection point in the second half of 2021.\nThe growth in net interest income is slower than the growth in lending AR due to the strong liquidity demonstrated by our customers that I spoke about earlier, which is leading to both our historically low credit costs and to high paydown rates that are driving lower net interest yields and a slower recovery in revolving loan balances. Looking ahead, we expect net interest income to be a tailwind to our revenue growth in 2022 and likely 2023 due to the slower recovery in revolving loan balances.\nSo to sum up on revenues, the successful execution of our investment strategy has driven the revenue recovery momentum you see on Slide 18. Looking forward into 2022, we expect to see revenue growth of 18% to 20%, driven by the continued strong growth in spend and card fee revenues and the lingering recovery tailwinds from net interest income and travel-related revenues.\nThe revenue momentum we saw in 2021 was clearly accelerated by the investments we made in marketing, value propositions, technology and people. And those investments show up across the expense lines you see on Slide 19. Starting with variable customer engagement expenses at the top of Slide 19, there are a few things to think about. Most importantly, the investments we are making in our premium value propositions are resonating with our customers and this, of course, is driving growth in these expense lines.\nIn addition, over the course of the pandemic, we added some temporary incremental benefits to many of our premium products in an effort we refer to as value injection because our customers were not able to take advantage of many of the travel-related aspects of our value propositions. The cost of this value injection effort generally showed up in the marketing expense line. Throughout 2021, we gradually wound down the value injection offers as our customers were again engaging more with the travel aspects of our value propositions as well as with the new rewards and benefits we introduced through recent product refreshes.\nThis is all a good thing in terms of our long-term customer retention and growth prospects. It does, however, mean you see more year-over-year growth in these variable customer engagement costs. Putting all these dynamics together, I'd expect variable customer engagement costs overall to run at around 42% of total revenues in 2022.\nMoving to the bottom of the slide. Operating expenses were just over $11 billion for full year 2021 and in line with 2020. Understanding our OpEx results, however, it's important to point out that we benefited from $767 million in net mark-to-market gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in 2021 and that these gains are reported in the OpEx line.\nWe also increased investments in the critical areas of technology and our talented colleague base in 2021 and expect to continue to grow our investments in these areas this year. For 2022, we expect our operating expenses to be a bit over $12 billion, and we see these costs as a key source of leverage relative to our much higher level of revenue growth. Last, our effective tax rate for 2021 was around 25%. And I'd expect a similar effective tax rate in 2022, absent any legislative changes.\nTurning next to our marketing investments we are making to build growth momentum. You can see on Slide 20 that we invested around $1.6 billion in marketing in the fourth quarter and $5.3 billion for the full year as we continue to ramp up new card acquisitions while winding down our value injection efforts. We acquired 2.7 million new cards, up 54% year-over-year.\nSteve emphasized the critical point, however, that, in particular, we see great demand for our premium fee-based products, with new accounts acquired on these products almost doubling year-over-year and representing 67% of the new accounts acquired in the quarter. Acquisitions of new U.S. consumer and small business Platinum Card members were at all-time highest this year, with Q4 being a record quarter of new account acquisitions from both of these refreshed products.\nMuch more importantly, though, than just the total number of cards, we focus internally on the overall level of spend and fee revenue growth we bring on from these new acquisitions. We are pleased to see that the revenues from 2021's acquisitions are trending significantly stronger than what we saw pre pandemic. Looking forward, we expect to spend around $5 billion in marketing in 2022.\nTurning next to capital on Slide 21. We returned $9 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2021, including common stock repurchases of $7.6 billion and $1.4 billion in common stock dividends on the back of a starting excess capital position and strong earnings generation. As a result, we ended the year with our CET1 ratio back within our target range, 10% to 11%.\nIn Q1 2022 and another sign of our growing confidence in our growth prospects, we expect to increase our dividend by around 20% to $0.52 and to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth. That brings me to our growth plan on Slide 22, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.\nThe combination of our pre-pandemic strategies, our learnings from the pandemic and the strong momentum we have achieved have all come together to embolden us to announce our new growth plan. What does that mean financially? In the near term, we expect our revenue growth to be significantly higher than our long-term aspiration due to the range of pandemic recovery tailwinds that I've talked about throughout my remarks, which is why we have given 2022 guidance of 18% to 20% revenue growth.\nWe've also given EPS guidance for 2022 of $9.25 to $9.65. We feel good about this earnings guidance as the momentum we have built on the revenue side helps us to grow over the number of notable items that benefited our 2021 results that we certainly don't expect to repeat in the same magnitude in 2022, as I discussed at the very beginning of my remarks this morning.\nOur 2022 guidance does assume an economy that will continue to improve and reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment. It also assumes that, based on current exchange rates, we would not see a significant impact from FX in our reported revenue growth in 2022.\nIn 2023, we expect our revenue growth to remain above our long-term aspirational targets due to the lingering recovery tailwinds, which should create a platform for producing mid-teens EPS growth. Longer term, as we get to a more steady-state macro environment, we have an aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of 10% and mid-teens EPS growth on a sustainable basis in 2024 and beyond.\nIn closing, we are committed to executing against our new growth plan, and we'll be running the company with a focus on achieving our accelerated growth aspirations.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Vivian.\n\nVivian Y. Zhou\n\nSenior VP & Head of IR, American Express Company\n\nThank you, Jeff. Before we open up the lines for Q&A, I will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just 1 question. Thank you for your cooperation.\nAnd with that, the operator will now open the line for questions. Alan?",

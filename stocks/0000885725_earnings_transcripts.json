[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew, and thanks to everyone for joining us. With me today are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jon Monson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A session, Mike and Jon will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein.\nWe issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures. The release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please note that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes certain acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\nGuidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire [ Nalu ] Medical, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to the Q3 financial and operating highlights deck which may be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nOn this call, all references to sales and revenue are organic, and relative growth is compared to the same quarter of the prior year, unless otherwise specified. This call contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our financial performance, business plans and product performance and development. These statements are based on our current beliefs using information available to us as of today's date, and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from those projected by the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences are discussed in our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC, including the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Boston Scientific disclaims any intention or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Lauren. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our quarterly results again exceeded our expectations led by our innovative portfolio, strong execution and a winning spirit of our global team. In third quarter '25, total company operational sales grew 19% and organic sales grew 15%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 12% to 14%, with sustained high performance in both our Cardiovascular and [ MediServ ] segments.\nQ3 adjusted EPS of $0.75 grew 19% and exceeding the high end of guidance range of $0.70 to $0.72. Q3 adjusted operating margin was 28%.\nTurning to our fourth quarter and full year '25 outlook, we are guiding to organic growth of 11% to 13% and for fourth quarter '25, which implies an increase to our full year '25 guidance to approximately 15.5%, reflecting our confidence to sustain above-market growth. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.77 to $0.79 and we are thus raising our full year adjusted EPS guidance to $3.02 to $3.04. And representing growth of 20% to 21%. Jon will provide more details in the financial section.\nI'll now provide some additional highlights on our third quarter results and outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 27% with impressive growth. The excellent growth is broad-based across our cardiovascular businesses, endoscopy and neuromodulation. Europe and Middle East and Africa did decline 2% on an operational basis as a result of two impactful yet transient headwinds in the quarter.\nFirst, the discontinuation of our accurate valve in May 25 and which had prior year third quarter sales of approximately $50 million. And secondly, we implemented our upgraded ERP system mid-quarter at our [ Kerkrade ] distribution center. This did result in a back order of approximately $30 million impacting a number of our businesses in Europe. We do anticipate this backorder will improve throughout the fourth quarter.\nExcluding these two headwinds, EMEA growth would have been high single digits driven by strong double-digit growth in and continued high utilization of FARAPULSE and double-digit growth in complex PCI.\nAsia Pac grew 17% operationally led by strong double-digit growth across Japan and China. Japan growth was driven by WATCHMAN and EP, we saw excellent performance in the quarter led by FARAPULSE, which recently received expanded labeling for persistent indication and was supported by our OPAL HDx mapping system. China grew an impressive mid-teens despite the substantial VBP in our peripheral business. China growth was broad-based and driven again by growth in ICTX and EP. Within the quarter, we received NMPA approval for the WATCHMAN FLX PRO device, and [ Rise ] began commercial launch, which coupled with FARAPULSE and investment in clinical evidence such as Option A, drives our confidence in sustained mid-teens growth over the LRP in China.\nI'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units, starting with urology. Urology sales grew 27% operationally and 5% organically Growth in the quarter was driven by an international business and a global phone management franchise. Axonics performance continues to be below expectations as we are focused on improving our commercial execution post the unplanned emergent However, we remain enthusiastic about the S&M market opportunity in our future to focus on brain activation and globalization opportunities.\nWe're pleased to have recently received approval for Axonics F-15 in Europe. Our outlook for the Axonics business, coupled with our broad innovation cadence across the business, drives confidence in our expectation that urology growth will improve throughout 2026.\nEndoscopy delivered an excellent quarter, growing 9%, driven by double-digit growth in key products, including AXIOS, MANTIS and OverStitch combined with our differentiated broad portfolio. Notably, the U.S. grew 11% led by the recent launch of [ Waflx plus ] and above-market growth across the pancreaticobiliary franchise.\nNeuromodulation had a strong quarter as sales grew 9%. Our brand franchise grew low double digits, supported by the 5-year results from the INTREPID study, which demonstrated sustainable benefits of DBS in patients with moderate to advanced parts disease. The pain franchise continues to strengthen and grew high single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in the U.S. with INTERCEPT. The team is in the early stage of launching INTERCEPT in Europe. We also just announced our agreement to acquire Nalu Medical which we anticipate will expand our portfolio into a new paint adjacency in peripheral nerve pain. This is an excellent new growth opportunity and complements our commercial strength with the interventional pain position. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2026.\nPeripheral Interventions sales grew 16% operationally and 6% organically with excellent low double-digit growth in the U.S. that was offset by the China VBP. Within our peripheral vascular business, we saw a low single-digit decline in arterial, again, driven by the China VBP. During September, Silk Road turned organic and delivered improved high single-digit pro forma growth within the quarter, supported by the recent launch of [ Enroute ] in China. Looking forward, we continue to expect a very limited launch of seismic IVL for peripheral above-the-knee procedures by year-end 2025, an increase in launch cadence -- I'm sorry, in '26 and an increase in launch cadence in '27. In venous, we saw excellent double-digit growth led by continued strength in [ Varithena and ECOs ].\nWithin the quarter, [ High Petro ], our clinical study with ECOs versus standard of care antiquate completed enrollment, and we expect data to be presented in 2026. Our individual Oncology and embolization business grew double digits, driven by our category-leading embolization and cancer therapies portfolio. With notable strength in cryoablation, which treats a broad number of cancer types. Clinical evidence remains a key enabler for future growth. And within the quarter, we completed enrollment in two important trials. Rowan, who studied TheraSphere in combination with AstraZeneca stride regimen for patients with HCC and [ Aclude ] a large real-world registry for [ Obsidio ] conformable embolic. Cardiology delivered another outstanding quarter, with sales growing 23%. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapy sales grew 3%, which does include the impact of the ACURATE withdrawal. With double-digit growth in coronary therapies, driven by aged drug-coated balloon in the U.S. and our imaging catheters globally. The U.S. grew 21%, led by Agent DCB, where we continue to expect strong growth supported by the new technology add-on payment that was recently approved and went into effect October 1.\nIn the long term, we're investing to expand the indicated patient population with evidence from our [ StanC ] trial evaluating agent versus standard of care in de novo lesions, which began enrollment in August. We continue to be excited about the addition of seismic IVL to our leading coronary therapies portfolio. and expect completion of the fracture trial in first quarter '26. We expect to launch this differentiated technology in the U.S. in early '27 further expanding our C prep treat approach across our portfolio.\nCardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 2%. Our diagnostic franchise grew low double digits, led by continued above-market performance with our Lux ICM device. In core CRM, our low-voltage business grew low single digits with the momentum from the launch of our conduction system patient tools in the U.S. and Europe, and our high-voltage business declined low single digits. We recently closed the acquisition of the Lucia Bio envelope assets, which are designed to prevent postoperative complications for devices such as pacemakers and defibrillators. We look forward to expanding the reach of this technology to more global markets as a complement to our core CRM portfolio.\nWATCHMAN grew an outstanding 35% this quarter and surpassed 600,000 patients targeted to date. The excellent growth in the quarter reflects accelerated concomitant uptake in the U.S. and continued penetration into the 5 million patients indicated today through excellent clinical results and strong patient and physician awareness. We continue to expect approximately 25% of the U.S. WATCHMAN procedures to be done concomitantly exiting '25 and with the potential for that to double by 2028, enabled by the trusted [ fairewatch ] approach. We are confident that we can continue to grow the WATCHMAN market by approximately 20% for the years to come driven by continued concomitant uptake, the upcoming data presentation of Champion in the first half of '26 and the launch of our next-generation device, WATCHMAN ELITE expected in late '27 or early '28.\nTurning to EP. We're incredibly proud of our EP performance, with third quarter sales growing 63% as we drive continued share gains in the overall EP market. FARAPULSE remains the leading PFA technology having treated over 500,000 patients to date with consistent and reproducible real-world results, further demonstrated in the recently published 1-year results from the [ FERADISE ] trial, which showed favorable procedural and safety outcomes and clinical effectiveness across ablation strategies and AF types.\nIn the U.S., we saw continued strong double-digit growth in FARAPULSE supported by ramping adoption of our OPAL HDx mapping system, with 1 in 3 FARAPULSE accounts now utilizing our integrated [ Fair wave ] NAV and OPAL device. The team is executing our pipeline strategy, and we recently launched our contact sensing feature and are moving to full release this month.\nLooking forward, our aim is to grow -- continue to grow our share in the overall EP market and we expect to retain a strong leadership position in PFA, enabled by our innovative portfolio, expanding mapping and commercial resources and consistent data publications. We expect global PFA penetration to continue to expand and to exit 2025 at 50% penetration and grow to approximately 80% by 2028. At our recent Investor Day, we shared that we aim to be the market share leaders, not just in PFA but the overall EP market over time. We are investing today to outpace the approximately 15% market growth expected through '28 and by advancing our ecosystem of innovative solutions across both the AF and non-AF segments of the market. We are simplifying ablations and the workflows associated with them. and expanding patient access through clinical evidence generation across the globe.\nBy year-end '25, we expect to make meaningful progress towards expanding access to new technologies and more complex and redo patients. with the launch of our FARAPOINT PFA catheter as well as initiate enrollment in the OPTIMIZE trial, which will study the integration of OPAL in the Cortex AI algorithm. Cortex is a differentiated mapping software designed to precisely visualize and target sources of arrhythmias, addressing an unmet need in the treatment of persistent a patients with unexplained reoccurrence. In closing, I look forward to finishing out an outstanding 2025 and delivering on our guidance, which will result in another year of delivering highly differentiated financial results versus our peer group.\nAnd as we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, we have an incredibly strong global team that is relentlessly pursuing and investing in meaningful innovation to deliver differentiated growth and leverage EPS growth this year and for years to come. And with that, I'll hand over to Jon to provide more details on our financials.\n\nJonathan R. Monson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nAll right. Thanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $5.065 billion represents 20.3% reported growth versus the third quarter of 2024 and includes a 90 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, which was favorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $38 million foreign exchange benefit, operational revenue growth was 19.4% in the quarter. Those acquisitions contributed 420 basis points to sales, resulting in 15.3% organic revenue growth which was above our third quarter guidance range of 12% to 14%. Q3 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 grew 19% versus 2024 and exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.70 to $0.72, primarily driven by strong drop-through on above-expectation revenue and margin performance in the quarter.\nAdjusted gross margin was 71% for the third quarter representing a 60 basis point improvement versus the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to favorable product mix, driven by strong growth in electrophysiology and WATCHMAN and partially offset by tariffs.\nAs a result of our Q3 performance, we now anticipate full year adjusted gross margin to slightly improve versus 2024, inclusive of an approximate $100 million tariff headwind for the full year unchanged versus previous expectations. Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 28%, expanding 80 basis points versus the prior year period, driven by strong drop-through on our top line performance.\nOn a GAAP basis, third quarter operating margin was 20.7%. Moving to below the line. Third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $116 million, which was in line with our expectations.\nOn an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 13.6%, and our operational tax rate was 13.9%. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.495 billion shares in the third quarter, and free cash flow for the third quarter was $1.16 billion with $1.343 billion from operating activities less $181 million in net capital expenditures. We continue to expect full year 2025 free cash flow to be approximately $3.5 billion, reflecting strong cash conversion driven by earnings growth and disciplined working capital management.\nAs of September 30, 2025, we had cash on hand of $1.275 billion, and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.0x. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A in high-growth adjacencies, followed by share repurchase. In alignment with this strategy, we recently closed our acquisition of the [ Alusa ] bio envelope assets and announced our agreement to acquire Nalu Medical.\nOur legal reserve was $306 million as of September 30, with $46 million already funded through our qualified settlement funds.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full year 2025. We expect full year 2025 reported revenue growth of approximately 20%, excluding an approximate 100 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange. We expect full year 2025 operational revenue growth of approximately 19%. Excluding an approximate 350 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2025 organic revenue growth of approximately 15.5% versus 2024.\nWe expect fourth quarter 2025 reported revenue growth to be in the range of 14.5% to 16.5% and excluding an approximate 200 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, we expect operational growth to be in a range of 12.5% to 14.5% and excluding an approximate 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect fourth quarter 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 13% versus 2024.\nAs a result of our year-to-date margin performance, we now expect to expand full year adjusted operating margin by approximately 100 basis points at the high end of our prior range of 75 to 100 basis points and we continue to expect full year 2025 adjusted below-the-line expense to be approximately $440 million. We also maintain our forecast for a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5% and an operational tax rate of approximately 14%. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.02 to $3.04 and representing growth of 20% to 21% versus 2024. We continue to expect an approximate $0.04 foreign exchange headwind on full year adjusted earnings per share. And for Q4, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.77 to $0.79.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with our strong third quarter financial performance, and look forward to executing on our full year 2025 guidance and our long-range financial goals, which we shared at our recent Investor Day. From 2026 to 2028, we're targeting 10% plus average organic revenue growth, approximately 50 basis points of annual adjusted operating margin expansion, leverage double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth and 70% to 80% annual free cash flow conversion. We feel that these goals represent differentiated performance in med tech, and we look forward to executing on them.\nThank you all for joining us today. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for the third quarter 2025 financial and operational highlights, which provides more details on our results and updated guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A."

With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and John Monson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the Q&A session, Mike and John will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures. The release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.

Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our second quarter results outperformed our expectations, led by our Cardiovascular segment closing a phenomenal first half to 2025.\nIn second quarter '25, total company operational sales grew 22% and organic sales grew 17%, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 13% to 15% and far outpacing our underlying weighted average market growth rate. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.75 grew 23%, also exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.71 to $0.73, inclusive of charges related to the worldwide discontinuation of our ACURATE valve.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.6% -- turning to our third quarter and our full year '25 outlook. We're guiding to organic growth of 12% to 14% for third quarter '25 and raising our full year guidance from 12% to 14% to 14% to 15%, reflecting the momentum across our global businesses.\nOur third quarter adjusted EPS guide is $0.70 to $0.72, and we now expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.95 to $2.99, representing growth of 18% to 19%, inclusive of updated assumptions for tariffs and impact related to ACURATE.\nJohn will provide more details within the financial section. I'll now provide some additional highlights on the quarter. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 31%, driven by our category-leading and broad-based cardiovascular portfolio. Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 2% on an operational basis and 7% excluding the discontinuation of our ACURATE valve. As a reminder, the vast majority of the $200 million in ACURATE revenue was generated in EMEA.\nWithin EMEA, growth within the quarter was led by double-digit growth for FARAPULSE, WATCHMAN and Complex PCI. Asia Pacific grew 15% operationally, led by strong double-digit growth across our largest markets in the region, Japan, China and Australia. Japan grew high teens driven by FARAPULSE, which has moved into the leading position in PFA with over 15,000 patients treated since launch in Japan, supported by new account openings and the launch of FARAWAVE NAV.\nChina also returned to mid-teens growth in the second quarter with diversified growth across businesses led by FARAPULSE and IVIS. And we expect this mid-teens growth to continue in China in the second half of the year. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units. Urology sales grew 28% operationally and 6% organically. Growth in the quarter was driven by the stone management and prosthetic urology franchises with double-digit growth in Rezum, which received expanded indication for large glands in the U.S. within the quarter.\nIntegration of Axonics business has progressed well as we have worked through short-term commercial disruption and destocking in the first half of the year. Endoscopy delivered a strong quarter, growing 8% globally and double digits in the U.S. with global performance driven by strong growth in our anchor products, including EXALT-D, MANTisS, AXIOS and OverStitch, which saw notable growth from both ESG and closure procedures.\nIn the second half of the year, we expect continued high single-digit growth led by our proprietary technologies and strategic partnerships globally. Neuromodulation sales grew 7% in the quarter with mid-teens growth in our brain franchise, led by continued adoption of the CartesIAX-HX leads and Illumina 3D in the U.S., both of which drive optimized patient outcomes.\nThe pain franchise grew mid-single digits, led by strong double-digit growth in [ INTerCptT ], which surpassed 50,000 patients treated with our innovative technology backed by robust clinical evidence. Cardiology delivered another outstanding quarter with sales growing 28%. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology therapy sales grew 9% and excluding ACURATE grew very strong double digits. For the second half of 2025, we expect an approximate 800 basis point impact to iCTx growth in the second half from the discontinuation of ACURATE. Coronary therapy's high teens growth was driven by AGENT DCB and our global imaging portfolio, buoyed by additional support from the U.S. coronary societies upgrading intravascular imaging to a Class Ia recommendation for complex lesions, further validating its clinical value. In the U.S., AGN DCB growth accelerated with new account openings and strong reorders, supported by confidence in long-term reimbursement with permanent CPT I codes established in the quarter that will go into effect in January '27.\nWe continue to invest in expanding our portfolio and are pleased with the progress of our fracture trial, studying the Bolt IVL system in coronary patients, which is expected to complete enrollment by the first half of '26. Additionally, we closed the acquisition of Sony Be in the second quarter, which continued to enroll in the THRIVE IDE, a global randomized and sham-controlled study designed to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of the Tvis system in hypertensive patients. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 1%. In Q2, our diagnostic franchise grew low double digits, fueled by strong growth of our Lux-Dx ICM device with our latest generation Lux-Dx 2 launching in Europe in the quarter. In core CRM, our low-voltage business declined low single digits and our high-voltage business was roughly flat for the year.\nIn the second half, we do expect contribution from our expanded conduction system pacing portfolio in the U.S. and Europe and anticipate FDA approval of the EMPOWER leadless pacemaker by year-end. WATCHMAN grew 28% in this quarter, reflecting continued concomitant uptake in the U.S. and the strong safety profile of our latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which recently received CE Mark. We continue to invest in further in the LAAC market, including the development of our fourth-generation WATCHMAN device, which we anticipate initiating the IDE trial for next year.\nWe continue to see considerable physician interest in concomitant procedures with over 60% of WATCHMAN implanting EPs in the U.S. having performed a concomitant procedure. Recently, we enrolled our first patient in the OPTION-A trial, studying concomitant use of WATCHMAN and FARAPULSE in Asia. We also received expanded labeling for WATCHMAN as a first-line therapy in post-ablation patients in the U.S. following the positive OPTION data, supporting continued confidence in our long-term outlook.\nElectrophysiology sales grew 94%, lapping our first full quarter of the FARAPULSE launch in the U.S. and growing mid-teens sequentially, supported by accelerated placements of the OPA mapping system, our portfolio of access solutions and uptake of concomitant procedures. Global momentum continued through the quarter, driven by the safety, predictability and versatility of the FARAPULSE device, particularly in de novo AFib ablations for paroxysmal and persistent AF, which we recently received expanded labeling in the U.S. We anticipate CE Mark as well as approval in Japan and China for this expanded labeling in the coming months.\nWe continue to invest in clinical evidence to expand the served patient population with our FARAPULSE technology, including the recent initiation of the REMATCH AF trial designed to study FARAWAVE and FARAPOINT in redo persistent AF patients. which currently represent approximately 1/3 of AF ablations. Also within the quarter, we announced positive 12-month primary endpoint results from the second phase of the ADVANG-AF trial, which will be used to support approval of the FARAPONT PFA catheter as an adjunct technology to treat atrial flutter in patients with persistent Afib, which we expect to receive by year-end '25. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 17% operationally and 7% organically.\nOur Interventional Oncology and embolization franchise grew strong double digits, led by our broad embolization and cancer therapies portfolio. In the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Entera Medical, strengthening our interventional oncology portfolio by adding a complementary therapy to expand our offerings to treat both primary and metastatic forms of liver cancer. Within our vascular franchise, we saw low single-digit growth in arterial with low single-digit drug-eluting growth driven by our participation in the China VBP, which we anticipate will result in our ability to serve more patients across China. In venous, we did see strong double-digit growth led by continued strength in Varithena and notable growth in ECOS, particularly internationally.\nWe continue to be pleased with the integration of Silk Road, which we expect to improve growth in the second half of the year, driven by a stabilization and investment of the commercial team. In closing, I'm very proud of the commercial execution of our high-performing global team and both in the near- and long-term growth catalysts across our businesses, which we look forward to sharing more details at our upcoming Investor Day on September 30 in New York City. With that, I'll hand over to John to provide more details on the financials.\n\nJonathan R. Monson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nSecond quarter consolidated revenue of $5.061 billion represents 22.8% reported growth versus second quarter 2024 and includes a 120 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, which was favorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $50 million foreign exchange tailwind, operational revenue growth was 21.6% in the quarter.\nSales impact from closed acquisitions contributed 420 basis points, resulting in 17.4% organic revenue growth, exceeding our second quarter guidance range of 13% to 15%. Q2 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 grew 23% versus 2024, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.71 to $0.73, primarily driven by our strong sales performance in the quarter.\nAdjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 69.4%, representing a 100 basis point decline versus the second quarter of 2024, driven by the negative impact from inventory charges related to the worldwide discontinuation of our ACURATE valve. Based on the current schedule of expected tariffs, we now anticipate a full year headwind of approximately $100 million, down from our approximate $200 million estimate that we provided on our Q1 earnings call. We continue to expect full year adjusted gross margin to be roughly in line with 2024. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.6%, expanding 50 basis points versus the second quarter of 2024, driven by strong drop-through on our top line performance and smart spend controls, offsetting the charges related to ACURATE.\nOn a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margin was 16.2%. Moving to below the line. Second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $110 million, slightly unfavorable to our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 12.6%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate was 14.2% for the second quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.494 billion shares in the second quarter.\nFree cash flow for the second quarter was $1.129 billion with $1.286 billion from operating activities, less $157 million in net capital expenditures. We now expect full year 2025 free cash flow to be approximately $3.5 billion. As of June 30, 2025, we had cash on hand of $534 million. And during the quarter, we were pleased to receive a credit rating upgrade from Moody's to A3. And with this upgrade, we now hold A- equivalent credit ratings from all 3 major agencies.\nOur gross debt leverage ratio was 2.1x. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A and high-growth adjacencies, followed by share repurchases. And in alignment with this strategy, we recently closed the acquisitions of Sona and Entera Oncology, which complement our existing Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions businesses, respectively. Our legal reserve was $300 million as of June 30, with $47 million of this reserve already funded through our qualified settlement funds.\nI will now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2025. We now expect full year 2025 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 18% to 19% versus 2024. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2025 operational growth to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5%.\nExcluding a 350 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 15% versus 2024. We expect third quarter 2025 reported revenue growth to be in the range of 17% to 19%. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect third quarter 2025 operational growth to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%. Excluding an approximate 450 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect third quarter 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 14%.\nBased on our first half margin performance, we now expect to expand full year adjusted operating margin by 75 to 100 basis points while increasing our level of investment in R&D to fuel durable, differentiated revenue growth. We now expect full year 2025 adjusted below-the-line expense to be approximately $440 million.\nUnder current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance, we forecast a full year 2025 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%. For 2026, we had previously forecasted a 200 to 300 basis point headwind to our tax rate, driven by changes to certain provisions scheduled under the TCJA.\nWith the recent passage of the OBBB, this anticipated headwind has largely been eliminated. We'll share more specific 2026 tax rate guidance on our Q4 2025 earnings call. We expect full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.95 to $2.99, representing growth of 18% to 19% versus 2024, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange.\nWe expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.70 to $0.72. In closing, I'm pleased with our strong second quarter financial performance and look forward to executing on our full year guidance of 14% to 15% organic revenue growth, 75 to 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 18% to 19% adjusted earnings per share growth. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2025 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2025 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, John. Drew, let's open up for questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 related follow-up. Please go ahead."

[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Monson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan R Monson\n\nSenior VP, Global Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Drew, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this release.\nThe release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please note, on the call, all operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes certain acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\nGuidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire SoniVie and Entera Oncology, which are expected to close during the second quarter of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to the Q1 financial and operational highlights deck, which may be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nOn this call, all references to sales and revenue are organic and relative growth as compared to the same quarter of the prior year, unless otherwise specified. This call contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our financial performance, business plans and product performance and development. These statements are based on our current beliefs using information available to us as of today's date and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance.\nIf our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from those projected by the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences are discussed in our periodic reports and other filings with the SEC, including the Risk Factors section of our most recent annual report on Form 10-K.\nBoston Scientific disclaims any intention or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nSo at this point, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, John. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In Q1, we delivered excellent results, all while we continue to invest in our highly innovative portfolio and capabilities. Importantly, we remain excited about our near and long-term growth catalysts, which we believe will enable us to deliver on our fundamental aim of driving consistent differentiated performance this year and well beyond.\nIn first quarter '25, total company operational sales grew 22% and organic sales grew 18%, both exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 14% to 16%. Our strong growth continues to reflect the durability of our category leadership strategy, which is powered through the meaningful innovation, clinical evidence generation and the winning spirit of our highly engaged global team. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.75 grew 34%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.66 to $0.68.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating margin was 28.9%. Turning to our second quarter and full year '25 outlook, we are guiding to organic growth of 13% to 15% for the second quarter '25 and raising our full year guidance from 10% to 12% growth to 12% to 14% organic growth, reflecting the significant strength in our broad-based cardiology portfolio and the global execution of our category leadership strategy across our business units.\nOur second quarter adjusted EPS guidance of $0.71 to $0.73, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS and to be $2.87 to $2.94, which represents growth of 14% to 17%. This also includes an approximate $200 million impact from tariffs. Based on the information that is available today which we expect to offset through sales upside and smart reductions in discretionary spending. Dan will provide more details on this within the financials.\nWe remain committed to our diversified global manufacturing footprint, investing across all regions and notably within the U.S., where we recently opened our new site in Georgia, continue to increase our Minnesota manufacturing capacity and footprint to support long-term growth.\nI'll now provide some additional highlights on our first quarter results. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 31% with double-digit growth in 5 of our 8 business units. Midway through Q1, we crossed the 1-year mark of the U.S. FARAPULSE launch and the 10-year anniversary of WATCHMAN's approval, 2 clinically impactful technologies that have helped to transform the growth profile of Boston Scientific. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 8% on an operational basis. This above-market growth was led by exceptional performance in EP as well as double-digit growth in our anchor technologies across the broader portfolio, including complex PCI, TheraSphere and Interventional Oncology, Axios and resume.\nAsia Pacific grew 11% operationally, led by double-digit growth in Japan. Japan is on track to have an excellent year led by strong FARAPULSE uptake. We continue to anticipate launching FARAWAVE NAV and Fairview in the second half of the year. China also delivered high single-digit growth off a very tough 42% growth comp in first quarter '24 and we anticipate to deliver double-digit growth despite ongoing VBP pricing impacts in China.\nI'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units. As a reminder, we did have one less selling day in the first quarter of which impacted our growth by approximately 200 basis points. Urology sales grew 25% on an operational basis and 4% organically. Growth in the quarter was driven by our core stone franchise, and we're pleased to have completed our first [indiscernible] fluid management case in Chile. The service system is part of our interconnected StoneSmart ecosystem, and we expect U.S. clearance in the second half of '25.\nLooking ahead, we continue to be excited by the differentiated value Axonics brings and our ability to more broadly serve our customers as we are pleased with the integration progress to date. Endoscopy sales grew 6%, both operationally and organically with balanced growth regionally and across our broad and deep portfolio. we continue to see sustained double-digit performance with our clinically differentiated Axios platform as well as double-digit growth at both OverStitch and Mantis clip, 2 very innovative technologies in our growing endoluminal surgery franchise.\nNeuromodulation sales grew 7% in the first quarter, with mid-single-digit growth in our brain franchise and high single-digit growth in our pain franchise. Within DBS, we saw improving growth exiting the quarter, driven by early contribution, the launch of our Cartesia leads and acceleration of the Illumina 3D programming algorithm in the U.S. Within our pain portfolio, Intercept grew strong double digits and we continue to see robust demand underpinned by 5-year data demonstrating the long-term efficacy and cost effectiveness of this treatment.\nCardiology delivered another fantastic quarter with sales growing 31%. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology Therapies sales grew an impressive 9%, and coronary therapies was driven globally by double-digit growth in our imaging franchise and excellent performance from our novel agent DCB technology. In the U.S., agent DCB momentum was fueled by strong reorder rates and new account openings with additional reimbursement established in the outpatient setting as of January, and incremental inpatient reimbursement expected to follow later this year.\nWithin the quarter, we're also pleased to present the rideasibility results of our VITALYST Circuitory support system with data demonstrating positive early experience and 100% technical success rate. In addition, we recently announced our agreement to acquire SoniVie, which has developed a clinical stage differentiated ultrasound-based renal [indiscernible] technology. We look forward to closing this acquisition, which we expect in Q2 this year. WATCHMAN grew 24% this quarter, reflecting robust market growth and an increase in our market share driven by strong concomitant uptake. With over half of our U.S. EP implanting customers now have been performing at least one [indiscernible] procedure.\nWe continue to invest in global clinical evidence, most recently initiating the Option A trial in Asia Pacific, assessing the effectiveness of FARAPULSE and WATCHMAN in a concomitant procedure. Within the quarter in the U.S., we completed the full conversion of WATCHMAN FLEX PRO which is our third generation and market-leading technology, and we remain committed to increasing patient awareness and advancing physician training and workflow optimization.\nLooking ahead, we expect the U.S. label update for WATCHMAN as a first-line alternative to OACs in post-ablation patients in the second half of '25 and the CHAMPION AF data readout in the first half of '26. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 1% in the first quarter. Our diagnostics franchise grew high single digits, led by double-digit growth in our [indiscernible] category. In core CRM, our low-voltage business grew high single digits, and the high-voltage business declined low single digits.\nWe've expanded our conduction system pacing offering with the recent launch of next-gen lead delivery catheters which will provide physicians with additional tools to target the left bundle branch area of the heart. And further, we anticipate FDA approval in power levels pacemaker in the second half of '25. Electrophysiology sales grew 145% with fantastic performance across the globe. Globally, we are now the #2 clear player in EP, and we intend to continue to expand our leadership position in PFA through clinical evidence, next-generation innovation, new offerings to fill portfolio gaps and commercial capabilities.\nWithin the quarter, we saw high commercial demand for FARAPULSE with strong sales in established accounts and rapid new account openings as the global market continues to convert to PFA given the compelling safety, efficacy and efficiency profile. And earlier this month, results from the investigator-sponsored single-shot CHAMPION clinical trial demonstrate that FARAPULSE achieved superior effectiveness for the treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal AF versus cryoablation.\nImportantly, this is the first prospective randomized demonstration of PFA superiority over any thermal ablation modality. We also continue to see strong adoption of our Opel HDX integrated mapping solution, which provides operators enhanced visualization and confirmation of pulse field applications. In first quarter, we completed enrollment in the AVANGAR trial, which studies a new patient population of drug-naive persistent AF patients. We also initiated and completed the first human case in the ELEVATE-PF trial, sliding the FARAFLEX [indiscernible] catheter, which is our large focal high-density map and blade catheter that integrates for the Opel HDX mapping system.\nAnd tomorrow, data from the ADVANTAGE Phase II trial studying [indiscernible] will be read out at the PFA live case Summit ahead of HRS, which we expect to support U.S. FDA approval by year-end '25. Also, peripheral interventions grew an impressive 16% operationally and 7% organically. Our Interventional Oncology and embolization franchise grew double digits across the portfolio driven by a broad offering of embolization devices and cancer therapy technologies. In the quarter, we received FDA approval to expand the patient population and study additional areas in the brain in the frontier trial. An early feasibility study for the use of TheraSphere to treat recurrent caleoblastoma.\nWe look forward to expanding our portfolio of offerings in this high-growth space and continue to expect the acquisition of Antero Oncology to close in the second quarter. Within our vascular franchise, we saw mid-single-digit growth in arterial and double-digit growth in venous in the first quarter. And earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Bolt Medical and also received FDA clearance of the IVL system for above-the-knee indication. We aim to initiate a limited launch by the end of '25 as we ramp supply following the acquisition close and earlier-than-anticipated regulatory approval.\nOn the coronary front, we continue to progress the fracture trial, now having enrolled patients in the U.S. Before I turn the call over, as you saw in our press release this morning, Dan Brennan has decided to retire from Boston Scientific after an outstanding 30-year career, including the last 12 years as our CFO. He will be succeeded by John Monson, who you know from his time leading Investor Relations at the end of June this year.\nLauren Tengler will return to Investor Relations and succeed John. I would like to personally thank Dan for his leadership, his great friendship and his many contributions over his remarkable career. Dan has been instrumental in transforming the trajectory of our financial performance and building the strong culture and values that are embedded throughout Boston Scientific. Thank you, Dan.\nAnd in closing, I'm grateful to our talented team of global employees who work every day to advance science for life, and I'm confident in the sustainability of our top-tier financial performance. With that, I'll turn it over to Dan.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike, and thanks for the kind words. First quarter consolidated revenue of $4.663 billion represents 20.9% reported growth versus first quarter 2024 and includes a 130 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was unfavorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $49 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 22.2% in the quarter. .\nSales impact from closed acquisitions contributed 400 basis points, resulting in 18.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our first quarter guidance range of 14% to 16%. Q1 2025 adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 grew 34% versus 2024, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.66 to $0.68, primarily driven by our strong sales performance in the quarter.\nAdjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 71.5%, which represents a 170 basis point improvement versus the first quarter of 2024. This strong performance was primarily driven by favorable product mix in the quarter. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 28.9%, this was favorable to our expectations due to our strong gross margin performance and timing of internal investments planned for the year.\nOn a GAAP basis, first quarter operating margin was 19.8%. Moving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $106 million. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 9.8%, which includes favorable discrete tax items related to the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 13.6% for the quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,493 million shares in the first quarter. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $354 million, with $541 million from operating activities, less $187 million in net capital expenditures.\nWe continue to expect full year 2025 free cash flow to be in excess of $3 billion. As of March 31, 2025, we had cash on hand of $725 million. We used $1 billion of the $1.5 billion euro-denominated senior note offering completed on February '26 to repay approximately $1 billion of 1 billion of euro-denominated notes that matured in March 2025. During the quarter, we were pleased to receive credit rating upgrades to single A- from both Standard & Poor's and Fitch ratings. Our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.2x.\nOur top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases. In alignment with the strategy, we recently closed the acquisition of Bolt Medical, which complements our existing interventional cardiology and peripheral portfolios. We expect to offset the associated earnings per share dilution through internal cost efficiencies and trade-offs. Our legal reserve was $316 million as of March 31, with $48 million of this reserve already funded through our qualified settlement funds.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and full year 2025. We now expect full year 2025 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 15% to 17% versus 2024. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect full year 2025 operational growth to be in a range of 15.5% to 17.5%. Excluding a 350 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 12% to 14% versus 2024. We expect second quarter 2025 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 17.5% to 19.5% with a neutral impact from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding a 450 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect second quarter 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus 2024.\nWe now expect full year adjusted gross margin to be roughly in line with 2024, reflecting the impact of newly enacted tariffs. Despite this headwind, we remain on track to deliver 50 to 75 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion for the year. We continue to expect full year 2025 adjusted below the line expenses to be approximately $425 million. Under current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance, we continue to forecast a full year 2025 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%.\nWe expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.87 to $2.94, representing growth of 14% to 17% versus 2024, including an approximate $0.04 to $0.05 headwind from foreign exchange. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.71 to $0.73.\nBefore I turn it back to John, I want to address the evolving trade environment. With the current schedule of expected tariffs, we forecast an approximate $200 million impact in 2025. We expect to fully offset this $200 million unanticipated headwind through our full year organic sales guidance raise, targeted discretionary spend reductions and a $0.01 FX benefit. Additionally, tariffs are capitalized in the inventory and recognized in the P&L over the course of finished goods inventory turns. Therefore, the Q2 impact from tariffs will be minimal, and we expect to see most of the tariff impact in the second half of the year. These effects are fully contemplated in the guidance ranges we are sharing today.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank my Boston Scientific teammates over the nearly 30 years for making this such an extraordinary place to call home. Special thanks to Mike for choosing me for this role 12 years ago. I've thoroughly enjoyed our collaborations. I'm thrilled for John as he assumes the CFO role, and I look forward to seeing all the great things he and the team will accomplish for physicians, patients, BSC teammates and investors in the years to come.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to John.\n\nJonathan R Monson\n\nSenior VP, Global Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks so much, Dan. Well, Drew, let's open up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so in order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question. Drew, please go ahead."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jon Monson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nThank you, Drew, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. With me today are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year 2024 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this release. The release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. Please note that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\nGuidance excludes the previously announced agreements to acquire Bolt Medical and Intera Oncology, which are expected to close in the first half of 2025 subject to customary closing conditions.

Boston Scientific disclaims any intention or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nGreat. Well then, Jon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In 2024, we had an excellent performance across the board, surpassing our financial goals that we set for the year. This outstanding and differentiated performance is fueled by innovation and great execution across our global business units and the earlier-than-expected approval in an adoption of FARAPULSE in the U.S. In fourth quarter '24, company operational sales grew 23% and organic sales grew 20%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 14% to 16%. Full year 24 operational sales grew 18.5%, while organic sales grew 16% for the year, exceeding our guidance of approximately 15%. We believe that most of our global business units grew in line or faster than their respective markets in '24, which is a testament to our broad diversified product portfolio and the winning spirit of our global teams.\nFourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.70 grew 26%, which exceeded the high end of guidance range of $0.64 to $0.66. Full year adjusted EPS of $2.51 grew 22%, also exceeding the high-end range of our guidance of $2.45 to $2.47. For the year, we drove 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin to 27% and representing a balance of margin drop-through on the revenue upside we saw throughout the year, along with the reinvestment back into the business to drive long-term differentiated growth. For our '25 outlook, we expect our differentiated financial performance to continue, fueled by our innovative portfolio and strong global execution, and we're guiding to organic growth of 14% to 16% for the first quarter and 10% to 12% for the full year. Our first quarter '25 adjusted EPS guide is $0.66 to $0.68 and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.80 to $2.87 representing growth of 12% to 14%. Dan will provide more details on the financials, and I'll now provide some additional highlights of '24.\nSo regionally, on operational basis, the U.S. grew 31% for the fourth quarter. Full year 2024 was 21% with double-digit growth in 6 of our 8 business units. On an operational basis, Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 12% in the fourth quarter and 14% on the full year. In '24, we saw above-market growth from all business units supported by strong commercial execution, talking about Europe here, and key franchises across the portfolio as well as price discipline. We expect to outpace the market again in '25 with further momentum in EP following the recent approval of FARAWAVE NAV and increasing contribution from our growth in emerging markets. In Asia Pac, we grew 12% operationally in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, led by excellent performance and double-digit growth across Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand.\nJapan really had a nice year, growing double digits for the second year in a row, driven by AGENT DCB, Rezum, WATCHMAN FLEX Pro and very early contribution from FARAPULSE. On a full year basis, China grew strong double digits across $1 million in revenue. This differentiated growth in China was fueled by our broad portfolio, focus on innovation and excellent commercial execution. Looking ahead, we expect China to grow mid-teens with increasing contribution from FARAPULSE in our diverse portfolio despite the ongoing DBP pricing pressures in the region. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our businesses. Starting with Urology, which grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year and an operational basis grew 20% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the full year following the number close of Axonics. Full year organic growth is fueled by prosthetic urology and stone management, where we had key launches with the TENACIO pump for the AMS 700 and continued success with our expanding LithoVue portfolio.\nProstate Health also performed well in '24 with double-digit growth in Rezum as well as strong performance in SpaceOAR, we're pleased to have enrolled our first patient in the hydro space trial, evaluating the safety efficacy of our space hydrogen. In '25, we expect to see continued strong above-market growth for urology and look forward to further integrating the highly complementary Axonics Technologies into our portfolio. Endoscopy sales grew 8% operationally and 7% in the fourth quarter organically on a full year basis, grew 9% operationally and 8% organically. Full year growth was led by double-digit growth in our endoluminal surgery and single-use imaging franchises, along with sustained growth of our AXIOS platform, where we're investing to drive expanded indications and most recently received an approval in Japan for AXIOS for gall bladder drainage. Within endoluminal surgery, we continue to see positive reimbursement wins for our ESG weight loss procedure with the recent Category 1 CPT code announced and now IFSO, an International Bariatric Committee endorsing ESG with guideline updates.\nNeuromodulation sales grew 12% operationally and 5% organic in Q4, and on a full year basis grew 14% operationally and 3% organically. Our brain franchise grew mid-single digits in both the quarter and on a full year basis, and our pain franchise grew mid-single digits in the quarter and low single digits for the year. Within deep brain stimulation, we expect improving growth in 2025 with the recent FDA and CE Mark approvals of our unique Cartesia X and HX leads. The first and only 16 contact directional leads that deliver precise personalized therapy. We also expect higher growth in our pain franchise in '25, driven by continued strong momentum in Intercept and the recently released data supporting safety, effectiveness and durability through 5 years now. Cardiology delivered an exceptional quarter and year with sales growing 32% in the fourth quarter and 25% for the full year.\nWithin cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies, sales grew 10% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year. And on a full year basis, the coronary therapies franchise growth was driven by strong global performance and our imaging and complex PCI franchises and earlier momentum with the U.S. launch of agent DCB, which now has additional reimbursement in the outpatient setting. In addition, we recently announced our agreement to acquire Bolt Medical an intravascular lithotripsy platform for treatment of coronary and peripheral artery disease. Bolt's IVL technology is highly synergistic with our existing suite of devices in complex PCI, imaging and drug-eluting portfolios in both ICTX and PI. And we're excited to close the Bolt acquisition, which we expect to do so in the first half of this year.\nOur structural heart valves franchise grew double digits for the full year and low single digits in fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we launched our next-generation accurate Prime Valve in Europe, which features frame enhancements, a simplified deployment mechanism and includes a larger valve size. WATCHMAN sales grew 20% in the fourth quarter and 19% on a full year basis. U.S. fourth quarter growth of 20% was bolstered by an increase in concomitant procedures enabled by the new DRG which became effective in October and positive data from our option trial demonstrating similar stroke risk reduction with superior bleed risk reduction versus OACs in high-risk patients following AF ablation. These positive outcomes from OPTION were reaffirmed by data in the concomitant subset of patients, which was recently presented at the AF symposium.\nWe're pleased with the performance of our WATCHMAN business in 2024 and expect this market to continue to grow approximately 20% driven by concomitant procedures, ongoing clinical evidence and our initiatives to drive patient awareness and physician training. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 3% in the quarter and on a full year basis. Our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits on a full year base in outpatient market growth driven by our implantable cardiac monitors with early contribution from our LUX-Dx II launch in Europe. In Core CRM, in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, both our high end and low voltage business grew low single digits, and as we look ahead, we're excited to bring our EMPOWER leadless pacemaker and module the CM system to market in '25 likely in the second half of the year. Electrophysiology sales grew 172% in fourth quarter and 139% on a full year basis. FARAPULSE has continued to lead the transformation of the AFib market, surpassing $1 billion in revenue in 2024 globally, with over 200,000 patients treated.\nAnd we expect the AF market to continue to rapidly convert to PFA in '25 and beyond, driven by FARAPULSE. Exceptional fourth quarter sales performance was driven by FARAPULSE uptake in the U.S. and Europe as a result of very strong safety profile, ease of use and procedural efficiency as well as our launches in both Japan and China. Initial feedback on our integrated system of FARAWAVE NAV on our OPAL mapping system, which we launched during the fourth quarter in the U.S. has been very positive. We expect to continue to enhance our capabilities in this segment of the market, including with our recently closed acquisition of Cortex an advanced AF mapping solution. We continue to build a best-in-class compendium clinical evidence, including the recent results of Phase I of the ADVANTAGE AF trial, with data demonstrating positive outcomes using FARAPULSE and persistent AF patients meeting the primary endpoint for efficacy and safety with 0 instances of stroke, pulmonary vein stenosis, esophageal injury or major access complications.\nWe expect an updated label for persistent AF in the second half of the year. In the coming weeks, we expect to complete the enrollment of AVANT GUARD evaluating the safety and efficacy of FARAPULSE as a first-line treatment for persistent AF compared to anti-rhythmic drug therapy. Additionally, we anticipate data to be presented in the first half of this year from Phase II of the ADVANTAGE AF trial, evaluating FARAPOINT, which is our point-by-point PFA ablation catheter, which is expected to support U.S. FDA approval by year-end '25. Turning to Peripheral Interventions. Fourth quarter sales grew 22% operationally and 12% organically on a full year basis, grew 15% operationally and 11% organic. Our Interventional Oncology and embolization franchise excelled again in Q4 with double-digit growth across the entire product portfolio and growing mid-teens for the full year. Expanding clinical evidence for new indications continues to be a focus area are pleased to have completed enrollment in the first phase of the Frontier trial, which is an early feasibility study for the use of TheraSphere to treat recurrent glioblastoma.\nAdditionally, we look forward to closing our acquisition of Intera expected in the first half of 2025, which will broaden our interventional oncology offerings to patients with liver cancer. Within our vascular franchise on a full year basis, we saw high single-digit arterial performance led by double-digit growth in our drug-eluting portfolio in mid-single-digit venous growth, led by Varithena and our clot management portfolio. On a stand-alone basis, the silicon business grew double digits for the full year, and we're pleased to recently share the 30-day results from the ROADSTER 3 study, which demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of TCAR for patients with standard surgical risk. So in closing, I'm very proud of our global team and what we were able to accomplish in 2024, resulting in full year organic growth of 16% adjusted EPS growth of 22%. We're very excited about the future of Boston Scientific and remain focused on our talent while enhancing our culture that is relentless in driving differentiated results. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike. Fourth quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4.561 billion represents 22.4% reported growth versus fourth quarter 2023 and includes a 70 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was unfavorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $26 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 23.1% in the quarter. Sales impact from closed acquisitions contributed 360 basis points, resulting in 19.5% organic revenue growth, exceeding our fourth quarter guidance range of 14% to 16%. Q4 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.70 grew 26% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.64 to $0.66, primarily driven by our strong sales performance and favorable tax results in the quarter. Full year 2024 consolidated revenue of $16.747 billion represents 17.6% reported growth versus full year 2023 and includes a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding this $127 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth for the year was 18.5%.\nSales from closed acquisitions contributed 210 basis points, resulting in 16.4% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of approximately 15%. Full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $2.51 grew 22% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $2.45 to $2.47. These results include a $0.05 headwind from FX, which was slightly unfavorable to our expectations. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.6%, which represents a 20 basis point sequential improvement versus the third quarter and results in full year 2024 adjusted gross margin of 70.3%. In 2025, we anticipate our full year adjusted gross margin will improve versus the full year 2024 and contribute to our adjusted operating margin expansion goals. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, and resulting in a full year 2024 adjusted operating margin of 27.0%, improving 70 basis points versus the full year 2023.\nWe expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2025 by another 50 to 75 basis points, balancing differentiated operating margin expansion while making targeted investments to fuel long-term top line growth. On a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating margin was 14.8%, resulting in a full year reported operating margin of 15.5%. Moving to below the line. Fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $87 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expenses of $301 million, in line with our expectations.\nOn an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10.5% and 11.9% for the full year 2024, including favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 13.2% for the full year, again, in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.409 billion shares in Q4 and 1.486 billion shares for the full year 2024. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.181 billion with $1.456 billion from operating activities, less $275 million in net capital expenditures, which include payments of $177 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items.\nFull year 2024 free cash flow was $2.648 billion, exceeding our expectations, and importantly, achieving 71% free cash flow conversion for the year. For 2025, we expect full year free cash flow to be in excess of $3 billion. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $414 million, and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.2x. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A followed by annual share repurchases. Our legal reserve was $326 million as of December 31, representing a $76 million increase versus Q3 2024, $50 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I will now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2025. We expect full year 2025 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 12.5% to 14.5% versus 2024.\nExcluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect full year 2025 operational growth to be in a range of 13.5% to 15.5%. Excluding a 350 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2024. We expect first quarter 2025 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 17% to 19% versus the first quarter of 2024, excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates. We expect first quarter 2025 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 18% to 20%. Excluding a 400 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2025 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 14% to 16% versus 2024.\nAs we indicated on our October call, we had 1 more business day in the fourth quarter of 2024, which was worth approximately 200 basis points. In the first quarter of 2025, we have 1 less business day, again, worth approximately 200 basis points. When adjusting for the impact of business days, the high end of our first quarter 2025 guidance range is in line with fourth quarter 2024 organic revenue growth. We expect full year 2025 adjusted below the line expense to be approximately $425 million.\nUnder current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance, we forecast a full year 2025 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%. This includes a benefit from the accounting for stock compensation, which we expect will be largely recognized in the first quarter, resulting in a forecasted Q1 2025 adjusted tax rate of approximately 11.5%. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.80 to $2.87, representing growth of 12% to 14% versus 2024, and including an approximate $0.05 to $0.06 headwind from foreign exchange, which is in line with what we saw in 2024.\nWe expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.66 to $0.68. As it relates to tariffs, we do not have significant levels of manufacturing in or sourcing from Mexico, Canada or China, as such, while the recent executive actions relative to these countries could present a minor headwind for the year we view these headwinds as manageable and they have been contemplated in our guidance ranges. In closing, I'm extremely proud of what our global team delivered for 2024 financial performance and look forward to executing on our full year 2025 guidance of 10% to 12% organic revenue growth, 50 to 75 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 12% to 14% adjusted EPS growth.\nFor more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 results and 2025 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who'll moderate the Q&A.\n\nJonathan R Monson\n\nSenior VP, Global Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to 1 question. Drew, please go ahead."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Monson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan R Monson\n\nSenior VP, Global Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Drew, and welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in this release. We have posted a link to that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.\nThe duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q2 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q3 and full year 2024 guidance and then we'll take your questions.\nDuring today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and organic revenue further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\nRelevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded organic growth are the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and the acquisitions of Apollo Endosurgery and Relievant Medsystems, which closed in February, April and November 2023, respectively, as well as our acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio from BBron, which closed in March 2024.\nDivestiture include the endoscopy, pathology business, which closed in April 2023. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreements to acquire Axonics and Sicobe Medical both of which are expected to close in the second half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to the Q2 financial and operational highlights deck, which may be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.\nOn this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use of cash, our financial performance, including sales, margins as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.\nIf our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC.\nThis statement speaks only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them, except as required by law. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, John, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our second quarter results exceeded our expectations, led by the strength of our differentiated global cardiovascular portfolio, particularly the execution in [ AF ] Solutions and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter, total company operational sales grew 16%. Organic sales grew 15%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 10% to 12%. Our top-tier growth continues to be fueled by innovation, clinical evidence generation and our strategy of category leadership. Consistent with prior quarters, most of our businesses and regions grew well above market.\nSecond quarter adjusted EPS of $0.62 grew 15% versus versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, and as a result of our first half margin performance and revenue upside versus previous expectations, we now expect to expand adjusted operating margin 50 to 70 basis points for the full year.\nTurning to the third quarter and full year '24 outlook. We're guiding to organic growth of 13% to 15% for third quarter and raising our full year guidance from 10% to 12% to 13% to 14%, reflecting momentum across our broad portfolio, particularly in our EP business unit. Our third quarter adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.38 to $2.42, representing growth of 16% to 18%.\nDan will provide more details on our financials, and I'll provide some additional color on the quarter and the outlook for the second half of '24. Regionally on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 17% in the second quarter with exceptional growth in EP, fueled by the continued success of the FARAPULSE launch as well as WATCHMAN, coronary imaging and strengthen our MedSurg businesses. Europe grew 16% on an operational basis versus second quarter '23. This impressive performance was driven by double-digit growth in 7 of our 8 business units, led by robust growth in [indiscernible] and strength across our growth in emerging markets.\nSecond quarter was also a record quarter in the region for our structural heart business, following positive data presented on ACURATE NEO 2 at the recent EuroPCR conference. We expect this momentum to continue supported by the launch of the larger size ACURATE Prime valve in late '24. Asia Pac grew 13% operationally versus a difficult comp in second quarter '23 with excellent performance in China, growing high teens and Japan growing double digits.\nWe also recently received approval in China for FARAPULSE and agent drug-coated balloon and continue to expect approval for FARAPULSE in Japan in the second half of this year. We expect the contribution from these launches will ramp over 2025. Within the quarter, pricing actions in key geographies went into effect with a China VBP on coronary imaging and Japan reimbursement cuts in June. We do expect Asia Pac to grow low double digits in the second half of the year, including the full impact of these pricing actions.\nSome additional commentary on the business units. Our urology business grew 9% organically in the quarter with double-digit growth in stone management and prosthetic urology, supported by our direct-to-patient efforts driving patient awareness and early contribution from the limited market release of the Tonacio pump. International growth of 14% was driven by laser therapies and Rezûm. We look forward to closing this previously announced acquisition of Axonics, which we continue to expect in the second half of this year.\nEndoscopy sales grew 8%, both operationally and organically in second quarter. Second quarter results were driven by above-market growth in our [indiscernible] franchise led by high-teens growth in Axios and the high teens growth in our endoluminal surgery franchise. We continue to expect Endo sales to grow faster than the market throughout '24, enabled by our innovative portfolio. Neuromodulation sales grew 16% operationally and 4% organically in the quarter. Our brain franchise grew low single digits with some impact from competitive product launches.\nWe expect this business to strengthen in the second half of the year, driven by our portfolio of differentiated technologies. In second quarter, our pain franchise grew strong double digits operationally and mid-single digits on an organic basis. Our spinal cord stim business saw improved U.S. trialing cadence in the quarter, and we expect that our U.S. SCS franchise will improve in the second half of the year.\nThe relieving business continues to perform extremely well, with more than 30,000 patients treated with the Intracept system to date. Peripheral Intervention sales grew 12% operationally and 9% organically versus second quarter. High single-digit growth in arterial was driven by continued momentum in our drug-eluting portfolio with double-digit growth in the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Venous was driven by momentum of ECO supported by the real PE data set and continued double-digit growth in Varithena.\nOur Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits in the second quarter, driven by our broad offering across embolization and cancer therapies. Looking forward, we continue to expect to close the previously announced acquisition of Silk Road Medical in the second half of this year.\nCardiology. Cardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growing 22% versus second quarter '23. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew 9%. Growth in coronary therapies was driven by continued strength in our global imaging franchise and APAC calcium franchise. Within the quarter, we initiated a limited launch of agent DCB in the U.S., which has received positive initial physician feedback.\nOur structural heart valves franchise grew strong double digits in the second quarter, led by ACURATE neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts in Europe and Latin America. At the end of the quarter, we also completed a follow-up of the full 1,500 patient cohort in the U.S. ACURATE IDE trial. We now expect to present this data in the first half of 2025 likely at the annual ACC meeting.\nWATCHMAN had another excellent quarter, growing 20% organically, with strong contribution from the ongoing launch of WATCHMAN FLX Pro in the U.S. and Japan. The U.S. grew 20% led by further [indiscernible] penetration into the existing indicated patient population enabled by our innovation, clinical evidence and patient awareness efforts. Cardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 3% organically in the quarter.\nIn the second quarter, our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits. This above-market growth was driven by our broad cardiac diagnostics portfolio. In core CM, a high- and low-voltage business grew low single digits, with strong international growth, partially offset by slightly below market growth in the U.S. At the recent HRS meeting, data was presented from the modular ATP trial of the modular CRM system, which is comprised of the EMPOWER leadless pacemaker and EMBLEM S-ICD, which met all prespecified 6-month endpoints and a high rate of ATP's success with no patient request for deactivation of pacing due to pain or discomfort.\nTurning to EP. EP sales grew an impressive 125% organically versus second quarter '23 driven by the rapid and sustained adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE PFA system. Second quarter sales were driven by outstanding commercial execution, robust supply and positive real-world outcomes as well as increased AF ablation volumes, supported by the efficiency of the FARAPULSE workflow. Our Baylis Access Solutions business also continues to see strong double-digit growth in the U.S., with utilization of approximately 80% of PFA procedures and approximately 85% of WATCHMAN procedures. Internationally, we saw continued fair pulse account openings and robust utilization in Europe and launched APAC markets.\nImportantly, evidence of more than 20,000 patients treated with FARAPULSE has been published or presented at medical conferences, demonstrating the safety, efficacy and reproducibility of the system. And within the quarter, we completed enrollment in the NAVIGATE PF study of the Fairview software module and Fair wave Nav-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year.\nAt the recent HRS meeting, outcomes from a sub-analysis of the ADVENT trial were presented. This is the very first randomized data for a PFA system demonstrating superior efficacy versus thermal modalities. With significantly more patients having achieved an arterial arrhythmic burden of less than 0.1% with FARAPULSE compared to RF and cryo. We plan to continue a steady cadence of clinical evidence generation to maintain our PFA leadership including ReMatch AF, a planned trial designed to study the FairPoint and [indiscernible] catheter in patients who need to redo ablation, which we expect to begin enrolling early in '25.\nIn closing, I'm very grateful to our global team for their commitment and winning spirit enable us to deliver life-changing technologies to millions of patients. One of the most exciting chapters as a company with a track record of executing or exceeding our financial goals while delivering meaningful innovation. With that, I'll hand it over to Dan.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike. Second quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $4.120 billion represents 14.5% reported growth versus second quarter 2023 and includes a 160 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, which was slightly unfavorable versus our expectations. Excluding this $57 million foreign exchange headwind, operational revenue growth was 16.1% in the quarter.\nThe sales impact from closed acquisitions was 140 basis points, resulting in 14.7% organic revenue growth, exceeding our second quarter guidance range of 10% to 12%. Q2 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.62, grew 15.4% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.57 to $0.59 primarily driven by our strong sales performance.\nAdjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.4%, contracting 160 basis points versus the prior year period, driven by higher-than-expected inventory charges related to the Polar x cryoablation system PAUSE given the strong commercial adoption of FARAPULSE in the U.S. as well as increased levels of capital placements in the quarter.\nWe continue to expect second half adjusted gross margin to be higher than the first half driven by the mix benefit from key product launches and full recognition of our annual standard cost improvements. We expect full year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below our 2023 rate. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, which expanded 40 basis points versus the prior year period. Given our strong first half operating margin and our expectations for the second half, we are raising our full year 2024 adjusted operating margin expansion goal to 50 to 70 basis points from 30 to 50 basis points compared to 2023.\nWe believe this strikes a nice balance of delivering incremental margin from our sales upside and continuing to invest appropriately to drive strong top line performance. On a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margin was 12.6%, which included intangible asset impairment charges related to the acquisitions of Cryterion Medical and Devora Medical. The Cryterion impairment charges were related to the high conversion rates of cryoablation to FARAPULSE for ablation procedures in the U.S.\nThe Devora impairment charges were related to the decision to discontinue work advancing the Wolf thrombectomy platform. Moving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $68 million, which was favorable to our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 13.1%, which includes favorable discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate for the quarter was 13.6%.\nFully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,484 million shares in the second quarter. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $660 million, with $814 million from operating activities, less $155 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $200 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. In 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion which includes approximately $700 million of expected payments related to special items.\nAs of June 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.9 billion, and our gross debt leverage ratio was 2.4x. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, in Q2, we announced our agreement to acquire Silk Road Medical and closed the acquisition of [indiscernible], a pre-revenue privately held medical technology company PAUSE developing an intracardiac echocardiography product, complementing our existing electrophysiology portfolio.\nOur legal reserve was $251 million as of June 30, a decrease of $32 million versus Q1 2024. $54 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds. I will now walk through guidance for Q3 and full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13.5% to 14.5% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14.5% to 15.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 14% versus 2023.\nWe expect third quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus third quarter 2023, excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. We expect the third quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 14% to 16%, excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions.\nWe expect third quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 13% to 15% versus 2023. We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $300 million. Given discrete items recognized in the first half of 2024, we now expect a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 13.5% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, which contemplates current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.38 to $2.42 representing growth of 16% to 18% versus 2023 including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations.\nWe expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to John, who will moderate the Q&A."

Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Jon. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations, fueled by our innovative portfolio, including the nearly 90 new products we launched globally in 2023, the execution of our category leadership strategy and the winning spirit of our global team.\nIn the first quarter '24, total company operational sales grew 15% and organic sales grew 13% versus first quarter '23, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Our strong growth continues to be diversified across businesses and regions. In the quarter, 6 of our 8 business units in all of our regions grew double digits. We believe that most business units grew faster than their respective markets with differentiated portfolios and strong commercial execution, supported by healthy procedural demand.\nFirst quarter adjusted EPS was $0.56, which grew 21% versus 2023, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. Turning to our second quarter and full year '24 outlook. We are guiding to organic growth of 10% to 12% for second quarter '24, and raising our full year guidance from 8% to 9% to 10% to 12%, reflecting momentum from our innovative portfolio, healthy procedural volumes and continued execution by our global team.\nOur second quarter '24 adjusted EPS guidance is $0.57 to $0.59, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.29 to $2.34, representing growth of 12% to 14%. Dan will provide more details on our financials, and I'll provide additional highlights on our first quarter, along with comments on our '24 outlook.\nRegionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 13% versus first quarter, with particular strength in EP, fueled by the launch of FARAPULSE midway through the quarter, as well as on our WATCHMAN ICTX Urology and Endoscopy business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 13% on an operational basis versus first quarter '23. This above-market growth was led by exceptional performance in EP as well as double-digit growth in our Endoscopy, Urology and PI businesses. We expect to continue to outpace the market, driven by continued broad-based momentum across our business and investment in emerging markets.\nAsia Pac grew 26% operationally versus first quarter '23, led by strong double-digit performance in all of our cardiovascular business units. Japan grew double digits driven by AGENT DCB, Rezum and our Access Solutions products. China delivered excellent results growing strong double digits, with 7 of our 8 business units growing double digits. I'll now provide some additional commentary on our business units.\nIn Urology, sales grew 10%, both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23, with double-digit growth in stone management as well as prosthetic urology. Rezum performed well in the quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally, and secured reimbursement status in France. We look forward to closing the previously announced acquisition of Axonics now expected in the second half of 2024.\nEndoscopy sales grew 12% operationally and 10% organically versus first quarter '23. Strong first quarter results were driven by the breadth of our portfolio, underpinned by differentiated anchor products such as AXIOS and our single-use imaging products. Within the quarter, we also received CE Mark for our MANTIS Clip and NICE in the U.K. issued positive guidance for the ESG endoscopic bariatric surgery procedure, both expected to further momentum in our growing endoluminal surgery franchise.\nNeuromodulation sales grew 10% operationally and declined 1% organically versus first quarter '23. Our brain franchise grew high single digits in the quarter, with low double-digit U.S. growth driven by our comprehensive directional stimulation offering enabled by image-guided programming. In the first quarter, our pain franchise grew low double digits operationally, but declined mid-single digits on an organic basis, with continued pressure in our U.S. SCS business.\nIn the U.S., during the first quarter, we did receive FDA approval and recently launched the WaveWriter symptom nonsurgical back pain indication and our next-generation fast auto dose. Importantly, the Relievant business continues to perform very well with steady expansion of payer coverage, and we expect sales from the novel Intracept procedure to grow about 50% in 2024.\nPeripheral Interventional sales grew 16% operationally and 11% organically versus first quarter '23. Double-digit growth in arterial was bolstered by our drug-eluting portfolio supported by the strength of clinical evidence and global commercial execution. In Venous, we saw continued above-market growth from Varithena, and Clot Management continued to perform well, in line with expectations. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew strong double digits in the first quarter, driven by our broad offering of embolization devices, including the Embold coil family in cancer therapies.\nIn the quarter, TheraSphere also grew double digits and data from the real world study, PROACTIVE, was presented, demonstrating positive outcomes in patients with intermediate and advanced HCC were treated with TheraSphere.\nCardiology sales delivered another excellent quarter with both operational and organic sales growing 18% versus first quarter 2023. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew an impressive 13% organically versus first quarter '23. Growth in Coronary Therapies was driven by continued strength in our international regions, led by our imaging portfolio and AGENT DCB in Japan. In the U.S., we're also pleased with the ongoing launch of VGO+, which is our AI-guided imaging platform. We also received FDA approval of our agent DCB in first quarter, and we expect to initiate a limited launch in the second quarter as we ramp supply following the earlier-than-anticipated regulatory approval.\nOur Structural Heart Valves franchise once again grew mid-teens in first quarter, led by ACURATE neo2, which continues to see growth from both new and existing accounts. We have now submitted for CE Mark for our next-generation ACURATE PRIME valve, which we continue to expect to launch in Europe in 2025.\nWATCHMAN had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically and maintaining our market-leading share position. In the U.S., WATCHMAN FLEX Pro moved into full launch, and we received FDA clearance for the TruSteer steerable sheath, allowing physicians to achieve more optimal device positioning in the widest range of LAA anatomies. International growth was driven by ongoing momentum in ongoing momentum within the quarter, and we received approval and launched WATCHMAN FLX Pro in Japan and Canada, which will support continued growth in these markets.\nCardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the first quarter '23. In the first quarter, our Diagnostics franchise also grew double digits, led by strong market adoption of our second-generation LUX-Dx ICM device. In core CRM, our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits and our high-voltage business grew low single digits. Our Emblem S-ICD continues to maintain its strong share position and we've seen very limited impact in Europe or the U.S. from a recent competitor's launch.\nWe expect to remain the clear market leader in this space and look forward to the upcoming data presentation at HRS of modular ATP, which is a pivotal trial studying the use of the Emblem S-ICD in conjunction with our Empower leadless pacemaker to function as a single-chamber pacemaker, as well as to provide antitachycardia pacing when needed. We anticipate FDA approval of the modular CRM system and stand-alone Empower leadless pacemaker in '25.\nElectrophysiology sales grew 72% both operationally and organically versus first quarter '23 driven by the adoption of the transformative FARAPULSE platform. International first quarter sales grew 59%, with continued FARAPULSE account openings and robust utilization in Europe. U.S. first quarter sales grew 85% organically, propelled by the mid-first quarter launch of FARAPULSE. We have already made good progress entering to high-volume accounts, supported by compelling clinical evidence, commercial execution and investment in our supply chain.\nEarly feedback on FARAPULSE has been extremely positive, with rapid adoption from both RF and cryo users. Electrophysiologists appreciate FARAPULSE's unique safety profile, ease of use, effectiveness and efficiency of the procedure. We expect our broad EP portfolio, coupled with our other AF solutions to drive significant global growth in '24 and beyond.\nWe also intend to extend our leadership in PFA by investing in innovation, clinical evidence and global capabilities. Within the quarter, we commenced enrollment of the NAVIGATE-PF clinical trial, study an integrated cardiac mapping with a FARAVIEW software and FARAWAVE non-enabled catheter, both of which are expected to launch in the U.S. during the second half of the year. We also completed enrollment of Phase II in the ADVANTAGE-AF clinical trial, studying our FARAPOINT device for CTI ablations, which is expected to launch in the U.S. in 2025, and we also anticipate data from Phase I of the ADVANTAGE trial for persistent AF to be presented in fourth quarter 2024.\nWe also look forward to our clinical late breakers at the upcoming HRS meeting in May, which aims to highlight the unique capabilities of FARAPULSE. Also of note, this week, we released our 2023 performance report, highlighting the company's actions to improve patient outcomes, while prioritizing our environmental, social and governance goals. We continue to make progress in all 3 key areas: innovating care to meet patient needs, empowering people and shaping a healthier planet, while performing with integrity.\nWhile we always have more to do, I know that our values-driven culture and the commitment of our global teams to challenge -- to this challenge of what's possible, we'll continue to raise the bar. In closing, I'm very grateful to our global employees who work every day to advance science for life. We remain committed to investing for the long term, while delivering top-tier financial performance in 2024 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike. First quarter 2024 consolidated revenue of $3.856 billion represents 13.8% reported growth versus first quarter 2023, and includes a 120 basis point headwind from foreign exchange in line with our expectations. Excluding this $40 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 15% in the quarter. Sales from the closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 190 basis points, resulting in 13.1% organic revenue growth, exceeding our first quarter guidance range of 7% to 9%.\nQ1 2024 adjusted earnings per share of $0.56 grew 20.6% versus 2023, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52, primarily driven by our strong sales performance. Adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 69.8%, which includes an approximate 30 basis point year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was slightly lower than anticipated, primarily driven by inventory charges and less favorable product mix due to increased levels of capital placements in the quarter.\nDespite a lower Q1, we continue to expect full year adjusted gross margin to be at or slightly below our 2023 full year rate, driven by increasing mix benefit from our new launches, lower inventory charges and the full recognition of our annual standard manufacturing cost improvements in the second half of the year. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%. We remain committed to expanding adjusted operating margin by 30 to 50 basis points in 2024 as we balance progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points of improvement from 2024 to 2026, with the flexibility to make critical investments to support key launches. On a GAAP basis, first quarter operating margin was 17.5%.\nMoving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $80 million. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 10.7%, which includes favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 13.7% for the quarter. Fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,482 million shares in the first quarter. Free cash flow for the first quarter was a negative $15 million, with $164 million from operating activities less $179 million in net capital expenditures, which includes payments of $251 million related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items.\nIn 2024, we continue to expect full year free cash flow to exceed $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to special items. As of March 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $2.3 billion, inclusive of the $2 billion -- 2 billion euro-denominated senior note offering completed on February 27, which we intend to use to partially fund the Axonics acquisition.\nDuring the first quarter, we repaid approximately $500 million of senior notes upon maturity, and our gross debt leverage was 2.5x as of March 31. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants. In alignment with our acquisition strategy, we recently closed the acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio from B. Braun, which complements our existing endoscopy portfolio and is expected to be immaterial to earnings per share in 2024.\nOur legal reserve was $283 million as of March 31, a decrease of $94 million versus Q4 2023, and $71 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 13% versus 2023. Excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023.\nWe expect second quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 10.5% to 12.5% versus second quarter 2023. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect second quarter 2024 operational revenue growth to be 11.5% to 13.5%. And excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect second quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2023. We now expect full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expense to be approximately $315 million.\nUnder current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules, we continue to forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.29 and to $2.34, representing 12% to 14% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange, which is unchanged from our previous expectations. We expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.57 to $0.59.\nFor more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2024 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q1 results and our 2024 guidance. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jon, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nJonathan R Monson\n\nSenior VP, Global Controller & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up for questions for the next 40 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Drew, please go ahead."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.\nThe duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q4 and full year performance as well as the outlook for the business, including 2024 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on this call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022, and the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holding Ltd., Apollo Endosurgery and Relievant Medical, which closed in February, April, November 2023, respectively. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed in April 2023. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire Axonics, Inc., which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website.\nOn this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meanings of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new and anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.\nIf our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.\nAt this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 2023 results were excellent, and our global performance represented one of the strongest years in company history, exceeding our financial goals that we set for the year. This performance is fueled by [indiscernible] and clinical evidence generation, commercial execution and the winning spirit of our global teams.\nIn fourth quarter '23, total company operational sales grew 15% and organic sales grew 14% versus fourth quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. Full year '23 operational sales growth of 13% versus 2022. And while organic sales grew 12%, exceeding our guidance of approximately 11% for the full year. Importantly, 6 of our 8 business units grew sales double digit in the fourth quarter and double digits for the full year 2023 and all of our regions also grew double digits in the fourth quarter and double digits full year 2023. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and our focus on innovation bolstered by commercial excellence.\nFourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range $0.49 to $0.52. Full year adjusted EPS of $2.05 grew [ 28% ] versus 2022, also exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Q4 adjusted operating margin was 26.6% and full year '23 was 26.3%, which is exciting because it exceeds pre-pandemic levels. We generated full year cash flow of $1.8 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $2.5 billion, in line with our expectations.\nNow for our 2024 outlook. We expect healthy procedure volumes to continue in our guidance to organic growth of 7% to 9% for first quarter 2024 and 8% to 9% for the full 2024. Our Q1 '24 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.50 to $0.52. We expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $2.23 to $2.27, representing growth of 9% to 11%. This guidance excludes the acquisition of Axonics, which is expected to close in the first half of '24.\nDespite pressures on margins in '24 from FX headwinds as well as investments in manufacturing capacity and selling expenses to fuel our exciting launches, we remain committed to improving operating income margins in 2024 and to our goal of improving adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points in '24 to '26. Now Dan will provide more details on those financials for both 2023 and 2024.\nI'll now provide additional highlights on '23 results along with comments on our outlook. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 11% versus fourth quarter '22. Full year 2023 grew 10%, with particular strength in our WATCHMAN, EP, Endo and Uro business units. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 12% on an operational basis versus Q4 '22 and 13% on a full year basis. It's above market growth is supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, price discipline and strong commercial execution.\nWe're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our [indiscernible] portfolio, and further opportunity in our growth in emerging markets within the EMEA region. Asia Pacific grew 17% operationally versus Q4 in '19 versus the full year 2022, with all major markets growing strong double digits. Japan had a strong year, growing double digits for '22 with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT DCB [ resume ] POLAR FIT and WATCHMAN FLX, and a full year basis, China grew approximately 20% versus 2022. This consistent growth is fueled by the diverse portfolio, focus on innovation and strong commercial execution.\nLooking ahead, we expect China to be an accretive mid-teens grower over our '24 to '26 LRP and to achieve over $1 billion in sales in 2024, supported by new product launches, supply chain agility and sustained investments in our talent and capabilities. The team in Latin America grew 17% operationally versus both Q4 full year '22 with 7 of 8 business units growing double digits on a full year basis.\nI'll now provide some additional commentary on our BUs. Urology had an excellent quarter. 10% organic growth versus Q4 '22 and on a full year basis grew 11% organically. Full year growth was led by our Stone Management and Prosthetic Urology globally. And in 2023, we relaunched our direct-to-patient campaign, driving therapy awareness for erectile dysfunction and supporting double-digit growth within our prosthetic urology franchise. We're excited about the opportunities that Urology includes in our recently announced agreement to [ acquire ] Axonics, a medical technology company that offers innovative devices for urinary and bowel dysfunction. We look forward to bringing these commentary portfolios together and expanding access to differentiated technologies for physicians and patients.\nEndoscopy sales were also excellent in the quarter, growing 12% operationally and 11% organically versus fourth quarter '22 and the full year basis growing 12% operationally and 11% organically. Within the quarter, strong results were led by AXIOS and single-use scopes, both growing double digits. On a full year basis, all regions grew double digits, supported by the broad and deep portfolio, new product innovation and focus on commercial excellence.\nNeuromodulation sales grew 7% operationally and 3% organically versus fourth quarter '22 on a full year basis, 7% operationally and 5% organically versus '22. Our brain franchise grew double digits both in the quarter and on a full year basis, driven by the precise [ Genus ] portfolio and our innovative image-guided programming, which is designed to improve the precision and efficiency of the deep brain stimulation procedure.\nIn fourth quarter, on an organic basis, our pain franchise was flat year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We expect our performance to improve in 2024 and with the recent launch of our U.S. WaveWriter Alpha [ DPN ] indication and the strong real-world data on FAST recently presented at NANS. Furthermore, with the completion of our Relievant Medsystems acquisition in the fourth quarter, we're excited about our ability to offer expanded pain portfolio that supports a comprehensive treatment algorithm, now including the novel Intracept system for the treatment of chronic low back pain.\nPeripheral Intervention sales were excellent also growing 12% operationally and 10% organically versus Q4 and a full year basis growing 13% operationally and 11% organically versus '22. Our [indiscernible] growth was led by the performance of our drug-eluting portfolio both in Q4 [indiscernible]. This market remains underpenetrated with more than half the procedures still being used with [indiscernible] metal devices, underscoring the importance of our ongoing commitment to innovation and clinical evidence.\nIn venous, Q4 [indiscernible] led by Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein technology. Additionally, in fourth quarter, [indiscernible] growth was supported by real PE, the largest real-world and near real-time data set evaluating advanced therapies for pulmonary embolism patients.\nOur [ individual ] oncology franchise performed extremely well in fourth quarter and in 2023, growing low double digits with strength across our portfolio of robust embolization technologies and cancer therapies. We continue to look to expand our clinical evidence and are pleased to have commenced enrollment in the [ ROMAN ] trial, which will access the safety and efficacy of use TheraSphere in combination with immunotherapy, treat HCC, the most common type of primary liver cancer.\n[ Cardiology ] delivered tremendous quarter -- delivered a tremendous fourth quarter and year, with both operational and organic sales growing 14% versus fourth quarter and for the full year 2022. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology therapy sales grew 10% for the full year and -- for the quarter and its full year. On a full year basis, the coronary therapies franchise growth was driven by strong performance in our international regions and our imaging franchise globally. AGENT Drug-Coated Balloon continues to perform very well in Japan, and we now expect approval of the AGENT in the U.S. in the first half of 2024. AGENT DCB will be the first coronary drug-eluting balloon in the U.S. indicator for instant restenosis providing physicians and patient solution for this unmet clinical need.\nOur structural heart valves franchise grew double digits in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, led by the performance of ACURATE Neo2 in Europe, and we now have treated more than 70,000 patients to date with our ACURATE technology globally. As we look ahead, we anticipate approval of ACURATE Prime in Europe in 2025. However, after reviewing a planned interim analysis of the U.S. ACURATE IDE data, we will now wait for the full 1-year data from the RCT cohort of 1,500 patients to determine our regulatory strategy. Therefore, we no longer anticipate the approval of [ VacarPrime ] in the U.S. in 2024. Additionally, in alignment with the FDA, we are suspending enrollment in the single arm continued access study while continuing to enroll in the randomized extended durability cohort. We expect to have more information in the second half of 2024 following the full data review.\nWATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus fourth quarter '22 and 25% on a full year basis. Q4 finished with record sales and strong utilization in major markets, we have now treated over 400,000 patients globally with the WATCHMAN technology. U.S. Q4 growth of 23% was supported by the breadth of the portfolio and the initial launch of WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which we expect to move into full launch in the first quarter. We continue to expand the breadth of clinical evidence supporting this technology and are pleased with the pace of enrollment within our post-market [ HEAL LAA ] trial, including our newly added cohort, which is studying in WATCHMAN FLX Pro and underrepresented patient populations.\nWe also look forward to initiating our monotherapy trial SIMPLIFY trial later this year, which will study WATCHMAN FLX Pro with a simplified post-implant drug regimen.\nCardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically versus Q4 '22 and on a full year basis grew 6% organically versus '22. On a full year basis, our Diagnostics franchise grew double digits, outpacing market growth driven by broad portfolio and ongoing investments in innovation. In core CRM, in both fourth quarter and on a full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low single digits and our low voltage business grew mid-single digits. 2023 performance was driven by our differentiated high-voltage portfolio and shock polarity options. As we look ahead, we expect our core CM growth to be in line with the market performance in '24.\nTurning to Electrophysiology. Sales grew 43%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '22 and the full year basis grew 37% operationally and 33% organically versus '22. U.S. fourth quarter sales grew 40% organically driven by our POLARx launch and ongoing win with our [ access ] solutions porfolio. Our international EP growth accelerated in the fourth quarter growing 46% organically, fueled by improved FARAPULSE console supply, and we now have treated over 40,000 patients globally with the FARAPULSE technology to date. And with the news this morning that we received FDA approval for FARAPULSE, we are thrilled to enter the U.S. market immediately.\nWe continue to invest in clinical evidence to study new indications and support access to our FARAPULSE technology. Late last year, we initiated the AVANT GUARD [indiscernible] to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the system as a first-line treatment for [indiscernible] in AF compared to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Additionally, a real-world data was presented at AHA for more than 17,000 patients treated with FARAPULSE in the MANIFEST-17K [indiscernible] which reinforced the real-world safety profile of the [indiscernible] platform with no reports of permanent phrenic nerve [indiscernible] or pulmonary vein stenosis, or esophageal injury and an overall major event rate of less than 1%. We're excited to bring this innovative technology to more markets and expect approval of FARAPULSE in Japan -- China and Japan, likely in the second half of this year.\nIn closing, I'm very proud of our global team, what we are able to accomplish in '23, resulting in full year organic sales growth of 12% and adjusted EPS growth of 20%. We're excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our talent and sustaining the culture that's motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-range plan goals. Those goals as a reminder, are sales an average of 8% to 10% over the 3-year period while expanding adjusted operating margin by 150 basis points, including double-digit adjusted EPS growth and improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% in 2026.\nWith all of that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike.\nFourth quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.725 billion represents 14.9% reported growth versus fourth quarter 2022 and includes a 40 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $12 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.5% in the quarter. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points resulting in 13.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 8% to 10%.\nQ4 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.55 grew 24% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.49 to $0.52 primarily driven by our strong sales performance.\nFor the year 2023 consolidated revenue of $14.240 billion represents 12.3% reported revenue growth versus full year 2022 and includes an 80 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, again, in line with our expectations. Excluding this $104 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth for the year was 13.1%. Sales from closed acquisitions and divestitures contributed 80 basis points resulting in 12.3% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of approximately 11%.\nFull year 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 grew 20% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $1.99 to $2.02. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.4% resulting in full year 2023 adjusted gross margin of 70.7%, in line with our expectations and representing a 20 basis point improvement versus full year 2022, inclusive of a 220 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.\nIn 2024, we expect a mix benefit from our new launches with offsetting headwinds from FX and the incremental investment in our manufacturing capacity and as a result, we anticipate our full year 2024 adjusted gross margin will be at or slightly below our full year 2023 rate. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.6% resulting in a full year 2023 adjusted operating margin of 26.3%, improving 70 basis points versus 2022. We expect to expand adjusted operating margin in 2024 by another 30 to 50 basis points balancing progress towards our long-range plan goal of 150 basis points over the 3 years 2024 to 2026 with flexibility for critical investments to support key launches.\nOn a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 15.7%, resulting in a full year reported operating margin of 16.5%.\nStill below the line, fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $79 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $331 million, in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10% and [ 11.2% ] of the full year 2023, including favorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 14.6% for the fourth quarter and 13.9% for the full year, again, in line with expectations.\nFully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.477 billion shares in Q4 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was $718 million, with $984 million from operating activities, less $267 million of net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $913 million. Full year 2023 cash flow was $1.8 billion, and adjusted free cash flow was $2.5 billion both in line with expectations.\nFor 2024, we expect full year free cash flow to be in excess of $2 billion, which includes approximately $800 million of expected payments related to acquisitions, restructuring, litigation and other special items. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of $865 million and our gross debt leverage was 2.3x. We expect to fund the Axonics acquisition through a mix of cash on hand and new debt, which will be determined prior to or at the time of close. Our top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants.\nOur legal reserve was $377 million as of December 31, a decrease of $30 million versus the prior quarter $108 million of this reserve is already funded through our qualified settlement funds.\nNow I'll walk through guidance for the first quarter and the full year 2024. We expect full year 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 9.5% versus 2023, excluding an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, we expect full year 2024 operational revenue growth to be 9% to 10%, excluding a 100 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 9% versus 2023. We expect first quarter 2024 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus first quarter 2023, excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, we expect first quarter 2024 operational growth to be 8.5% to 10.5%, excluding a 150 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2024 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9% versus Q1 2023. We expect our full year 2024 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $330 million.\nUnder current legislation, including enacted laws and issued guidance under OECD Pillar 2 rules, we forecast a full year 2024 operational tax rate of approximately 14% and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%. We continue to monitor tax legislation globally, including the currently drafted law to partially repeal U.S. R&D capitalization. The law were to be passed as currently proposed we would expect a tailwind of approximately 100 basis points to our operational tax rate in 2024.\nWe expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.23 to $2.27 representing 9% to 11% growth versus 2023, including an approximate $0.04 headwind from foreign exchange at current rates and existing hedging contracts, which will be recognized ratably through the year. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.50 to $0.52.\nFor more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2023 financial and operational highlights which outlines more details on Q4 and full year results and 2024 guidance.\nIn closing, I'm very proud of our 2023 performance and look forward to executing on our 2024 guidance of 8% to 9% organic revenue growth, 30 to 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%.\nBefore I turn it back over to Lauren for the Q&A, I wanted to provide a quick update. A key part of our talent strategy is moving high potential individuals throughout the company to give them a broad set of experiences. As part of this, effective March 1, Lauren Tengler will become the Global Controller for our Urology business unit providing financial leadership to the global business and importantly, playing a key role in the integration of the Axonics business. Lauren previously spent many years within our Urology business, making her uniquely qualified for this opportunity.\nFollowing Lauren's transition, [ John Monson ], currently our Chief Accounting Officer, will move to our Investor Relations function, leading [indiscernible] and the rest of the team. I know the investment community will join me in thanking Lauren for her leadership and contributions and in welcoming John to the role.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks so much, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please let yourself to 1 question. Drew, please go ahead."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President of Investor Relations.

We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2023 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q3 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q4 and full year 2023 guidance. Then we'll take your questions.\nDuring today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\nRelevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022; the majority stake investment in Acotech Scientific and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively.\nDivestitures include the Endoscopy Pathology business, which closed in April of this year. Please note that we have elected to consolidate Acotec results on a 1-quarter lag, which have been included in our Q3 reported adjusted results. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to acquire [ Relevant MedSystems ], which is expected to close in the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.\nFor more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words.

Factors that may cause such a difference include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nWell, then, Lauren, thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased with another quarter of excellent results with momentum continuing fueled by new product innovation, clinical evidence and our talented teams across the globe.\nIn Q3 '23, total company sales grew 11% operationally and 10% organically versus Q3 '22, which exceeds the high end of our guidance range of 7% to 9%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy, focus on innovation and strong commercial execution. We believe that most of our global business units grew in line or faster than their respective markets.\nQ3 adjusted EPS of $0.50 grew 15% versus Q3 '22, which exceeds the high end of the guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48. Q3 adjusted operating margin was 26.1%, slightly higher than anticipated. Now for '23 guidance, we're guiding to Q4 '23 organic revenue growth of 8% to 10% and aligning our full year organic guidance for approximately 11% at the high end of our prior guidance.\nOur Q4 '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.49 to $0.52 and we are raising our full year adjusted EPS range to $1.99 to $2.02. I'll now provide additional highlights on Q3, along with comments on our 2023 outlook, and then Dan will provide more details on the financials. Originally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 9% versus Q3 '22, and driven by strong performance within our WATCHMAN, [ EP ], Endo and [ urology ] businesses. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus Q3 '22.\nPerformance of the region was broad-based with double-digit growth in 7 out of our [ 108 ] business units. Within the quarter, we saw a strong growth in EP with ongoing momentum and demand for FARAPULSE and POLARx. Asia Pac grew 19% operationally versus third quarter '22, led by strength in Japan and China. Japan grew strong double digits in the quarter with ongoing momentum from new products, most notably AGENT DCB resume POLARx FIT and WATCHMAN FLX. Physician demand for our differentiated AGENT DCB remains high, and we've taken a market leadership position within the quarter after launching earlier this year.\nDouble-digit growth in China was led by our imaging and complex PCI portfolio as well as the commercial execution of the team more broadly. These results were further supported by the performance of the Acotech business, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year.\nI'll now provide some additional commentary on the business units. In the quarter, Urology sales grew 11% organically with international growth of 18%, fueled by new products and globalization efforts with all regions outside the U.S. growing double digits. Globally, the Stone Management franchise grew double digits driven by LithoVue and Laser therapies.

We are optimistic about the opportunities ahead of our Pain business, included in our recent U.S. approval to expand the indication of our WaveWriter Alpha SCS system to include DPN, which is expected to launch in early '24. We're also excited to add to our portfolio with our recently announced agreement to acquire [ Relevant Med Systems ] and its [ INTERCEPT ] procedure. [ Intercept ] is the only U.S. cleared system for vertebrogenic pain expanding our portfolio of pain offerings, which is expected to close in the first half of 2024.\nPeripheral Intervention sales grew 8% organically and 13% operationally, which includes the results of Acotec versus third quarter '22.

The rural PE study analyzed nearly real-time EHR data for over 2,200 PE patients from 2009 to 2023.\nThis study provides new clinical evidence for providers in determining the optimal modality for each patient's needs. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits including ongoing momentum with our Embold Coil launch as well as strong demand for our cancer therapies. Within the quarter, we received FDA clearance to expand the indication of the visual [ ICE probation ] system to treat pain associated with tumors that have metastasized to bone in patients who are unable to receive standard radiation therapy. Our Cardiology Group delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growth of 11% versus third quarter '22. Within Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology therapy sales grew 7% organically versus third quarter '22. Our structural heart valves franchise grew double digits in the third quarter, led by ACURATE neo2 sales performance in Europe and growth within our coronary therapies franchise is fueled by ongoing success of our imaging technologies.\nWe're pleased to have received clearance for the AVVIGO+ guidance system. AVVIGO is our next-generation platform that provides high-quality fast imaging with improved physiologic assessment of coronary vessels and lesions.\nWe continue to be pleased with the performance of AGENT DCB in Japan. Importantly, our AGENT IDE trial results were presented yesterday as a late breaker at [ TCT ] with data demonstrating statistical superiority of the agent drug-coated balloon versus uncoated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of patients with instant restenosis. With our recent regulatory submission to FDA, we anticipate approval of agent the first drug-coated balloon indicated for the [ coronary rites ] within the U.S. in the second half of '24. WATCHMAN sales grew 23% organically versus third quarter '22 and we're very pleased with the excellent performance of this franchise and now treated more than 350,000 patients globally.\nLast month, we received FDA approval of the latest generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro, which is designed to improve visualization during device placement to enhance healing post implant and treat a broader range of patient anatomies.

International growth of 33% was driven by excellent performance from our differentiated FARAPULSE and POLARx technologies as well as our Access Solutions franchise and the leading [ Verse across ] access platform. U.S. growth of 22% was led by our Access Solutions franchise, along with contribution from the early approval -- I'm sorry, from the approval of the POLAR Cryoablation system, including POLAR FIT, which enables physicians to adjust and expand the Cryo balloon to best fit a patient's individual anatomy.\nAlso within the quarter, we launched VersaCross Connect or POLARSHEALTH, which provides safe and efficient access to the left side of the heart during procedures, expanding our access solutions portfolio. Clinical evidence generation remains a key priority, and we're pleased to have completed enrollment in the first phase of the ADVANTAGE AF clinical trial studying FARAPULSE for the treatment of patients with persistent [ Afib ]. Additionally, we commenced enrollment and treated our first patient in an extension arm of the ADVANTAGE study to evaluate [ FairPoint ], which is a point-by-point PFA focal catheter for CTI ablations, usage read atrioflutder. Finally, within the quarter, we achieved important milestones in bringing our leading PFA technology to the U.S.\nRecall data from our ADVENT IDE trial was presented at ESC at the end of August, comparing FARAPULSE to standard of care thermal modalities meeting the primary end points. We've also committed our U.S. regulatory submission and continue to anticipate the approval of FARAPULSE in the U.S. in the second half of '24.\nThrough the first 9 months of this year, we have grown organic sales 12% while growing adjusted EPS 18% with broad-based growth across all of our business units and regions. This performance is supportive of the goal we laid out last month at our Investor Day, where we aspire to the highest performing large-cap med tech company over the next 3 years. We believe our focus on talent and culture our relentless pursuit of innovation, while doing the right thing for society and operating responsibly sets us up to deliver a unique set of financial goals over the [ '24 to '26 ] long-range period. Our LRP goals include growing sales, 8% to 10% CAGR over the period, while expanding adjusted operating margins by 150 basis points over the 3 years, with double adjusted EPS growth annually and improvement of our free cash flow conversion to approximately 70% by 2026. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike. Third quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.527 billion represents 11.2% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2022 and includes a 10 basis point tailwind from foreign exchange, which was lower than expected due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar throughout the quarter. Excluding this $4 million tailwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% in the quarter.\nSales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 90 basis points, resulting in 10.2% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%. Q3 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 grew 15% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.46 to $0.48, driven predominantly by our strong sales performance.\nAdjusted gross margin for the third quarter was [ 70.2% ], slightly lower than our expectations, primarily driven by foreign exchange. In light of our Q3 results, we now anticipate that full year 2023 adjusted gross margin will only slightly improve on a year-over-year basis. Strong sales performance drove third quarter adjusted operating margin of 26.1%, resulting in a year-to-date adjusted operating margin also of 26.1%.\nOur year-to-date performance sets us up well to achieve our full year 2023 adjusted operating margin goal of approximately 26.4%, which represents 80 basis points of expansion versus 2022. On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 19.6%, which includes a $111 million credit, primarily related to certain IP litigation matters. Moving to below the line. Third quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $81 million, which was in line with our expectations. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the third quarter was 12.4% and favorable to our expectations, driven by certain discrete tax items in the quarter.\nOur operational tax rate was 13.9%, in line with expectations. Fully diluted weighted average share outstanding ended at $1.475 billion in Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $509 million, with $698 million from operating activities less $190 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $582 million, as a result of our strong year-to-date adjusted free cash flow generation, we now expect full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.4 billion.\nOur top capital allocation priority remains strategic tuck-in M&A, followed by annual share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock grants, which we announced at last month's Investor Day. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $952 million and our gross debt leverage was 2.3x. I'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and full year 2023. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be approximately 12%, which excludes an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange higher than our previous estimate due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be approximately 11% versus 2022.\nWe expect fourth quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11% versus Q3 2022 with a neutral impact from foreign exchange based on current rates, excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect fourth quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10%. We continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Our full year 2023 operational tax rate is now expected to be approximately 13.5% under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales.\nAs a result of a lower operational tax rate and favorable discrete items recognized in the third quarter, we now expect our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 12%. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.478 billion shares for Q4 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for the full year 2023. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.99 to $2.02 representing 17% to 18% growth versus 2022.\nWe continue to anticipate a neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.49 to $0.52. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2023 financial and operational highlights which outlines more details on Q3 results and 2023 guidance. In closing, I'm very proud of our year-to-date financial performance with top-tier organic revenue growth of 12%, adjusted operating margin of 26.1% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 18%. I look forward to continued momentum in the fourth quarter to close out 2023, which will set the stage towards achieving our long-range financial goals. With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Dan. Costas, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Costas, please go ahead."

Relevant acquisitions and divestitures excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022; the majority stake investment in acatech Scientific Holding Ltd and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively. Divestitures include the endoscopy pathology business, which closed in April of this year. Please note that we have elected to consolidate [ Acotec ] results on a 1-quarter lag, which had an immaterial impact on our Q2 reported and adjusted results. On June 15, 2022, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to purchase a majority stake in MI Tech. The agreement required global regulatory approvals that we were unable to obtain in some countries. As a result, the original agreement was terminated.

We're very proud of our second quarter results, which exceeded our expectations and demonstrated the strength of our category leadership strategy, commitment to clinical evidence, and the winning spirit of our global team. In second quarter '23, total company sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of our organic guidance range of 7% to 9%. We anticipate that most of our business units grew in line or faster than the respective markets, fueled by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution, also supported by healthy procedure demand.\nSecond quarter adjusted EPS of $0.53 grew 21% versus second quarter '22, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50. And second quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, also slightly higher than anticipated.\nThrough the first half of the year, we have grown the business organic sales rate at 13%, with broad-based durable growth across all of our business units and regions. Importantly, we have also grown our adjusted EPS growth 20% during the first half, while balancing our investments to ensure we achieve our short-term and long-term goals.\nNow for our 2023 guidance, we're guiding the third quarter '23 organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%, and we expect momentum to continue and are raising our full year organic guidance to 10% to 11%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS estimate is $0.46 to $0.48, and we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS range to $1.96 to $2.\nI'll now provide some additional highlights in the second quarter, along with comments on our '23 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials.\nRegionally, and on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 9% in second quarter, with notable strength in our WATCHMAN, PI and Endoscopy businesses. Europe, Middle East Africa also grew 9% on an operational basis versus second quarter, with strong performance in the region was broad-based, with double-digit growth in 4 out of our 5 major markets in Europe. Across the portfolio, we saw strength in new and ongoing product launches, including Farapulse, POLARx, ACURATE NEO 2 and LUX-DX.\nAsia Pacific grew 24% operationally versus second quarter, led by strength in China and Japan. Japan growth is fueled by new products, including agent, our drug-coated balloon for the coronary arteries, and resume our minimally invasive BPH technology with device performance and procedures that leave nothing behind is resonating in the market.\nChina delivered excellent growth in the second quarter, led by our innovative portfolio and commercial execution against the COVID impact second quarter '22. We also saw particular strength in our interventional cardiology therapies, WATCHMAN, CRM and PI business units, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year.\nI'll now provide some additional commentary on our businesses. Starting with urology. Urology sales grew 8% organically in the second quarter. The stone management franchise grew double digits, driven by LithoVue and ongoing globalization efforts. Rezum continues to do well globally, growing strong double digits in the quarter, and most recently launching in Brazil. We continue to see ongoing momentum within our prosthetic urology franchise, fueled by patient activation efforts designed to bring awareness to our erectile restoration and male incontinence interventions.\nEndoscopy sales were excellent, growing 12% organically and 14% operationally in the second quarter, with notable strength in the U.S., Latin America and Asia Pac, with new product momentum and healthy procedure demand. Our Apollo integration is progressing well, and earlier this month that we received FDA clearance for OverStitch and XT, the suturing system that enables future placement during advanced endoscopic procedures. This next-generation device brings ease-of-use benefits and improved accessibility when using a single-channel endoscope. Neuromodulation sales grew 3% organically in the second quarter. Spinal cord stimulation sales were flat versus prior year, and we expect SCS sales growth to improve in the second half of the year, with strong trialing in the second quarter in support of clinical evidence, which was presented this month at Aspen. Notably, 6-month outcome data were reported from the [ SOLOS ] trial, which is a randomized controlled trial for nonsurgical back pain, which demonstrated superior outcomes for SCS against conventional medical management, also consistent with primary endpoint results.\nOur brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter, with continued momentum from new product launches in the U.S. and procedure recovery in Europe. Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for the PRECISE Neural Navigator 5 software, which, when used with our deep brain stimulation system, can help provide clinicians with data for efficient programming in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\nPeripheral Intervention sales were very strong, growing 13% organically versus second quarter '22. Our arterial franchise grew double digits, led by our drug-eluting portfolio. And earlier this month, after reviewing all available data and analysis, the FDA provided updated information associated with paclitaxel-coated devices used to treat PAD, recognizing the safety of these devices and eliminating the requirement for specific warning language within device-related labeling. We're pleased that the FDA determined that the available data do not support an excess mortality risk, and we remain dedicated to helping physicians provide the best care possible for their patients.\nIn venous, U.S. growth was led by ongoing strength in [ Varithena ], a nonthermal treatment for varicose veins, with international growth driven by our clot management technologies. Our Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits, with strength across the entire portfolio. And last month, we received clearance for the Embold, soft and packing coils, which along with the Embold fibroid coil, complete our detachable coil system. We also began our limited market release for [indiscernible], which is the only conformable gel embolic material that's indicated for the peripheral vasculature, adding to our robust embolization portfolio.\nCardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with organic sales growth of 13% versus second quarter. Within cardiology, the Interventional Cardiology Therapies business, sales grew 12% organically versus second quarter. Our coronary therapies franchise growth was driven by our innovative imaging technologies as well as the recent launch of our agent drug-coated balloon in Japan, offsetting ongoing price pressure in drug-eluting stents.\nOur structural heart valves franchise grew strong double digits with another quarter of performance from our ACURATE neo2 in Europe. Market reception remains very high, backed by clinical evidence, ease-of-use benefits and a focus on lifetime patient management. We continue to expect to bring ACURATE neo2 to the U.S. in the second half of 2024.\nWATCHMAN sales grew 27% organically versus second quarter, also outpacing the market. U.S. demand remains strong and international growth was led by China and Japan. We were pleased to have completed enrollment in the WATCHMAN FLX PRO CT pilot study, which is a single study design using multiple imaging modalities to assess post-procedural healing in the next generation of WATCHMAN FLX Pro. We expect continued momentum within the WATCHMAN franchise further supported by the anticipated approval of our both WATCHMAN FLX Pro and our steerable sheath called Trusteer by the end of 2023.\nCardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 5% organically in the quarter. In core CRM, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, and our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we believe that performance was in line or slightly below market growth as the replacement tailwinds neutralize. Our diagnostic franchise grew double digits in the quarter on the strength of our broad cardiac diagnostic portfolio, and we anticipate momentum will continue, supported by the approval of our next-generation ICM called [ LUX 2 ] later this year. Electrophysiology sales grew 28% organically in the second quarter. International growth continues to be fueled by strong performance in both Farapulse and POLARx Europe and APAC.\nWe continue to make progress towards bringing these innovative technologies to the U.S., and we expect POLARx approval in the third quarter. In addition, we are looking forward to the data presentation of the ADVENT trial, our U.S. IDE, at the ESC Conference on August 27. Recall the ADVENT trial is a first of its kind, randomized clinical trial, designed for a noninferior 12-month primary safety and efficacy endpoints compared to a commercially available RF and cryoablation systems. It is notable for its design and rigor as it seeks to demonstrate the single procedure effectiveness of an intervention without the use of antiarrhythmic drugs and reablations. We continue to anticipate the approval of Farapulse in the U.S. in 2024.\nThe Access Solutions franchise grew strong double digits in the second quarter with continued momentum in the U.S. and Japan with a differentiated Versacoss transseptal platform. We're also proud of the performance of our global teams and are confident in our future. We remain committed to sustainable innovation and our financial goals, consistently growing sales faster than our underlying markets, expanding operating margins and delivered strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth with a strong adjusted free cash flow generation. We're looking forward to our September 20th Investor Day, where our leadership team will provide more insight into our innovative pipeline today, the opportunities ahead and our long-term financial goals.\nSo before I pass it along to Dan, I want to announce that we also have some movement within our business unit leadership team. And after nearly 20 years at Boston Scientific, [indiscernible] has announced his plan to retire in August. Jim [indiscernible] will now lead the neuromodulation business, where he previously spent 8 years prior before moving over to lead the WATCHMAN franchise 5 years ago. Lastly, Angelo DeRosa will now lead our WATCHMAN business. Angelo has spent the last 10 years of Boston Scientific in Europe, most recently leading the European CRM and EP business. Congratulations to Jim and Angelo, and we appreciate [indiscernible] for his many contributions to Neuromodulation in Boston Scientific throughout his career.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Mike. Second quarter 2023 consolidated revenue of $3.599 billion represents 11% reported revenue growth versus the second quarter of 2022, and reflects a 100-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange, in line with expectations. Excluding this $33 million headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 12% in the quarter.\nSales from acquisitions and divestitures contributed 30 basis points, resulting in 11.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding our guidance range of 7% to 9%.\nQ2 2023 adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 grew 20.7% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.48 to $0.50, driven by strong sales performance and a favorable effective tax rate in the quarter. Adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72%, slightly ahead of our expectations, resulting in an adjusted gross margin of 71.2% for the first half of 2023.\nWe continue to expect second half gross margin to be lower than the first half of 2023, and in line with the second half of 2022, largely due to timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, slightly ahead of expectations, predominantly driven by strong top line performance and partially offset by slightly higher SG&A spend. We continue to focus on adjusted operating margin expansion, and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, which would represent 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022.\nOn a GAAP basis, the second quarter operating margin was 14.3%.\nMoving to below the line, second quarter adjusted interest and other expenses totaled $93 million, slightly higher than expectations, driven by FX volatility in certain unhedged currencies. On an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the second quarter was 9.8%, slightly below expectations due to certain discrete tax items and a lower-than-anticipated operational tax rate of 13.2%, driven by our geographic mix of earnings in the quarter.\nFully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,456 million shares in Q2, which includes the issuance of 23.98 million common shares upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock on June 1 of this year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $514 million, with $658 million from operating activities, less $143 million net capital expenditures. Excluding special items, adjusted free cash flow was $730 million. We continue to target full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion.\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had cash on hand of $426 million, and our leverage was 2.4x, in line with our expectations.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and the full year. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 11% to 12%, which excludes an approximate 50-basis-point headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 11% versus 2022. We expect third quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus Q3 2022, excluding an approximate 50-basis-point tailwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect third quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%.\nWe continue to expect our full year 2023 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we now expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 12.5%, reflecting favorable tax discretes recognized in the second quarter. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.475 billion shares for Q3 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023. We expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.96 to $2, representing 15% to 17% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top-tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share, and we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.46 to $0.48. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q2 results and 2023 guidance.\nIn closing, I'm very proud of our first half financial performance with top-tier organic revenue growth of 13%, adjusted operating margin of 26.2% and and adjusted earnings per share growth of 20%, all contributing towards our top-tier financial goals. I look forward to continued momentum in the second half of 2023. And with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Dan. Kyle, let's open it up for questions for the next 35 minutes or so. [Operator Instructions] Kyle, please go ahead."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector Investor Relations, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThank you, Jamie. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. .\nWe issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2023 results, which include reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading, Financials and Filings.\nThe duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q1 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q2 and full year 2023 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ken Stein.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\nRelevant acquisitions excluded for organic growth are Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022, the majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited and Apollo Endosurgery, which closed in February and April of this year, respectively.\nPlease note that we have elected to consolidate Acotec results of operations on a 1-quarter lag, thus having no impact to our Q1 reported or adjusted results. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to purchase a majority stake in MI Tech, which has not closed.\nFor more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic.\nThis call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may believe, estimate and other similar words.\nThey include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share, new anticipated product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.\nIf our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.\nFactors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.\nAt this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael Mahoney\n\nWorldwide Chairman, Medical Devices and Diagnostics\n\nThanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone, for joining us today. Our first quarter performance exceeded our expectations across all business units and regions, which is a testament to the winning spirit of our global team and the relentless focus on innovation and execution, and we also launched more than 70 new products globally in 2022.\nIn the first quarter 2023, total company operational sales grew 15% versus 2022, while organic sales grew 14%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 6% to 8%. We believe that all business units grew faster than their respective markets with differentiated portfolios and a strong commercial execution, supported by healthy procedural demand.\nFirst quarter EPS of $0.47 grew 19% versus 2022, exceeding the high end of the guidance range of $0.42 to $0.44. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, which is in line with expectations.\nNow for our 2023 guidance. For second quarter '23, organic revenue, we're guiding to growth of 7% to 9% and full year organic growth of 8% to 10%. Our second quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.48 to $0.50. And we're guiding to a full year adjusted EPS range of $1.90 to $1.96.\nI'll provide additional highlights on first quarter, along with comments on our 2023 outlook, and Dan will provide more details on the financials. Regionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 13% versus first quarter '22 inclusive of 140 basis point tailwind from the Baylis acquisition with notable strength -- with notable organic strength across all our business units.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa grew 20% on an operational basis versus first quarter '22 with nearly every market growing double digits in the quarter. This strong above-market growth is driven by our diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand. We remain excited about the year ahead and expect to continue to outpace our peers within the EMEA market.\nAsia Pac grew 15% operationally versus first quarter '22 with broad-based strength across all major markets and business units. Within the quarter, we're pleased to have received Health Sciences Authority approval for Farapulse in Singapore, expanding access of this innovative new technology to more patients.\nIn Japan, first quarter growth was fueled by the launch of AGENT, drug coated balloon, a differentiated coronary drug-coated balloon for in-stent restenosis and small vessels with physicians pleased with ease of use in balloon deliverability.\nChina also grew double digits in first quarter, ahead of our expectations with solid procedural demand as hospitals work through COVID delayed procedures. Our diverse portfolio in China, commercial execution and supply chain management within the country supported the strong performance in the quarter.\nIn February, we also closed our majority stake investment in Acotec, further expanding our presence in the market, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in China for the full year.\nI'll now provide some comments on our business units. Urology sales grew 16% organically. All four franchises grew double digits in the quarter with strength in key products, including LithoVue and Rezum.\nIn the U.S., we received FDA clearance and initiated a limited market release for LithoVue Elite, which is a single-use flexible ureteroscope, which incorporates an innovative pressure-sensing capability that will enable physicians to monitor intrarenal pressure during stone removal procedures.\nEndoscopy sales for the quarter grew 11% organically versus first quarter '22 with broad-based strength across all regions and franchises. Our Single-Use-Imaging franchise grew double digits, so we're pleased to have recently launched our third-generation EXALT-D with improved ergonomic design updates to improve the physician experience.\nIn April, we closed the Apollo Endosurgery acquisition, which furthers our category leadership strategy within the important area of endoluminal surgery. With differentiated technologies like OverStitch and X-Tack along with an entry into the adjacent endobariatric market.\nNeuromodulation sales grew 14% organically versus first quarter '22. Our pain business grew high single digits in the quarter with strong SCS performance driven by our innovative Alpha portfolio with FAST therapy and our Cognita suite of digital tools supporting patient activation.\nOur brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter, driven by new product launches, including GUIDE XT, which was developed in collaboration with Brainlab. This revolutionary software provides implanting and managing clinicians the ability to model the effect of a patient simulation ahead of actual programming, which will improve procedural efficiency.\nIn the quarter, peripheral interventions also grew 12% organically versus first quarter '22. Our arterial franchise grew double digits, led by our drug-eluting portfolio, establishing clear leadership in SFA drug elution, further supported by our differentiated Eluvia long-length DES.\nOur Venous franchise growth was driven by ongoing above-market performance in Varithena. And within the quarter, we launched EKOS Plus in the U.S., which provides more ultrasound power to resolve clot burden more quickly and completely.\nOur Interventional Oncology franchise grew double digits with strength across the entire portfolio. We look forward to initiating our limited market release in the second quarter for Obsidio, the first conformable embolic indication for the peripheral vasculature.\nCardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 17% and organic sales growing 15% versus first quarter '22. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies, sales grew 13%.\nOur coronary therapies franchise grew low double digits in first quarter, led by strong performance within our imaging portfolio with particular strength in the U.S. with the ongoing launch of the AVVIGO-II guidance system.\nOur Structural Heart Valves franchise continues to grow strong double digits, and we're pleased to have completed enrollment on our ACURATE IDE trial and continue to expect to launch ACURATE Neo2 within the U.S. in the second half of 2024.\nWatchman sales grew 29% organically versus first quarter '22. Demand remains very strong for Watchman FLX, and we now have treated more than 300,000 patients globally since launch.\nWe are proud of our performance to date, and we continue to invest for the future through product innovation, solutions and clinical evidence. Last week, the Population Health Research Institute announced the IDE approval of [ LOUS 4 ], which is a collaborative research study with Boston Scientific that will continue to expand our LAAC clinical evidence. This trial is expected to start in mid-2023 and will complement the existing CHAMPION AF and Option trials.\nCardiac Rhythm Management sales grew 8% organically versus first quarter '22. Our Diagnostics franchise grew strong double digits in the quarter with continued momentum across the portfolio.\nIn core CRM, both our high-voltage and low-voltage businesses grew mid-single digits. And we believe that all major markets were in line or slightly above market growth. We do expect our core CM growth to taper closer to market growth for the remainder of '23 as replacement tailwinds neutralize.\nElectrophysiology sales grew 54% operationally and 31% organically versus first quarter '22. Our international EP business grew 40%. And importantly, the EMEA region grew our EP business 57%, driven by strong adoption of Farapulse and POLARx.\nWe continue to invest in the expansion of our portfolio and received approval in Japan, Canada and Europe for POLARx FIT, which is an expandable balloon catheter, capable of creating 28- and 31-millimeter sizes, providing procedural adaptability and efficiency.\nAnd just last week, 1 year outcomes data from the MANIFEST-PF registry were presented as a late breaker at EHRA. This is the first large real-world dataset on a novel ablation technology, which demonstrated real-world safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Farapulse PFA system.\nThe data also reinforced the minimal learning curve and reproducibility of the Farapulse workflow and everyday commercial use. We continue to advance our clinical evidence within this space and initiate enrollment in our ADVANTAGE AF trial, which is studying the use of Farapulse for patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.\nWe also look forward to the readout of our Advent U.S. ID randomized controlled trial in the second half of this year and continue to expect the approval in the U.S. in '24. We're also very pleased with the performance of our Access Solutions franchise, which grew strong double digits in the first quarter, driven by further penetration into transseptal crossing procedures.\nLast week, we released our '22 performance report, outlining our environmental, social and governance results. We are pleased with the progress our global teams have made to advance sustainable innovation while contributing to a healthier planet, addressing in equities and supporting communities around the world.\nWe have much more to do, and our values-based culture will serve us well as we continue to transform lives and hold ourselves accountable to our commitments.\nWe are confident the year ahead will bring many more exciting milestones across each of our business units, and we remain committed to our financial goals of consistently growing faster than our underlying markets and our peer group, expanding operating margins and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth with strong free cash flow generation. We also look forward to hosting our hybrid Investor Day event on September 20.\nWith that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\n\nDaniel Brennan\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nThanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $3.389 billion represents 12% reported revenue growth versus first quarter 2022 and reflects an $88 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations with continued volatility in foreign exchange rates throughout the quarter. .\nExcluding this 290 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 14.9% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis through mid-February contributed 90 basis points, resulting in 14% organic revenue growth, nicely exceeding our guidance range of 6% to 8%.\nStrong revenue performance resulted in Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.47, again, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.42 to $0.44 and representing growth of 19.2% versus 2022. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%.\nWe continue to expect full year 2023 gross margin to include a similar level of macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds as 2022 and expect a sequential improvement in Q2, resulting in a first half 2023 gross margin that is higher than the second half of 2023, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements in 2022.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%. We continue to prioritize operating margin expansion and are maintaining our full year 2023 goal of approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the full year 2022. On a GAAP basis, the first quarter operating margin was 16.3%.\nMoving to below the line. First quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $78 million, slightly favorable to expectations due to gains on certain unhedged currencies.\nOn an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the first quarter was 12.8%, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting, slightly higher than expectations due to the timing of certain discrete tax items. Our operational tax rate was 13.8% for the first quarter in line with our full year expectations of approximately 14%.\nFully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.446 billion shares in Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was $83 million, with $190 million from operating activities, less $108 million net capital expenditures. Excluding payments related to acquisitions, restructuring and other special items, adjusted free cash flow was $229 million.\nWe continue to aim for full year 2023 adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of March 31, 2023, we had cash on hand of $570 million, which in accordance with accounting standards for less than wholly owned subsidiaries includes the cash balance from Acotec of approximately $140 million following the completion of our majority stake investment. As of March 31, our leverage was 2.5x, in line with our expectations.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and the full year 2023. We expect full year 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11%, which excludes an approximate 50 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.\nExcluding the impact of closed acquisitions, and the recently closed divestiture of our pathology business, which had approximately $24 million revenue in 2022, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10% versus 2022.\nWe expect second quarter 2023 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 7.5% to 9.5% versus Q2 2022 excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding the contribution from closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect second quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%.\nWe expect our full year 2023 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $340 million. We continue to expect our full year 2023 operational tax rate to be approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13% under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales.\nWe expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.458 billion shares for Q2 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the 23.98 million shares we expect to issue based on our current stock price on June 1, 2023, upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock.\nWe expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the approximately $14 million quarterly preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion.\nWe expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.90 to $1.96, representing 11% to 15% growth versus 2022, which we believe delivers top-tier financial performance. We continue to anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share.\nWe expect second quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.48 to $0.50. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2023 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q1 results and 2023 guidance.\nBefore I turn the call over for a few upcoming events, to note: we will be hosting our Annual Shareholder Meeting on May 4 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern and our Q2 2023 earnings call on Thursday, July 27, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector Investor Relations, Boston Scientific Corp.\n\nThanks, Dan. [indiscernible] let's open it up to questions for the next 35 minutes or so. In order for us to take as many questions as possible, please try and limit yourself to one question. Jamie, please go ahead."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThank you, Drew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 and full year '22 results, which includes reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings. The duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour.\nMike and Dan will provide comments on Q4 and full year performance as well as the outlook for our business, including 2023 guidance, and then we'll take your questions.\nDuring today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith, and Dr. Ken Stein.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\nRelevant acquisitions excluded for organic growth or Preventice, Farapulse, and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August, and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022.\nDivestitures include the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals business, which closed on March 1, 2021. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreements to purchase a majority stake in M.I.Tech and Acotec as well as the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery, which are all expected to close in the first half of 2023.\nFor more information, please refer to our Financial and Operating Highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website.\nOn this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate, and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new and anticipated product approvals and launches; acquisitions; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins, and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend, and other expenses.\nIf our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.\nFactors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2022 represented a return to more durable and consistent procedural growth within the markets we serve, which provided a stronger base for our innovative portfolio.\nI'm very proud of the resiliency and winning spirit of our global team, delivering on our sales and EPS goals despite the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain challenges. Importantly, we delivered strong performance across all geographic regions and believe that most -- all of our business units gained or maintained market share throughout the year.\nIn fourth quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 9% and organic sales grew 7% versus fourth quarter '21, which was the low end of the guidance range. However, it's very important to note that these results include an unplanned sales reserve of $60 million, established for an Italian government payback provision which resulted in the headwind of approximately 200 basis points for the quarter.\nThe underlying fourth quarter performance was strong on both sales, operating margin increases, and earnings per share. And without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our organic sales guidance range of 7% to 9%. Full year '22 operational sales grew 11% versus '21, while organic sales grew 9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 9%.\nFourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.45 declined minus 2% versus '21, and full year adjusted EPS of $1.71 grew 5% versus '21, both achieved in the low end of the guidance range. Once again, without the impact of the Italian sales reserve, we would achieve the high end of the guidance range for both fourth quarter and full year of $1.71 to $1.74.\nWe generated full year free cash flow of $950 million and adjusted free cash flow of $2.1 billion, in line with our expectations.\nNow for outlook for 2023. We are guiding to organic growth of 6% to 8% for both first quarter '23 and full year '23, which excludes the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and Acotec, all of which are expected to close in the first half of 2023.\nOur first quarter '23 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.42 to $0.44, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $1.86 to $1.93. And despite the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and supply chain headwinds, we remain committed to our goal of plus 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in 2023.\nDan will provide more details on our '22 performance, the Italian sales reserve, and our '23 outlook. I'll now provide some additional highlights on '22 results along with comments on our '23 outlook.\nRegionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 10% versus fourth quarter '21. Full year '22 grew 11%, inclusive of a 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions, with particular strength in our WATCHMAN, Endo, and urology business units.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa grew 11% on an operational basis versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% on a full year basis. This above-market growth was supported by ongoing investments in emerging markets, new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio, pricing discipline, and strong commercial execution. We're excited about the year ahead with ongoing momentum across the region, particularly with our innovative EP portfolio and further opportunity with Baylis in the Access Solutions franchise.\nAsia Pacific grew 10% operationally versus fourth quarter '21 and 12% for the full year. On a full year basis, 6 out of 8 business units grew double digits, supported by ongoing innovation across the region. Full year Japan growth was driven by new products, including POLARx, which has approximately 50% share in open accounts.\nWe look forward to 2023 with ongoing momentum from both new products and are excited about our recent approval and reimbursement received for AGENT DCB, which is a coronary drug-coated balloon for in-stent restenosis in small vessels.\nOn a full year basis, China grew more than 20%, fueled by 13 new product launches, ongoing portfolio diversification, and the team's resiliency and execution. We continue to expand our presence in the China market with the recently announced acquisition of a majority stake in Acotec.\nWe believe this investment can create strategic value for both companies with opportunities to collaborate in R&D, manufacturing, and commercial strategies. We also continue to expect China to be a double-digit grower in '23 despite ongoing VBP pressure and potential impact to procedure volumes in Q1 from COVID.\nIn Latin America, the momentum continued with operational sales growth of 16% versus fourth quarter '21 and full year growth of 28%, with all business units growing double digits versus '21.\nOn the business units, starting with urology. Urology sales grew 12%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis. They grew 15% operationally and 10% organically versus '21. Within the quarter, all franchises grew double digits, fueled by new and ongoing product launches and continued global expansion.\nOn a full year basis, global growth was driven by key products such as LithoVue, Rezum, and SpaceOAR as well as the acquisition of the Lumenis and the Moses Laser Technology, further complementing the urology portfolio. Endoscopy sales grew 7% organically in the quarter, and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21.\nIn '22, we had global success with innovative products such as AXIOS and Single-Use-Imaging, both growing over 20% and supporting strong growth across the globe. In the fourth quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Apollo Endosurgery, which will add a complementary in innovative endoluminal surgery portfolio.\nWe look forward to closing this acquisition as well as our previously announced majority stake in M.I. Tech, which includes the innovative HANAROSTENT in the first half of '23. Neuromodulation sales grew 5% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 3% organically versus '21.\nGlobally, our spinal cord stimulation business grew 4% in the fourth quarter with continued physician enthusiasm for WaveWriter Alpha and FAST. We continue to invest in clinical evidence to expand indications and present a 3-month data from our nonsurgical back study, SOLIS, at NANS earlier this year. The study comparing SCS to conventional medical management met its primary endpoints, and we anticipate FDA approval for nonsurgical back indication by the end of '23.\nOur Brain franchise grew double digits in the quarter and low double digits on a full year basis. This strong performance is aided by continued momentum from new product launches in '22 as well as the recent launch of the Vercise 2-in-1 lead extension.\nPeripheral Interventions sales grew 9% organically versus both fourth quarter '21 and full year '21. Within Arterial, we are pleased with the performance of our drug-eluting portfolio growing strong double digits for the full year and achieving the #1 global position -- I'm sorry, the #1 position within SFA in the U.S.\nOn a full year basis, our Venous franchise was flat versus prior year with Varithena, our market-leading varicose vein offering, growing over 20% in 2022. Our Interventional Oncology franchise performed well in '22, growing low double digits, led by our portfolio of innovative cancer therapies and suite of embolization tools.\nWe continue to invest in expanding the potential applications of TheraSphere and enrolled our first patient in our early feasibility study, FRONTIER, avowed in the image of -- safety of image-guided intra-arterial delivery of TheraSphere GBM in patients with the reoccurring glioblastoma.\nCardiology delivered another excellent quarter, with operational sales growing 13% and organic sales growing 10% versus fourth quarter '21. On a full year basis, sales grew 14% operationally and 10% organically. Our newly aligned cardiology group delivered strong growth across its 4 businesses, as we continue to invest in the higher growth segments and differentiated offerings for our customers that address the areas of greatest cardiac need for patients.\nWithin Cardiology, Interventional Cardiology Therapy sales grew 5% organically in fourth quarter and on a full year basis grew 8% organically versus '21. On a full year basis, the Coronary Therapies' franchise, which includes both drug-eluting stents and complex PCI grew 7%, driven by strong performance in our international regions and our imaging franchise.\nOur Structural Heart Valves franchise grew double digits in both fourth quarter and the full year basis, outpacing the market in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 aortic valve, ongoing clinical evidence to support growth throughout '22 and in the fourth quarter.\nData from the ACURATE neo2 PMCF study was presented as a late-breaker at PCR London Valves, demonstrating positive safety and 30-day outcomes with low PVL rates and best-in-class pacemaker implantation rates. Additionally, we enrolled our first patient in the ACURATE Prime XL Nested Registry, assessing the safety and efficacy of the ACURATE Prime Aortic Valve XL to treat patients with severe aortic restenosis who need a larger valve size for the TAVR procedure.\nWATCHMAN sales grew 22% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis, grew 24% organically versus '21. Q4 finished with record sales, strong utilization in the U.S. supported by the DAPT label expansion. Importantly, we completed the enrollment of our CHAMPION AF trial way ahead of schedule. This head-to-head trial versus novel oral anticoagulation has the potential to more than triple the number of patients indicated for WATCHMAN FLX in 2027 and beyond.\nWe remain excited about this outlook for this business and expect double-digit growth in 2023, fueled by innovation, ongoing clinical evidence, and strong commercial execution. CRM sales grew 6%, both operationally and organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 8% operationally and 7% organically.\nOur diagnostics franchise had a strong year, growing double digits versus '21. In core CRM, on the full year basis, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, and our low-voltage business grew mid-single digits, and we expect that all major markets were in line or slightly above the market.\nElectrophysiology sales grew 76% operationally and 25% organically versus fourth quarter '21 and on a full year basis grew 69% operationally and 18% organically versus '21. Importantly, our international EP business continues to outpace the market, growing over 40% organically versus fourth quarter '21.\nPOLARx continues to perform well in both Europe and Japan, has now been treated to treat over 25,000 patients since launch. Momentum in Farapulse continues with another strong quarter of growth in Europe. And we continue to invest in clinical evidence and look forward to the readout of the randomized ADVENT U.S. IDE trial in the second half of '23 and are planning to initiate our ADVANTAGE AF trial to these Farapulse patients with persistent AFib imminently.\nWe've been very pleased with the performance of our Baylis acquisition and the innovative VersaCross platform, which grew 2x faster than the market in '22. We launched our VersaCross Connect in '22, improving efficiencies in our WATCHMAN procedure.\nEarlier this year, we shared our strategy consistent with years past. We continue to position ourselves to win in the markets we play through meaningful innovation by balancing our financial commitments. And in '22, we announced 4 acquisitions, invested 10% of our sales in internal R&D to fund sustainable growth and advance patient care.\nWe're extremely excited about the year ahead and remain focused on our people and sustaining a culture that is motivated to drive differentiated performance and achieve our long-term goals, continuing to grow sales faster than markets, continuing to expand operating margins, and delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation.\nSo before I turn it over to Dan, I want to share that with the retirement of Dr. Ian Meredith, Dr. Ken Stein will assume some of the global responsibilities that previously fell under Ian, including total company investor engagement, in addition to his CRM, EP, and WATCHMAN roles.\nPlease join me in congratulating Ken, and thanking Ian for his many contributions. With that, I'll pass it off to Dan to provide more details on the financials.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $3.242 billion represents a 3.7% reported revenue growth versus the fourth quarter 2021 and reflects a $158 million headwind from foreign exchange, slightly favorable to our expectations as the U.S. dollar weakened throughout the quarter.\nExcluding this 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 8.7% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisition of Baylis contributed 160 basis points resulting in 7.1% organic revenue growth at the low end of our guidance range of 7% to 9% growth versus 2021, including an approximate 200 basis point impact associated with an unplanned sales reserve related to an Italian government payback provision, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWith the goal of recovering spending above the government's medical device budgets, this payback provision requires companies that have supplied medical devices to public hospitals in Italy to pay back a portion of these overrun amounts. While we and others in our industry, have appealed and will continue to challenge the enforceability of the law through the Italian court system.\nWe established a sales reserve of $60 million in the fourth quarter, representing our best estimates of amounts we could be required to pay back. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of the organic revenue growth guidance range.\nFlow-through on the Italian sales reserve resulted in Q4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.45, at the low end of our range, representing a decline of 2% versus 2021. Without the reserve, we would have achieved the high end of our range for the quarter.\nFull year 2022 consolidated revenue of $12.682 billion represents 6.7% reported revenue growth versus full year 2021 and reflects a $524 million headwind from foreign exchange. Excluding this 440 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 11.1% for the year.\nSales from closed acquisitions contributed 240 basis points, resulting in 8.7% organic revenue growth, in line with expectations and inclusive of a 50 basis point impact associated with the Italian sales reserve. Full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $1.71 represents 4.8% growth versus 2021, achieving the low end of our guidance range of $1.71 to $1.74. Without the unplanned Italian sales reserve, we would have been at the high end of our full year guidance range.\nAdjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.5%, resulting in full year 2022 adjusted gross margin also of 70.5%, in line with our expectations. Full year adjusted gross margin improved versus 2021, driven by an FX tailwind of approximately 100 basis points related to our hedging contracts, partially offset by continued macroeconomic headwinds.\nThese headwinds were approximately $375 million versus 2019 and are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances primarily related to direct material cost and availability.\nOur 2023 guidance assumes macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds will be similar to 2022. Different from prior years, we expect first half 2023 gross margin to be higher than the second half, largely due to the timing of foreign exchange movements that occurred during 2022.\nFourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.7% resulting in full year 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6%, improving 30 basis points versus 2021, inclusive of a 30 basis point negative impact from the unplanned Italian sales reserve.\nAs we look to 2023, we continue to focus on our goal of annual operating margin expansion. And despite our expectation of continued macroeconomic headwinds, our goal is to achieve approximately 26.4% adjusted operating margin for the full year 2023, representing 80 basis points of improvement versus the 2022 adjusted operating margin of 25.6% and importantly, 50 basis points of expansion compared to the full year 2022 adjusted operating margin without the impact of the Italian sales reserve.\nOn a GAAP basis, the fourth quarter operating margin was 12.4%, including $131 million in litigation-related expenses, which I'll provide detail on in a moment. Moving to below the line. Fourth quarter adjusted interest and other expense totaled $88 million, resulting in full year adjusted interest and other expense of $362 million, slightly higher than our expectations, driven in part by an FX loss from certain unhedged currencies.\nOn an adjusted basis, our tax rate for the fourth quarter was 11.9% and 12.7% for the full year 2022, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Our operational tax rate was 12% for the fourth quarter and 13.5% for the full year, slightly favorable to our expectations of approximately 14%.\nFully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1.442 billion in Q4 and 1.440 billion for the full year 2022. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $776 million, and free cash flow was $597 million with $807 million from operating activities less $210 million of net capital expenditures.\nFull year 2022 adjusted free cash flow was $2.1 billion, in line with expectations, and free cash flow was $949 million with $1.5 billion from operating activities, less $576 million of net capital expenditures.\nFor 2023, we expect adjusted free cash flow in excess of $2.3 billion. As of December 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $928 million. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Apollo Endosurgery and the majority stake investments in M.I. Tech and Acotec with cash on hand or available credit lines in the first half of 2023.\nOur top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of December 31, our leverage was 2.57x, in line with our expectations, and we were pleased to be upgraded to BBB+ with a stable outlook at both Fitch and Standard & Poor's within the quarter.\nOur legal reserve was $443 million as of December 31, an increase of $139 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to our mesh litigation. While our U.S. case count has remained materially the same over the past 3 years, we've increased our reserve to account for our latest estimates of the time and cost to resolve these claims as well as remaining probable and estimable global claims. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2023.\nAnd as a reminder, guidance excludes any acquisitions that have not yet closed. We expect full year 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 7% versus 2022. Excluding an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, based on current rates, and a 20 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect full year 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8% versus 2022.\nWe expect first quarter 2023 reported revenue growth to be in a range of 3% to 5% versus Q1 2022. Excluding an approximate 350 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and a 70 basis point contribution from closed acquisitions, we expect first quarter 2023 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8%.\nWe expect our full year 2023 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $340 million. Under current legislation and forecasted geographic mix of sales, we forecast a full year 2023 operational tax rate of approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting for stock compensation, which we expect will largely be recognized in the first quarter, resulting in a Q1 2023 adjusted tax rate of approximately 12%.\nWe expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.447 billion shares for Q1 2023 and 1.464 billion shares for full year 2023, which includes the shares we expect to issue on June 1 this year related to our May 2020 mandatory convertible preferred stock offering. We expect the impact to adjusted earnings per share to be neutral with the preferred stock dividend ending at the time of conversion.\nWe expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.86 to $1.93, representing 9% to 13% growth versus 2022. At current rates and existing hedging contracts, we anticipate a neutral impact from FX on full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share. We expect first quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.42 to $0.44. For more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q4 results and 2023 guidance.\nIn closing, I'm very proud of the results that our global team achieved in 2022 with top-tier revenue performance and differentiated operating margin expansion despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, and I'm looking forward to continued momentum during 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. Drew, let's open it up to questions for the next 30 minutes-or-so. (Operator Instructions) Drew, please go ahead."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q3 2022 results which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.\nThe duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike and Dan will provide comments on Q3 performance as well as the outlook for our business, including Q4 '22 and full year '22 guidance. And then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith; and Dr. Ken Stein.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions include -- excluded for organic growth are Preventice, FARAPULSE and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively; as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. Divestitures include the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals, which closed on March 1, 2021. Guidance excludes the previously announced agreement to purchase the majority stake of M.I. Tech, which is expected to close by year-end 2022.\nFor more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic.\nThis call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, statements about our growth and market share; new and anticipated product approvals and launches; acquisitions; clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings, as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.\nAt this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us here today. We're very proud of our performance in the third quarter, particularly in light of the ongoing macroeconomic and supply chain headwinds. Our performance continues to be supported by the strength and diversification of our innovative portfolio and the winning spirit of our global team.\nThird quarter '22 total company operational sales grew 14% versus prior year. And organic sales grew 11.5%, which does exceed the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10%. This performance is a testament to our category leadership strategy and focus on innovation with strong commercial execution. 6 of 8 of our business units grew double digits organically, and we believe that nearly all of our businesses and regions grew faster than their respective markets. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.43 grew 6.3% versus prior year, at the low end of our guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45, attributable to increased FX headwinds and slightly higher spend within the quarter.\nWe have grown 9.2% organically year-to-date through third quarter. And in light of this performance, we are increasing our full year '22 guidance for operational growth to approximately 11.5% and organic growth to approximately 9%. For fourth quarter '22 revenue, we're guiding to operational growth of 8.5% to 10.5% and organic growth of 7% to 9%. We're also updating our full year '22 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.71 to $1.74, primarily related to the ongoing headwind from foreign exchange. Our fourth quarter '22 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.45 to $0.48.\nThroughout 2022, we have maintained our goal to improve operating margins. While our goal remains, we feel it's prudent to provide an updated adjusted operating margin target of approximately 26%, considering the continued macroeconomic pressures. On a full year basis, this does represent approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion versus our 2021 rate of 25.3%.\nI'll now provide additional third quarter highlights along with some comments on future outlook. Regionally, the U.S. delivered operational growth of 12% versus prior year. Strong growth was realized across most all of our businesses -- business units, particularly cardiovascular and endoscopy, and included an approximate 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions.\nMiddle East -- I'm sorry. Europe, Middle East and Africa grew 15% on an operational basis versus prior year. We continue to see excellent execution fueled by our innovative portfolio, with 7 of the 8 business units growing double digits. Sales growth accelerated within our growth/emerging market countries within Europe, with notable strength across cardiology and peripheral interventions.\nIn Asia Pac, we grew 15% operationally with strong growth in China, India and ASEAN countries. While our Japan results saw some impact from COVID within the quarter, we continue to see strength driven by new products, including POLARx, WATCHMAN FLX and Rezum. Our team in China delivered excellent results in the third quarter with growth of 36%. Growth is primarily driven by our ICTx business within cardiovascular, PI and our CRM business units, supported by new and ongoing product launches across the portfolio.\nTurning to Latin America. The team executed another exceptional quarter, growing 29% operationally.\nAll business units in major markets grew double digits in the third quarter. And across the portfolio, more than 10 new products were launched, enabled by remote training and support.\nI'll now provide some thoughts on our business units, starting with Urology and Pelvic Health, which grew organic sales 13% and 16% on an operational basis. The stone management, prosthetic urology and prostate health franchises all grew double digits in third quarter, with balanced performance across the regions.\nWe continue to focus on global expansion and are pleased to have received approval and commenced the launches of SpaceOAR in both Korea and Mexico and Rezum in Japan. Our Lumenis acquisition did turn organic in September. And we remain excited about the global opportunity ahead with the Moses laser technology, LithoVue Single-Use flexible ureteroscopes and our broad portfolio of stone management products.\nIn Endoscopy, sales grew 10% organically. This category-leading business continues to focus on product innovations, enhanced by best-in-class physician education and training. Growth in the quarter was driven by our biliary and single-use imaging franchises with ongoing market development activities enabling increased utilization of EXALT-D and other key products.\nIn Neuromodulation, organic revenue grew 3%. Our pain franchise sales were flat year-over-year, below our expectations, with ongoing reimbursement challenges impacting U.S. procedures for both Vertiflex and spinal cord stimulation.\nIn SCS, while international growth was very strong with broad demand for WaveWriter Alpha, our U.S. SCS sales were impacted by preauthorization denials despite strong patient demand and ongoing physician interest in our FAST therapy. We have a team in place focused on supporting the preauthorization documentation requirements. However, we do anticipate that challenges will continue to persist in the fourth quarter.\nIn deep brain stimulation, the U.S., EMEA and LatAm regions grew double digits in the third quarter. Globally, we're seeing stable underlying DBS procedure growth, and we continue to see momentum in the U.S. as we moved into full launch of our STIMVIEW XT integrated imaging and programming platforms.\nCardiology delivered another excellent quarter with organic sales growing 13% and operational sales growing 16%. Within Cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies' organic sales grew 11%. This coronary therapies franchise performed well in third quarter, driven by strong performance in our international regions, particularly with our differentiated imaging franchise. Importantly, we recently completed enrollment in our AGENT IDE trial. This is the very first U.S. trial for a coronary drug-coated balloon to treat in-stent restenosis. And we expect to launch in Japan in '23, in the U.S. in 2024.\nOur structural heart valves franchise did grow double digits in the third quarter again with continued strength in Europe with our ACURATE neo2 TAVR platform. Additionally, results from the PROTECTED TAVR trial were presented as a late-breaker at TCT. Recall, the PROTECTED TAVR trial studied our cerebral embolic protection device, SENTINEL, with TAVR versus unprotected TAVR. With a reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke -- while the reduction in the primary endpoint of overall stroke did not reach statistical significance, a secondary analysis demonstrated a clinically meaningful 63% relative risk reduction in severe disabling stroke.\nTurning to WATCHMAN. Organic sales grew 26% in third quarter. Global growth continues to be very strong, further supported by the U.S. FDA approval of an expanded label to include DAPT, giving physicians and patients choice of DAPT or OAC in the first 45 days post-implant.\nWe continue to focus on innovation in this space with a TruSteer, which is our new steerable sheath. And we also highlighted our next-generation FLX device, WATCHMAN FLX Pro, at our TCT investor event in September. We expect FLX Pro to build on our second-generation FLX with additional sizes and a device coating designed to enhance healing.\nIn Cardiac Rhythm Management, organic sales grew 7% versus prior year. We had another strong quarter of performance as we continue to focus on lifetime patient management, from diagnostics to implant, with our broad portfolio. Within core CRM, our low-voltage franchise grew mid-single digits and high-voltage grew low single digits. Our diagnostics franchise continues to perform very well. We're pleased to have received CE Mark for our implantable cardiac monitor, LUX-Dx, and we have commenced our commercial launch.\nElectrophysiology sales grew 26% on an organic basis and 83% on an operational basis. We continue to see strength in our comprehensive international portfolio, which grew 45% organically. And this includes 2 months of contribution from FARAPULSE. Physician demand for POLARx in Japan and FARAPULSE and POLARx in Europe remains very strong, and we continue to see increased utilization at existing centers, while we are expanding into new accounts. In addition, we're pleased to have launched FARAPULSE in Australia and Singapore under special access, and we anticipate approval in '23.\nThe Baylis integration continues to go well with the differentiated transseptal access portfolio growing double digits in the quarter and remains on track to achieve our full year expectations.\nIn Peripheral Interventions, organic sales grew 12% with broad growth across all major franchises and regions. In arterial, our differentiated drug-eluting portfolio grew double digits in the quarter and we received FDA approval for a line extension of Eluvia and commenced launch of the longest length of drug eluting stent for peripheral arterial disease in the U.S.\nThe Interventional Oncology business had another very strong quarter with great growth and continued strength in our cancer therapies, [ICEex] and TheraSphere. We're pleased to have closed on the acquisition of Obsidio and the gel embolic material technology. Obsidio is the first gel embolic with an indication for the peripheral vasculature and a complementary addition to our portfolio. We look forward to launching this technology within the U.S. in 2023.\nIn alignment with our overall commitment to progress our environment, social and governance efforts, the PI division announced collaboration with a health care data platform, Truveta, aiming to provide insights to help better address health care disparities within various PI disease states.\nWe remain committed to driving sustainable innovation to Boston Scientific. And despite the persistent macroeconomic pressures, we continue to invest for the long term in R&D, execute strategic tuck-in M&A with a focus on improving patient outcomes today and into the future.\nWe're also excited about the opportunities ahead and remain focused on our long-term financial goals: Continuing to grow sales faster than the markets, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow generation.\nBefore I turn it over to Dan, I do want to take a moment to share that our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Ian Meredith, will be retiring in April of 2023. We're extremely grateful for his strong contributions, particularly his dedication to patients, clinical science and meaningful innovation. And his great sense of humor.\nWith that, I'll now turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance in more detail.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Third quarter consolidated revenue of $3.170 billion million represents 8.1% reported revenue growth versus third quarter 2021 and reflects a $162 million headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our expectations due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. Excluding this 550 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 13.7% in the quarter.\nSales from the acquisitions of FARAPULSE through July, Lumenis through August and Baylis contributed 220 basis points, resulting in 11.5% organic revenue growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 8% to 10% growth versus 2021.\nContinued foreign exchange headwinds and slightly higher spend on R&D investment across the portfolio largely offset our top line outperformance, resulting in Q3 adjusted earnings per share of $0.43, achieving the low end of our guidance range, representing 6.3% growth versus 2021.\nAdjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.7%, in line with our expectations. The macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, particularly related to inflationary pressures and availability of materials, which have largely offset a slight improvement in freight costs.\nFor full year 2022, we continue to expect adjusted gross margin to be slightly below 70.8%, which includes $375 million in macroeconomic headwinds versus 2019. These headwinds are predominantly from increased freight costs and unfavorable manufacturing variances, primarily related to direct material cost and availability with a smaller portion attributable to increased labor costs. Recall, unfavorable manufacturing variances are recognized over approximately 6 months, in line with our inventory turns.\nThird quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.5%, slightly lower than our expectations. We continue to focus on our global goal of operating margin expansion, but believe it is prudent to update our operating margin target to allow for the flexibility to weigh near-term spend discipline with investments to continue to fuel top line growth. We now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be approximately 26%.\nOnetime charges within the quarter's results included a minor write-off related to the discontinuation of our SAVAL program. In addition, we recognized a GAAP charge attributable to an intangible asset impairment of $125 million primarily related to Vertiflex as the business continues to face reimbursement challenges impacting the revenue outlook for the product. On a GAAP basis, the third quarter operating margin was 11.3%.\nMoving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $91 million in Q3, higher than our expectations driven in part by FX losses from certain unhedged currencies. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 11.9% on an adjusted basis, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 14%, in line with expectations. We ended Q3 with 1.440 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nAdjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $626 million; and free cash flow, $320 million, with $470 million from operating activities, less $150 million net capital expenditures. We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2 billion.\nOur total legal reserve as of September 30 was $304 million, a decrease of $210 million versus June 30, primarily related to mesh and certain IP litigation payments.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash on hand of $338 million. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. As of September 30, our leverage was 2.5x, and we now expect year-end leverage to be at or slightly below 2.5x.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q4 and the full year 2022. We expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be approximately 11.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 500 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, 100 basis points higher than our previous expectations. Excluding a 250 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis, and $13 million of pre-divestiture Specialty Pharmaceutical sales in 2021, we now expect full year 2022 organic revenue growth to be approximately 9% versus 2021, reflecting our strong Q4 performance and confidence in continued consistent procedural growth.\nWe expect fourth quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 8.5% to 10.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 650 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates. Excluding a 150 basis point contribution from the acquisition of Baylis, we expect fourth quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9%. We continue to expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $350 million.\nFull year 2022 operational tax rate expectations remain unchanged at approximately 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation and discrete tax items recognized year-to-date. Our tax rate expectations reflect current legislation, including a provision on the treatment of R&D expenditures. We continue to believe there's bipartisan support to reverse this provision. And if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our full year tax rate to revert to its historical range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted.\nWe expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.443 billion shares for Q4 2022 and 1.440 billion shares for the full year 2022.\nOur long-term hedging strategy continues to be effective at minimizing FX impact on EPS, and we are largely hedged through 2023. At current rates, we now anticipate FX headwinds on our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share of $0.06, which is $0.03 unfavorable versus previous expectations, due to the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As a result, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share range to $1.71 to $1.74, representing 5% to 7% growth versus 2021. We expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $0.45 to $0.48.\nOne quick housekeeping item before I turn it back over to Lauren. We continue to expect full year 2022 preferred stock dividend expense of approximately $55 million related to our May 2020 Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering using the if-converted method. These shares will mature on June 1, 2023. At which point, the dividend expense will retire, and our share count will increase based on our share price at the time of conversion. In each of the conversion scenarios, the resulting impact to EPS should be immaterial.\nFor more information, please check our Investor Relations website for Q3 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more details on Q3 results and the MCPS share conversion.\nIn closing, I'm proud of the results we've achieved year-to-date with continued revenue momentum. And despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on operating margin expansion, balanced with investment in our innovative portfolio, to drive continued above-market top line growth.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThank you, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up to questions for the next 35 minutes or so. (Operator Instructions). Andrew, please go ahead."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q2 2022 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release, as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call, to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials & Filings.\nThe duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q2 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q3 2022 and full year 2022 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q3 and full year guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith; and Dr. Ken Stein.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions excluded for the organic growth or Preventice, FARAPULSE and Lumenis Surgical which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively; as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. Divestitures include the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals which closed on March 1, 2021. Guidance excludes the recently announced agreement to purchase the majority stake of M.I. Tech which is expected to close in the second half of 2022. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck which may be found on our Investor Relations website. On this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic.\nThis call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share; new and anticipated product approvals and launches; acquisitions, clinical trials; cost savings and growth opportunities; our cash flow and expected use; our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.\nAt this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Lauren, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. We're very pleased with our second quarter performance and our strong outlook for the full year, supported by our innovative portfolio, commercial execution, clinical evidence and strategic tuck-in M&A.\nIn the second quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 10% versus prior year, while organic sales grew 7% despite a strong comp of 9% organic growth in second quarter '21 versus 2019. Our sales results exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 3% to 6%. Importantly, we continue to grow faster than our peers in most of our businesses and regions.\nSecond quarter adjusted EPS of $0.44 grew 9.6% versus prior year, again, exceeding the guidance range of $0.41 to $0.43. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.2%, which is in line with expectations.\nWe anticipate more durable and consistent procedural growth for the remainder of the year as hospitals continue to manage through staffing challenges and COVID waves. Our first half revenue performance was 8.1%, and we anticipate growth to accelerate in the second half. And therefore, we are increasing our full year '22 guidance for operational growth from 10.5% to 11.5%, and organic growth to plus 8% to 9%. For third quarter '22 revenue, we're guiding to operational growth of 10% to 12% and organic growth of 8% to 10%.\nWe aim to improve operating margins in 2022. However, with the ongoing impact of supply chain challenges, we are updating our adjusted operating margin to 26% to 26.2% for the full year as a result of FX volatility and additional supply chain-related operating margin pressure. We are narrowing our full year '22 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.74 to $1.77. Our third quarter '22 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.43 to $0.45, and Dan will provide more details on both of these sales and EPS performance in the outlook.\nI'll now provide some additional highlights in the quarter along with comments on our '22 outlook. Regionally, the U.S. delivered operational growth of 7% versus prior year, and sales in the quarter included a transient impact from the contrast dye shortage primarily impacting our coronary therapies, WATCHMAN and PI business.\nIn Europe, Middle East, Africa, our business grew 12% on an operational basis versus prior year. We had excellent broad-based growth across the EMEA region with 5 of 8 business units posting double-digit growth. Key products in emerging markets within the region are driving growth across the portfolio, with particular strength in electrophysiology, WATCHMAN and interventional cardiology therapies.\nIn Asia, we grew 11% operationally versus prior year. We're quite pleased with the overall performance of the region despite the impact of COVID and related public health measures within China, with notable performance in Japan, India and our ASEAN countries. We continue to make progress with new products and commenced the first WATCHMAN FLX cases in China, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia. The China team executed well in a very tough environment, growing 9% and performing in line with our expectations. We remain confident in the team's ability to drive double-digit growth for the full year '22, supported by our diversified portfolio and commercial execution.\nLatin America grew 33% operationally versus prior year, and all 8 business units in the vast majority of countries grew double digits in the quarter.\nUrology and Pelvic Health organic sales grew 7% and 16% on an operational basis versus prior year. Globalization continues to be a focus with 44% growth within emerging markets driven by new and ongoing product launches, such as LithoVue and SpaceOAR, in key countries, with momentum continuing with the recent approval of the Tria Firm Ureteral Stent in China. We continue to be pleased with the Lumenis integration and execution of the global (technical difficulty)\nTurning to Endoscopy. Sales grew 6% organically versus prior year. Broadly, this diverse business continues to perform well with products like our innovative AXIOS Stent, the only stent indicated for transgastric and transduodenal access. We also continue to see strength in our single-use imaging franchise with EXALT-D expanding to new accounts and driving utilization.\nTo further broaden our portfolio, we announced an agreement to purchase a majority stake in M.I. Tech, which includes the novel HANARO STENT technology, a family of conformable, self-expanding metal stents. This agreement is expected to close in the second half of 2022.\nIn Neuromodulation, organic revenue declined 1% versus prior year against a very challenging year-over-year comp with the U.S. launches of WaveWriter Alpha and Vercise Genus, along with COVID procedure recovery in second quarter '21.\nIn pain, sales grew sequentially in second quarter with physicians excited about a robust and innovative portfolio of offerings for SCS, including WaveWriter Alpha, FAST therapy and the Cognita Practice Optimization suite of solutions.\nIn brain, performance also improved sequentially with the U.S. launch of the Neural Navigator software for -- with STIMVIEW XT, which is our integrated imaging and programming platform developed a partnership with Brainlab.\nIn Cardiology, our organic sales grew 8% versus prior year and operational sales grew 12%. Within cardiology, interventional cardiology therapies organic sales grew 6% versus prior year. Our coronary therapies franchise grew mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth within our Imaging business as our AVVIGO II Guidance System moved into full launch in the U.S.\nInternationally, strong growth continues, driven by our innovative and comprehensive portfolio for imaging [instruments in treating] complex coronary disease. Physician enthusiasm for ACURATE neo2 continues, supported by ongoing clinical data that further validates the differentiated enhancements of neo2, including the Italian neo registry, which demonstrated reduced rates of PVL, low PPI, excellent hemodynamics and high device success rate in more than 900 patients.\nTurning to WATCHMAN. Organic sales grew 17% versus prior year. Growth accelerated sequentially on a comp-adjusted basis, with strength across the region with a full launch of FLX in Japan, market share gains in Europe and increased penetration in the U.S. as we continue to drive awareness with ongoing clinical evidence in our second-generation device.\nWe remain confident, based on our ongoing discussions with FDA, that our DAPT submission will be approved in the coming months. And the uses of DAPT with FLX was recently highlighted in real-world data, with more than 17,000 patients with the NCDR registry. This demonstrated no significant difference in rates of major events at 45 days post implant. Whether patients were discharged from the hospital on DAPT, to DOAC and aspirin, or warfarin and aspirin.\nIn Rhythm Management, organic sales grew 7% versus prior year. In core CRM, we anticipate that our growth was at or above the market, with our low-voltage business growing mid-single digits and our high-voltage business growing low single digits.\nOur S-ICD franchise continues to perform well, further supported by positive data from the investigator-sponsored ATLAS trial presented at HRS earlier this year. The ATLAS trial compared EMBLEM S-ICD to single-chamber transvenous ICD devices and demonstrated similar protection from sudden death and superiority from serious lead-related complications at 6 months.\nOur Diagnostics business continues to perform well, outpacing the market, driven by the Preventice portfolio and our implantable cardiac LUX-Dx.\nIn electrophysiology, sales grew 9% on an organic basis and 67% on an operational basis versus prior year. Second quarter performance was led by strength and differentiation of our portfolio in Europe and Japan. We're pleased to have completed enrollment in both the NEwTON AF trial and the ADVENT trial, important steps to expand the offering of our StablePoint force-sensing catheter in the U.S. in 2023 and FARAPULSE in the U.S. in 2024. Physician enthusiasm is very strong for both our POLARx and FARAPULSE platforms in Europe, and we're looking forward to increasing our account openings in the second half of this year.\nThe Baylis team continues to execute well with strong performance in the quarter, led by VersaCross-RF access system. The integration is on track, and we're excited to have launched the Baylis-developed VersaCross Connect LAAC Solution to provide safe and more efficient access to left-side heart for WATCHMAN FLX implants.\nIn Peripheral Interventions, organic sales grew 6% versus prior year. Within the arterial franchise, we had another very strong quarter of double-digit growth in the drug-eluting portfolio as Ranger and Eluvia solidified their positions in key global markets.\nIn venous, the U.S. clot management business was impacted in the quarter by both the transient impact of the contrast shortage as well as by competition, largely offset by strength in Varithena sales as we continue to expand market share with our innovative offering.\nInterventional Oncology grew low double digits in the quarter, fueled by our innovative cancer therapies, TheraSphere and ICEfx, as well as the robust set of embolization access and delivery tools that we offer. Globalization remains a significant opportunity in the space. And notably, we have commenced treatment of patients with PDAC malignancies in the Hainan province of China with TheraSphere through a medical pilot program. Outside of the Hainan province, TheraSphere treatment in China is restricted to the MANDARIN clinical trial.\nEarlier this quarter, we issued our annual performance report which showcases our commitment to corporate responsibility and progress toward our longer-term goals. In this report, we highlight key metrics in support of our efforts, include performance against our first human capital scorecard, which tracks company-wide goals and is part of the company's annual bonus plan. You can access this report at any time through our Investor Relations website.\nWe're very pleased with our first half results and outlook for '22 and beyond despite the macroeconomic challenges we continue to face. Our innovative portfolio, category leadership strategy, commercial execution and commitment to ongoing and clinical evidence positions us well today and into the future. We look forward to hosting an investor event at TCT this September. We'll provide more details as they're available.\nWhile the macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging, we remain committed to our long-term financial goals, continuing to grow sales faster than underlying markets, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth and strong adjusted free cash flow. I remain very grateful to our employees for their winning spirit.\nI will now turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance in more detail.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $3.244 billion represents 5.4% reported revenue growth versus second quarter 2021 and reflects a $130 million headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our expectations due to the strengthened U.S. dollar. Excluding this 420 basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 9.6% in the quarter.\nQuarterly sales from the acquisitions of FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis contributed 300 basis points, resulting in 6.6% organic revenue growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 3% to 6% growth versus 2021.\nStrong top line results primarily drove Q2 adjusted earnings per share of $0.44, representing 9.6% growth versus 2021 and exceeding the high end of our guidance range of $0.41 to $0.43.\nAdjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.4%, in line with our expectations. Although we've seen some stabilization in the cost of freight, we do anticipate incremental second half headwinds of approximately $75 million versus pre-COVID level resulting from inefficiencies in our manufacturing plants due to the availability of direct materials and the cost to procure them. This incremental $75 million brings the total headwind versus 2019 to $375 million. Recall, this headwind is primarily driven by inflationary pressures on direct materials, freight and labor costs, as well as inefficiencies in our manufacturing plants due to material availability.\nWe now expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be slightly below the second half of 2021 adjusted gross margin of 70.8%. We anticipate a slight improvement to adjusted gross margin in the second half due to the full realization of standard cost improvements consistent with historical trends as well as an FX tailwind from the stronger U.S. dollar.\nSecond quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.2%, resulting in a first half adjusted operating margin of 25.5%. As a result of the increased macroeconomic pressures on gross margin, we now anticipate our full year adjusted operating margin to be within a range of to 26% to 26.2%. Despite these macroeconomic headwinds, we're focused on margin improvement versus the second half 2021 average of 25.9%, with our range representing 10 to 30 basis points of operating margin expansion.\nOn a GAAP basis, second quarter operating margin was 13%, including a charge related to ongoing IP litigation.\nMoving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $74 million in the quarter, lower than our expectations, driven in part by a onetime FX gain from certain unhedged currencies.\nOur tax rate for the second quarter was 12.8% on an adjusted basis, including discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 14.3%, in line with our expectations.\nWe ended Q2 with 1.438 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nAdjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $593 million, and free cash flow $204 million with $307 million from operating activities, less $103 million net capital expenditures. For full year 2021 adjusted free cash flow, we continue to aim to be at or above 2021 adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had cash on hand of $276 million, and we continue to expect to close the purchase of the majority stake of M.I. Tech in the second half of 2022 funded with cash on hand. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals. We continue to expect leverage of 2.5x by year-end 2022. And as of June 30, our leverage was 2.6x.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q3 and for the full year 2022. We expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 10.5% to 11.5% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 400 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, 200 basis points higher than our previous expectations, and includes a 250 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis and $13 million of pre-divestiture Specialty Pharmaceutical sales in 2021.\nAs a result of our strong Q2 performance and confidence in durable and consistent procedural growth, we are raising our full year 2022 organic revenue growth range to 8% to 9% versus 2021, excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures.\nWe expect third quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 10% to 12% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 400 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates, and includes a 200 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of FARAPULSE, Lumenis and Baylis. Excluding the impact of closed acquisitions, we expect third quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 8% to 10%.\nWe now expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $350 million, reflecting the FX gain recognized in Q2.\nWe continue to expect our full year 2022 operational tax rate to be 14%, with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation and discrete tax items recognized in the first half of the year. As a reminder, our tax rate reflects current legislation, including a provision on the treatment of R&D expenditures. We continue to believe there is bipartisan support to reverse this provision, and if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our full year tax rate to revert to its historic range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted, resulting in a $0.06 earnings per share benefit.\nWe expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.442 billion shares for Q3 and 1.441 billion shares for the full year 2022.\nAs a result of continued uncertainty within the macroeconomic environment as well as FX volatility, we are narrowing our full year adjusted earnings per share range to $1.74 to $1.77. And for the third quarter, expect to be in a range of $0.43 to $0.45.\nPlease check our Investor Relations website for Q2 2022 financial and operational highlights which outlines more detailed Q2 results.\nIn closing, I am proud of the first half results we achieved with projected second half momentum supporting our organic revenue guidance increase of 100 basis points at the midpoint. Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on operating margin expansion and expect to see sequential improvement in the second half of this year.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up to questions for the next 35 minutes or so. (Operator Instructions). Andrew, please go ahead."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrew. Welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q1 2022 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.\nThe duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q1 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q2 2022 and full year '22 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q2 and full year 2022 guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there is less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions excluded for organic growth are Preventice, Farapulse and Lumenis Surgical, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively, as well as Baylis Medical, which closed on February 14, 2022. Divestitures include the BTG Spec Pharma business, which closed on March 1, 2021. For more information, please refer to our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website.\nOn this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified, are organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws, which might be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share, new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses. Factors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them.\nAt this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Lauren. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're very pleased with our first quarter performance and our outlook for the full year despite the impact of the ongoing pandemic and the macroeconomic headwinds. Growth in the quarter was fueled by improved procedure volume, our innovative portfolio and strong execution across our global team. In first quarter '22, total company operational sales grew 13% versus prior year, while organic sales grew 10%, above the high end of our guidance range of 5% to 8%. Importantly, this performance was strong across all regions, and we anticipate that most all of our businesses grew at or faster than their respective markets.\nFirst quarter adjusted EPS of $0.39 grew 6.5% versus prior year, achieving the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.38 to $0.40. And despite continued macroeconomic headwinds and resulting supply chain pressure, first quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.8%, which was higher than anticipated due to the overachievement of sales and lower spend. While we continue to anticipate less of a global COVID impact on underlying procedure volumes for full year '22 versus '21, we continue to provide a wider guidance range to account for uncertainty related to COVID waves, staffing challenges and supply chain pressures. However, we are increasing our full year 2022 operational growth to 9% to 11% and organic growth to 6.5% to 8.5%. For second quarter '22 revenue, we are guiding to operational growth of 6% to 9% and organic growth of 3% to 6%.\nWe're also updating our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to $1.74 to $1.79, and our second quarter adjusted EPS estimate to $0.41 to $0.43. Despite increased macroeconomic pressures, we continue to target adjusted operating margin expansion of 10 to 50 basis points or 26% to 26.4% for the full year, and Dan will provide some additional details. I'll now provide additional highlights in the first quarter, along with comments on our '22 outlook.\nGlobally, the impact from COVID varied by region during the first quarter. And within the quarter, we experienced a more significant COVID impact in both the U.S. and Europe in January and early Feb, with significantly improved volume growth during the remainder of the first quarter. Regionally, our business in the U.S. delivered operational growth of 13% versus prior year, which includes an approximate 400 basis point tailwind from acquisitions. First quarter performance in the U.S. was particularly strong in WATCHMAN, PI, cardiology and endoscopy.\nIn Europe, Middle East, Africa, we grew 12% on an operational basis versus prior year, while all businesses in the region experienced strong growth. We saw particular strength in structural heart, including TAVR, WATCHMAN, and other interventional cardiology therapies as well as electrophysiology. In Asia Pac, we grew 14% operationally versus prior year with new product launches, fueling the region's growth, notably POLARx and RANGER in Japan and WaveWriter Alpha in Australia.\nThe China team delivered another impressive quarter with double-digit growth in the first quarter with broad strength across the region, enabled by a diverse portfolio. Given the current COVID wave in China, we do anticipate more pressure on underlying procedural volumes in the second quarter. However, we remain confident in our team's ability in China to continue to drive toward double-digit growth for the full year 2022.\nNow some additional thoughts on our business units. Urology and pelvic health grew sales 7% organic and 16% operational. The global integration of the Lumenis acquisition is going extremely well with an innovative MOSES laser platform, complementing our category-leading stone portfolio. Globalization remains a big opportunity in this business, and we're pleased with the approval of Rezum in China after a successful pilot, and we look forward to launching later this year. Additionally, we received approval in Canada for LithoVue Elite, which is our next-generation flexible single-use ureteroscope with advanced imaging and intrarenal pressure sensing capabilities.\nTurning to our endoscopy business. Sales grew nicely, 9% organic versus prior year. The underlying business remains very strong, and we continue to innovate with new product offerings, supporting continued above-market growth. We're seeing momentum across our franchises, including biliary, hemostasis and our single-use imaging franchise as the SpyGlass DS visualization system continues to have strong growth, while our newer single-use scopes are gaining scale. Beyond products, we're also enhancing our digital capabilities with the recent launch of e-commerce platform to all endoscopy customers in the U.S.-based ambulatory surgical centers to enable easy online ordering from any device at any time.\nIn neuromodulation, first quarter organic grew faster than the market at 8% versus prior year. In pain, we continue to see positive momentum in spinal cord stimulation as physicians continue to be pleased with the performance of the WaveWriter Alpha system with fast therapy and our Cognita practice optimization suite of solutions.\nIn brain, we received FDA approval in the U.S. for the Neural Navigator software with STIMVIEW earlier this month. This was developed in collaboration with Brainlab and enables more streamlined programming for clinicians with integrated visualization for lead placement and stimulation field modeling.\nIn cardiology, organic sales grew 11% versus prior year and operational sales grew 16%, with all business units growing high single digit or better in the quarter. Within cardiology, our interventional cardiology therapies business had organic sales of 8% versus prior year. Coronary franchise grew mid-single digits, fueled by new product launches and globalization. And within the quarter, we received FDA clearance of the expanded portfolio of Emerge PTCA dilation catheters, making it the only complete portfolio of balloon sizes in the U.S. for the treatment of large vessels and lung lesions.\nWe really had another strong quarter with double-digit growth in our structural heart valves franchise, led by ACURATE neo2 in Europe. We continue to take market share in our existing accounts while also continuing to gain new accounts, exceeding our sales expectations in the first quarter. Additionally, we have initiated our -- and also are currently enrolling patients in our early feasibility study called ACURATE Prime XL, which is evaluating additional sizes for the ACURATE neo2 valve.\nTurning to WATCHMAN. Organic sales grew 33% versus prior quarter -- versus prior year. WATCHMAN is on track to deliver full year double-digit growth with sustained momentum from the second-generation WATCHMAN FLX, ongoing clinical evidence, globalization and commercial execution. Within the quarter, the ongoing SURPASS analysis of the NCDR LAAO registry was presented at CRT, including more than 16,000 patients with real-world results that reinforce the differentiated safety and efficacy data seen in our pivotal PINNACLE FLX trial.\nIn cardiac rhythm management, organic sales grew 7% and operational sales grew 14% versus prior year. In Core CRM, we anticipate that our growth was in line to slightly above market with our low-voltage business growing high single digits and our high-voltage business growing low single digits, aided by stronger SICD sales. We look forward to the presentation of further clinical evidence at HRS later this week.\nWithin the diagnostics franchise, we continue to be pleased with the performance of our differentiated portfolio with both the LUX-Dx implantable cardiac monitor and preventive AECG portfolio outpacing the market in first quarter. Electrophysiology sales grew 11% and an organic 47% operationally versus prior year. International strength continues driven by our innovative portfolio and continued success of Farapulse, with late-breaking clinical data from the MANIFEST-PF survey presented at EHRA highlighting the real-world performance of the system. And more than 1,700 patients' investigators reported 99.9% success in achieving acute pulmonary vein isolation and excellent procedure times. We continue to further [the body of] clinical evidence elsewhere in the portfolio with real-world outcomes data from the POLARx ICE study, which was presented at EHRA and demonstrated a strong safety and efficacy of the POLARx Cryoablation System.\nWe also closed the Baylis acquisition in mid-February, and we're excited to bring a novel category leading technology and commercial synergies to our broader portfolio.\nIn Peripheral Interventions, organic sales grew 10% versus prior year. The arterial franchise was led by double-digit growth within the drug-eluting franchise, supported by ongoing clinical evidence and more broadly, our category leadership portfolio. And within venous, Varithena had another quarter of double-digit growth driven by a strong underlying market and penetration in new accounts.\nOur Interventional Oncology franchise continues to do very well, led by TheraSphere, which grew double digits in the quarter. And earlier this month, we received FDA IDE approval to initiate the frontier study, which will assess TheraSphere as a treatment option for patients with glioblastoma, an aggressive cancer occurring in the brain or spinal cord. We also received FDA clearance for EMBOLD, which is a fiber embolization coil that further enhances our portfolio of embolization technologies.\nBoston Scientific's dedicated transforming lives through innovative medical solutions while also minimizing the impact of the environment and making measurable contribution to the world. Corporate responsibility is core to our values and helps inform our priorities at advanced progress and aligned to our business goals. So we're excited to share our progress in the 2021 performance report, which we expect to release in May. Also in 2021, we announced 5 acquisitions, strengthening our underlying market growth with innovative technologies and accretive growth markets.\nIn 2022, we evolved our leadership structure to enhance customer focus and further enable our strategies. Joe Fitzgerald now leads the cardiology segment, including interventional cardiology therapies, WATCHMAN, CRM Diagnostics and Electrophysiology and Art Butcher now leads the MedSurg segment, including endoscopy, urology and neuromodulation, while continuing to oversee Asia Pac. This new structure supports agile business practices and drives collaboration and innovation across our similar call points while also empowering our leaders to maintain our deep customer focus.\nWe're excited about the outlook for 2022 and our long-range plans despite the macroeconomic challenges we continue to face. We remain committed to our financial goals, growing sales faster than the market, continuing operating margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth with strong adjusted free cash flow. I'm extremely grateful to our employees for their resiliency, their strong results and their winning spirit. And now I'll turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance in more detail.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. First quarter consolidated revenue of $3.026 billion represents 10% reported revenue growth versus first quarter of 2021 and reflects a $74 million headwind from foreign exchange, higher than our expectations, driven by the strengthened U.S. dollar. Excluding this 270-basis point headwind from foreign exchange, operational revenue growth was 12.6% in the quarter. Quarterly sales from the acquisitions of Farapulse, Lumenis and Preventice through February, and Baylis post the February 14 close date, contributed 340 basis points, partially offset by the divestiture of the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals business in 2021, resulting in 9.7% organic revenue growth, exceeding the high end of our guidance range of 5% to 8% growth versus 2021.\nWe saw a steady improvement in Q1 procedural volumes as COVID waned in most geographies throughout the quarter with a strong finish in March. April procedural volumes have continued to see minimal COVID impact with the exception of China, in line with our expectations. Top line results drove Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.39, representing 6.5% growth versus 2021 at the midpoint of our guidance range of $0.38 to $0.40. Included in the $0.39 was a $0.02 headwind from tax and below the line.\nAdjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 70.3%. We expect Q2 adjusted gross margin to be in line with Q1 as we continue to face macroeconomic headwinds and resulting pressures on the global supply chain. Despite our expectation that these macroeconomic headwinds will continue throughout 2022, we anticipate a slight improvement to adjusted gross margin in the second half with the full realization of standard cost improvements and less unfavorable manufacturing variances. We now expect our full year adjusted gross margin to be in line with the second half of 2021 adjusted gross margin of 70.8%, which reflects an approximate $300 million headwind versus pre-COVID levels with nearly half of this headwind related to increased freight costs and the remaining headwind resulting from unfavorable manufacturing variances, driven by the availability of direct materials and the increased cost to procure them.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating margin was 25.8%, slightly higher than our expectations, driven by top line revenue performance and disciplined spend management in the quarter. We continue to anticipate our full year adjusted operating margin to be within a range of 26% to 26.4%. Given the magnitude and level of persistence of the macroeconomic headwinds, it likely makes the high end of our adjusted operating margin guidance range, less certain, but we still believe the range is achievable. And on a GAAP basis, first quarter operating margin was 15.4%.\nMoving to below the line. Adjusted interest and other expense totaled $110 million in Q1, slightly higher than our expectations. And based on the timing of our debt refinancing within the quarter included minimal benefit from the debt transaction, which I'll provide further detail on in a moment. Our tax rate for the first quarter was 14.3% on an adjusted basis, including unfavorable discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 13.9%, higher than our expectations, driven by differences in the treatment of interest expense in the issuing jurisdiction of our euro-denominated bonds. We ended Q1 with 1.438 billion fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Our adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $70 million, and free cash flow was an outflow of $171 million with a $58 million outflow from operating activities and $113 million of net capital expenditures.\nFor full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow, we continue to aim to be at or above 2021 adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion. As of March 31, 2022, we had cash on hand of $325 million after closing the acquisition of Baylis Medical in February. Our top priority for capital allocation remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals.\nWithin the first quarter, we completed an opportunistic transaction, refinancing approximately $3.3 billion of U.S. bonds funded through an offering of EUR 3 billion denominated bonds. The transaction was debt neutral, and we remain committed to our long-term leverage goals of 2.25 to 2.5x leverage. And as of March 31, our leverage was 2.76x.\nI'll now walk through guidance for Q2 and full year 2022. We expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 9% to 11% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and includes 250 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse, Lumenis and Baylis and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021.\nAs a result of our strong Q1 performance, we are raising our full year 2022 organic revenue growth range to 6.5% to 8.5% versus 2021, excluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures. We expect second quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 9% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 300 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and includes a 300-basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Farapulse, Lumenis and Baylis. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we expect second quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 3% to 6% against a much tougher Q2 comp. We now expect our full year 2022 adjusted below-the-line expenses to be approximately $360 million, down from the $400 million guidance issued in February due to lower interest expense as a result of our debt refinancing transaction, partially offset by the cost to manage our VC portfolio and execute our hedging program.\nAs a result of the difference in tax treatment of interest expense related to our debt refinancing transaction, we now expect our full year 2022 operational tax rate to be approximately 14% with an adjusted tax rate of approximately 13%, including the benefit of the accounting standard for stock compensation. We expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.443 billion shares for Q2 and 1.445 billion shares for the full year 2022. We now expect full year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.74 to $1.79 and for the second quarter expected to be in a range of $0.41 to $0.43. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q1 2022 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q1 results.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Dan. Andrew, let's open it up to questions for the next 35 minutes or so. (Operator Instructions) Andrew, please go ahead."

(Operator Instructions) After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lauren Tengler, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nLauren Tengler\n\nDirector of IR, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThank you, Andrew. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on today's call are Mike Mahoney, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dan Brennan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We issued a press release earlier this morning announcing our Q4 2021 results, which included reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures used in the release. We have posted a copy of that release as well as reconciliations on the non-GAAP measures used in today's call to the Investor Relations section of our website under the heading Financials and Filings.\nThe duration of this morning's call will be approximately 1 hour. Mike will focus his comments on Q4 performance as well as future catalysts and the outlook for our business, including Q1 '22 and full year '22 guidance. Dan will review the financials for the quarter, provide more details regarding our Q1 and full year guidance, and then we'll take your questions. During today's Q&A session, Mike and Dan will be joined by our Chief Medical Officers, Dr. Ian Meredith and Dr. Ken Stein.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on the call, operational revenue growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and organic revenue growth further excludes acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales. Relevant acquisitions for organic growth versus 2020 and 2019 include Preventice; Farapulse; LUMINIZE, which closed in March, August and September of 2021, respectively; as well as Vertiflex and BTG Interventional Medicines, which closed in May and mid-August of 2019, respectively.\nDivestitures include BTG Spec Pharma, which closed March 1, 2021, and the global embolic microspheres portfolio and intrauterine health franchise, which were divested in August 2019 and second quarter of 2020, respectively.\nThroughout the call today, we will refer to 2021 growth rates versus 2019 and 2020, utilizing the comparison to 2019 as the last full year baseline prior to COVID. Going forward, 2022 guidance and corresponding results will be compared to 2021 only. 2022 guidance excludes Baylis Medical acquisition, which is expected to close in Q1 '22. For more information, please refer to Slide 10 of our financial and operating highlights deck, which may be found on our Investor Relations website.\nOn this call, all references to sales and revenue, unless otherwise specified or organic. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which may be identified by words like anticipate, expect, may, believe, estimate and other similar words. They include, among other things, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic upon the company's operations and financial results; statements about our growth and market share new product approvals and launches, acquisitions, clinical trials, cost savings and growth opportunities, our cash flow and expected use, our financial performance, including sales, margins and earnings; as well as our tax rates, R&D spend and other expenses.\nFactors that may cause such differences include those described in the Risk Factors section of our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs filed with the SEC. These statements speak only as of today's date, and we disclaim any intention or obligation to update them. At this point, I'll turn it over to Mike for his comments.\n\nMichael F. Mahoney\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Lauren, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm very proud of the agility and winning spirit of our employees and continue to be impressed with the resiliency of hospital systems and their ability to provide patients with the care they need during the pandemic. We're very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter performance and anticipate that all of our business units either maintained or gained share in the quarter despite the challenges COVID presented.\nOn a full year basis, the global strength of our product diversification and category leadership strategy resulted in all businesses with the exception of CRM and USEP gaining share. We look forward to the year ahead and remain bullish in both the near-term and the longer-term opportunities we laid out at our Investor Day.\nIn fourth quarter '21, total company operational sales grew 17% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 15%, achieving the high end of our guidance range of 12% to 16%. Fourth quarter '21 organic sales grew 7% versus '19. Full year 2021 operational sales grew 19% versus 2020, while organic sales grew 19%, again, achieving the high end of our guidance range of 18% to 19%. Full year '21 organic sales grew 6% versus 2019.\nQ4 adjusted EPS of $0.45 grew 94% versus 2020 and was flat to 2019, achieving the high end of the guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45. Full year adjusted EPS of $1.63 grew 69% versus 2020 and 3% versus 2019, again exceeding the high end of the full year guidance range of $1.60 to $1.62. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, resulting in a second half 2021 run rate of 25.9%. The full year '21 adjusted operating margin was 25.3.\nOverall, we're very pleased about the cash flow with full year 2021 free cash flow generation of $1.3 billion and adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion, which grew 11% versus 2020.\nSo turning to 2022. While we anticipate less of a COVID impact on underlying procedures for the full year 2022 versus 2021, we're providing a wider range to account for uncertainty related to COVID waves and staffing shortages. For first quarter '22, organic revenue were guiding growth of 5% to 8% and for a full year of 6% to 8%, excluding the Baylis acquisition, which is expected to close in first quarter of 2022.\nOur Q1 adjusted EPS estimate is $0.38 to $0.40, and we expect our full year adjusted EPS to be $1.73 to $1.79. Despite the near-term macroeconomic pressures in 2022, we continue to target operating margin expansion with a goal of double-digit adjusted EPS growth at the high end of the range. Dan will provide more details on both sales and EPS performance and outlook, including more insights on 2022. I'll now provide more highlights in Q4 and full year '21 results along with comments on '22 outlook.\nRegionally, on an operational basis, the U.S. grew 20% versus fourth quarter 2020 and full year 21% -- full year 2021 grew 25%, inclusive of a 300 basis point tailwind from acquisitions and continued strength of new product launches across the portfolio. Europe, Middle East, Africa grew 16% on an operational basis versus both fourth quarter '20 and full year '20.\nWe continue to see strong performance in Europe despite the pandemic impact with many Of the Western countries and excellent growth in the Middle East and Africa region. On a full year basis, all business units in Europe grew double digits versus the prior year with the majority of businesses gaining share. We continue to anticipate strong growth from our Europe region given the innovative product pipeline, globalization efforts and the integration of the acquisitions.\nAsia Pac grew 17% operationally versus fourth quarter '20 and 14% for the full year. Within the quarter, the vast majority of Asia Pac countries grew versus prior year with double-digit growth in IC, PI and EP supported by new and ongoing product launches. On a full year, Japan grew 7%, fueled by new products like WATCHMAN FLX, POLARx and Ranger as well as innovative launches across the coronary therapies portfolio. I'll now provide some additional comments on our business units.\nUrology and Public Health sales grew 9% on an organic basis versus fourth quarter '20 and on a full year basis grew 19% versus 2020 and 11% versus 2019. Within the quarter, SpaceOAR and Rezum both grew double digits, and we're pleased with the 22% improved reimbursement for the ASC and hospital outpatient setting for Rezum.\nOn a full year basis, we saw strength across the business with double-digit growth in LithoVue, Core Stone, Rezum, SpaceOAR and (inaudible) Restoration. As we look forward towards 2022, we remain excited about our strong leadership position further extended by the acquisition of LUMINIZE in the market-leading Moses laser technology.\nTurning to endoscopy, sales grew 10% organically versus fourth quarter '20 with full year growth of 19% versus '20 and 12% versus 2019. Over the duration of the year, broad-based strength across all regions and franchises resulted in Endoscopy business achieving $2 billion in 2021.\nWithin the quarter, we launched the AXIOS stent in China and on a full year basis grew this product line over 20% globally. We remain excited about the outlook of our innovative offerings within our single-use imaging portfolio, including SpyGlass DS, EXALT Model D, EXALT Model B and SPY Discover. Looking at 2022, we continue to anticipate above-market growth as the endoscopy global commercial teams continue to execute at a high level by creating long-term partnerships with hospitals, given the unique breadth and differentiation of our portfolio.\nTurning to CRM. Organic sales grew 4% versus fourth quarter 2020 and full year sales grew 8% versus '20 and declined 6% versus '19. In Q4, our high-voltage business grew low single digits, which we expect was in line with the market with improved sequential growth in our S-ICD franchise, enabled by our enhanced electrode launch in June.\nThe pacer business grew mid-single digits, which was likely in line with the market. In December, we enrolled our first patients in the modular ATP trial, our dual-track clinical study for a stand-alone legal pacemaker as well as to provide antitachycardia pacing to Emblem S-ICD patients.\nWithin the Diagnostics franchise, our implantable cardiac monitor, LUX-Dx, continues to perform well and grow share. The preventive business grew 20% on a full year pro forma basis, enabled by our differentiated portfolio and strong execution. Electrophysiology sales grew 16% versus fourth quarter '20 on an organic basis, with full year growth of 23% versus '20 and 7% versus '19. Importantly, the international EP sales grew 38% versus prior on a full year operational basis, fueled by our innovative portfolio, including POLARx, StablePoint and Farapulse. The early Farapulse launch is going well in Europe with physicians enthusiastic by the safety and ease of use of this technology. We're very excited about the outlook of the EP business and look forward to further complementing it with the closing of Baylis in first quarter '22.\nIn Neuromodulation, fourth quarter organic revenue grew 6% versus prior year and full year sales grew 19% versus 2020 and were flat to 2019. Despite the COVID wave impacting procedure volumes, we continue to gain share with strong demand for our WaveWriter Alpha systems, and ongoing clinical evidence resulting in a full year SCS growth rate of over 20% versus 2020.\nJust a few weeks ago, we presented various data sets of NANDs, including the 2-year combo RCT data supporting the longevity of our SCS therapy. We continue to roll in the SOLUS trial studying our WaveWriter SCS systems for the treatment of patients with chronic low back and/or leg pain who have not undergone spinal surgery and anticipate initial clinical work on DPN in the coming months.\nIn our Brain franchise, while COVID impacted procedure volumes, we continue to enhance our portfolio and capabilities with strong full year growth in '21 versus 2020. We look forward to expanding our U.S. Vercise Genus offering in '22 in partnership with Brainlab.\nIn Interventional Cardiology, organic sales grew 40% versus fourth quarter 2020 and 31% versus full year '20, which includes a tailwind of approximately 1,000 basis points related to sales return reserves for the transition to consignment for WATCHMAN in 2020.\nFull year Interventional Cardiology sales grew 7% versus 2019. In Coronary Therapies, our complex PCI franchise had strong growth in '21 with strength across every region, further enabled by the recent launch of our VGO 2 guidance system in the U.S. Within drug-eluting sense, we continue to differentiate our portfolio through the global launches of Synergy 48-millimeter and MEGATRON. We continue to anticipate being first to U.S. market in 2024 with our agent drug-coated balloon and expect to complete enrollment in the U.S. IDE trial in the first half of 2022.\nWe're extremely pleased with the performance of WATCHMAN franchise in the fourth quarter as sales surpassed our expectations. Importantly, the 2021 global performance of WATCHMAN was consistent each quarter with strong double-digit growth, resulting in full year sales of $830 million, growing 68% versus 2019.\nWe continue to be pleased with our ability to deliver the safest and most efficient therapy, increased physician utilization and global expansion while driving greater awareness to this fast-growing LAAC market. Clinical evidence generation remains an important focus, and we expect the first readout from the ongoing SURPASS analysis of the NCDR LAO registry at CRT later this month. This analysis will include over 16,000 patients and is the largest data set in WATCHMAN FLX patients presented to date.\nWe continue to expect WATCHMAN to be a significant growth driver for Boston Scientific in '22 and beyond. Across the Structural Heart franchises, we had the highest quarterly sales results to date for ACURATE neo2, Sentinel and the Safari Guidewire. ACURATE neo2 continues to perform well with positive physician feedback on the clinical performance and ease of use of the valve, and we're excited for the year with over 10% share across full European market and are approaching 20% share in open accounts.\nWhile we've been pleased with the early clinical progress of the military technology, we have decided to discontinue work in the military program due to the time and financial investment required to commercialize this platform as compared to other near- and long-term portfolio opportunities across the company. We've made this decision now so that we can focus on the execution of existing and future technologies within the structural art space and elsewhere within our portfolio.\nIn Peripheral Interventions, organic sales grew 9% versus fourth quarter 2020 with full year sales growth of 14% versus '20 and 9% versus 2019. Within the drug-eluting portfolio, we've been pleased with the globalization and ongoing clinical evidence supporting Eluvia and Ranger, resulting in exceeding our sales goal of $150 million for 2021. In VENOUS, our market-leading varicose vein offering, Varithena, grew over 40% in 2021, and we see continued runway with this underserved market.\nIn Q4, we closed the Devoro acquisition and look forward to launching our arterial and venous offerings in the second half of 2022, complementing the broader portfolio and further extending our category leadership. In Interventional Cardiology, TheraSphere grew over 20% on a full year basis, supported by ongoing clinical evidence, including the EPAC trial, which is the first positive Phase III SIRT trial studying TheraSphere as a second-line therapy in patients with liver-dominant MCRC that have failed first-line chemotherapy.\nOur focus on improving patient health comes with the responsibility to have a positive impact in the world we share. Our environmental, social and governance practices guide us as we make long-term measurable progress, and I'm proud to announce that Boston Scientific received the 2022 Catalyst Award, their premier recognition for organizations initiatives that advance women in the workplace.\nBoston Scientific also ranked them in the top 50 of American Most Just Companies for our contributions to creating jobs, providing benefits and work life balance, cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace and producing sustainable products and building stronger communities. I'm grateful for the passion and commitment of our global team as we continue to deliver our values and do our part to create a better future, both as a global business and as a global corporate citizen.\nWhile we have faced challenges over the last few years of COVID, we are stronger for it. We're building new capabilities that will enable us to better serve our patients and customers both today and the future. We are well positioned in 2022 with category-leading innovative product positions, continue to focus on investment in clinical evidence while continuing to enter high-growth adjacent markets. We acquired several companies in the past year, with innovative products that are accretive markets, and we continue to evolve our leadership and commercial structures to best enable these exciting new technologies. We remain committed to our long-term financial goals of 6% to 8% organic revenue growth, operating margin expansion, double-digit adjusted EPS growth with strong cash flow generation. I'm very grateful to our employees for their winning spirit, I will now turn things over to Dan to review our financial performance and forward-looking expectations.\n\nDaniel J. Brennan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Boston Scientific Corporation\n\nThanks, Mike. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue of $3.127 billion represents 15.4% reported revenue growth versus fourth quarter 2020 and reflects a $38 million headwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 16.9% in the quarter. Sales from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and LUMINIZE contributed 330 basis points, partially offset by the divestiture of the BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals business, resulting in 15.1% organic revenue growth towards the high end of our guidance range of 12% to 16% growth versus 2020. This 15.1% growth includes a 440 basis point tailwind from the WATCHMAN sales return reserve recognized in Q4 2020, which was contemplated in our guidance.\nCompared to fourth quarter 2019, organic revenue growth was 6.7%, nicely above the midpoint of our guidance range of 4% to 8%. This 6.7% growth excludes $67 million in 2019 sales of the divested intrauterine health and BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals businesses as well as $89 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, including Preventice, Farapulse and LUMINIZE.\nQ4 adjusted earnings per share of $0.45 represents 94% growth versus 2020 and flat versus 2019 and achieved the high end of our guidance range of $0.43 to $0.45, driven by revenue performance at the higher end of our guidance range and a slightly favorable adjusted tax rate.\nFull year 2021 consolidated revenue of $11.888 billion represents 19.9% reported revenue growth versus the full year 2020 and reflects a $126 million tailwind from foreign exchange. On an operational basis, revenue growth was 18.7% in the quarter versus 2020.\nSales from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and LUMINIZE contributed 210 basis points, more than offset by sales of the divested intrauterine health and BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals businesses, resulting in 18.9% organic revenue growth within our guidance range of 18% to 19%.\nCompared to full year 2019, organic growth was 5.7%, again, above the midpoint of our guidance range of 5% to 6%. This 5.7% growth excludes $131 million in 2019 sales of divested businesses as well as $531 million in 2021 sales of acquired businesses, including Vertiflex, BTG Interventional Medicines, Preventice, Farapulse and LUMINIZE, and $13 million of specialty pharmaceutical sales prior to divestiture.\nFull year 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 represents 69% growth versus 2020, 3% growth versus 2019 and exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $1.60 to $1.62. Adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.9%, in line with our expectations of a slight sequential improvement from the 70.6% recorded in Q3. We continue to face macro environment headwinds on gross margin, which included the cost of running plants with COVID-specific measures, increased freight costs and price pressures and higher direct labor wages.\nAs the Omicron variant surged, we saw increased headwinds and particularly in December with higher levels of COVID-related absenteeism in our plants as well as price pressure on direct material costs, driving unfavorable manufacturing variances.\nAs a reminder, manufacturing variances are capitalized on the balance sheet and realized over an approximate 6-month period. As a result, we expect full year 2022 gross margin to improve slightly versus the second half of 2021.\nGross margins in the first half of 2022 are expected to be below the second half of 2021, driven by the lagging impact of unfavorable manufacturing branches capitalized on the balance sheet and typical standard cost revaluation. In line with our historical trends, we anticipate that the second half of 2022 gross margins will be improved versus the first half, driven by lower COVID-related headwinds and recognition of full 2022 standard cost improvements.\nOur longer-term goal remains to return to pre-COVID gross margin levels of 72% plus as global supply chain disruptions and inflation lessen over time. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, resulting in a second half average of 25.9%. Full year adjusted operating margin was 25.3%. In light of increased gross margin pressures, we felt it was prudent to provide a range for 2022 adjusted operating margin and expect the full year to be within a range of 26% to 26.4%, representing a 70 to 110 basis point improvement over the full year of 2021, and with the high end representing our long-range plan goal of 50 basis points annual improvement versus second half average 2021.\nOn a GAAP basis, fourth quarter operating margins were 5.8% and includes a $197 million intangible asset impairment related to the discontinuation of the Millipede program, as Mike outlined, and a $128 million in litigation-related expenses, which I'll provide further details on in a moment.\nMoving below the line, adjusted interest and other expense totaled $115 million in Q4 and $423 million for the full year 2021, in line with expectations. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 5.3% on an adjusted basis. Our full year adjusted tax rate of 7.6% includes discrete tax items and the benefit from stock compensation accounting. Excluding these items, our operational tax rate was 8.8% favorable to our expectations, driven by our geographic mix of earnings.\nFully diluted weighted average shares outstanding ended at 1,436 million shares in Q4 and 1,434 million shares for full year 2021. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $425 million, and free cash flow was $217 million with $478 million from operating activities, less $261 million of net capital expenditures.\nFor full year 2021, we delivered adjusted free cash flow of $2.2 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion with $1.9 billion from operating activities, less $540 million of net capital expenditures. We exceeded our expectations for full year adjusted free cash flow with growth of 11% versus 2020 driven by lower working capital as we balance increasing our inventory position with sales recovery and finished the year with a favorable DSO.\nFor 2022, adjusted free cash flow, we aim to be at or above 2021 while we continue to invest in inventory with less COVID-related impact on our manufacturing, labor and direct material availability. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash on hand of $1.9 billion. We continue to expect to close the acquisition of Baylis Medical in Q1 funded with cash on hand. Our top priority for capital remains high-quality tuck-in M&A, and we'll continue to assess opportunities in conjunction with our financial goals.\nWith respect to our legal reserves, we booked $128 million in Q4, which includes $60 million related to ongoing litigation in the neuromodulation space and $68 million related to mesh product liability claims in Australia. There's been no material change to the outlook for the U.S. mesh claims over the last 3 years. Materially all U.S. claims remain settled, and we continue to seek prompt resolution of active cases and claims.\nOur total legal reserve was $548 million as of December 31, 2021. I'll now walk through guidance for Q1 and the full year 2022. As a reminder, guidance does not include the acquisition of Baylis Medical since it has not yet closed.\nWe expect full year 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 9% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 100 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and includes 110 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and LUMINIZE, and $13 million of pre-divestiture specialty pharmaceutical sale in 2021.\nExcluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect full year 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 6% to 8% versus 2021. We expect first quarter 2022 operational revenue growth to be in a range of 7% to 10% versus 2021, which excludes an approximate 200 basis point headwind from foreign exchange based on current rates and includes 210 basis point contribution from the acquisitions of Preventice, Farapulse and LUMINIZE, and $13 million of predivestiture specialty pharmaceutical sales in 2021.\nExcluding the impact of closed acquisitions and divestitures, we expect first quarter 2022 organic revenue growth to be in a range of 5% to 8% versus 2021. We forecast our full year 2022 operational tax rate to be approximately 13% with an adjusted tax rate of 12%, including the benefit from the accounting standard for stock compensation.\nOf note, our forecasted tax rate includes a headwind from delayed provisions in the 2017 TCJA that take effect in 2022 related to the treatment of R&D expenditures. We believe there is bipartisan support to reverse these provisions and if such legislation were to be enacted, we would expect our tax rate to revert to its historic range of approximately 11% operational and 10% adjusted.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share for the full year to be in a range of $1.73 to $1.79 and for the first quarter to be in a range of $0.38 to $0.40. A few other items to keep in mind as you look to model 2022.\nWe expect below-the-line expenses, which include interest payments, dilution from our VC portfolio and costs associated with our hedging program to be approximately $400 million for the year. Preferred stock dividends will be approximately $55 million for the year, and we expect a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 1.443 billion shares for Q1 2022 and 1.447 billion shares for the full year 2022. Please check our Investor Relations website for Q4 2021 financial and operational highlights, which outlines more detailed Q4 results.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Lauren, who will moderate the Q&A."

My name is Denise, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Head of Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Denise. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and Interim CFO, Chris Emerson, will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, President; and Don McCree, Chair of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our third quarter presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.\nOur comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review in the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results in the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.\nAnd with that, I will hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nThanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We announced very strong financial results today as our momentum continues. We feel like we are firing on all cylinders.\nFinancial highlights include EPS growth of $0.13 sequential quarter or 14%, with strong NII growth of 3.5% sequentially and paced by NIM expansion of 5 basis points and net loan growth across consumer, private bank and commercial similar to last quarter. Fee growth was 5% versus Q2, paced by a tremendous quarter in Capital Markets, our second highest ever as well as continued nice growth in wealth fees. Sequential positive operating leverage was 3% as expense growth was held to just 1%. We continue to experience favorable credit trends and we still have a robust balance sheet. Our CET1 increased 10 basis points to 10.7%. We have an LDR of 78.3% and virtually no wholesale borrowing.\nWe continued the strong execution of our strategic initiatives during the quarter. The Private Bank had a banner quarter on deposits with spot growth of $3.8 billion to $12.5 billion, which is already ahead of our year-end $12 billion target. Loans and AUM continue to track well. We have now added 8 wealth lift-outs to the private wealth platform with more in the pipeline. We continue to build out our private bank team with additional hires in Southern California, and we now have around 500 people in the business, quite the ramp from a start-up in 2023. In addition, our efforts across New York City Metro, private capital and payments are all tracking well.\nOur efforts around reimagine the bank continue to make good progress. We've systematically evaluated all areas of the bank to seek opportunities to improve how we are serving customers and how we are running the bank. We will give the full parameters of this effort on the January earnings call. Overall, we expect benefits to largely offset costs, including one-timers in 2026, with net benefits beginning to positively impact results in 2027 and becoming quite meaningful thereafter.\nOne of my priorities this year has been to commence the transition of the leadership team I assembled a decade ago to the new refresh team that can take us forward for the next decade. Most recently, we announced that Don McCree will be retiring in March 2026, having handed the range to Ted Swimmer earlier in October. Don has been a great partner and has made a big contribution towards our success. It's been a real pleasure working with him. We've been planning Don's succession for some time, and I have every confidence that Ted is the right leader to take us on the next leg of the journey. When Aunoy Banerjee arrives in 10 days as our new CFO, the team will have been largely refreshed with several younger, dynamic outstanding new leaders.\nTurning back to the financials. With respect to Q4, we expect to continue to see attractive earnings growth faced by positive operating leverage, favorable credit trends and share repurchase. We remain highly focused on executing our strategic agenda, which should deliver superior organic EPS growth relative to our peers over time as well as further improvements in returns. We are positioned well to sustain our momentum into 2026. The macro environment remains positive despite continuing uncertainty with respect to fiscal and monetary policies. We will stay focused on execution and the things that we can control as we continue on our journey towards building a top-performing bank.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Chris Emerson, our Interim CFO. Chris?\n\nChris Emerson\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, we delivered a strong revenue performance with disciplined expense management in the quarter, driving both sequential and year-over-year positive operating leverage of about 3% and 5%, respectively. We saw good growth in deposits with the Private Bank hitting $12.5 billion in deposits for the third quarter, up $3.8 billion. Lending continued to pick up during the quarter, with growth led by increasing sponsor activity in commercial and the private bank.\nGiven our strong outlook, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.46, which is a $0.04 or a 9.5% increase. Referencing Slides 5 and 6, we delivered EPS of $1.05 for the third quarter, an increase of $0.13 or 14% over the second quarter. PPNR was up 9% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Capital Markets delivered a record third quarter and our best performance since the all-time high fourth quarter of 2021. Performance was strong across all categories, demonstrating the power of our capabilities as market activity picks up. Net interest margin continues to steadily expand, up 5 basis points to 3% and average loan volume was up 1%, which combined, delivered 3.5% NII growth. Expenses were well managed, and we had 3% positive operating leverage.\nCredit trends continue to be favorable and net charge-offs were lower as expected. We continue to maintain robust capital, strong liquidity levels and a healthy credit reserve. We ended the quarter with our CET1 ratio at 10.7% while executing $75 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. And importantly, we are executing well against our key strategic initiatives with very strong momentum in our private bank and private wealth build-out. The Private Bank continues to steadily grow its earnings contribution adding $0.08 to EPS this quarter, up from $0.06 in the prior quarter. With this, the Private Bank hit an important milestone this quarter, achieving cumulative breakeven with the EPS contribution since the launch in 2023, completely covering our investments and then some in about 2 years.\nNext, I'll talk through the third quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. Net interest income increased 3.5% linked quarter driven by continued expansion of our net interest margin and a 1% increase in average interest-earning assets. The margin expansion of 5 basis points was driven by the time-based benefits of noncore runoff and reduced impact from terminated swaps as well as fixed rate asset repricing. We continue to do a good job optimizing deposits in a competitive environment. Interest-bearing deposit costs were stable, while total deposit costs were down slightly. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta was 53% through the third quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8. These are up 5% linked quarter and up 18% year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, Capital Markets delivered a record third quarter and our second best ever quarterly performance. An increase in market activity drove strong M&A results even before including the deals that were delayed from the prior quarter. We saw a meaningful pickup in debt underwriting, primarily driven by refinance activity, and we delivered a solid performance across loan syndication fees and equity underwriting. We continue to perform well on the league tables ranking fourth for the last 12 months on deal volume for middle market sponsored loan syndications. And our deal pipelines across M&A, debt and equity capital markets remain strong.\nOur wealth business delivered a record quarter with higher advisory fees from continued positive momentum in fee-based AUM growth, given strong inflows from the conversion of private wealth lift outs as well as market appreciation. As expected, mortgage and other income came down from elevated levels in the prior quarter.\nOn Slide 9, expenses are up 1%, reflecting continued investment in the build-out of Private Bank and Private Wealth and strong capital markets performance. Disciplined expense management and strong revenues resulted in approximately 170 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio to 63%. Our top 10 program is progressing well and is on target to deliver a $100 million pretax run rate benefit by the end of this year. I'll provide an update on our reimagine the Bank initiative in just a few minutes.\nOn Slide 10, period-end loans were up 1%. This includes noncore portfolio runoff of roughly $600 million in the quarter. And excluding noncore, loans were up approximately 2% on a spot basis. The Private Bank delivered a solid loan growth again this quarter with period-end loans up about $1 billion to $5.9 billion, reflecting a pickup in commercial line utilization and growth in retail mortgage. Commercial loans were up slightly on a spot basis given increased line utilization tied to sponsor activity. We continue to reduce CRE balances, which were down about 3% this quarter and 6% year-to-date. And core retail loans grew by about $1 billion, driven by home equity and mortgage.\nNext, on Slides 11 and 12, we continue to do a good job on deposits with noninterest-bearing balances increasing by about $1.5 billion or 4%, maintaining a steady mix at 22% of the book as our overall spot deposits increased approximately $5 billion to $180 billion. Average deposits were up 1% driven by increases in the Private Bank and Commercial with spot up 3%, including some larger transactional flows towards the end of the quarter.\nWe continue to focus on optimizing our deposit funding costs with a further reduction of higher-cost treasury broker deposits this quarter and a decline in retail CD rates. Our interest-bearing deposit costs are stable linked quarter, translating to a 53% cumulative down beta. And importantly, stable retail deposits are 66% of our total deposits, which compares to a peer average of about 56%. Moving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs of 46 basis points are down from 48 basis points in the prior quarter, driven primarily by a decrease in C&I. Credit trends continue to trend favorably with nonaccrual loans down slightly linked quarter, driven by C&I and CRE with criticized balances also declining.\nTurning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. The allowance was down slightly to 1.56% this quarter as the portfolio mix continues to improve due to noncore runoff, the reduction in the CRE portfolio, and lower loss content front book originations across C&I and retail real estate secured. The economic forecast supporting the allowance is relatively stable to the prior quarter. The general office balance of $2.5 billion continued to decline modestly in the third quarter driven by paydowns and charge-offs. This is down by $1.6 billion since March of 2023, roughly 40%. The reserve for the general office portfolio is $314 million, which represents a robust 12.4% coverage.\nMoving to Slide 15. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.7%. And adjusting for the AOCI opt-out removal, our CET1 ratio is 9.4%. We returned a total of $259 million to shareholders in the third quarter with $184 million in common dividends and $75 million of share repurchases. Moving to Slide 16 and 17. We are well positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term with our overall 3-part strategy. A transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank among our regional peers and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and private wealth franchise.\nThe Private Bank continued to make excellent progress, as you can see on Slides 18 and 19. The Private Bank delivered its strongest quarter of deposit growth so far with end-of-period deposits up $3.8 billion to $12.5 billion and average deposits up $2.2 billion to $10.7 billion. The overall deposit mix continues to be very attractive with about 34% in noninterest-bearing at the end of the quarter. We also delivered strong loan growth this quarter adding roughly $1 billion of loans to end the quarter at $5.9 billion. This reflects growth in subscription finance as line utilization rose with increased client transaction activity as well as good growth in mortgage. So far, we've added 8 wealth teams to our platform with more in the pipeline. We ended the quarter with $7.6 billion in AUM, up $1.1 billion linked quarter, reflecting the continued strong conversion rates of the wealth lift-outs.\nAnd with year-to-date earnings of $0.18, we are tracking to approximately 7% earnings contribution, which is above our target of 5% plus accretion to Citizens bottom line in 2025. We continue to remain focused on sustaining strong growth in the Private Bank, while maintaining a high level of profitability with ROE in the 20% to 25% range in 2025 and over the medium term.\nMoving to Slide 20. Our Reimagine the Bank initiative continues to take shape. We feel very good about how we are currently positioned. However, the pace of change is accelerating and competition is fierce. So we are taking the opportunity to think boldly about what will be needed to take the bank to the next level. We have a team of executives from across the bank, working on cultivating technology and AI-enabled ideas that will empower our colleagues to run the bank better and we are looking at all our key customer touch points to simplify and improve the customer experience.\nAside from technology, we're looking at areas like reducing the number of vendors we use and rationalizing how they serve us across the bank. We are also looking at how we use our corporate facilities and how best to optimize our branch network to build our market share in key markets. We will have more details on the contours of the program for you on our year-end earnings call, but suffice to say, we will be running the program with our usual financial discipline with an eye towards minimizing the impact of onetime costs and capital investments in '26 by executing initiatives with faster paybacks. The program will drive positive net benefits in 2027 that we expect will accelerate into 2028. With this program, we aspire to deliver fully phased-in run rate benefits greater than top 6, which was in excess of $400 million.\nOn Slide 21, we provide our guide for the fourth quarter, which contemplates 225 basis point rate cuts, one in October and another in December. We expect net interest income to be up approximately 2.5% to 3%, driven by an improvement in net interest margin of approximately 5 basis points and interest-earning assets up slightly, maintaining a fairly consistent spot LDR to the third quarter. We expect noninterest income to be stable with capital markets holding steady to the third quarter and some puts and takes across other categories. We are projecting expenses to be stable to up slightly, and we expect to deliver sequential positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and for the full year. Credit is expected to continue to trend favorably with charge-offs in the low 40s basis points.\nAnd we should end the fourth quarter with the CET1 ratio stable at 10.7%, including share repurchases of roughly $125 million, which, depending on the amount of loan growth could be revised. The fourth quarter tax rate should be approximately 22.5%.\nMoving to Slide 22. Looking out to the medium term, we see a clear path to achieving our 16% to 18% ROTCE target. Expanding our net interest margin is an important driver, along with the impact of the successful execution of our strategic initiatives and improving credit performance.\nTo wrap up, our strong third quarter results demonstrate the quality and potential of our fee businesses as well as the consistent improvement in our net interest margin. Coupled with our continued expense discipline, we achieved positive operating leverage for the second quarter in a row. Credit trends continue to improve. And with our strong reserves and capital level, we are in an excellent position to continue navigating a dynamic environment while supporting our clients and continuing to progress our strategic initiatives.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nOkay. Thank you, Chris. Denise, let's open it up for some Q&A.",

My name is Denise, and I will be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question and answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Head of Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Denise. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun, and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our Q2 presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review in the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results in the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I'll hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced strong financial results today that exceeded expectations notwithstanding tremendous uncertainty in the macro-environment during the quarter. Highlights include strong NII growth of 3.3%, sequential quarter paced by NIM expansion of 5 basis points, and the resumption of net loan growth across consumer, private bank, and commercial. Good fee growth of 10%, which was paced by wealth, card, and mortgage. Good expense discipline with expenses broadly flat, resulting in 500 basis points of operating leverage, and credit trends remaining favorable, and continued meaningful share repurchases. It's worth noting that capital markets still managed to have a pretty good quarter notwithstanding the uncertainty in the environment. Our diversity helped as strength in equity underwriting and loan syndications offset weaker debt capital markets and a delay in the completion of several significant M&A deals.\nWe expect that we will record over $30 million in fees on these deals in July, and our pipelines remain strong, setting us up well for the second half. Our balance sheet remains rock solid across capital, liquidity, funding, and our credit reserve position. We continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives. The private bank had strong growth in loans and AUM, with average deposits up nicely, but spot deposits impacted somewhat by the timing of inflows and outflows. We remain on track to hit all full year targets. The business is on track to deliver in excess of 5% accretion to Citizens' bottom line and a 20%+ ROE in 2025. In addition, efforts across New York City, Metro, Private Capital, Payments, and BSO are all tracking well.\nWe've commenced work on a project we are calling Reimagining the Bank, which will be led by Brendan and other top leaders. The objective is to redesign how we serve customers and run the bank, taking advantage of new technologies like Gen AI and Agentic AI. This requires changes to our organizational model, our underlying technology and data architecture, and imparting new skills to our colleague base. It will be multi-year in nature and ultimately serve as our next top program. Stay tuned for more details later in the year. With respect to the second half, we believe that economic conditions and markets are trending favorable, though further machinations around tariffs continue to present a degree of uncertainty. Rather fortunately, the fundamentals to drive higher deal activity and a pickup in loan demand remain intact, and we feel well positioned to capture the opportunity and to deliver good results.\nWe remain comfortable with the full year guide for 2025. We gave back in January, and we're well positioned to sustain that momentum into the medium term. In short, we feel good about our positioning overall from a strategic, business, and financial standpoint. We will stay focused on execution and the things we can control as we continue our efforts towards building a distinctive, great bank. With that, let me turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks Bruce and good morning everyone. As Bruce mentioned, we delivered strong Q2 results with really good revenue performance and disciplined expense management, resulting in positive sequential operating leverage of about 5%. We saw lending begin to pick up during the quarter, with net growth across commercial, consumer, and private bank more than offsetting our non-core rundown. Referencing slides 5 and 6, we delivered EPS of $0.92 for the Q2, a $0.15 or 19% improvement over Q1. Net interest income for the quarter was up 3.3%, driven by margin expansion and interest earning. Asset growth fees were up significantly linked quarter. Wealth and card fees were a record for the quarter, and capital markets showed modest growth despite market uncertainty, which resulted in several meaningful M&A deals pushing into July. Mortgage also increased largely due to an improvement in MSR valuations.\nExpenses were well managed, and net charge offs came in as expected. With respect to our balance sheet, we continue to maintain robust capital, strong liquidity levels, and a healthy credit reserve. We ended the quarter with CET1 at 10.6% while also executing $200 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. Importantly, we are executing well against our key strategic initiatives, paced by continued momentum in our private bank and private wealth buildout. The private bank continues to steadily grow its profitability, contributing $0.06 to EPS this quarter, up from $0.04 in the prior quarter, and we delivered our strongest quarter of loan growth so far, adding $1.2 billion in loans.\nAlso, we continue to make good progress in New York City, and our top 10 program is on target and progressing well with work commencing on a multi-year transformational top program to reimagine how the bank operates. Next, I'll talk through the Q2 results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide 7. Net interest income increased 3.3% linked quarter, driven by continued expansion of our net interest margin and modestly higher interest-earning assets. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin improved 5 basis points to 2.95%, given the time-based benefits of non-core runoff and reduced drag from terminated swaps, as well as favorable fixed asset repricing.\nIn addition, we continue to optimize our funding and execute well on our down rate deposit playbook as our interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 2 basis points. Moving to slide 8, fees are up 10% linked quarter. Capital markets improved modestly, driven by higher equity underwriting and loan syndication fees. Bond underwriting fees were lower due to a tariff-driven pause in activity for part of the quarter. Similarly, M&A advisory fees were lower, with some sizable deals pushing into July. Given the market uncertainty during the quarter, we expect that we will record over $30 million in fees on these deals in July. We continued to perform well in middle market sponsored bookrunner deals, ranking third by deal volume in the second quarter, and our deal pipelines across M&A and DCM remained strong in terms of the number and value of transactions.\nGiven pent up demand, our wealth business delivered a record quarter with increased transaction activity, and higher advisory fees from continued positive momentum, fee based AUM growth in the private bank. Our card business also delivered a record quarter, driven by a seasonal improvement in purchase volumes. Importantly, in consumer, we recently launched a new suite of MasterCard credit cards designed to address the distinct financial needs and preferences of our customers, which should help us accelerate growth in this business. Mortgage revenue growth reflects an improvement in MSR valuation, as well as seasonal growth in production. Lastly, other income was a bit higher than usual this quarter, as we had a few things break our way. This line can move around a little from quarter-to-quarter on slide 9.\nExpenses are broadly stable linked quarter, helping to drive positive operating leverage of about 5% and improve our efficiency ratio to below 65%. Our latest top program is progressing well and is on target to deliver a $100 million pre-tax run rate benefit by the end of the year. We've undertaken an effort to develop a much broader program to use new technologies to better serve customers and run the bank. We'll give you more on that later in the year. On slide 10, period end loans were up 1%. This includes non-core portfolio runoff of roughly $700 million in the quarter. Excluding non-core, loans were up approximately 2% on a spot basis. The private bank delivered its strongest loan growth quarter so far, with period end loans up about $1.2 billion to 4.9 billion. Commercial loans were up slightly.\nGiven some new money lending growth and a pickup in line utilization. We are past the peak in terms of client BSO exits, which is also creating less drag to growth, and core retail loans grew driven by home equity and mortgage. Next, on slides 11 and 12, we continued to do a good job on deposits, improving the mix with an increase in non-interest bearing to 22% of the book and lowering our overall deposit costs. Average deposits were up 1%, driven by increases in lower cost categories across consumer and the private bank. We continue to focus on optimizing our deposit funding with a further reduction of higher cost treasury broker deposits this quarter and a decline in retail CDs. We delivered strong retail CD retention rates even as we reduced yields.\nThis was a meaningful driver of our improving deposit costs this quarter as our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a competitive environment. Our interest bearing deposit costs are down 2 basis points this quarter, translating to a 54% cumulative down beta. Importantly, stable retail deposits are 67% of our total deposits, which compares to a peer average of about 55%. Moving to credit on Slide 13, net charge offs of 48 basis points are down from 51 basis points in the prior quarter after adjusting for the 7 basis point impact of the non core education loan sale. In Q1, retail net charge offs improved across both core and non core, down about 10 basis points after adjusting for the non core education loan sale.\nThis was partly offset by a modest increase in commercial net charge offs, primarily driven by an increase in CNI relating to several small idiosyncratic credits. Of note, nonaccrual loans continued to trend favorably and were down 4% linked quarter, reflecting a decline in CNI retail. Nonaccrual loans also decreased with a reduction in other retail and continued runoff of the noncore auto portfolio. As we look across the portfolio, we believe that credit trends are showing signs of improvement and that nonaccrual loans for this cycle likely peaked in the Q3 of 2024, and net charge offs peaked in the Q1 of 2025. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 14, the allowance was down slightly to 1.59% this quarter as the portfolio mix continues to improve due to noncore runoff, reduction in the CRE portfolio, and lower loss content.\nFront book originations across CNI and retail real estate secured. The economic forecast supporting the allowance reflects a mild recession, and macro-impacts from tariffs similar to last quarter. The General Office balance of $2.7 billion continued to decline modestly in the Q2, driven by paydowns and charge offs. The reserve for the General Office portfolio is $322 million, which represents 11.8% coverage. It's worth noting that this is the Q1 since the General Office concerns began that our ACL coverage level declined. We allowed the reserve coverage to come down slightly, utilizing the reserve as we make progress with the workout backlog, and the rest of the book remains stable. Note that the cumulative charge offs plus the current reserve translates to a total expected loss rate of about 20% against the March 2023 General Office loan balance, consistent with our view at the end of Q1. Moving to slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is 10.6%, adjusting for the AOCI opt out removal.\nOur CET1 ratio was stable at 9.1% given our strong capital position. We repurchased $200 million in common shares at a weighted average price of $39, and including dividends, we returned a total of $385 million to shareholders in the Q2. Our share repurchase program was also increased to $1.5 billion by the board of directors in June. Moving to slide 16, we are well positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term with our overall three-part strategy: a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank among our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and private wealth franchise.\nIn support of these businesses, we've commenced work on a broad Reimagining the Bank initiative that will drive meaningful benefits by revisiting how we operate front to back, leveraging new technologies like AI to serve customers in new ways and run the bank better. This will become a multi-year transformational top program, and we will have more to say about this as the planning progresses later in the year. Moving to slide 17, our private bank continued to make excellent progress. We delivered our strongest loan growth quarter so far, adding $1.2 billion of loans to end the Q2 at $4.9 billion. This reflects growth in commercial as line utilization has picked up given increasing client activity, as well as growth in mortgage. Average deposits were up $966 million for the quarter and stable on a spot basis.\nGiven a temporary surge in deposits at the end of the Q1 and some outflows at the end of Q2, we've seen good deposit gathering momentum early in the Q3 with deposit levels over $9.5 billion in mid July. The overall mix continues to be very attractive, with about 36% in non interest bearing at the end of the quarter. We added three more strong wealth teams this quarter, one each in Northern New Jersey, New York City, and Los Angeles. We ended the quarter with $6.5 billion in AUM, up $1.3 billion for the quarter, with a $0.06 contribution to EPS from the private bank in the second quarter. We are tracking well against our targeted 5%+ accretion to Citizens' bottom line in 2025, and to deliver a 20% to 24 return on equity for the year and over the medium term.\nMoving to Slide 18, we provide our guide for the Q3, which contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in September. We expect net interest income to be up approximately 3% to 4, driven by an improvement in net interest margin of approximately 5 basis points, with interest earning assets up slightly. This pickup in net interest margin is primarily attributable to the time-based benefits of non-core runoff, reduced drag from terminated swaps, and a benefit from fixed asset rate repricing. We expect noninterest income to be up low single-digits, led by rebounding activity in capital markets, which will be partially offset by reductions in mortgage and other income. We are projecting expenses to be up approximately 1% to 1.5, reflecting continued private bank build-out and broadly strong fee revenues. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for the Q2 in a row.\nCredit trends are expected to improve modestly from the Q2 charge-off level, and we should end the Q3 with CET1 stable, including share repurchases of roughly $75 million, which could be impacted by the amount of loan growth. Our full year outlook remains broadly in line with the guide we provided in January, which contemplated a pickup in business activity in the second half of the year. Looking out to the medium term, we see a clear path to achieving our 16% to 18 ROTCE target. Expanding our net interest margin is also an important driver, and we continue to project to be 3.05% to 3.10 in Q4 2025, 3.15% to 3.30 in Q4 2026, and in the 3.25% to 3.50 range in 2027. Slide 21 in our appendix provides some incremental details on our net interest margin progression to 2027.\nThis, combined with the impact of successful execution of our strategic initiatives and improving credit performance, will drive ROTCE meaningfully higher through 2027. To wrap up, we delivered strong Q2 results that came in ahead of expectations, highlighted by growth in net interest margin, good fee performance, and positive operating leverage. We ended the quarter with strong capital, liquidity, and reserves, which puts us in an excellent position to support our clients and continue driving growth and progressing our strategic initiatives. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, John. Denise, let's open it up for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one. Please unmute your phone and record your name clearly when prompted. Your name is required to introduce your question. To withdraw your question, press star two. Our first question today comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning everyone.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nHi.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nBruce, you saw nice loan growth in the quarter. Obviously, a decent amount of it was idiosyncratic given the gains that you're making in the private bank. I know there's a lot of moving pieces with loan growth runoff in CRE, strategic runoff. Maybe can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of growth in sort of the private bank and then everything else, and how you're feeling about sentiment from borrowers for the remainder of the year? Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure. I'll start, then I think I'll pass it to Brendan and Don for more specific color. I'd say it felt a little like an inflection point that we finally saw all three of the businesses, commercial, consumer, and private bank, have net loan growth. At the enterprise level, we had loan growth that exceeded the kind of BSO and non-core rundown actions that we're taking. You know, when we look into the second half, I would say we're constructive on kind of the macro and the fact that there's been pent-up demand to put money to work in the sponsor space. We're starting to see kind of some new deal flow.\nWe're starting to see a pickup in line utilization there, and a little bit also in the pure corporate banking side. I think the private bank is finding its footing in terms of we kind of have the operation up and running. Initial focus is attracting the relationships, gathering the deposits, and the operating accounts. I think it's been a little slower to see the loan demand pick up, but we're now starting to see that. Some of the growth in the quarter was line utilization on some of the PE/VC subscription lines we have, but also the individual consumer borrowing, particularly around mortgage, that's starting to pick up as well. We expect that now to continue. Clearly, a little drop in rates, if it happens in the second half, would be a bit of a tailwind there.\nIn consumer, we've been kind of just very steady. We have a great HELOC product, we lead the market in HELOC market share. That continues to be a product that is in demand, as well as mortgage being another area where we see consistent, modest growth, but nonetheless it's growth. We launched a whole new card complex during the quarter, and we would expect to see balances in the card space pick up a bit. You know, I'd say we see growth continuing really across the complex. The other net positive is some of the BSO is starting to wind down and become less of a headwind. The non core reductions are smaller as we go forward.\nSome of the work that's been done in commercial, that's smaller as we go forward, and so that will free up the overall net number to be a little bit more positive. With that, why don't I go first to Brendan, and then we'll go over to Don.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSounds good, that was all well said. Maybe I'll just supplement that with a few numbers. In the core retail business, excluding non-core, we were up about $400 million quarter-on-quarter, about $1.4 billion year-on-year. We're seeing steady, high-quality, relationship-led growth. The HELOC progress that we're making has been substantial, and with external numbers that are available on title recordings, it appears we've been number one in the United States on originations in the last couple quarters. The credit quality has been very, very high. High 700 FICO scores, mid-60s CLTV. We're very pleased with it. Yields above 7%, so not bad when we're. Not playing across the country, we're only. Playing in 14 or 15 states and number one nationally, and those all come with deep deposit relationships as well given the structure of the product and our strategy. We're very pleased with that.\nAs Bruce mentioned, we're incredibly excited about the new credit card product launch. It will be mostly oriented around cross selling into our retail customer base versus trying to be a national issuer. We believe the products are very competitive. In fact, we're seeing 30% of our early sales in our higher end mass affluent oriented card that we're calling Summit Reserve, which is a metal black card and also comes with an annual fee, so it can reposition the profitability of the credit card business over time. We expect balances as purchase activity to scale in the back half of the year and start to see some modest high yielding growth there.\nWe feel like we're well positioned in consumer for that to continue and maybe accelerate a little bit on the yield side with card. In the private banking space, we're seeing really an unlock on growth across the board. $1.2 billion in growth linked quarter. 31% of the balances are consumer. That's up a little bit from last quarter. We had a 95% growth rate linked quarter on originations on mortgage. What we're hearing in the market is that our customers obviously were dealing with higher interest rates for a while as we launched the business. You all saw that those metrics were heavy deposit led early on, and they're starting to adjust to the new normal where interest rates are, and business activity is starting to flow through.\nThe relationship started with day to day operating deposits, and it's now moving into lending, which is great to see. Yields are strong, 6.55% on the private bank, which is 433 basis points over the deposit cost. We still have margin in this business that is NIM accretive, which is driving, obviously, the ROE accretion at the top of the house. For us to deliver the rest of the year in private banking, we need an average of $1.1 billion a quarter versus $1.2 billion.\nWe just did. We feel pretty good that the story can continue, and the pipelines are strong, and demand is really increasing. Hopefully, with volatility in the market staying in the same zone we're in now or better, we feel really positive. On the non-core side, just as Bruce mentioned, the rundown is easing. Last year, we were running down about $1 billion a quarter. For the back half of the year, it'll be about $500 million a quarter. So. Still a little bit of headwinds there, but that's reducing, which should be net accretive and hopefully allow us to, all the front book activity we're seeing in the customer businesses, to start to scale up.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, Don.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYep. I'll pick up where Brendan ended, which is, you know, we've been reducing our book ex-CRE by about $1 billion a quarter on our BSO agenda. That's, we're basically almost done with that. That's going to be a headwind that goes away. We'll continue to reduce CRE a little bit to the tune of $500 million a quarter or so, but that'll be a little bit of a drag. What we're seeing is broad business optimism across the board this quarter. It was really led by the private complex, which everybody knows we've put a lot of resources, a lot of strategic emphasis on. We saw a lot of great utilization in our subscription lines and our private credit lines. That was probably about 75% of our loan growth in the quarter, with about 25% coming from CNI.\nAs I'm out talking to CNI customers, they're starting to see the uncertainty around the different policy questions abate. You've got the budget bill passed, you've got the Middle East solved, you've got tariffs moving behind us, and they're beginning to invest in their businesses again. We're seeing quite dynamic pipeline growth across core CNI. People remember Bruce mentioned and John mentioned that New York metro, we're two and a half, three years into now, but we've also opened up in Florida and California in terms of middle market growth. We're seeing very nice new business generation in those markets, which is generating not only loan growth, but it's generating full wallet relationships, which we're really encouraged by. Very different from where I was six months ago. I'm very optimistic about what we see going forward.\nWe'll see how quickly it materializes. It seems like the environment is a good tailwind to the next couple of quarters.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would just put one asterisk on what you said, Don, is that. Like the worst case outcomes on tariffs. Seem to be behind us, but you know, it's still kind of out there as something to contend with. I'd say most folks feel that we'll negotiate something that results in fairer trade, there'll be a higher tariff rate, but it's not something that is going to knock people off their peg.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThey're adjusting their business models to deal with it.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nCorrect. Let's hope that is the case. As we go forward. In any case, I think that has turned into something that's not as big a concern in terms of causing uncertainty. I also think besides the tax bill getting through, the regulatory appointees getting confirmed and having pushing that aggressive deregulatory agenda will also be positive in the second half of the year. Okay, Ryan, anything else?\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nYes, no, that was a great in-depth response. I just feel bad that John did not get a chance to answer, so maybe I'll just throw one out there for him. Obviously, it's been great to see the NIM expansion, and you sort of reiterated all the NIM expectations over the medium term. I guess, you know, given the potential that we could have a more dovish Fed at some point in the not so distant future, maybe just talk about what steps you are taking, if at all, to sort of try to lock in the higher end of those margin expectations. Even if we're in a more dovish environment, can we see sort of the midpoint or higher in terms of the net interest margin? Thank you. No more from me.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I appreciate that, Ryan. I guess what I would talk about is, you know, we have this range that we've talked about over the medium term of 3.25% to 3.50. In our materials, we talked a little bit about what rate environment that range would be consistent with, that rate environment, even with a Fed funds level that is frankly even below 3%. I'd say that something even in the neighborhood of 2.75%, which would be a significant amount of dovishness and a significant amount of reductions from the Fed, would still be consistent with the low end of that range of 3.25%. Anything higher than that, what we messaged was something in the neighborhood of 3.50% probably puts us in the middle of our range at 3.37% NIM.\nAnything that, you know, higher for longer gets us to the high end of that range. We're feeling very increasingly confident in that range. What we've been doing to try to quarter-over-quarter to protect that downside is opportunistically, you know, putting on hedges in a forward starting way. Those hedges generally are well north of where we think the Fed will likely come out. They'll be stable to providing protection against that lower end. Did a little bit of hedging in the Q2, a little bit in theQ1, and we'll continue to opportunistically look for our spots given rate volatility. That's playing out really as expected, and so feeling pretty good about that range.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll just add is that you don't want to spend all your powder on the down scenario. So we've left some of the out years a bit open because you could get in a situation where you have stagflation, and then you want to be able to participate and get the benefit of that in a higher rate environment. That's kind of a judgment call. I think we have a really good buy box discipline, so to speak. We're waiting to see little spikes, and then we'll put some more on. We're still kind of open to the possibilities that we could end up in a different scenario than what is the consensus scenario of the Fed kind of moving down.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for the color.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nYes, hi, good morning. Wanted to ask about the right hand side of the balance sheet in terms of the strategy for the second half of the year. Given everything that I've heard from Brendan and Don, it sounds like it's going to be a good second half for growth. I’ve noticed, John, that you did have great NIB growth in the quarter. Total deposits were down a little bit. As we think about the second half of the year and potentially a growth year outlook, how are you thinking about sort of growth versus optimizing the mix, and is there sort of more BSO to consider that's coming on the asset side that could help fund that growth?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think it's a tale of both of those, Erika, but. Well, I'll start off with the deposit side. We're pretty pleased with our low-cost deposit trends. The mix improved in the second quarter compared to the Q1 on DDA and low cost overall, and those contributions are driven predominantly by our idiosyncratic private bank growth that comes in at 36% of non-interest bearings. That's accretive to top of the house, but also the core retail deposit base has just been performing exceptionally well versus peers from all that we can tell. There's very strong momentum there, and we have really good seasonal factors that contribute on the commercial side in the second half typically.\nAll of that lines up for what we believe to be stable to improving mix on the deposit side, while actually still being able to grow deposits to support our loan growth outlook.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nA stable LDR outlook too stable.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nExcellent liquidity with very good LDRs, a good point there. Of course, on the left side of the balance sheet, we are still rotating capital, maybe to a declining degree, but we've done a really nice job of rotating all of that capital out of non-core and deploying it into highly strategic opportunities in the front book across all three businesses, all three legs of the stool. That's been really efficient, and that front book, back book is extremely powerful and will continue for some time in the non-core space. You heard Don talk about the fact that he's still rotating capital in CNI, although to a decreasing level, such that we're seeing some of this growth fall to the bottom line.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, I'm going to just briefly ask for a brief comment with color so we don't chew up too much of the clock. Brendan, maybe anything to add on kind of strategies in the second half for consumer or private bank, and then Don, I'll flip it to you also for a brief comment.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, just quickly to John's point, the benchmarks we see show that our low-cost deposits in the retail franchise are outperforming peer averages by over 300 basis points for the year so far, which is giving us a lot of optionality on how we manage our deposit strategy. We generally have been flattish linked quarter on interest-bearing deposits, but we've actually grown retail core relationship deposits and released a little bit of interest-bearing deposits on the Citizens Access side, which has given us a lot of ability to manage margin, and the total yield on the consumer business is down three basis points as a result. All of that is giving us the ability to rotate to a higher quality deposit book, more relationship-led, and given us some flexibility on the yield side.\nWe've had a lot of CD maturities, $8 billion in Q1, $6 billion in Q2. We're retaining about 87% of that, but the yields on that are down 120 basis points. When we save those balances, that's also allowing us to drive costs down, and we have large maturities coming due. It's a little bit less in the second half than the first half of the year, but we still have big maturities up in the. We expect that to continue to give us some cost value. On the private bank side, I won't add a lot. We've got confidence in the outlook on growth, 36% not interest bearing, 42% low cost when you add in. The portfolio is of real high quality. We're starting to see the consumer side starting to gear up on some growth as well.\nWe just expect those trends to continue through the summer and into the fall. We're pleased with that, and the channel should give us the ability to have idiosyncratic deposit growth.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'll be super brief. I'd say the two things I'm excited about on the deposit side is we are getting a nice win rate in our expansion markets, which is full wallet win rates. We've had a couple interesting wins on the payment side, another big merchant acquiring account, and a couple other embedded finance type of accounts, which is coming with some nice low cost deposit growth. It's changing our mix a little bit. The liquidity team on the commercial side of the house has done a great job building a bunch of product functionality, which is away from just the core client functionality. We see nice momentum on that front.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nGood. Anything else?\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nYeah, just one more for you, Bruce. Just on the capital, obviously your large peers, their requirements have started to move down with this year's stress test. Potentially more with other types of recalibration with Basel III endgame potentially getting finalized, maybe the AOCI burden is just a third for near term than the 150 basis point adjustment that we have. Fully accounting for it today, I guess in terms of Regional Bank CET1 and excess capital definition, how much of it can sort of ride with the momentum of the G sibs versus potentially being also upheld by the ratings agency. I know ratings agencies, I know one of your peers talked about that being a bit of a binding constraint for the regionals, and I'm wondering if you had any thoughts on that?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, sure. I would say. It's good when. You come through a turbulent period like we had in the banking industry through 2023 and first half of 2024 to build capital and run a little conservatively. I think you've seen all the regionals building their capital. I think the rating agencies' view collectively is that profitability, excuse me, profitability took a bit of a dip and needs to be kind of restored. There was this overhang of commercial real estate office that needed to work itself through and hold more capital until we see the flex point where profitability has rebounded and you've got through the kind of workout phase and substantially through, and credit appears to be in good shape. I'm hopeful that rating agencies start to look more out the front view mirror and don't hold on to that view for too long.\nI think it's still there and it's probably on investors' minds too. Let's just make sure that we're in a good environment and then potentially capital can come down a bit. I don't think it's going to happen right away. I think we've been running a bit above our 10% to 10.5 CET1 range. Ultimately, I think we'll be able to bring it back into that range and still probably stay a bit on the conservative side. That's been our M.O. really since the IPO, to run a little conservative on capital, and there's some real benefits that come from that. If you have a fortress balance sheet, the economy is going to go through cycles. That means the industry is going to go through cycles, and there's going to be opportunities witnessed.\nWhen the west coast banks failed, we were in position to go bid and ultimately to do the startup of the private bank in a tough environment. Actually, running with a little more conservative in your capital structure proves to be a long term benefit. That's where I think it is. Eric.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOk.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Matt O'Connor. Your line is open with Deutsche Bank. I'm sorry.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. I was hoping you could just elaborate a little bit on the reimagining the bank initiative. Maybe any color if there's kind of a point person running it, and how it's different from the top initiatives that we've seen over the last several years?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, I'll start, and I think I'll flip it to Brendan, who will be on point for this one. You know, if you go back in the annals of our top program, we've had 10. Number six about five years ago was a bigger, more complex program than that. It kind of took a two-year time frame and had more technology investment to deliver the benefits. A lot of times when we focus on these annual top programs, we're going after faster wins that aren't as complex and across the enterprise involve rolling out new technologies. We paused and did a two-year program in top six. I think we're at a flex point now in what's happening with new technologies that it's worth doing something similar for the next top program.\nI think it's kind of broader. Top program may sound limiting, and when you say reimagining the bank, it's how you're serving your customers, what you can do for your customers, the efficiency of how you're running the bank, how you can just say things like, you know, I have all these people in the call centers, what are ways to deliver better outcomes and more cost effectively? What would it take to ultimately drive that? What has to happen from a technology standpoint, an organizational standpoint, et cetera. We're taking that step back now. We're talking with lots of outside consultants, looking at scenarios across all industries, across the planet, in the banking industry. What is kind of the cutting edge right now in terms of how these technologies are being deployed? That can be kind of a seismic shift in how your bank's operating.\nIt sounds, you know, I don't want to set expectations too high, but we are really at an exciting period now. We basically set up a mini Exco Sponsorship group, which is going to be led by Brendan. We have a kind of day-to-day lead project team from some key people across the bank that will focus on this mainly as their job now for the next few quarters. We have some idea on the silos that we can go attack. We're kind of setting up the structure, and then we're going to unleash this very shortly. With that set up, maybe Brendan, you could add to that.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I guess my thoughts here would be after going through the IPO for 10 years and then through Covid, I think for Citizens, it's a natural reflection point on the next chapter for the bank and kind of what got us here might need to shift a little bit on what's going to get us to the next phase. Good to just pull way back and have a broad lens on that. To Bruce's point, you combine that with the market dynamics that things are changing very, very fast. The use cases on AI are becoming a little bit more real versus hopes and dreams. How do we combine those two dynamics to simplify the business model, get really crisp on where we want to win, and then really reimagine how the bank works to get things done in a win-win fashion.\nFaster, cheaper for the bank, better from a customer experience standpoint for our customers. All things from operating metrics and artificial intelligence and cost to our people, strategy, and corporate real estate, to simplifying our vendors and getting really, really focused, everything's on the table. The work to be done over the next couple months is just to hone that and get really focused on where we want to get to, which, as Bruce mentioned, hear from us as soon as we get more specific on what we're going to tackle. It's been five or six years since we did the last really big top and that's probably the right timeline to move from the smaller programs back to a really large one.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would just also add, Matt, that we get to some really good numbers in the medium term without this. We are aiming big on what the potential benefits can be, which could be quite beneficial to the overall financial metrics. Some of that is we'd like to free up the capacity to do more investment in some of our growth initiatives. You know, you get that virtuous circle going, and you create some self-funding for the things that you think are going to drive the future. You're able to now accelerate the investment cycle and drive kind of top line growth and efficiency growth. Clearly, you're not going to spend everything that you save. Some of that will drop through and benefit the margin, and benefit ultimately the shareholder.\nThere are some longer term considerations where you can free up some investing dollars to actually accelerate the build out of things like the private bank. We're pretty excited by it. I don't want to oversell it at this early stage, but stay tuned. We'll be talking more about it in the next couple of calls.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's helpful. As you think about kind of some of the upfront costs for this, are you thinking you can self fund it like you've been able to offer in the past, or anything that we should be mindful of in terms of notable items, programs, and things like that? Thanks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou know, I guess it's TBD, Matt, is what we've decided to do now is if these are modest costs and they tend to repeat with each top program, we're kind of not posting them separately and breaking them out. If there were some big things that look more like an expenditure of capital and would affect the run rate, we can either call them out or we can notableize them. We have not crossed that bridge at this point.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ken Usdin with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Just two quick ones. First on the fee side, thanks for giving that color about the $30 million in the Q3 in capital markets, and we see the guide clearly. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that capital markets pipeline, what you're seeing underneath on the advisory side and other capital markets, and how you're feeling about the outlook there?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure. Let me just start, and I'll quickly flip it to Don. What I would say that is a real positive is that we do have some diversity in the fees within capital markets. We started to see, interestingly, the equity markets start to come to life, and we participated in some IPOs in the Q2. Banks indicated loan market stayed strong throughout the quarter. There was a pause in debt market deals early in the quarter.\nThe kind of overall macro-uncertainty probably has the biggest impact on M&A and people's willingness to go forward with deals and close deals. I think that right now we have a huge tailwind because of the deals that pushed, that could have closed in Q2 or were expected to, that pushed into Q3. Beyond that, we're seeing that pipeline refill. We think the equity market continues a bit, syndicated loan market and then the debt market should come back as well. We might be firing on all cylinders. I'll turn that over to Don.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI won't go all the way there because I'll get my budget changed for the year. We are seeing, you know, remember that, you know, away from M&A, which is obviously advisory and actually working with a lot of our private companies for generational change transactions, which is what our core franchise is. There's a big, big pent-up kind of desire to transact, and it's only been recently where you're starting to see valuations come in line between buyers and sellers. A couple of the big things we are going to complete in July had nice economic kickers to them, and we're selling these companies for really high valuations.\nThe second thing I'd say is on the financing side of things, whether it be syndicated lending, the bond businesses, or even some of the equity businesses, it's largely been a refinancing of capital structure kind of exercise, and we haven't really seen the new money engine kick in in size yet. It feels to me like that's happening as I'm looking at our pipelines, that we're starting to see that. It's not just continuation funds from the private equity guys, which is the flavor of the month, but they're beginning to actually transact in a much more significant way. You're seeing the whole private complex beginning to come forward and look to put capital to use. Whether that is a Q3 event or a Q4 event, I'm not totally sure yet, but the pipelines feel pretty good.\nI'm more optimistic than I've been in a while in terms of momentum across the diversified portfolio that Bruce mentioned in terms of cap markets.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nOkay, great. It's clear to see. Like the mortgage over-earning in the quarter. That's clear in the forward guide. The other was a bunch of smattering of items. Was there anything notably sizable in there or what a better run rate is for that other fees? Thanks guys.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would just say there, Ken, that you know that other income line has got a collection of small things that you kind of have to take a view of the full year on that, that you're going to have some quarters where things run a little light and some quarters where they run a little heavier. I think that kind of evens out over the course of the year. There's nothing really sizable and noteworthy to call out there. It just seemed like a few things broke our way and less things broke our way in the Q1.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst of Large-Cap Banks, Autonomous Research\n\nYep, perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nUS Large-Cap Bank Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning everyone. I wanted to start first on the private bank. If we look at the $12 billion deposit target for the end of this year, I know the trends aren't linear, but just given what we saw at Q2 versus Q1, what gives you confidence? It's roughly $3 billion or so growth. For the second half. Can you talk about that?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yeah, well, as John mentioned in his comments, mid July we're already up over $9.5 billion. The $8.7 billion, if you look at the average deposit growth, was quite healthy. Had some positive noise at the end of Q1 that slowed back out seasonally, and then we had some lumpy couple of days at the end of the day this quarter. Looking at the average balances is probably the right way to do it on the underlying momentum, and we're starting. To see that ramp back up.\nYou know it is true we'll need a strong, strong summer and fall and a strong close of the year to get to the numbers. We see the demand there. The platform is scaling. Our bankers are hitting their stride, they're getting used to the platform and used to the bank. We still see the white space as nobody has truly emerged to cover it. We're still seeing strong inflows, and so demand is high. It's going to be about execution, and the underlying pace I think needs to be in line to maybe slightly better than what we saw in the second quarter for us to get there. We've got confidence that's the case. We also have had some new teams that have come on in Southern California as an example that are just getting their feet under them.\nWe have some positivity there and very targeted. We've added a few folks in a handful of the markets, so there's a lot of dynamics going into that. It certainly is an ambitious target for us, but we do have confidence we can get there.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nUS Large-Cap Bank Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay, that's helpful. For my follow up, this commentary around reimagining the bank is really fascinating. When you talk to most banks and they talk about Agentic AI, it tends to be call center and CRM focused. It seems that this is much broader. Are you guys, is this like everything on the table? Client experience, cost saves, risk mitigation? Are you looking at everything? If you are, it's amazing if you could pay for that, not see an increase in expenses because if you look at the large banks, they need to spend first to start seeing the benefits. Could you unpack that a bit for us?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, everything is on the table, and we are bullish on long-term value creation from AI and Agentic AI. There are some tried and true things in the program too that will help self on part of the journey that aren't necessarily kind of the new, modern, technology-led initiatives, like vendor simplification at a broader scale with much more of a strategic lens, taking a look at how the company's structured from a real estate standpoint. There are a lot of other more traditional things that we've hygiene cleaned up on the various top initiatives, and now we're going to take an even bigger step back. It will be a myriad of things.\nOur hope is, and this is what we're going to scope out through the summer period, that we can sequence all these investments in a way that has it smart and logical, and have some quick wins that can maybe supplement some of the ideas that take a longer time. The reason we're having a much longer window in this top versus the other top is that some of these initiatives do take a little bit more time for the shift to come, and we want to take that medium term, longer term lens on this. We're planting the right seeds not just to impact the next year or two, but impact the next three to five years. I think it's a big difference in how we're approaching this program that allows us to be a lot more strategic.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would just add also that the pace of innovation in this space, particularly around Agentic, is really mind boggling. When you look back six months ago and where was this and how ready for purpose were some of these solutions to kind of where are they today? I know, Brendan, you just spent a day with a bunch of fintechs and startups to try to look at this and kick the tires a little harder. It's quite dramatic. You know, the big banks may be spending a lot of money and doing some kind of pioneer work, though I think there'll be kind of more ready made, turnkey solutions available that hopefully we can take advantage of.\n\nSteven Alexopoulos\n\nUS Large-Cap Bank Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. Terrific. Thanks for the color.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Up next is John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst of Regional Banks and Specialty Finance Sectors, Evercore\n\nMorning. Just want to ask a little bit around competitive dynamics. You have a couple peers out there. Citing some intensifying competition, we've heard both a bit on the loan pricing side as well as on deposits. I just want to see. If you can give us a little bit more color, what you're seeing there in terms of. On the deposit side, your confidence in. Your data expectations, and are you seeing any of that pressure, and then on. The loan pricing side specifically, as you. See some acceleration in loan growth. Your strategies there, are you seeing some. Intensifying competition from banks and non-banks?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nLet's start with Don on commercial.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. John, yes, the answer is it's competitive out there. It's always competitive. I think our secret sauce and what we're trying to do is stay focused on multi-product relationships with mid-sized companies, and we've carved out a niche. I think we've got an incredibly strong delivery model, which allows us not to just think about making loans or gathering deposits, but doing a multitude of things with our customers. That's what we've tried to build over the last 10 years. It's interesting, the teams that we've hired in Florida and California have said the same thing to me, which is, wow, the way we're showing up as a company across product and industry expertise and core banking is so different than my old firm showed up.\nIt's becoming the differentiator of being able to win business and win broad wallet relationships with people. I mean, we're never going to make a lot of money lending money to a company. I mean, it's about everything else we do with that company. That's the way we try to make the market. I've never been in a situation in my 41 years of doing this where I haven't had a ton of competition, and you just got to be day to day more focused and day to day better to create the kind of relationships that you want to bring onto the balance sheet, and then also pass on the things where you're not going to make a lot of money, where it's just a price gain. That's what BSO has been about for us.\nWe're really trying to rotate capital to where we can build those enduring relationships and, you know, knock wood. So far, so good. If you look at private credit, which is what a lot of people like to talk about, we're now bankers to the Private Credit Complex, and we've created an amazing business banking the private credit complex that actually is, in a very equivalent way, replacing our leveraged finance kind of fee stream and our leveraged finance earning stream with a much more attractive earning asset on the private credit side of things. Trying to stay ahead of the trends and trying to stay smart about where the market is going, and then having your delivery cost being reasonable, which is what Brendan's going to try to lead in terms of reimagining the bank, is really the name of the game. How do you generate good earning assets and good deposit growth with a reasonable expense base?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nBrendan?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSame thing, my businesses. It is really intense. It's always been intense. I think it's largely been unchanged recently. There's a lot of competition out there. There's always some irrational folks pricing out there. I think what we're spending a little. bit more time on is if rates pull back, how do we play that and do some competitors play it a little bit more irrationally on the deposit side and hold serve for a while to gain deposits and deteriorate margins or chase the market down really fast on lending, we'll see what happens. Right now we're competing well in a really intense market. When it's relationship led, to Don's point, you tend to have a little bit more flex in yield pricing on both sides, deposits and lending. If you've got truly the primary banking relationship, you don't have to be the very best, and that helps a lot as we've regrounded the franchise and deep relationship-based banking both in retail and private banking. One thing you can count on us on is being return focused. We're not going to chase the market down.\nIf competitive dynamics get super intense, we'll make sure we're doing the right thing for capital allocation and the right returns. We're very committed to, on private as an example, to have a 20% to 24 return profile. We're going to stick to our guns there, price loans and deposits that we believe is appropriate for market conditions, and then we'll have to compete and win on relationships. We're doing that so far, and I don't expect that to change.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJust two quick items here to add on top of that. One is spreads are holding in, holding our discipline on the commercial lending side of things, and returns in retail and consumer look good on the deposit side. We've had this outlook of low to mid-50s cumulative beta over the medium term. Already through the end of the Q2, we're at 54%, which is better than median, better than average, and a really, really strong performance so far this cycle. We have all of the foundation and mindset is there to continue that performance over the medium term.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMaybe one more point. I think we've made this on other calls that we've had, probably a little bit more leverage than some of the other peers when you think about Citizens Access and now the private bank. Depending on how competitive dynamics flex across all the segments, we can capitalize. Where there's better ground.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst of Regional Banks and Specialty Finance Sectors, Evercore\n\nOkay, great, thanks. Bruce, just curious on your updated thoughts around the M&A backdrop. We've seen some, you know, a resumption of deals amid the regional banks. Just wanted to get your thoughts there. I know you've kind of implied. That over time, if you get that, you know that you've got to work towards, you know, your results and then. That will drive a multiple in your stock and everything. Just curious how you see Citizens. As being a potential player in the wave of consolidation that we could see.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think nothing's really changed there, notwithstanding a small deal that was announced last week. You know, our focus right now is driving this organic growth. We have a huge opportunity here to get our ROTCE back where we'd like it to be, to capture that white space that First Republic vacated, and build up our private bank and private wealth business, and really drive the growth in the New York City metro market that is sitting there in front of us to execute on. I want to not get distracted and make sure that job one is to continue to drive great execution and drive the ROTCE higher. I have said, though, if there's a really attractive opportunity down the road, I have total confidence in this leadership team and our ability to integrate that and execute on that.\nYou'd have to be pretty high bar to make sure that you had the financials, the strategic, the cultural fit in order to go do something. I think that's more kind of down the road than it is imminently.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst of Regional Banks and Specialty Finance Sectors, Evercore\n\nGot it. All right, thanks Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, next.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nDenise.\n\nOperator\n\nThat's all? Yeah. Oh, I'm so sorry. I had my mute button on. That is from Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nResearch Analyst of Banks Mid-Cap and Consumer Finance, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning all. I had a quick question on credit given that the office reserve was down about 50 basis points. Can you update us on what you're seeing in the space, and I guess if things are improving, how you're thinking about managing that reserve and the overall ACL over the next few quarters?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou start, John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll just go ahead and start off there. Thanks for the question. We're seeing some really good trends in credit, as you saw in some of our results. You know, broadly, charge offs being down, you know, from last quarter to this, and expected to be down again. You've got to, we're keeping an eye on that, but the trends look good. Nonaccrual trends look very good. Lastly, as you're asking about with respect to general office, I mean, the thing to keep an eye on is the dollar amount of reserves that we're allocating to this book. We are down this quarter about $30 million or so. That rate will jump around a little bit, but this is the Q1 where we're really charging off against the reserve and don't feel the need to re-provide for those charge offs.\nThat reflects some expectation of stability in valuations, as well as an understanding and an outlook with respect to probability of default that feel well controlled and re-fenced at this stage. That's been a big level of uncertainty that we have a sense here may be starting to get behind us. We've had peak credit losses are behind us, we believe, for this cycle, as well as, I think we mentioned, peak in nonaccrual. I think that is all trending well. I think the last thing to keep in mind is our front book, back book. As we're running off other areas of the book, such as CRE outside of general office, most of the front book has a lower provision and ACL need compared to what's getting run off, including in noncore.\nA lot of those trends would be consistent with coverage levels being adequate now and possibly some opportunity to moderate that over time, you know, as long as the macro holds in. You know, just, you know, to wrap it all up, a lot of really solid tailwinds on the credit side, and feeling like that looks good for the rest of the year.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAnyone had anything on office?\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nNo, I just say that, you know, I don't think we've moved an office property into our workout group in the last year. The problem children who are going through the workout process and where we've got the reserves put up are well identified and well through their restructuring process, and the rest of the book, there's some good tailwinds in terms of the office environment in different cities across the country, notably New York City, which is quite strong. I think if you go back two or three years from now, we had a lot of uncertainty. Right now we feel like we've got a really box we're comfortable with where we've got things reserved, as John said.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nResearch Analyst of Banks Mid-Cap and Consumer Finance, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood, that's very helpful. Bruce, I don't think I heard you talk about Stablecoin when you spoke about reimagining the bank initiative. Is that an area of focus? If that is, how are you thinking about the investment there, and in general, what impact do you think that will have on.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I wouldn't put that under the umbrella of reimagining the bank. I think that's more kind of an initiative for us to develop under kind of our overall payments business and payments strategy. You know, I think it's got a lot of buzz right now, and there's some potential use cases that may ultimately establish themselves, and cross border payments is one everybody's talking about. We're certainly monitoring developments there. We see you always want to make sure that you're capturing opportunities and minimizing risks when you see these trends develop. I think we've got smart people looking at these things. We're talking to our customers. We want to be there to serve our customers' customers. I think we're positioned well.\nI wouldn't call it out as something that in the near term is that dramatic, that will have that dramatic of an impact on us. A lot of times you're going to look to do these developments in consortia with other banks or leveraging some of your key vendors like Fiserv, and so we're looking at all of that. I don't think there's a significant investment that's staring us in the face at this point.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nResearch Analyst of Banks Mid-Cap and Consumer Finance, Morgan Stanley\n\nFair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nChris McGratty\n\nHead of US Bank Research and Managing Director, KBW\n\nOh, great. Thanks for tipping me in. Bruce, on capital allocation. Broadly, given the momentum you have in your capital markets business, is there a case to be made to be upping capital to these businesses anywhere you'd like to lean in a little bit more.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think it's more of an OpEx question than a capital question. We've been adding coverage bankers in key industry verticals, and corporate finance specialists, and we'll continue to do that. We've added coverage bankers in the middle market, as Don mentioned, in some of the expansion areas, building out New York Metro, and investing in Florida and California. A lot of this is people cost. I think we have good capital allocation to do the business that we focus on, and underwriting limits, et cetera.\nFor a bank our size that is prudent, I think it would be a mistake potentially to say, well, let's just take more swings and raise that capital limit and do bigger deals. We tend to run into the big boys as we move up market, and we also want to stay prudent in terms of the risk we're willing to take and making sure that we stay granular. I'd say probably no. In terms of additional capital, we could continue to see some loan growth. In terms of the sponsors that we cover, we might broaden that universe a little bit. That might be one place that we earmark a little bit of capital. Mostly right now it's about OpEx and making sure we have really great people lined up with where we see the best opportunities.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think that's right. I think where you'll see us over index is probably building depth and industry specialization. As Bruce said, in terms of our corporate finance teams, I think we've got plenty of talent on our core underwriting desks and our core capital markets businesses, and we don't feel capital constrained at all for the business that we're trying to undertake.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWe have a good complement of M&A professionals as well.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nA lot of that doesn't take capital. Right. That's pure advisory.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIf we were adding to that, it would maybe be to complement industry verticals. If we go out and buy another boutique, it might be a place where we think we're a little short, and we could benefit from some expertise. I don't see a huge amount taking place there either.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI agree.\n\nChris McGratty\n\nHead of US Bank Research and Managing Director, KBW\n\nOkay, I appreciate that. Then the follow up, the comments. About charge offs peaking likely in the Q1 and NPLs last Q3. If I separate the office discussion, which you just handled, anything notable to call out in terms of inflows or inflow reversals over the last couple quarters that give you confidence in those numbers? Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, things are playing out as expected, very nicely. I think the macro-stability, we were a little conservative with the macro this quarter, you know, so I think we're well positioned for any uncertainties going forward with respect to tariffs or unemployment, which we actually raised a touch in the Q2 to remain conservative on that outlook. When it comes to the back book performance, it's actually, you know, playing out as expected. Next quarter we expect charge offs to be down slightly as we mentioned. Yeah, nothing to really call out.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think part of that is just our risk appetite and where we focus our strategy. In consumer, we're focused more on mass affluent and affluent is our sweet spot. We have kind of less exposure to the mass customer who's the first segment to get stretched. You don't see any trends in our delinquencies or anything concerning at all. Again, on the corporate side, you know, we've moved up market a little bit and we've grown kind of the upper end of middle market and mid corporate, and those tend to be a bit stronger credits as well. We don't really see any. Hot spots across the market and where.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWe do have riskier exposures like leverage finance, we're highly diversified with very small holds. We distribute 90% of those transactions, so our average hold is like $12 million. That overall book has been declining. Over the last couple of years. We have a very kind of well-developed distribution strategy to make sure it doesn't stick to our balance sheet.\n\nChris McGratty\n\nHead of US Bank Research and Managing Director, KBW\n\nGood, that's great. Thank you. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director of Financial Services, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks, guys. I think most of my questions have been answered. Did want to ask Bruce or Brendan. How does the private bank build out look after we get past this year, after you hit the $12 billion deposit, $7 billion loan, and $11 billion assets under management target? Will we kind of be, you know, you've talked about the white space, so presumably there's much more to do. Is there a point where we get toward more of a critical mass where profitability kind of begins to flywheel upon itself, or will we continue to add more teams at a similar pace to the last year or so?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, let me start. Brendan, you can offer some color. I think it was really important when we initiated this startup that we put some markers out there, we stayed disciplined, and we demonstrated that we could grow this business in a prudent fashion, in a sustainable fashion, profitably, and that we would generate good returns.\nWe've held that discipline. We've made, and partly it also makes sense because there's a lot to build in support before you really turn the crank. You want to make sure you've got the service levels, the systems, and the customer interfaces at the right level. That all came together saying that we're going to grow gradually through 2025. Once we hit those markers, which we expect to do, then where do you go from there? I think continuing to add more private banking teams in attractive locations is part of the equation. Opening more private bank offices that are kind of attractive ground level facilities. We just opened one this week in New York City. You can go in for a cookie on the corner of 52nd and 6th. It's an awesome showcase for the private banks.\nWe'll be doing more of that. We're ramping up the wealth team so we can have kind of better solution set for folks, both banking needs and their wealth needs as well. I would expect that to continue. You know, if you go out three to five years, this can grow quite a bit from being, you know, 5% to 6 accretive to the bottom line. It can easily scale up from there, and I think we can do it profitably. So, Brendan?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nPresident and Head of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. The only thing I would add is it's incredibly important to us that we stay true to the financial guardrails we put in place in terms of having this be the loan growth be driven by first securing high quality funding, and that will be a governor on our growth. We won't get out over our skis, and we have this be a financial profile that has return accretion to the franchise versus dilution. Those things are heavy considerations. Having said that, I agree with everything Bruce said. The opportunity is still very big, and as we consider growth, it ties a little bit into reimagining the bank. If we can self-fund the journey, maybe we'll go a little faster, but we're going to stay very true to the value proposition in the guardrail.\nWe believe there's white space in the integration of banking and wealth, and we need talent that believes that too and can scale. We certainly have other markets that. We operate in today in retail and commercial that we're not yet in in private banking that are great markets for us to round out our full bank proposition and plant a private banking flag, as well as sort of some of the newer markets like Florida and California that still provide a lot of running room for growth. Right now we're focused on delivering the year, but we definitely see opportunity for sustained growth into the future in 2026 and beyond.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYep. We'll give you more color on. That actually when we get to the January guide and we talk about 2026. I'd like to be leaning forward as early as next year to actually continue to scale it up.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director of Financial Services, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. All right, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Appreciate the call has gone on too long. Just a couple of quick follow ups. One in terms of outlook for deposit costs, it feels like CDs still have some room to go, but we saw the checking account rates move up quarter over quarter. Just wondering if we don't get any rate cuts, John, are deposit costs still trending lower through the second half of the year?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, you may have heard from Brendan that we had a nice rotation in the CD book. There was about $8 billion that matured in the Q2 that we're actually rotating into much lower cost CDs that are 120 to 150 basis points below where the maturity rates are. The really nice front book, back book there, it steps down a tiny bit in the Q3.\nDown a touch, maybe in the neighborhood of $6 billion in maturities, but still a really nice tailwind for that front book, back book. There's still more in the Q4. I think we've got nice benefit to be able to have the opportunity on the deposit side. I think as I mentioned earlier, keeping an eye on our deposit, our cumulative deposit beta where we perform quite well, we're at 54% for the end of the Q2. That's better than average, and we feel very good about deposit costs for the rest of the year based on not only interest bearing costs themselves, but also some opportunities to stabilize and improve the mix.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Just one quick one for you, Don. When we think about the lending outlook, I'm not sure if you addressed this. Any sign, any uptick on the sponsor led side when we think about capital call line lending? Are you seeing any pickup there, and how much of that's kind of baked in for the back half? Thanks.\n\nDon McCree\n\nChair of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes, we've seen about an 8% increase in capital call utilization in the Q2. That drove a little bit of our loan growth in general. The trending I heard from the team yesterday is they continue to expect further growth and utilization. As we get it, we're not adding a lot of new capital call lines, but we're just seeing utilization revert to normal, and we're about six points below our long-term average utilization in our capital call line. You know, you're seeing the deal announcements going on out there. Capital call lines get driven by not the deals we're doing, but obviously by the broad activity of the PE complex, and they're beginning to get more active. We think there's some continued upside in utilization on that side of things.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGreat.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think that's our last question. Great. Before I leave, I just want to take the opportunity to thank John Woods for his contribution along our transformation journey. It's been great working with you, John, and anyway, we wish you well on your next chapter.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, with that, let me thank everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

It.\n\nOperator\n\nMorning everyone and welcome to the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ivy and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question and answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Head of Investor Relations. Kristen, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Ivy. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and CFO John Woods will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter presentation located on our investor relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review in the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results in the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix, and with that, I will hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Kristen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced financial results today that were in line with our expectations. Highlights include NIM expansion of 3 basis points to 2.90%, core loan growth of 1%, resilience in our fee categories despite some softness in capital markets given market uncertainty, and credit trends remaining favorable along with continued share repurchases. Our balance sheet remains very strong with CET1 ratio of 10.6%, LDR of 77.5%, virtually no Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, and a strong credit allowance position. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to sell $1.9 billion in purchased student loans which reside in non-core. $200 million of the portfolio was sold in Q1, with the balance to be settled ratably over the next three quarters.\nWe will use the proceeds to pay down high-cost funding, purchase low-risk weight securities, and repurchase shares. The transaction will be accretive to NIM, EPS, and ROTC. We had already included the impact in our full-year guide. During the quarter, we also issued $750 million in senior debt, further bolstering our funding base. We executed well on our strategic initiatives during the quarter. The Private Bank continued to see excellent growth, reaching $8.7 billion in deposits and $5.2 billion in AUM. We added private wealth teams in Florida and Southern California during the quarter, and another one today in New Jersey. Our New York City Metro, private capital, and payments initiatives also saw continued progress. As we look forward, there has clearly been an increase in uncertainty in the macro environment given the policy decisions and rollout emanating from Washington.\nThis has caused many market participants to hit pause on investments or deal activity. On a positive note, our corporate and consumer borrowers are generally in good shape and are in position to weather these challenges. The basis for our full year guide had anticipated some choppiness in the first half of the year tied to the rollout of tariffs and downsizing of the federal government. Our view held that as the lower tax, deregulation, and pro energy agenda kicked in later in the year, we would see a pickup in loan demand and deal activity in the second half. With respect to an update to our full year guide at this point, we reaffirm our EPS estimate.\nThough there could well be some puts and takes, events in Q2 will help clarify whether the second half outlook will solidify as we had planned. On our guide slide in our presentation, we call out some risks that affect both us and the industry at large given the environment, and we also show some potential offsets to the full year guide. The main risks associated with continued economic uncertainty and a slowing economy include a push out in capital markets fees, slower loan growth, and higher credit provision. Potential offsets to these possible impacts include even better performance on funding costs, greater share repurchases, and further efforts on cost transformation. It's worth noting that there is a significant amount of pent-up demand around M&A activity. We are working on a record number and dollar value of transactions, and are hopeful that they get done as uncertainty subsides.\nWhile it's still early to make a call as to how the environment plays out, we remain focused on pulling the levers we can to offset any macro headwinds as we did in 2024 in meeting our initial year guide. As we look to the medium term, we remain confident in our NIM trajectory, which powers our ROTC improvement, and in our ability to execute on our key strategic initiatives like the private bank. In short, we feel good about our positioning overall from a strategic, business, and financial standpoint. We will stay focused on execution and the things we can control as we continue our efforts towards building a distinctive great bank. With that, let me turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks Bruce, and good morning everyone. As Bruce indicated, we delivered first quarter results which were broadly in line with our expectations and reflected typical seasonal impacts. Referencing slides 5 and 6, we delivered EPS of $0.77 for the first quarter, with ROTC of 9.6%. Net interest income came in at the better end of our expectations for the quarter, as we performed well in our margin, which continued to benefit from the time-based decline of non-core and terminated swaps, along with strong deposit cost. Performance fees were up nicely year-over-year, and linked quarter performance reflects the impact of seasonality and market uncertainty on capital markets, wealth. Fees were a record for the quarter. As we continue to build out the private bank, expenses were managed tightly, including the usual seasonality in salaries and benefits.\nCredit came in as we expected, and we maintained a strong reserve coverage level during the quarter. We entered an agreement to sell approximately $1.9 billion of non-core education loans. This acceleration in non-core runoff will be accretive to NIM, EPS, and ROTC, with the redeployment of the freed-up capital and liquidity as the sale settles over the course of the year. We continue to execute well against our strategic initiatives. Notably, the private bank continued to steadily grow its profitability, contributing $0.04 to EPS and finishing the first quarter with $8.7 billion of deposits. Also, we continue to make good progress in New York Metro, and our top 10 program is well underway.\nWe ended the quarter in a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.64% or 9.1% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal, a pro forma category 1 LCR of 122%, and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.61%. This includes a robust 12.3% coverage for general office. We also executed $200 million in stock buybacks during the quarter, taking advantage of our strong capital position. Next, I'll talk through the first quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide 7. Net interest income decreased 1.5% linked quarter, driven by the day count impact of about $28 million and slightly lower interest earning assets, which was partially offset by the benefit of higher net interest margin. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was up 3 basis points to 2.90%.\nDriven primarily by the time-based benefits of non-core runoff and reduced drag from terminated swaps, and the benefit of improved deposit costs, partially offset by the net impact of rate-driven impacts on the balance sheet. We continued to execute our down-rate playbook in the deposit portfolio. Our interest-bearing deposit costs decreased 18 basis points, while maintaining the mix of non-interest-bearing deposits at 21%, stable with the prior quarter. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit down beta improved to 53% in the first quarter. Moving to slide 8, non-interest income is down 3.5% linked quarter with seasonal impacts in capital markets and card fees. Capital markets saw lower M&A and loan syndication activity given seasonality and the impact of uncertain market conditions pushing M&A deals out. Debt and equity underwriting improved coming off a slower fourth quarter.\nEven in a quarter impacted by seasonality and market volatility, we managed to perform well in middle market sponsored bookrunner deals, ranking number three by volume. Our deal pipelines across M&A and DCM remain very strong despite market uncertainty. In fact, our M&A pipeline is at all-time highs in terms of number and value of transactions. Given pent-up demand, we are hopeful these deals get done as market uncertainty subsides. The wealth business delivered a solid quarter with increased annuity sales activity. We also continue to see positive momentum in fee-based AUM growth from the private bank. Our global markets business was up slightly this quarter with increased client hedging activity in FX and energy-related commodities. On slide 9, expenses were managed tightly, up 1.7% linked quarter, primarily reflecting seasonality in salaries and benefits.\nOur latest top program is underway, and this gives us the capacity to self-fund our growth initiatives. On slide 10, period-end and average loans were down slightly. This reflects the non-core transaction of $1.9 billion as well as auto runoff of $700 million. Excluding non-core loans, we were up approximately 1% on a period-end basis. The private bank continued to make good progress, with period-end loans up about $550 million to $3.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Commercial loans were up slightly, with a modest increase in line utilization as some of our corporate banking clients drew down on their lines to finance inventory builds ahead of tariffs. We also saw a modest increase in capital call line usage given M&A activity in our sponsor base, and core retail loans grew slightly, driven by home equity and mortgage.\nNext, on slides 11 and 12, we continued to do a good job on deposits, growing on a spot basis primarily in low-cost categories. In what is typically a seasonally down quarter, period-end deposits were up approximately $3 billion, or 2%, driven primarily by low-cost growth in the private bank and consumer, partially offset by a seasonal decrease in commercial. The private bank continues to add customers and grow nicely, with period-end deposits increasing by about $1.7 billion - $8.7 billion at the end of the first quarter. Our retail franchise grew deposits in low-cost categories this quarter, and we continue to maintain strong CD retention rates even as we reduced yields. Stable retail deposits are 68% of our total deposits, which compares to a peer average of about 55%.\nThis was a big driver of our improving deposit costs this quarter as our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a competitive environment. Our interest bearing deposit costs are down 18 basis points last quarter, translating to a 53% cumulative down beta. We continue to maintain a robust level of liquidity with a pro forma LCR of 122%, significantly above the Category 1 bank requirement. Moving to credit on Slide 13, net charge offs of 58 basis points for the quarter included a 7 basis point impact from the non-core transaction. Excluding this impact, net charge offs were 51 basis points, which was down modestly from 53 basis points in the prior quarter. In line with our expectations, commercial charge offs were down modestly, driven by a sequential decline in general office. Retail charge offs were broadly stable, excluding the impact of the non-core transaction.\nOf note, non-accrual loans were down 5% late quarter, reflecting a decline in commercial as we continue to work out general office loans. Retail non-accrual loans also decreased as a result of the non-core transaction and continued runoff of the auto portfolio. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14, the allowance was relatively stable at 1.61% this quarter as portfolio mix continues to improve due to back book runoff and lower loss content. Front book originations were offset by a slightly more conservative loss forecast. The economic forecast supporting the allowance reflects a mild recession similar to last quarter, and macro impacts from tariffs. The reserve for the $2.86 billion general office portfolio is $351 million, which represents a coverage of 12.3%, broadly stable with the prior quarter.\nNote that the cumulative charge-offs plus the current reserve translates to an expected loss rate of about 20% against the March 2023 loan balance when industry loss is commenced. Moving to Slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is 10.64%, adjusting for the AOCI opt-out removal. Our CET1 ratio was stable at 9.1%. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $200 million in common shares, and including dividends, we returned a total of $386 million to shareholders in the first quarter. Turning to Slide 16, we provide some details on the non-core portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, we took the opportunity to accelerate the rundown of the portfolio with an agreement to sell approximately $1.9 billion of education loans. We recognized a $25 million charge-off associated with this portfolio that was covered by a pre-existing allowance.\n$200 million of the sale settled in the first quarter, with the remainder scheduled to settle ratably each quarter through 2025. We expect to use the proceeds to pay down high-cost funding, invest in low-risk investment securities, and repurchase shares. With this redeployment, the transaction will be accretive to NIM, EPS, and ROTC. Moving to Slide 17, we are well positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term with our overall three-part strategy: a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank among our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned private bank and private wealth franchise. We continue to make excellent progress on the private bank.\nWe delivered our strongest deposit growth quarter so far, adding $1.7 billion of deposits to end the first quarter at $8.7 billion, and the mix continues to be very attractive with slightly over 40% in non-interest bearing. We also ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in loans and $5.2 billion in AUM, with a $0.04 contribution from the business in the first quarter. We are tracking well against our 5% accretion estimate to Citizens' bottom line in 2025 and to deliver a 20% to 24% return. Moving to Slide 18, we provide our guide for the second quarter. We expect net interest income to be up approximately 3%, driven by an improvement in net interest margin of approximately 5 basis points and day count. This pickup in net interest margin is primarily attributable to the time-based benefits of non-core runoff and reduced drag from terminated swaps.\nNon-interest income is expected to be up mid to high single digits, led by capital markets, with some risk if market uncertainty persists. FX and derivatives, and wealth should also provide a lift for the quarter. We are projecting expenses to be broadly stable. Credit trends are expected to improve slightly from the first quarter charge-off level, excluding the non-core transaction, and we should end the second quarter with CET1 in the range of 10.5% to 10.75%, including share repurchases of approximately $200 million, which could increase depending on loan growth. Currently, our full-year outlook remains broadly in line with the guide we provided in January, which contemplated a pickup in business activity in the second half of the year. However, if the current challenges in the external environment persist, there could be select risks that impact us as well as the broader industry.\nPersistent market volatility could impact capital markets revenue and anticipated loan growth in the second half of the year. While the assumptions incorporated in our current reserve are conservative, and our corporate and consumer borrowers are broadly in good shape, heightened likelihood of a deeper recession could lead to higher provision. However, if these risks arise, we have potential offsets we can leverage. Lower loan growth could facilitate additional share repurchases, as well as the opportunity to further lower deposit costs. As we continue executing our deposit pricing playbook, we would also take the opportunity to manage expenses down through streamlining our operations, and further cost transformation. Looking out to the medium term, we see a clear path to achieving our 16% to 18% ROTC target.\nExpanding our net interest margin is an important driver, and we project it to be 3.05% - 3.10% in Q4 2025, 3.15% - 3.30% in Q4 2026, and in the 3.25% - 3.50% range in 2027. Slide 21 in our appendix provides some incremental details on our net interest margin progression to 2027. This, combined with the impact of successful execution of our strategic initiatives, should drive ROTC meaningfully higher by 2027. To wrap up, we delivered Q1 results that were in line with our expectations, highlighted by growth in net interest margin. While the market uncertainty has impacted capital markets revenues, deal backlogs are at all-time highs. We accelerated the runoff of non-core with the education loan sale, which will be accretive to NIM, EPS, and ROTC.\nWe entered the quarter with strong capital, liquidity, and reserves, which puts us in an excellent position to support our clients while navigating market uncertainty. We continue to drive forward our strategic initiatives, with the private bank progression particularly noteworthy. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, John. Operator, Ivy, let's open it up for Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the question and answer portion of the call. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please unmute your phone, press Star one, and record your name clearly when prompted. If you need to withdraw your question at any time, press Star two. Again, that's Star one to ask a question. Your first question comes from the line of John Pincher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Evercore ISI)\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nJust on the balance sheet growth, just want to see if you can give us a little bit more color around loan demand. What you're seeing here in this backdrop, are you seeing what are some of the trends in line utilization? Are you seeing any weakening of the pipeline, and also any type of pre-tariff inventory build that might have driven a little bit of the growth in the near term but might be more.\nOf a pull forward versus the outlook?\nIf you can just give us some color there. Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll start off and others will chime in here, but maybe just starting in commercial, we are seeing some line utilization increases. We saw that up a couple percentage points at the end of the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. That was driven by a number of factors. I mean, we think tariffs is part of the story, but I'd also say that M&A and some working capital is in there as well. That was both in our corporate banking business, as well as on the sponsor side in our utilization, in our subscription line side of the house and commercial.\nWe are seeing some of that trending, and frankly, given the expected pickup in business activity in the second half, there's some expectation that we'll see that continue, assuming some of this uncertainty subsides. On the consumer side of things, we're seeing good take up on the RESI and HELOC side of the ledger, given where the rate environment is. HELOC in particular has been a really strong story for us. Last but not least, I throw out the private bank, which continues to drive growth. You're seeing all three of the legs of the stool, as you heard earlier, contributing to the loan growth outlook. Maybe I'll just pause there and see if there's other color to add.\n\n[Unknown Speaker 2]\n\nUnknown Speaker 2\n\nYeah, I would affirm what John said. It's done. I think as we talk to customers, we're hearing a little bit of expansion desire.\nThey've gone a little bit to the sidelines right now just given what's going on with the uncertainty in the environment. The other thing, John, that's been going on really powerfully in the first quarter is we've gotten disintermediated by the bond markets. We had an extremely strong bond quarter, and some of that came off of our balance sheet. As clients access, particularly the high yield market, I think that probably is going to reverse given where rates are right now. That'll be a tailwind behind us in terms of loan growth. I don't know how much of it is tariffs in terms of the line draws. I think it's just general working capital build, people running their businesses really tightly. I don't think we've seen the tariff impact yet, and that could be a tailwind also.\nYou know, as we'll have to see on the capital call lines, that's a pretty big part of our balance sheet. You know, not huge, but it's about a $10 billion exposure overall, of which about half is drawn, and that's running at relatively low utilization. To the extent we get some of the deal activity kicking in, particularly in the second half, that should grow nicely.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIt's Brendan, on the consumer side, if you put aside our non-core rundown, which as John pointed out was down about $1 billion last quarter, and look at the underlying business that we're still originating, we're seeing decent growth, 1% up year-over-year, as John pointed out, heavily led by residential and secured. The portfolio is 75% secured. Keep in mind on the consumer side, with incredibly high credit straps, with high FICOs and relatively low LTVs, HELOC, we're actually up 9% year-over-year and believe we're right at the top of the league tables on net growth versus peers. That's through a bunch of innovative investments that we've made in analytics and customer experience that has driven a distinct advantage for us.\nWe will continue to take advantage of that given the high quality nature of the customer, and expect that growth level to persist throughout the year.\nMortgage, even though we have high.\nRates, the portfolio growth is actually decent, up 3% year-over-year. Again, high quality customers, prepay speeds really low on the back book given the lack of a refinance activity.\nWe're seeing net positive growth.\nThe other portfolios, student and credit card, have been flattish. Student given higher rates, and credit card obviously by design. As we look to launch some new products here midyear, we expect that to see some higher returning growth, assuming the economy plays in our favor in the second half of the year. We feel pretty good that underlying loan demand is high for the second half of the year. In the private bank, we are, as John pointed out, we grew about $500 million linked quarter.\nWhat we're seeing there is still strong.\nDemand from that customer base. As the consumer part of that portfolio builds, the mix has shifted modestly to consumer. That's now 30% of the book, where it was in the low 20s about a year ago. That's a good sign. We expect slow, steady, continued progression and balancing out the book. Demand seems to have picked up. Our mortgage originations in the private bank are about double what they were same time this year, despite a similar rate environment.\nActivity is strong.\nWe expect growth rates to accelerate in the back half of the year for the Private Bank.\n\n[Analyst] (Evercore ISI)\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, great. Thank you for all that color. Appreciate it. Just quickly on my second question, just around capital, I know you're sitting here around 10.6% CET1, and you cited expectation for around $200 million in buybacks, similar to this quarter or to last quarter. Also, I know you mentioned, I think Bruce, you mentioned this and John.\nYou mentioned as well that if you.\nDid see weaker loan growth and weaker macro, you could see higher buybacks. Can you just maybe help frame that? Like if we do see weaker loan growth and a weaker economy, would you conversely maybe be more cautious and therefore maybe husband more capital versus step up buybacks. Can you just talk about how you view that trade off? Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll go ahead and start there. I mean we're committed to that range that we articulated at 10.50 to 10.75. If there's less RWA, then we would feel opportunistically, you know, a willingness to step up on the buyback side of things. The reason for that is a couple fold. I think the starting point on capital is very strong both before and after AOCI. You look at our AOCI haircut, we're still north of 9%, which is quite a good number.\nWe would also have to look at what the uncertainty would hold. If you look at our reserve position that we've already set aside, we actually have a recessionary scenario already contemplated in our port provision and loan loss reserve situation. From that standpoint, I think that we could see a number of scenarios throughout 2025 that would be consistent with continuing to be able to upside buybacks in the face of lower loan growth.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWhat I would add to that is if you go back to 2024, we also had a pickup in growth that would build over the course of the year. When that did not happen, we basically used the freed up capital to buy back our shares, and we thought our shares were very attractive. I'd say given kind of the crack in bank stock prices since the macro uncertainty and the rollout of the tariffs, we still feel that the stock is cheap relative to inherent value. It presents a real opportunity to offset any impact that would hit in the P&L from slower loan growth if that happened through buying back our stock and buying it back at very attractive pricing.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI just hasten to add, as we keep growing our tangible book value per share, the earn backs on buying back stock at these levels is well under a year, and so it's pretty attractive. We would feel good for all those reasons stated.\n\n[Analyst] (Evercore ISI)\n\nAnalyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ken Usdin from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\nGuys.\nI wonder if you could talk through that push and pull on the capital.\nMarkets outlook and the fee guide. I guess first of all, you.\nKnow, the record pipeline, what's your level of confidence in terms of closing those transactions? I guess secondly, if that capital markets embedded expectation doesn't pull through, how do we understand like the comp ratio offset and the magnitude of flex that.\nYou can have to keep PP&R close to in line?\nThanks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll start and then maybe John or Don can follow on. Again, I think that the exciting aspect of this from our standpoint is that we've over time built out really strong capital markets capability and a very broad M&A capability that covers middle market companies through mid corporate, and specializes in industry verticals that we think are going to be active. The fact that there's pent-up demand from sponsors to do deals, and there are industry sectors that are very active, for example, data centers where we have a really strong group of folks focusing there, I'd say it's heartening to see that we've got record numbers of engagements. Our people are working very actively, and on a probability assessment, none of these deals have dropped. I think we're just waiting to see some of this uncertainty subside.\nWe still feel optimistic that things will settle down here a little bit and that we should be able to pull that through. What I would say, if that is not the case and things do push out a bit, there are other things to consider. One is that we're broadly diversified, so we've had the ability to, if one area doesn't fire on all cylinders, like if M&A is soft, then oftentimes our financing, our syndicated loan capability, our debt underwriting will pick up and provide an offset. The FX and interest rate derivatives and commodities hedging risk management business also is seeing an uptick in activity, and depending on the circumstances, that could provide an offset. The first line of defense is kind of diversity within the fees that could help offset any pushout on M&A volumes.\nThere is obviously incentive compensation that would drop if the deals do not deliver. Just broader, looking at the expense base, we are constantly working on ways to streamline our businesses and perfect how we are running the bank to make it more efficient. We have a top 10 program up and running, but we are certainly not content with that given all of the opportunities we see around new technologies like AI and ways to deploy that to run the bank better and serve our customers better. I would say that would be the broad playbook. Maybe for color on the revenues, Don, you might want to add anything there.\n\nDon McCree\n\nVice Chairman and Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I just echo a couple things that Bruce just said. One is I'm really encouraged by the diversity of the franchise and the people that we continue to add. Actually, we're continuing to hire really strong talent into some of our industry teams, which provides an ability to continue to transact in the market. I also want to remind people that a significant part of our M&A business in particular is mid-sized companies coming out of our core franchise. They continue to have a really strong desire to sell and transact. A lot of those go into private equity. The other thing I'd say is that the financing markets are generally pretty attractive. We can get these things financed, and they're not $10 billion deals, they're $100, $200, $300 million deals. They're eminently executable.\nOne of the things that's been interesting is, and you would ask the question of why are these things pushing, part of it's due to the de-staffing of the FTC and the SEC. It's just taking longer to get these transactions done. I think the most important thing that Bruce said is we have not lost one mandate out of the pipeline. It's not as if these transactions are going away, they're just taking a little bit longer to execute. I'm super confident that we're going to be able to get these things across the finish line, whether it's the second quarter or third.\nQuarter, we'll have to see.\nSome of it will be volatility. There is very little tariff dependency in any of these underlying deals. The big picture is we should generate the revenue, and hopefully my bonuses aren't going to go down by year end. Chris will do that to me as he's done in the past, if that does happen.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJohn, anything to add?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would just highlight the diversity point that you made. Just on the expense side, I mean we would. In an environment like that, you get the direct offset that you mentioned on incentives, and then you take a harder look at some discretionary stuff that we also touched on before. More broadly, just feeling like the net interest income story is just a number of great tailwinds that are part of why we feel good about the guy for 2025 as well. Okay.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nThanks for all that.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, Ken.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nGood morning. I was wondering, just looking at interest.\nRates, which have been extremely volatile, it.\nSeems like the forward curve changes daily.\nCan you talk about what the.\nIdeal interest rate environment is for Citizens and yield curve and conversely, what type of rate environment kind of would put the NIM outlook potentially at risk? Are there any plans to reduce some of the asset sensitivity?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, good questions there. I mean, out the window our asset sensitivity is ±1% to a ±100 basis point change in a gradual shift in the yield curve up or down over the next 12 months. We are slightly asset sensitive. Yeah, we're close to neutral based on just how those numbers are playing out. I'd say that first and foremost, the net interest margin trajectory is primarily not rate dependent. You've got the time-based benefits that are really driving net interest margin both in the near term and over time.\nFor example, in the first quarter we had about five basis points of time based benefits. Given the slight asset sensitivity and seasonally lower deposits, that's why we ended up at 3 basis points of net interest margin growth in the first quarter. When you look out to the second quarter, again, we're going to get about five basis points of time based benefit and better balance sheet trends. That's why all of that drops to the bottom line, and really that momentum continues to build not only through 2025, but out into 2026 and 2027. We have in our slide deck illustration of the fact that by the time you get to the fourth quarter of 2027, the cumulative time based benefit is 35 basis points.\nIf you add that to the 290 that we delivered in the first quarter, we're already at the lower end of the range without having to deal with interest rates. From there, the rest of the story that takes us into our range of 325 to 350. You would also look at fixed asset repricing, which really is more about long end rates. There's a lot of baked in turnover of the balance sheet given coming out of the lower rate environment that we're in in the pandemic. You got 15 to 20 basis points there, and now we can talk about rates. We're pretty well hedged from a swaps standpoint in through, you know, out through the middle of 2027. Yes, we will do a little better if rates are higher.\nYou know, if rates are, you know, the terminal rate out the window appears to be around 3.50%, that's a good outcome for us, and that would put us in the middle of our range. Higher rates, you know, terminal rates like 4% would be consistent with the upper end of our range of around 3.50%. We could tolerate as low as 3% on fed funds or even a touch lower and still hold the low end of our range at 3.25%. We are basically comfortable with a wide range of scenarios on rates. We feel pretty well hedged, with a slight orientation towards performing a little better a couple of years out if rates are a little higher, and we think about inflation and stagflationary scenarios when we think about positioning the balance sheet that way.\nThe objective of trying to have a lot of non-rate related tailwinds is something that you need to think about when you think about our recovery on net interest margin.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nThat's great.\nThanks, John. If I could ask, just kind of a follow up to Ken's question.\nYou talked about the puts and takes with this uncertain environment, but could you just give an update on the positive operating leverage for the full year versus January's forecast of 150.\nJust.\nI realize there's all this uncertainty, but just wondering how you're thinking about it.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we think we're, you know, we're reaffirming that outlook. You know, we believe that that's very achievable around the $150, and a big driver of that, again, back to net interest margin. We see net interest margin rising by about, you know, rising to 3.05 - 3.10 by the end of the year. That implies about a 15 basis point increase in net interest margin year-over-year. That's pretty powerful on the NII line, and therefore that 3% to 5% NII is a huge driver of our positive operating leverage, and we feel good about that. You know, we talked earlier about the diversity on the capital markets and fee line broadly, and how our pipelines are consistent with being able to deliver the guide with some levers to pull if certain scenarios play out.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would add to that that.\nYou know, in 2024, most banks, including ourselves, were very tight on expenses, and 2025, we're inflating a little bit. The guide was for roughly 4% expense growth, and that reflects the fact that there's lots of great things for us to invest in as we build out the franchise here. Things like making sure we're adding to the private bank, we're adding private wealth teams, we're opening private bank offices, we're investing in AI and various projects, data analytics capability, there's our payments capability. There are things that we want to keep investing in to position us for that medium-term growth outlook. In a tougher environment, we can throttle some of those things a little bit. Our preference is to not do that, to keep investing and keep building.\nJust kind of putting that in context, there are some levers to pull, preferences to keep going, make those investments for the future. We can pull back a little bit if need be. The other structural benefit that we do have as well on the private bank, keep in mind that the majority of that cost base was compensation guarantees. As the team is productive and we have confidence in hitting our revenue outlook, that revenue is gobbling up existing expenses and compensation, not necessarily adding to it. It's operating leverage, right? Operating leverage right there naturally, versus last year, which we have a lot of confidence to move the revenue outlook. That should be a structural advantage for us too. Great point, Brendan,\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst for Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you. You've alluded to this and how you've responded to all the questions, particularly the PPNR one. As you know, the net interest income outlook is quite important. As I pull up the slide from last quarter, it said up 3% to 5%. If I think about affirming.\nThe.\nExit NIM on slide 21, and then the balance sheet seems to be fairly in line, at least average earning assets were in line this quarter. Unless we think that the balance sheet will shrink, it seems like that up 3% - 5% is still broadly in line in terms of what you're affirming. Just wanted to confirm that in terms of the full year look.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, you've got that right.\nErica.\nSean, that three to five feels pretty good. If you just think about NIM alone, that would take us to the upper end of that range. What we indicated in the guide was that, at least back in January, we might have interest earning assets down about 1%, which is what put us into the middle of the range. There's some, you know, there's some flexibility there. You know, when you think about relative value in the securities portfolio and what we're seeing in deposit flows, which are actually coming in a little better than we expected, you know there are, there's another lever there with respect to interest earning assets in the securities book that we'll be monitoring throughout the year. Net interest margin trends exactly as expected.\nFeeling very good about that with some levers to pull even in the securities portfolio and on interest earning assets, if relative value looks attractive and deposit flows continue the way they've been going. That's the way we think about that. Three to five.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst for Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nThank you. Switching topics on the reserve, this is a two-part question. Number one, just a broad question here: what unemployment rate is your reserve sort of looking forward to? Second, John, could you talk through the dynamics that's perhaps unique to Citizens about the non-core runoff? As we think about perhaps the baseline case of unemployment potentially getting worse or the company weighting the downside case more, what is sort of the offset of the $1.9 billion student loan sale and the runoff portfolio? Obviously, the commercial real estate portfolio has been, you've been resolving parts of that for some time now. Walk us through those two dynamics as we think about how to think about the provision from here, as we think about perhaps a more uncertain economic backdrop, but also a specific optimization of your loan mix.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll hit both of those and others may chime in here. We have a number of scenarios that get applied to different parts of the portfolio. Our base baseline scenario has an unemployment rate of 5.1%. That covers a large portion of our book, primarily in C&I and in retail. When you get into the CRE portfolio, that 5.1% is paired with a decline in GDP, which would imply a mild recession. A majority of the book has a mild recession associated with it. When you think about the CRE book overall, we have a combination of a moderate to severe recession assumption applied to CRE, and the unemployment assumption there is higher than 5.1%. On a weighted average basis, you'd end up with an unemployment rate that's above 5.1%.\nI mean, just as an example, our general office portfolio has a severe recessionary scenario with an unemployment rate of 9.3% and a GDP decline of 4.4%. Just giving you a sense that generally it's something higher than 5.1%. That's why I think what we're saying is that a lot of the uncertainty and concern about recession for 2025 we feel like is mostly baked into our allowance. I mean, we'll be monitoring it, we're keeping an eye on it, and we're watching charge-off trends coming down in line with our expectations. That all feels very good. On the credit side.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJohn, you might.\nHave the number on the top of your head, but Erika, we had, we're about 1.61% in terms of the allowance to loans. Kind of the day one CECL was on an adjusted basis if you adjust it down first for the Investors deal and then for the actions we're taking in non-core. What is that number?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\n25 -130.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\n125-ish. Yeah, in that ballpark. Anyway, we feel that over time we've continued to improve the focus on kind of where we want to lend. We want to lend to deep relationships. In commercial, we've been moving more up market so that 80% of the C&I portfolio is now investment grade equivalent. In the retail book, 95% of the book is super prime and high prime. 78% of the retail book is secured. Homeowners are the ones that we're lending on an unsecured basis. Two thirds of the borrowers are homeowners, which tend to have a better credit profile. We have a bunch of those stats back on pages 24, 25, and 26. The CRE portfolio, we've taken a lot of the pain there already. The pigs have been going through the Python, so to speak.\nWe feel that we're well reserved for different scenarios that could ensue over the course of the year. Yeah.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nTo the other point, question you had, Erika, regarding non-core rundown, I mean, I think you can kind of pair in some respects, I mean, certainly the balance sheet fungible, but you can sort of think about non-core and private bank in some respects together because we're taking a lot of that liquidity and capital and down in the non-core space, but we're growing in private bank and in commercial. On the private bank, we have a year-end target on the loan side that is similar to the rundown in non-core that's being accelerated in 2025. What you're seeing is pulling back on lower customer value assets in the non-core space, growing high customer attractive RWA in private bank, in commercial, and in core retail.\nThe engine here is humming along really well and probably a little faster than we expected given our opportunistic transaction.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "When we set up non-core, that was roughly, broad numbers, $10 billion running down in the consumer runoff portfolio and $10 billion running up in the private bank. By the way, the credit quality in the private bank, I mean, the group that came over from First Republic had virtually no credit losses, and so far we've had no credit losses in that book. You can't say that will always be the case, but it's very, very high credit quality. That alone is going to average down the net charge-off ratio through the cycle to something in the low to mid-30s from something that had been kind of higher-30s to low-40s. Brendan, you want to add anything there? Just a couple of quick stats maybe just to build on your points.\nOn private banking, we have zero customers that are in delinquency or criticized right now. To John's point, we're replacing the non-core rundown with that quality of asset. The other thing to make note of on non-core, which is seasoned now and in rundown with no new originations coming through with auto, as the portfolio gets more seasoned, you have the dynamic of you drive the car up a lot and it immediately reprices down and you're upside down a little bit on LTV until pay downs happen. The portfolio is a couple of years seasoned. We feel pretty good that we've got our arms around loss content. It shouldn't be hypersensitive to unemployment unless there's a really significant event in the market. That should be stable, and we feel good about the quality there.\nJust on the retail book, to everybody's point, 79% of it on the core side is residential secured. On the home equity book, 99% is below 80% CLTV. On the mortgage book, 51%. There's very, very little lost content there unless there's a significant housing market correction, which obviously we're not seeing a high chance of. When you unpack the unsecured book, while over time we'd like to have more exposure to credit card, right now we're undersized on credit card, and that's a good thing if there's an unemployment spike. On the student book, 98% is cosigned by the parent on in school, and 40% of our student loan refinancing book is with folks with advanced degrees, which are less sensitive to spikes in unemployment.\nWhen you net all that together, I feel like on a relative basis we should be in a very strong spot if there's a blip in unemployment.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst for Large Cap Banks and Consumer Finance, UBS\n\nVery thorough, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Deutsche Bank)\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. A couple of follow ups on fee revenue categories. The service charges were quite strong year-over-year. You mentioned cash management, which I think is pretty straightforward, and then also overdraft. Just elaborate on the overdraft. Is it increased frequency and why you think that is? Were there some pricing changes or what drove that component?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, most of the service charge numbers actually in cash management and business banking is seeing really strong growth with some technology investments that we've made in the consumer business to drive stickier, engaged customers. By the way, that's also showing up in our low-cost deposit trend. The increases that we're seeing are largely driven by healthy fee creation versus punitive, which we are very, very pleased with. Our overdraft line has obviously been on a downward slide for a decade, and it's now relatively stable. We've not made any pricing changes. While the mass market population is generally back to paycheck to paycheck, they are in fact pretty stable. We're not seeing any behavior in that base. Spending trends are still strong, but stable.\nWe're not seeing anything in that base that would suggest a breakout of economic stress yet, which obviously would be tied to an increase in overdraft fees too. We feel like that's going to.\nBe kind of range bound.\nHopefully, the growth that we see will be in the positive fee creation through customer advice and services that we provide, largely in cash management. Overdraft is in a range, obviously. I'm sure you all saw the court case that is out there on overdraft, and the House and the Senate both signed off on eliminating the rule from the CFPB. We also think the risk that potentially exists in the back half of the year about that may be coming down is de minimis at this point, headed to the President's desk for signature. Anyway, overdraft is stable, not growing, not really decreasing in any material way.\n\n[Analyst] (Deutsche Bank)\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, that's helpful. In credit card, they were down obviously versus Q4 on seasonal trends, but also down a little bit year-over-year when they were trying to grow it. Is that just the cost of rewards and upfront sign-ons, or what's driving?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThat drop on a year-over-year basis? Yeah, we have, there's been a little bit of our prior expansion activity. We.\nWe're doing with credit card.\nWe've paused for a short period of time while we launched new products in May and June. We're very, very excited about a couple of new products that are coming.\nOut late spring into the summer.\nCustomer spending trends have been broadly stable for a bit here, and we're expecting that to get back into growth mode. As you probably remember, going back 18 months, some of the growth in credit card and debit card fees were structural, related to the MasterCard arrangement that we did. That really drove some net positive fee growth to the bottom line. As we generate more spending activity and grow the net portfolio in cards in the back half of the year, we expect that line to continue to modestly grow.\n\n[Analyst] (Deutsche Bank)\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi Bruce.\nHi John.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nHey Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGuys, can you share with us as.\nA follow up to your comments on the non-core loan portfolio and in view of the sale of the stock, the non-core student loans, can you give us the pros and cons of selling the entire portfolio that you outlined on slide 16?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll take that. John, you can chime in, but you know, I think that there's relatively high predictability in terms of the runoff of auto, which is basically what's left. Should we want to accelerate that sale, there's going to be a liquidity cost that has to be paid. Our view is since this is short duration paper, it runs off predictably. It runs off fast. The duration of the paper is roughly two years, that we're better off preserving the capital and not incurring that liquidity cost, if you will.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, agreed. We've got very strong capital and liquidity, so there's no need to accelerate it beyond the accelerated rundown. I mean, if you look in Q4 2025, by the end of this year, the entire book is going to be down to $2.6 billion. You know, $1.5 billion of that is, or a little more than $1.5 billion, about $1.7 billion or so, is sitting in an auto-collateralized structure anyway and therefore wouldn't be able to be sold. That's sort of ring-fenced and just runs down on its own. You're basically under $1 billion by the end of the year from the round trip from the beginning of this journey in terms of running down non-core. This is going to be kind of in the rearview mirror very soon. From that standpoint, we think the transaction that we did was the accelerant.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThat was a longer lived asset with the bigger tail. To move that out really helps accelerate the whole rundown.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou know, who knows, maybe in the future there could be a cleanup, but it would be something that really would not have much of an impact given that it is at such a low profile by the end of the year anyway.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, thank you. As a follow up, obviously your credit, you've got it under control, and you talk very thoroughly about the office commercial real estate portfolio and the challenges there. I noticed in the C&I portfolio, and I know the numbers are not large and it could be the lower loan numbers that one or two loans going non-accrual will push the number up. In slide 28, you do give us that breakdown of non-accruals. Can you give us some color on the C&I portfolio? The uptick again wasn't material in nominal levels. What are you guys seeing in C&I, especially in view of your outlook of the uncertainty we're all confronting with this economy?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, maybe just to start off on 28, that's the allowance is really, you know, when you see those numbers go up, that's really us being a bit, a touch more conservative with respect to areas that, you know, we're seeing. That makes sense to flow additional allowance.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOver to the non-accrual though. I think, I think that you're talking about the 0.57% going up to the 0.65%. Correct.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nIt's small.\nI understand small, but I'm just curious. Yeah,\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think that's just the law of kind of small numbers in terms of if you have one thing move into non-accrual as we work through some issues, that can make modest adjustments from quarter to quarter there, but nothing really to call out, I think.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes, Gerard, I'll just jump in. We're seeing no macro deterioration, C&I people.\nYou know, I go back to what.\nI've said for a couple years now people really tighten their belts during COVID, both from a debt standpoint and an efficiency standpoint. That's going to help them go through any kind of uncertainty that we have. We see no broad trends of deterioration at all in our C&I book.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou know, I would say it's more a question of, you know, they're in good position, and they've positioned themselves to be resilient and adaptable to the environment. To me, the bigger question is when, how much offense do they want to play? The macro actually holds them back from further growth in their businesses, and that potentially affects loan demand or deal activity. I don't really view it as any kind of material credit risk. In fact, when you look at the sectors that we lend to, we don't have huge exposure to the sectors that are most exposed to tariffs. In general, we feel really that this is more an issue about how much offense comes out of the customer base, as opposed to are we worried about credit deterioration.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from FEbrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning. Just two very quick follow up questions. John, maybe for you. Not sure if I missed when we look at your fee income guidance, you talked about the capital markets pipeline. What are we assuming for capital markets just from a fee revenue standpoint for second quarter and for the full year? If you don't mind sharing that.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we have it right. It's a driver, and it's, I think I'd go back to the diversification points that we said earlier. I think we've got, you know, in the capital markets we've got M&A certainly as part of the story, but there's loan syndications, some equity capital markets opportunities, and you heard Bruce earlier talk about client hedging that are all contributing to the second quarter as well as the full year, and then don't.\nWe're also, you know, focused on the fact that on the consumer side of the house, card and wealth are also expected to be contributing in Q2 and in 2025 as well. We haven't broken down the details separately from fees in Q2 or 2025.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, it's a material driver to the 8% to 10% growth we had for the year in the original year guide, and then in the second quarter lift that we have. I would say the level of the capital markets activity to me is why we have a little bit wider range in the second quarter fee guides. We still think we'll see a nice bounce off of Q1 levels, but we'll have to wait and see how that plays out. I think the broader point John just made about diversity and, you know, when one thing is a little soft, we have enough levers that, you know, I think we're pretty confident that we'll be able to find offsets at capital markets. It's a bit sluggish.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nGot it. I guess maybe just to follow up on the margin outlook, when you have the margin for the end of the year, end of 2026, can you remind us what the fed funds rate underpinning that is? I appreciate sort of the time sensitivity of what the NIM does, but what's the fed funds rate? If we get 100 basis points of fed funds cut, let's say between now and year end, does that create some downside risk to the 2025, 2026 outlooks or not?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'd say as I mentioned, we're pretty well hedged. We've got, you know, we've got—when you look out the window, there's a—sorry, starting over. We said two cuts in January, but out the window maybe there's three, but that third cut happens late in the fourth quarter, number one.\nNumber two, we are close to neutral from an asset sensitivity perspective. That 305 - 310 feels very good and very comfortable with respect to delivering that range. The terminal rate of about 350 getting out into 2026 and 2027 puts us into the middle of our 325 - 350 net interest margin range. You'll see on the slide there in the back where we articulate that outlook. 2026, also just one other thing to add in case there's any follow ups, you know, the net interest margin growth in 2025 is very comfortable and we feel good about it. It maybe implies about 15 basis points year-over-year. 2026 is a significant amount of tail ends associated with some accelerating trends, and much of the time-based benefit actually really starts to kick in in 2026.\nThat's something to keep an eye on also.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nManaging Director and Head of North American Banks Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Manav Saldia from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nJust a couple of quick follow up questions. One was on loan growth. Can you talk about how much of the loan growth over the past year has come from NBFI loans and how you're thinking about the credit risk of that portfolio?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean, I'll start off and Don may add in here. I mean, we do have exposure like many of our peers do into the NBFI space. It's part of our, the ecosystem of interacting in the private credit space and the private capital construct that we do a very good job of covering. I would say that I'd hasten to add that the credit exposure for the places where we play is very low. You think about the kind of interactions that we do in whether it's business credit intermediaries or in the private equity space.\nThat credit profile has been very low over time.\n\nDon McCree\n\nVice Chairman and Head of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I agree with that.\nThe growth hasn't been massive in terms of actually adding exposure.\nWe've seen a little bit of growth.\nDue to higher utilization, you see that coming through in the numbers a little bit. We very much like the structures that we have in place, both for the private equity complex and the private credit complex. They're both kind of investment grade like in terms of their credit profile, so very low losses, very strong structures, ABs kind of structures, particularly in private credit. We feel very good about those exposures. The other important thing is, back to everything we're doing in the NBFI space, it's about a broad relationship. We're doing more, multiple different things with each of the people that we're lending to. It's not as if we're going out there and building a loan book. We're doing M&A with a lot of these complexes.\nWe're actually distributing some of the private credit funds into our private bank and wealth management areas now. There's a lot of different relationship orientation, and we're very selective in terms of the underlying clients that will actually bank.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I would just add two other points of color. One is that the definitions for this category are changing a little bit, and some exposures that might not have been considered NBFI are now getting pushed into that a little bit. It's hard to do long period of time straight apples to apples comparisons, but I think once we get through the reclassification process, then going forward, have more continuity in those forecasts. The other thing is that where we are growing somewhat is in the private bank, and that's a little bit of a different kind of complementary perspective to some of the bigger funds that Don's folks are covering.\nBrendan, I don't know if you want to add that, but we're making capacity there for kind of PE and VC funds where we know those firms extremely well, and we want to be the bank to the fund complex and the partners of those firms. That's really good business. That was always really good business at First Republic, and we're growing that business here. The credit structures, as Donn mentioned, we believe are well structured with incredibly low risk, one-year subscription lines. The duration of it, if there's anything that we see that is worrisome, we can move on pretty quickly.\nWe also, in the private bank, won't.\nDo the credit unless we have their operating cash management relationship. A very deep relationship with the firm with strong underwriting, then eyes all over cash flows and the whole community that we're banking. We feel good about the exposure.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYep, very helpful. As my follow up just on the non-core loan sale in the first quarter, how should we think about the benefit to NIM from that sale?\nI know the year-end NIM guide.\nIs relatively unchanged, so I was wondering if there's some offsets there, if there's a higher probability that you can hit the higher end of that guide?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we had anticipated that we would have an opportunity to accelerate in 2025, so that was included in the January guide broadly. The 305 - 310 is already incorporated this sale.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou may recall that on the first quarter call I hinted that we were working on acceleration. We were pretty far down the track that we would get something done. When we had the guide, we had assumed that. It's not that dramatic of a lift to NIM, but we'll pick up basis points here and there. It all adds up and builds our path towards hitting those year end numbers, those fourth quarter numbers.\n\n[Analyst] (Morgan Stanley)\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nPerfect, thank you. Okay.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAll right, well, I think that brings us to the end of the call. Thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your continued interest and support. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the Citizens Financial Group First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We were pleased to finish the year with a strong quarter as our financial results reflect good sequential revenue growth led by NIM expansion and capital markets fees, positive operating leverage, favorable credit trends, and a robust balance sheet across capital, liquidity, and LDR. We are still seeing subdued loan demand, though we've more than compensated for that with 10 basis points of NIM expansion that drove sequential NII growth of 3%. Fees grew sequentially by 6%, paced by capital markets and mortgage, while expense growth was 3.5%, paced by hiring in Private Bank, Private Wealth, and Commercial Middle Market.\nWe still delivered positive operating leverage of around 50 basis points. Our credit trends are looking favorable, with NPAs down sequentially, criticized assets trending down, and no surprises in charge offs as we work through our CRE office portfolio. Given these trends and the contraction in loan balances, we added $162 million to our provision against $189 million in charge offs, and our ACL to loan ratio increased slightly to 1.62%.\nWe currently expect that the credit trends should continue, and that we should be able to see credit costs come down in 2025. We continued to repurchase shares in the quarter, $225 million, bringing the full year total to $1.05 billion. We repurchased 28 million shares in 2024, or 6% of the beginning of year balance. With respect to execution of our key initiatives, we made further progress across the Private Bank.\nOur New York City Metro strategy, serving private capital and growing our payments business, VSO efforts saw a reduction in non-core loans of $4.2 billion in 2024 with a remaining balance of $6.9 billion. We are looking for opportunities to accelerate the rundown, so stay tuned on that. In addition, we made further progress in exiting low-returning relationships in C&I and in reducing overall CRE loans. Our Top Nine Program was executed well, delivering $150 million in annualized Q4 run rate benefits, and we've launched Top 10 with a target benefit of $100 million.\nThe Private Bank, Private Wealth progress is worth spotlighting. The business continues to ramp up nicely, growing the customer base, and hitting all financial targets. We reached $7 billion in deposits, $3.1 billion in loans, and $4.7 billion in AUM, and we were profitable in the quarter. We are confident in our ability to meet or exceed our goal of having this business be 5% accretive to our bottom line in 2025. We added a banking team to Southern California in Q4, and this morning we announced an additional wealth team in South Florida for the full year 2024.\nWe hit most line items in our beginning of year guide that's shown on slide 34, with the exception of balance sheet volume. That said, we were able to repurchase more shares given the lack of loan demand. Turning to our 2025 outlook, we expect solid growth in NII given further NIM expansion and a resumption of modest net loan growth. Fees should grow nicely, paced by capital markets and wealth. We have confidence in this revenue outlook, so we'll step up investments in OpEx and CapEx to support key growth initiatives.\nWe anticipate attractive, positive operating leverage for the full year of around 1.5%. Credit costs are projected to improve year on year, and we expect to see reserve releases continue throughout the year. We will manage our CET1 ratio above the high end of our 10% to 10.5% range given ongoing uncertainty, but we expect to continue with regular share repurchases. We've included some slides on our medium-term outlook and how the drag from our legacy swap portfolio will dissipate with time. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our medium-term 16% to 18% ROTCE target.\nExciting time for Citizens. Our strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best-positioned super regional commercial bank, and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We've made steady progress and will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline you've come to expect from us. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2024. We know we can count on you again this year, with that let me turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. As Bruce indicated, we delivered results in 2024 that were broadly in line with our expectations at the beginning of the year. Q3 was our trough quarter, Q4 was a nice bounce back, and we are well positioned for growth in 2025. On slide six, you can see that we delivered underlying EPS of $3.24 for 2024, which includes a $0.45 drag from non-core and a net $0.05 investment in the Private Bank. Full year ROTCE was 10.5%, which was 12% excluding these items.\nDespite loan volumes being lower than expected given market dynamics, net interest income came in broadly in line with our expectations for the year, down 9.7%, as we delivered a full year margin of 2.85%. Fees were up a strong 9%, led by a pickup in capital markets, card, and wealth fees, while expenses were managed tightly, up only 1.5%. Notwithstanding meaningful investments to support the build out of the Private Bank and Private Wealth, we also managed well through an uncertain credit environment, maintaining strong reserve coverage levels with credit losses coming right in line with our expectations at the start of the year.\nThe transformation of our deposit franchise since our IPO became clear in 2024 as we managed through a very competitive environment against the backdrop of rapidly rising rates. Our deposit cost performance was better than the peer average, a meaningful improvement compared with prior rate cycles, and with the latest Fed rate cuts, we have aggressively lowered deposit costs in Q4.\nImportantly, our financial strength has allowed us to execute well against our strategic initiatives, providing momentum as we head into 2025. We've opportunistically built out the Private Bank, which has raised $7 billion of deposits through the end of the year and, as expected, became profitable in the fourth quarter. We also continue to make solid progress building out our New York City Metro franchise. We are investing in our payments platform, and we are solidifying our Commercial Middle Market coverage with investments in key expansion markets that complement our Private Bank success.\nI'll start with some of the highlights of the fourth quarter financial results, referencing slides five and seven. Before we get into the details, we generated underlying net income of $412 million, EPS of $0.85, and ROTCE of 10.7%. This includes a negative $0.10 impact from the non-core portfolio, which will continue to steadily run off, creating a tailwind for overall performance going forward. As I mentioned, the Private Bank contributed to earnings in the fourth quarter, adding about a penny to EPS.\nImportantly, we returned to positive sequential operating leverage in the fourth quarter, with a nice lift in NII and fees, even as we made important investments in the Private Bank and Private Wealth, and added Commercial Middle Market bankers in key expansion markets. We ended the year in a very strong balance sheet position, with CET1 at 10.8%, or 9.1% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal, a pro forma Category I LCR of 119%, and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.62%, up from 1.61% in the prior quarter.\nThis includes a robust 12.4% coverage for General Office, up from 12.1% in the prior quarter. We also executed $225 million in stock buybacks during the quarter. Next, I'll talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide eight. NII was up 3.1% linked quarter, reflecting a higher net interest margin and slightly lower interest earning assets. As you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, our margin was up 10 basis points to 2.87%, reflecting the benefit of non-core runoff, fixed rate asset repricing, and better deposit and loan betas, partially offset by our net asset sensitive position.\nAs rates declined with the Fed cutting rates through the end of the year, we executed our down rate playbook, reducing rates ahead of the cuts and bringing down higher cost rates deposit balances. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit down beta was about 50% better than our initial expectation. Moving to slide nine, fees were up 5.6% linked quarter, primarily driven by an improvement in capital markets. Capital markets saw strong loan syndication activity and a pickup in M&A, which benefited from seasonality and a general improvement in the environment.\nDebt underwriting was lower, coming off a strong third quarter. Mortgage banking fees reflect higher MSR valuation, with overall operating results remaining stable. The wealth business delivered a solid quarter with good momentum in AUM growth from the private bank, but that was offset by lower transactional sales activity. On slide 10, expenses were up 3.5% linked quarter, primarily reflecting hiring for the private bank and private wealth buildout, and Commercial Middle Market bankers to complement our private bank footprint in Southern California and Florida.\nOur Top Nine Program achieved a $150 million pre-tax run rate benefit exiting the year, which is above our original target of $135 million. We have launched our Top 10 Program, which is targeting $100 million in run rate efficiencies by the end of 2025. On slide 11, average loans were down slightly, and period-end loans were down 1.7% linked quarter. This reflects the non-core portfolio runoff of approximately $900 million, a decline in commercial loans given paydowns in C&I and CRE against a backdrop of low client demand and lower line utilization. The Private Bank continues to make nice progress, with period-end loans up about $1.1 billion to $3.1 billion at the end of the year.\nNext, on slides 12 and 13, we continued to do a good job on deposits in a very competitive and dynamic environment. Period end deposits were broadly stable linked quarter, with attractive growth in retail and the private bank offset by the continued paydown of higher cost Treasury and commercial deposits. This was primarily tied to non-core loan rundown and a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits. The private bank continues to add customers and grow nicely, with period end deposits up about $1.4 billion to $7 billion at the end of the year.\nOur retail franchise did a nice job raising deposits this quarter in low cost categories, and importantly, we've seen strong retention as the CD portfolio turns over at lower rates. We also grew non-interest-bearing deposits by about $940 million. Linked quarter, driven by the private bank and seasonal flows in commercial combined, our non-interest-bearing and low cost deposits increased to 42% of total deposits in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs are down 31 basis points linked quarter, which translates to a 50% cumulative down beta. Moving to credit on slide 14, as expected, net charge-offs were broadly stable at 53 basis points compared with 54 basis points in the prior quarter. A decline in C&I charge-offs was offset by an increase in commercial real estate, primarily coming from the General Office portfolio.\nRetail charge-offs were stable. Of note, nonaccrual loans were down slightly, reflecting a decline in commercial, given the resolution of a number of General Office loans. Criticized loans were meaningfully lower in the fourth quarter. Following relative stability over the past few quarters, we continue to make consistent progress in working out the General Office portfolio, with limited new inflows into workout.\nTurning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 15, our overall coverage ratio increased slightly linked quarter to 1.62%, primarily reflecting the denominator effect of lower portfolio balances. While we maintain strong reserve coverage for certain portfolios such as General Office, our overall reserve declined slightly in light of a broadly stable macroeconomic outlook and improving loan mix given the runoff of non-core auto portfolio and originations in retail, real estate, secured, and commercial categories that have a lower loss content profile.\nThe reserve for the $2.9 billion General Office portfolio is $364 million, which represents a coverage of 12.4%, up from 12.1% in the third quarter as the portfolio continues to reduce. Note that the cumulative charge-offs plus the current reserve translates to an expected loss rate of about 20% against the March 2023 loan balance when industry losses commence.\nMoving to Slide 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio strengthened to 10.8%, which compares with 10.6% in the prior quarter. Adjusting for the AOCI opt out removal, our CET1 ratio was relatively steady at 9.1% despite the impact of higher long-term interest rates on AOCI in the quarter. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased $225 million in common shares, and including dividends, we returned a total of $413 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter.\nOver the full year, we repurchased $1.05 billion in common shares, representing 28.1 million, or about 6% of our beginning of year outstanding shares, at an average price of $37.35 per share. Turning to Slide 17, we view our overall strategy in three parts. A transformed consumer bank, the best positioned commercial bank amongst our regional peers, and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned Private Bank and Private Wealth franchise.\nSlides 18 to 20 provide some updates on our positioning and progress, which you can read at your convenience. Note on slide 20, we've updated our Private Bank targets for 2025. Given the success we've had to date, we bumped deposits from $11 billion to $12 billion, and AUM from $10 billion to $11 billion. We adjusted loans to $7 billion. Given the impact of higher rates on borrowing demand, we are tracking well to meet or exceed our 5% accretion estimate to Citizens' bottom line in 2025.\nOn slide 21, we provide an update on some of the tremendous progress in New York since we made a play there about three years ago with HSBC's East Coast branches and Investors Bank. Moving to slide 22, I will take you through our full year 2025 outlook, which contemplates a forward curve with two Fed cuts, one in Q2 and the other in Q4, ending the year with a Fed funds rate of 4% and a 10-year treasury rate of 4.5% to 4.75%. We expect NII to be up 3% to 5%, driven primarily by an increase in NIM to about 3% for the year.\nWe project spot loan growth in the low single digits overall and mid single digits excluding non-core. Loan growth will be impacted by non-core runoff, pay downs, and more selective originations in CRE and muted commercial loan demand early in 2025. We expect C&I to pick up in the second half of the year as new money gets put to work. Private banks should see consistent loan growth throughout the year. We expect average loans will be down roughly 2% to 3%, and overall earning assets to be down about 1%, which reflects the extent of the H2 2024 drop and continuing non-core runoff.\nNon-interest income is expected to be up in the 8% to 10% range, led by capital markets and wealth. We are projecting expenses to be up about 4%, as we are confident in our revenue outlook and want to step up our investments and growth initiatives after a constrained 2024. Excluding the private bank and private wealth, the increase in expenses will be about 2.6%. We have provided a walk showing the key components of our 2025 expense outlook on Slide 23.\nWhen you put the revenue and expense outlook together, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage for 2025, roughly 150 basis points. Our outlook for net charge offs is to trend down to approximately $650 million to $700 million, or high 40s in basis point terms. We will continue to work through the General Office portfolio, and given macro trends, the remixing of the balance sheet, and expectations for modest spot portfolio growth, we will likely see ACL releases over the course of the year. Finally, we expect to end the year with a strong CET1 ratio in the 10.5% to 10.75% range, which is above our medium-term operating range of 10% to 10.5%.\nGiven the continued uncertainty in the macro environment, as we monitor the market environment and loan growth levels, we will opportunistically engage in share repurchases. It's worth noting that loan growth was below expectations in 2024, and we were able to offset the impact through share repurchases and less pressure on deposit costs. We would use the same playbook in 2025 if needed. On slide 25, we provide the guide for the first quarter. Note that the first quarter has seasonal impacts on revenue, namely capital markets fees, lower day count reducing net interest income, and taxes on FICA reset and compensation payouts impacting expenses.\nCredit trends are expected to improve, and we should end the first quarter with CET1 in the range of 10.5% to 10.75%, with a good amount of share repurchases. Moving to slides 27 to 28, as we look out over the medium term, we have a clear path to achieving our 16% to 18% ROTCE target.\nExpanding our net interest margin is an important part of improving our ROTCE, which we project to be in the 3.25% to 3.5% range in 2027. However, given our balance sheet positioning and our asset sensitivity, if the Fed maintains an elevated Fed Funds rate at or above 4%, this will help to deliver a NIM level at the upper end of our range or higher. On slide 28, we provide a walk to our target 16% to 18% ROTCE. We have significant NII tailwind driven by non-rate dependent terminated swaps, amortization, and non-core runoff, which will generate about 300 to 400 basis points of ROTCE through 2027.\nWe add roughly another 100 basis points with the net impact of other dynamics, such as positive fixed asset repricing, the runoff of legacy active swaps, and the offsetting impact of our naturally asset sensitive balance sheet.\nThat puts you into the 15% to 16% range. We expect to generate solid returns from our legacy core business plus the successful execution of the Private Bank and other key initiatives I talked about earlier, which should drive meaningful revenue growth, generate positive annual operating leverage, and improve our efficiency ratio, which will add another 200 to 300 basis points of ROTCE. We should see some benefit from credit, where we have been over-providing today versus a more normal environment, with charge-offs improving to the low to mid-30s basis points, reflective of the improved mix of the portfolio with less auto and CRE and more Private Bank loans in C&I.\nAOCI impacts are providing a ROTCE benefit today, which should normalize with time. This impact will be partially offset with share repurchases. In short, we feel very confident in our ability to achieve the 16% to 18% medium term target. To wrap up, we delivered a solid performance in 2024, broadly in line with expectations. Importantly, we turned the quarter on net interest margin, delivered improving capital markets results, and remained disciplined on expenses, returning to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter.\nWe ended the year with a strong capital, liquidity, and credit position. That puts us in an excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities. We are well positioned for 2025, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our medium term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I'll hand it over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, John. Ivy, let's open it up for some Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the question and answer portion of the call. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please unmute your phone, press star one, and record your name clearly when prompted. If you need to withdraw your question at any time, you may press star two. Again, that is star one to ask a question. Our first question will come from Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Let's see, John, maybe wanted to start on sort of that medium-term margin outlook. Can you just sort of add some additional context on what gave you the confidence to bump up the top end.\nOf that medium term range, to basically the extra error between the 340 and the 350 at the top end of the range, please?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes, sure. I think the main reason for that is just the outlook on rates. I'd say that when you think about where we were last quarter and in prior quarters, you know, the Fed was landing in a terminal, you know, rate that was well below 4% when we put this together previously. Now when you see the Fed, you see the bond market discounting something closer to 4%.\nWe've basically widened the expectation of range that you could see at the upper end. So 3% would be, you know, sort of consistent with our floor of 3.25%, but 4%, given our asset sensitive balance sheet, would be more consistent with a higher number than the 340 we showed last quarter. You may recall last quarter we said that, hey, a 3.50 or 3.75 Fed would be consistent with 340.\nNow the Fed, you know, could land somewhere near 4%. That's the main reason why we raised that. I think there are other reasons too. I mean, just getting, you see the confidence. We have a growing confidence based on our performance in the fourth quarter with a very solid 10 basis point increase in NIM. We've continued to opportunistically hedge funds to reduce the impact of rates falling into the future. Just a number of positive benefits that we were able to see that gave us the confidence to increase the upper end to 350.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGotcha. Perfect. Thank you for that.\nWas something you could help to put in a little bit more context, sort of the higher fourth quarter costs.\nInvestments and we certainly understand them in light of what you're building with the Private Bank.\nMaybe curious about where you stand such that you're confident that cost.\nCan hold more firm after that small additional lift that we would expect in the first quarter.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean I would say we put something in the slide deck there on slide 23 that you can take a look at. I mean I think in Q4 for the full year. In Q4, you know, we've been investing in the Private Bank all along, and just given how well that's performed, that gave us the confidence to continue to invest and maybe accelerate some investments in the Private Bank through team advisor lift outs and also in the commercial bank where we're investing in our capabilities in Southern California and Florida. A combination of those two things is what caused our expense number to be up a bit in Q4 and A. Maybe Bruce will.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'd also just add to that, Scott, for the full year we were still on our guide range of 1 to 1.5. What I would say is that 2024, given some of the built-in revenue trajectory, was a year where I think all banks, including ourselves, had to be very, very disciplined on expenses. When you start to see that revenue is improving, the revenue outlook is improving, which we saw that occurring in Q4, and we can see more visibility into revenue strength into next year, then some of the things that you maybe deferred that are really attractive investment cases, you start to lean in again a bit. We started that process a bit in Q4. When you look at next year, we'll be guiding to about 4%.\nIf you strip out the impact of Private Bank and Private Wealth, which we want to continue to, there's a great opportunity there to fill that void in the market. We want to keep disciplined investing into that. The rest of the bank is down at roughly 2.5%, and the top program usually provides about a 1% benefit. We're leaning in a little bit across some attractive investment opportunities across the rest of the bank, but still the overall numbers are kind of in a position where we should have quite a bit of confidence. We can deliver positive operating leverage in 2025. Perfect.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right, thank you very much.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes, hi, good morning. We just wanted to think about some of the dynamics that are more strategic than mechanical on the margin improvement. John, give us a sense in terms of how you're thinking about deposit growth, the mix of that deposit growth, and also sort of what the repricing cadence looks like. Given that the neutral rate seems to be settling around four, does the pacing change? Is the beta fast first and then slow down as loan growth comes back?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, a couple of comments related to that. I mean I think strategic opportunities to grow deposits, and you see what we've been able to do with the Private Bank, and we've raised our target there. Our performance in the last rate tightening cycle has been better than average. We've seen our opportunities to grow low cost actually be better than what we're seeing in a lot of our industry peers.\nThe core retail franchise is performing extremely well. The idiosyncratic opportunities in New York City Metro and Private Bank are adding on top of that. Our commercial business is driving DDA growth as well. From a strategic standpoint, the deposit franchise is an incredibly solid foundation as we head into this potential easing cycle. I mean, I think when you look at betas, we did outperform our own expectations in the fourth quarter with betas around 50% when we were originally thinking around 40%. You know, based on the rate outlook, you know, we expect that betas continue to can continue to increase.\nWe went, you know, the earlier betas, we did get out of the gate pretty quickly and I think later, you know, our opportunity to grow beta from here, we're going to end up seeing our betas get to low to mid-50s maybe by the time you get to a terminal 4%. You know that you can do the math there on what the sequential betas look like. Feeling incredibly confident in the underpinning of the NIM trajectory given the deposit franchise.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, maybe ask Brendan to comment a little bit about deposits.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Erika. Maybe a quick point on private, and I'll talk for a minute about core retail deposits. On private, our low-cost deposits remain around 40%. DDA plus savings. Despite the pretty, pretty healthy growth, the quality of the deposit book has been very consistent and very accretive to the overall mix to Citizens. We expect that while that could pull back a little bit, we expect.\nThe accretion mix to still be very.\nStrong through all of 2025.\nThat growth will both be in.\nQuantity and quality for the overall franchise, which is great. On the retail book, I've mentioned this on most every call, but the full year performance for the retail portfolio was very, very strong against peers. With benchmarks that we look at, we think we're somewhere in the range of 150 basis points better than peer average on low-cost deposits, which is again largely DDA and savings. Our DDA book, the outflows sort of stopped around August, September, and we've been flattening out.\nWe saw some very modest growth at the back half of Q4, including a pretty sizable tick up in savings in the back half of Q4. The strength there is still very good. We believe we were indexed probably number one in the regional bank peer set in retail banking core DDA growth for the full year 2024.\nThere's nothing that I see that suggests that we won't continue to outperform peers on our relative low-cost deposit performance. The other thing I would say is we've been very, very successful in our CD book turning over at lower yields with high retention. In Q4, we had about $5.5 billion in CDs in the retail book turnover with over a 90% retention rate. Those CDs are coming in at about 100 basis points better in yield. When I look at the first half of the year, we've got a little bit north of $14 billion in CDs on the retail book that will also turn over. That should give us some dry powder to drive those yields lower.\nWe expect to retain the vast majority of those balances, largely in deposits, with some trickling out into support for the wealth business and going into managed money in AUM. That gives us a good amount of dry powder for thinking about the first half of the year on bringing deposit yields in the CD book down.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, that's helpful. Just secondly, just a quick follow-up, and I just wanted to ask a bigger question of Bruce and John. Given all those elements and the fact that you're entering at 2.87 for the year and you have a 3% net interest margin guide for the full year, does that mean the exit is somewhere between 3% to 3.10%? If so, Bruce, that tees you up for a very strong year, not just mechanically, but strategically. I think the question that I was getting this morning is where are we in terms of the investment horizon, which is with regards to the Private Bank and the Private Wealth initiative?\nIn other words, you're setting up for great NII growth in 2026, and investors are wondering if you're going to continue to front load some of the investment spend in the wealth and Private Bank initiative.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Just to your favorite question, exit rate on NIM, I would bump that up a little bit and say probably more like 3.05% to 3.10%. That's that. In terms of how we think about the Private Bank, you know, we launched this back in the middle of 2023, and you know, it's been a tremendous effort to get folks in place, support them appropriately, and have them transition in customers. It's been a really great success story. Certainly not the finished article, more to do to get to White Glove service, but feeling good about the trajectory that we're on. I want to just make it clear, though, that we're very committed to delivering our financial commitments on this business.\nWe want to demonstrate that it is a profitable business that can deliver attractive returns, and we're running it a bit differently than the way it ran at First Republic. We have some guardrails around the kind of nature of the business we want to take on, and the spreads we hope to achieve, et cetera, et cetera. One thing that we wanted to deliver this year was to be profitable in the fourth quarter. We said we'd be profitable in the second half of the year. We got to that in August.\nWe had enough headroom that we felt confident that we could add another team in Southern California. As you know, Erika, when you bring in these Private Banking Teams, they show up and they're all expenses initially, and then over time they transition in customers, and then the lines cross and they become profitable.\nWe still delivered a profitable fourth quarter, about a penny of EPS. When we look at next year, depending on how fast that business is growing, if we're hitting our targets, there may be opportunities to add additional teams while still delivering the profitability of the 5% accretive to the bottom line. By the way, that translates now we're starting to get up towards that 20% ROTCE target for the business already by the end of next year. We're keeping those guardrails in place as we grow the business.\nThere's such a big opportunity there. There are some great people out there who want to join the platform, that we have to be thinking about kind of how to fill the void in the market and really build a great franchise.\nI think we have that balance right, and you can expect us to be disciplined in how we approach that. I'd like to see if we're running faster than projected, that we're going to be leaning in and adding some additional teams. The wealth teams typically are accretive right from the get go, so those we can keep doing throughout the year. It's more kind of the private banking locations, PBOs, and additional teams that we just need to fit into the overall financial dynamic that we're trying to deliver.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nVery helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Just on the timing of the ROTCE target that you laid out medium term.\nIs that implied for 2027 or just unequity on net.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWhich targets the MTO? The.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nSorry, that's right, the 16%-18% medium term.\nAny way to frame the timing?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, well, I think we've. The medium term to us is by 2027, and you know, we'll be on an upwards arc through 2025 and 2026 in order to get to that destination. I don't necessarily want to put a pin in it as to whether we could get there in 2026. There's possible scenarios that that could happen, but certainly by 2027 we feel quite confident that we'll be there, Matt.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, you laid out the waterfall.\nIn terms of how you get there.\nJust to clarify, the operating leverage of 1.5% this year, obviously there's a nice improvement in that in the next.\nCouple years to support that ROTCE level, right?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes. I think clearly as we continue to see the benefit of the kind of swap runoff and non-core runoff and the NIM lift, that really juices your positive operating leverage, and that there's a big, you know, there's some, you know, contribution from that in 2025, but it actually accelerates in 2026, and so we would expect positive operating leverage to be even more in 2026.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nFor those on the phone, if you would like to ask a question, please use star one. Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, Bruce. Hi, John, how are you?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nHi.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nBruce.\nCan we take a step back for a moment? Obviously, we have a new administration coming in, and we're going to get a number of new heads of the different regulatory agencies. Maybe the most important change coming from the Vice Chair of Safety and Soundness at the Fed, with Barr stepping down about two weeks ago. When you look at it, how are you kind of thinking about what can change to the benefit for not just Citizens, for the banking industry?\nWhat are you looking or hoping for that these new leaders can come in and really enable the banking industry to, the Treasury Secretary nominee in his testimony, get the banks more involved in the US economy.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, well, I think we've started to make some headway already on that this year, Gerard, as some of the proposals that were a response to what happened in 2023 seem to be have overdone, overcooked in terms of changes to capital, liquidity, and funding frameworks that I think the industry pushed back and thought that they needed to be dialed back.\nWe were starting to make progress on that in any event. I do think putting that to bed and coming up with what are the final Basel III capital rules, what are we going to do with liquidity, what are we going to do with funding, and making sure that tailoring remains central to how the framework is set. That's kind of job one on the prudential side. I would say the other benefits could be just a refreshed look at supervision.\nThere's a lot of folks who work really hard, and we get really good advice and input from the supervisors. Sometimes things get overcooked a bit, and you lose the forest for the trees. Just kind of making sure that that is focused at the right level frees us up to have a little more flexibility in how we operate. That could be positive as well. I'd say some of the pressure on fees that we've seen come out of the CFPB, they're not always net beneficial. They may make good headlines. You know, squeezing a balloon, and you know, you close down this, and then the banks have to make a return, so they have to charge somewhere else.\nJust having a more insightful view as to how to allow banks to operate with well-disclosed fees that actually benefit their customers, as opposed to constantly pushing on that, would also be helpful. I'd say last thing, there's probably a need for more consolidation in the industry, particularly at the smaller end of the spectrum. Taking the sand out of the gears on that and allowing that to take place with more certainty, I think that would also benefit the industry. I think a number of all that should allow banks to continue to have the capital to lean in, support economic growth. I think we've done a good job of that, and we want to continue to be able to do that.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nJust quickly on what you just said, Bruce, consolidation at the smaller end of the spectrum. How do you define smaller end? $10 billion and less asset sized banks or something small?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I don't know where to draw that line, but certainly I'd say banks that are even in the 25 to 50 category just have a lot of investing to do to keep up with technology changes, business model going, digital, cyber defenses, a lot of regulation. I just think there's a lot of great banks in that size category, but ultimately I think there'll be some who feel that they can gain some benefits from scale. I think if the framework were more certain, you'd start to see consolidation all the way through from the very smallest banks, maybe up to those smaller regionals.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. As a follow up question, you give us very good detail on your commercial real estate portfolio and how you work, and for the issues that the industry confronts on commercial real estate, office in particular, can you give us an update on, using the baseball vernacular, what inning do you think we're in in getting through this kind of pig in the python situation in commercial real estate and specifically office.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'm going to start and turn it over to Don, but I'd say when we saw this happening, it kind of kicked off in the early part of 2023. We said this is a multi-year process to kind of work this out just based on the nature of the terms of the leases and kind of return to office dynamics, et cetera, that this was going to take a while to play out. We've seen that consistently throughout the rest of 2023 through 2024. I think looking into 2025, we'll still be in workout mode, but I think we're probably past the midpoint at this point, so maybe middle innings of the game, and hopefully we see that start to really drop off as we exit 2025. I'll leave it over to Don.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, Gerard, I think that's right. I'll channel my Bob Uecker, and since we're memorializing him and you're analogizing baseball, I think the good news on the real estate side, as Bruce said, we still have kind of 25 to work through. We are seeing almost no incremental deterioration based on the entirety of the portfolio over the last year or so. Everything we've identified as problematic, needing to go through the workout cycle, estimation of losses pretty much playing out as we expected, and we are getting toward the back end.\nAs Bruce said, in 2025, the good news across the board in the real estate complex is liquidity is really coming back, and we're seeing this not necessarily in the office portfolio, but in the rest of the real estate portfolio. That can ripple over as we get into later, later portions of 2025. We're seeing the CMBS market very active, we're seeing the life companies very active. We're getting taken out of criticized assets at par in the non-office space, but in the multifamily space.\nThere are a lot of kind of encouraging signs that we're seeing across the board. I think, as John said in his remarks, we're seeing no new migration into our workout team. There's a lot to be a little bit more optimistic about. We've got a ways to go to work out. Interestingly, a lot of the sponsors think that there's some brightness at the end of the tunnel, so they're dribbling in cash to keep the properties alive because they think there might be an opportunity down the road. It's elongating the workout cycle a little bit more than past cycles.\nI think we feel like we have a really good handle on it, and it's trending reasonably consistent with what our expectations.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJohn, you have a stat. That's overall criticized assets came down sharply in the fourth quarter, led by the drop in CRE.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nExactly. Yeah. Criticized levels down significantly. You know, overall, actually overall Criticized is down 17%, led by a reduction in General Office. That's great news.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThat was in the order of like 30%.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, exactly, exactly.\nDon mentioned inflows to outflows have really flipped around rather than inflows exceeding outflows. That flipped around in the fourth quarter significantly. Inflows slowed to a trickle, and then upgrades outpaced all of that in the fourth quarter. Turning the corner in the game, back to the imagery, was nice to see in full Q.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAppreciate all the color. Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the belly of the curve. How much of an impact does that have on both the asset and the liability side of the balance sheet? I'm thinking from an asset side it gives you some more benefit from fixed asset repricing, but on the liability side, maybe it makes it a little bit harder to drop those CD rates further. Is that something you guys are focusing on? Is there a risk that if the belly of the curve keeps moving higher, could that weigh on some of those deposit betas from here?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAppreciate the question. I'll comment on that. I mean broadly, I would just make the point that we're asset sensitive, and we're basically asset sensitive across all of the key rates across the curve for the most part. When you look at the belly of the curve, that's actually driving our fixed asset repricing, and when you see our net interest margin progression through time, that's consistently a positive. On a net basis, if the belly of the curve is rising, we're net beneficiaries of that. On the funding side, when you think about CDs out of the gate, that's typically less than a one-year term that can turn over.\nNet, net, our asset repricing would overcome even if the belly of the curve was consistently higher. That would be a net positive for us through time. You can see that in our net interest margin we've built in the curve that we see basically out the window through the medium term progression. The fixed rate asset repricing is 15-20 basis points by the time you get to 2027, and that's consistently building through 2025 into 2026 and 2027. That's a net positive. I think the only place that our funding comes into play on the belly is maybe in the senior debt space, and we're really well positioned there.\nWe're north of 4% of RWA, and that's not a huge driver for us. Again, the asset sensitivity, higher rates basically is a net positive for us.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nYeah, I'm just thinking you guys were actually ahead of the curve when the Fed was cutting rates, and you were able to drop those deposit rates sooner. I'm just thinking now that there's not as many rate cuts in the forward curve, and the belly of the curve is higher, whether that's weighing on deposit costs at all.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, no, as I mentioned, we'll be able to get deposit betas up to the low to mid-50% from where we are today at around 50%. If, and that's based on the curve where we have a cut in the second quarter and a cut in the fourth quarter. If, however, there are no cuts in 2025, our deposit betas would flatten out. That's a net positive for us because of our net floating position, and loan yields would more than make up for the fact that deposit betas might not be quite as high because we're asset sensitive. I should mention that our asset sensitivity actually grows in 2025, 2026, and 2027.\nOn an all-in basis, our net interest margin is a beneficiary of rates being higher because loan yields more than offset what the impact on deposit betas might be, because we're overall asset sensitive.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Perfect, thank you. If I can just ask a follow up on loan growth. You're looking for mid single digit spot loan growth excluding non core loans. Can you talk about the catalyst there? Also, where do you see loan growth coming from? Is it sponsors, traditional middle market, is it both?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yeah, I'll start, then John can give you more details. I think, you know, we have been quite disciplined in making sure that where we're putting out loan capital, we're getting good returns. We haven't really sought to force the action. In fact, through balance sheet optimization, we have actually exited a number of relationships in commercial. We're certainly trying to run down the CRE book a little bit, and then we have non-core set up to run down assets.\nI think the catalyst that we're looking for to actually get back to loan growth, which is certainly desired and desirable, the main building block here, the Private Bank, is, I think, likely to put on about $1 billion a quarter to get to the targets at the end of the year.\nThat's pretty idiosyncratic to us in kind of having a startup business that's growing that we can count on for that kind of growth, and not only in loans but also in deposits. You know, if you take out that growth, then the spot loan growth drops, John, from mid single digits down to low single digits or something like that. I think we're not really calling for any aggressive resumption in loan growth.\nWe're anticipating that things will be relatively subdued, continuing into the first half of the year, and then start to pick up in the second half of the year in commercial. We saw line utilization go down quite a bit in Q4, particularly subscription lines. That new money deal machine, private equity putting money to work, waiting for Godot on that, that didn't happen in Q4.\nWe don't expect it just because the calendar flipped the page to pick up right away in 2025. I think that will begin to happen, and we'll see all the benefits of that: higher capital markets fees, loan growth that comes along with that. We're being cautious in terms of how much of that we put into the forward forecast. On consumer, we just have a few of the areas that have consistently been able to grow: mortgage, HELOC, our card business.\nNo great shakes there either, just some moderate level of growth. When you look across that, we've got some things running down. We have Private Bank steady as she goes. We have a resumption in the second half of commercial and a little lower level of steady as she goes in consumer.\nJohn, I don't know if you want to add color to that.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, just another point or two to emphasize. I agree with that. We said mid single digits ex non-core. You know, if you think about the three legs of the stool, you hit all three. If you private bank on its trajectory, really is a huge driver and is the largest driver getting us to that mid single digits. If you look at it excluding the private bank and excluding non-core, we would be in a low single digits trajectory as Bruce mentioned. When the consumer legacy is half of that and the other half of it is in commercial, consumer legacy, you mentioned Bruce, and in commercial subscription and M&A activity.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIs likely to pick up expansion markets and middle markets.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nExactly. You know, we've got expansion markets contributing as we see in 2025. The other important part is, you know, subscription line utilization is about as low as we've ever seen. It's in the low 40%, typically in the mid-50%. We see some of that partial. We see some of that coming back, not all the way back. Fund finance, you know, that we've been successful at in the past, will contribute as well as asset backed up. You know, I mean, I would just say that, you know, all of that put together keeps us in a good spot. As we mentioned earlier, to the extent that this doesn't happen, as we mentioned earlier, we've been able to navigate a lower loan growth environment in 2024 quite well.\nWe would run that playbook back and you'd see more buybacks out of us with a stock price that's attractive as we see it below intrinsic value. We'd at the margin likely deliver even better deposit performance if that were to be the case. I think we've got some nice optionality in 2025 to keep to stay on our trajectory.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would just say one final thing is that really the NII guide is as it was, as you saw in the fourth quarter. It's really driven by the NIM expansion, so it's not as dependent on volume growth in order to deliver that. As John said, if you don't see the volume growth, you have other levers, such as you can repurchase your shares and you won't push on deposits as much. You can be a little more disciplined on your deposit pricing. I'd say we feel quite confident overall in that NII guide for next year.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThat's really helpful. Appreciate the detail. Anzeo. Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, is that it? I guess that's it for the questions. We got a lot of banks reporting today, so I hope everybody got a good night's sleep last night and makes it through the day. Thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Take care.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color.\nWe will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.\nWith that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kristien, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We announced solid results today, and we continue to execute well through an uncertain environment. Highlights for the quarter include very strong fee performance, good deposit cost management, tight expense control and credit metrics, which were within expectations. Our balance sheet remains robust with a CET1 ratio of 10.7%. Our loan-to-deposit ratio was 80%. Our ACL ratio was 1.63%, and and Federal Home Loan Bank advances are now below $600 million. Of note, we saw our revenues tick up relative to Q1. Our underlying PPNR grew by 2% over Q1. Our underlying net income grew by $13 million or 3%. We repurchased $200 million in shares over the quarter with our sequential EPS up 4%.\nThe combination of our strong capital position, solid returns and capital freed up from noncore rundown has allowed us the capital flexibility to support our customers and return capital to shareholders. Share count is down over 5% versus a year ago. Our fee growth was relatively broad as capital markets fees continued their rebound led by low syndications and bond underwriting.\nWealth and card fees, both at record levels. We also are seeing nice momentum in our well-positioned payments business. Our Private Bank had a terrific quarter. We reached $4 billion in deposits up from $2.4 billion in Q1 and tracking well towards our year-end '25 goal of $11 billion. We brought in 2 leading private wealth teams in the quarter, one from San Francisco and one from Boston. And we've reached $3.6 billion in assets under management at quarter end with nice momentum.\nOur commercial bank hired a middle market leader for Florida and for California during the quarter to increasingly important states for us. Our overall commercial franchise continues to be well positioned in serving the middle market, private capital and key growth verticals and we look for our strong performance to continue in the second half. I should pause to give a shout out to Don McCree for his appointment as Senior Vice Chair in June. Great recognition for his efforts over the years at Citizens.\nWe have done a good job in executing on our strategic initiatives. TOP 9 is tracking well to targets, and we have commenced work on top 10, which will push into new areas like AI. Our BSO work is progressing well. Noncore ran down $1.1 billion in the quarter. Commercial C&I is refocusing on deep relationships and we have a medium-term plan to reduce our CRE exposure. Credit metrics are holding up fine outside of general office. We continue the lengthy workout of general office, which will take several more quarters before we see improvement.\nRoughly 70% of our office exposure is suburban versus central business district or loss given defaults have been about half of CBD properties. The good news is that we have our arms around the issue and we don't expect to see major surprises. Looking forward, we continue to be upbeat about our prospects. While there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in a good position to navigate the challenges that may arise, and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year as well as the medium term.\nOur strategy rests on a transformed consumer bank, the best positioned super regional commercial bank and the aspiration to have the premier bank-owned private bank. We will continue to execute with the financial and operating discipline that you've come to expect from us.\nWith that, let me turn it over to John.\n\nJohn F. Woods\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nThanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, second quarter results were very solid in a number of key areas. Starting with the excellent fee performance driven by strong capital markets fees and record results in Wealth and card. Also, we managed our deposit portfolio quite well. With stable balances and lower interest-bearing costs in a competitive environment, which positively impacted NII and NIM. Rounding our quarterly results, expenses and credit came in largely as expected.\nWith respect to balance sheet strength, we continue to maintain a healthy credit reserve position and capital and liquidity levels near the top of our peer group. And importantly, we are executing well against our various multiyear strategic initiatives, including the build-out of our Private Bank. I'll summarize further highlights of the second quarter financial results referencing Slides 3 to 6. We generated underlying net income of $408 million for the second quarter, EPS of $0.82 and ROTCE of 11.1%. Maintaining a strong balance sheet position is a top priority, and we ended the second quarter with CET1 at 10.7% or about 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal. We also maintained our strong funding and liquidity profile in the second quarter. Our pro forma LCR is 119%, which is well in excess of the large bank category 1 requirement of 100%. And our period-end LDR improved to 80.4%.\nOn the funding front, we reduced our period-end FHLB borrowings by about $1.5 billion linked quarter to $553 million. We continued our programmatic approach to increasing our structural funding base with a successful $750 million senior debt issuance during the second quarter and we added about another $1 billion of auto back borrowings. That was our fourth issuance, essentially completing our auto program, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date.\nWe also refinanced preferred stock in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of new preferred and redeeming $300 million of higher coupon floating rate preferred on July 8. Credit losses of approximately $180 million were in line with our expectations. The NCO rate rose a little to 52 basis points, reflecting loan balances coming in a little lower than expected. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.63% is up 2 basis points from the prior quarter. This includes an 11.1% coverage for general office, up from 10.6% in the prior quarter.\nRegarding our strategic initiatives, the Private Bank is doing very well, having generated $4 billion of deposits and $3.6 billion of AUM through the second quarter. Also, our investments over the years in the private capital and capital markets space are playing out nicely as demonstrated this quarter.\nFinally, we are excited about our top of house initiatives, including the ongoing benefits from BSO and top as well as growing contributions expected from data and technology-related initiatives such as generative AI and cloud migration.\nNext, I'll talk through the second quarter results in more detail, starting with net interest income on Slide 7. As expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, reflecting lower net interest margin and loan balances. With respect to NIM, as you can see in the walk at the bottom of our slide, our margin was down 4 basis points to 2.87%, reflecting a 6 basis point increase in swap expense due to the 60 basis point decline in average receive rate in the quarter. This was partly offset by a net increase in NIM of 2 basis points from all other sources, including higher asset yields noncore runoff and good deposit cost performance with interest-bearing deposit costs down 3 basis points. Overall, our deposit franchise continues to perform well in a very competitive environment. with our interest-bearing deposit beta at 51%, which was down from 52% in Q1.\nMoving to Slide 8. Our Fees were up 7% linked quarter given strong results in capital markets and record card and wealth results. Our Capital Markets business improved 14% linked quarter, with higher bond underwriting and loan syndication fees given strong refinancing activity. M&A advisory fees were down slightly off a strong first quarter However, our deal pipelines remain strong, and we expect to see positive momentum in the second half of 2024. It's great to see our Capital Markets business holding the #1 middle market sponsor book runner position by the second quarter in a row. This reflects the benefit of the investments we've made in our capabilities since the IPO and demonstrates the diversification of the business.\nCard fees were a record, primarily given the full quarter benefit of the first quarter transition to a new debit card platform as well as seasonally higher purchase volume. We delivered record results in wealth driven by increased sales activity as well as higher asset management fees given the constructive market environment and contribution from the Private Bank, which will continue to grow given the AUM increase in the second quarter from our [ well team ] hires. Mortgage banking fees are up modestly with a benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and an improvement in servicing P&L. Production fees were down slightly given a decline in margins.\nOn Slide 9, underlying expenses were down slightly as we saw the normal seasonal benefit in compensation and we did a nice job managing our expenses while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Our TOP 9 program is progressing well, and we continue to expect to deliver a $135 million pretax run rate benefit by the end of the year. We have commenced work on our TOP 10 program and we'll provide more details later this year.\nOn Slide 10, period end and average loans are down 1% linked quarter as we continue to optimize our balance sheet and prioritize relationship-based lending. The linked quarter decline was driven by the runoff of our noncore portfolio of $1.1 billion. Core loans were broadly stable with a slight reduction in commercial balances, largely offset by an increase in retail. The decrease in commercial loans reflects paydowns and exits of lower returning credit-only relationships, lower client loan demand and corporates continuing to issue in the debt markets.\nNext, on Slides 11 and 12. We continue to do an excellent job of deposits in an extremely competitive environment. Period-end deposits are broadly stable linked quarter as seasonally lower retail deposits was offset by strong growth in the Private Bank. We continue to see a slowing rate of migration from demand and lower cost deposits to higher cost interest-bearing accounts with the Fed holding steady as well as the benefit of deposit market share gains with the Private Bank. As a result, noninterest-bearing deposits are stable at about 21% of total deposits. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels, about 69% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our funding costs in the higher rate environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were down 3 basis points linked quarter, given proactive management of our pricing strategy.\nMoving to credit on Slide 13. Net charge-offs were 52 basis points, up 2 basis points linked quarter, reflecting broadly stable charge-offs and lower average loans. The commercial charge-offs in the quarter were largely driven by CRE General Office and the fact that C&I recoveries were higher in 1Q versus 2Q. This increase in commercial was largely offset by a decrease in retail, primarily due to seasonal trends in auto and runoff. Nonaccrual loans increased 4% linked quarter, driven by increases in CRE general office and multifamily, which has been reflected in the reserve level for the quarter.\nTurning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 14. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.63%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the first quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves and lower loan balances, given noncore runoff and commercial paydowns and balance sheet optimization. Our reserve of $369 million for the $3.3 billion general office portfolio represents 11.1% coverage, up from 10.6% in the first quarter.\nAdditionally, since the second quarter of 2023, we have absorbed $319 million of cumulative losses in the general office portfolio. When you add these cumulative losses to the reserves outstanding, this represents roughly a 17% loss rate based on the March 2023 balance of $4.1 billion. Over the past 6 quarters, the general office portfolio was down roughly $900 million to $3.3 billion at June 30 given paydowns of about $500 million and the charge-offs I just mentioned. The loss experience so far has been concentrated in the central business district properties with approximately 2x the loss rate of suburban properties. Suburban exposure is 70% of our total at this point.\nOn the bottom left of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level, which we believe represents a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. So we feel the current coverage is very strong.\nMoving to Slide 15. We have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio was a strong 10.7%, up 10 basis points from 1Q and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt-out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers. You can see on Slide 16 where CET1 stands currently relative to peers. Given our strong capital position, we repurchased another $200 million in common shares, and including dividends, we returned a total of $394 million to shareholders in the second quarter.\nMoving to Slide 17. Our strategy is built on a transformed consumer bank, a best positioned commercial bank amongst our regional peers and our aspiration to build the premier bank-owned Private Bank and Wealth franchise. First, we have a strong transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise rounded in primary relationships and high-quality customer growth.\nNotably, the transformation of our consumer deposit franchise is the chief reason our deposit performance has dramatically improved from the last upgrade cycle. We are much more in in our deposit raising capabilities now with more levers to pull and better analytical tools and where our beta performance lagged our regional peers last time, so far this cycle, we are better than peer median. We also have a differentiated lending platform where we are prioritizing building adorable relationships with our customers, and we are focused on scaling our wealth business.\nImportantly, we continue to make great progress improving digital engagement with our customers and increasing deposit share as we build our customer base, particularly in New York Metro.\nNext, we believe we have built a leading commercial bank amongst the super regional banks. We are focusing on serving sponsors and middle market companies in the high-growth sectors of the economy and we have full set of product and advisory capabilities to deliver to our clients. In particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem, which appears poised for a strong recovery after one of the slowest deal-making periods in decades. We are starting to see a more constructive capital markets environment develop and our consistent position near the top of the middle market and sponsor league tables gives us confidence that we have a right to win as activity picks up.\nFinally, we're building a premier Private Bank, and that is going very well and gaining momentum. We are growing our client base and now have about $4 billion of attractive deposits, a $1.6 billion increase from the prior quarter with roughly 30% noninterest-bearing. Also, we are now at $1.4 billion of loans and continuing to grow. We recently opened private banking offices in Mill Valley, California and Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities with our Citizens Wealth Management business as the centerpiece of that effort.\nWe added 2 exceptional asset management teams in the second quarter, one from San Francisco and the other from Boston, bringing the total Private Bank AUM to $3.6 billion, well on our way to hit our $10 billion target by the end of 2025. Importantly, our Private Bank revenue increased 68% to about $30 million in the second quarter, and we are on track to break even on the bottom line later this year.\nMoving to Slide 18. We provide the guidance for the third quarter. This outlook contemplates a 25 basis point rate cut in each of September and December. We expect NII to be down 1% to 2%, driven by one last step up in swap costs this cycle. Noninterest income should be up slightly, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets more than offset by a pickup across other categories. We expect noninterest expense to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be down modestly, and the ACL should continue to benefit from noncore runoff. Our CET1 ratio is expected to come in about 10.5% with approximately $250 million to $300 million of share repurchase currently planned.\nWith respect to the full year 2024 guide we provided in January, we feel good about the overall level of PPNR. Revenues are tracking broadly in line with some puts and takes. NII is expected to come in at the upper end of the down 6% to 9% range, reflecting lower loan balances with NIM trending modestly better. This should come in modestly above the range of 6% to 9% originally expected. You should expect us to continue to do well on expenses, which will be broadly in line with the January guide.\nWe expect NII and net interest margin to rebound in the fourth quarter given spot costs that peaked in the third quarter. with a return to positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter. In addition, net charge-offs are trending in line with our January expectations. We continue to expect to end the year with a target set in ratio of approximately 10.5%, and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth.\nTo wrap up, we delivered a strong quarter with good momentum in capital markets, record results in wealth and card and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. Our capital levels are strong near the top of our peer group, and we are maintaining robust liquidity and funding. Our unique multiyear strategic initiatives, including the build-out of our Private Bank are progressing well and our consumer and commercial banking businesses are well positioned to drive strong performance over the medium term. Given these tailwinds, combined with strong execution and tight expense management, we remain confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nThank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for Q&A.",

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question and answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and CFO John Woods will provide an overview of our Q1 results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our Q1 earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.\nOur comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Kristin. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We were pleased to start the year with a solid quarter. We continue to play strong defense through an uncertain environment. With a CET1 ratio at 10.6%, our LDR at 81%, our allowance for loan loss ratio of 1.61%, and general office reserves now at 10.6% on the P&L. We are still seeing a modest decline in NII, though our NIM was stable at 2.91%. Fees picked up by 3% sequential quarter, led by capital markets and card, and expenses were flat. Our credit trends are in line with expectations. We repurchased $300 million US dollars of shares during the quarter as we free up capital from our non-core rundown. Our guide for Q2 and full year remain consistent with our expectations at the outset of the year. Our strategic initiatives are making good progress.\nThe Private Bank is off to a good start, reaching $2.4 billion US dollars in deposits at quarter end. We expect momentum to accelerate further over the course of the year. We are also focused on building out Private Wealth management through further investment in Clarfeld, plus several imminent team lift outs. Our New York City Metro initiative continues to go well, with the fastest growth of any of our regions, and really strong net promoter scores. Our focus in the commercial bank of serving the middle market, private capital, and key growth verticals has put us in great position to benefit from a pickup in deal activity, which we expect to build further over the course of the year, and our top nine program is being executed well, allowing us to self-fund our growth investments while keeping overall expense growth rate muted.\nWhile there are still many uncertainties in the external environment, we feel we are in good position to navigate the challenges that may arise, and we maintain a positive outlook for Citizens over the balance of the year, as well as the medium term. Over the past decade, we have undertaken a major transformation of Citizens. Our consumer and commercial banking segments are positioned for success, and we are now looking to build the Premier bank-owned Private Bank and wealth franchise. Our balance sheet has been repositioned with an exceptionally strong capital, liquidity, and funding profile, and we are deploying our loan capital more selectively to achieve better risk-adjusted returns. Our expense base has been tightly managed, with AI offering the potential for further breakthroughs, lots accomplished, with more to do. Clearly, exciting times for Citizens. With that, let me turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. As Bruce mentioned, the year is off to a good start. Q1 results were solid against the backdrop of a more constructive macro environment, which supported an improvement in capital markets, stability in our margin, and credit performance that continues to play out largely as expected. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with capital levels near the top of our peer group, excellent liquidity, and a healthy credit reserve position. Importantly, this positions us to execute well against our multi-year strategic initiatives, including the build-out of our Private Bank. Let me start with some highlights of our Q1 financial results, referencing slides three to six, before I discuss the details. We generated underlying net income of $395 million US dollars for the Q1 and EPS of $0.79 US dollars.\nThis includes a -$0.03 US dollars impact from the Private Bank, which is a significant improvement from the $0.11 US dollars impact last quarter as we start to see revenues pick up and we progress to our expected break even in H2 2024. It also includes the impact of the non-core portfolio, which contributed a $0.13 US dollars negative impact. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it is steadily running off, creating a tailwind for performance going forward. Our notable items this quarter were $0.14 US dollars, which primarily consists of an adjustment to the FDIC Special Assessment, and top and other efficiency-related expenses. Excluding these notable items, our underlying ROTC for the quarter was 10.6%.\nPlaying prudent defense remains at the top of our priority list, and we ended the quarter with a very strong balance sheet position with CET1 at 10.6%, or 8.9% adjusted for the AOCI opt out removal. We also continued to make meaningful improvements to our funding and liquidity profile in the Q1. Our pro forma LCR strengthened to 120%, which is well in excess of the large bank category 1 requirement of 100%, and our period end LDR improved to 81% from 82% in the prior quarter. On the funding front, we reduced our period end FHLB borrowings by about $1.8 billion US dollars linked quarter to a modest $2 billion US dollars.\nWe also increased our structural funding base with a very successful $1.25 billion US dollars senior issuance, and another $1.5 billion US dollars auto collateralized issuance during the quarter. We have another $1 billion US dollars of auto backed issuance expected to settle this week. This is our fourth issuance, and it was executed at our tightest credit spreads to date. In addition, we expect to be a more programmatic issuer of senior unsecured debt going forward. Credit trends have been performing in line with our expectations, with NCOs coming in at 50 basis points for the Q1. Our ACL coverage ratio of 1.61% is up 2 basis points from year end. This includes a 10.6% coverage for general office, up slightly from 10.2% in the prior quarter. We are well positioned for the medium term, with expected tailwinds to NIM that support a range of 3.25% to 3.4%.\nRegarding strategic initiatives, the Private Bank is doing very well. We continue to make inroads in the New York City Metro, and our latest TOP program is progressing nicely. In addition, we are poised to benefit from an improving capital markets environment, with our investments in the business and synergies from our acquisitions positioning us to capitalize as activity levels continue to pick up. Next, I'll talk through the Q1 results in more detail, starting with net interest income on slide seven. As expected, NII is down 3% linked quarter, reflecting a stable margin on a 2% decrease in average interest-earning assets given lower loan balances and day count. As you can see from the NIM walk.\nAt the bottom of the slide, our margin was flat at 2.91% as the combined benefit of higher asset yields, non-core runoff, and day count were offset by higher funding costs and the impact of swaps. As expected, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta remains in the low 50s at 52%, and although we continue to see deposit migration, the rate of migration is slowing. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well, with our beta generally in the pack with peers. Moving to slide eight, our fees were up 3% linked quarter given a notable improvement in capital markets and good card results. The improvement in capital markets reflects a nice pickup in M&A activity and strong bond underwriting results. Our capital markets business consistently holds a top three middle market sponsor bookrunner position, and this quarter we achieved the number one spot.\nOur deal pipelines remain strong, and we continue to see positive early momentum in capital markets this quarter, with strong refinancing activity continuing in the bond market. In card, we had a nice increase, primarily driven by the benefit of a strategic conversion of our debit and credit cards to Mastercard. Our client hedging business was down a bit this quarter, with lower activity in commodities and FX. The decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by a lower benefit from the MSR valuation net of hedging and a modest decline in servicing P&L, partially offset by higher production fees as margin improved. While lot volumes were stable, on slide 9, we did a nice job managing our underlying expenses, which were stable. We will continue to execute on our top program, which gives us the capacity to self-fund our growth initiatives.\nOn slide 10, period end and average loans are down 2% linked quarter. This was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans given paydowns and generally lower client loan demand. Our highly selective approach to lending in this environment, along with exits of lower returning credit-only relationships. Commercial loan utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remain cautious and M&A activity was limited in the face of an uncertain market environment. Next, on slides 11 and 12, we continued to do well in deposits. Year on year, period end deposits were up $4.2 billion US dollars, driven by growth in retail and the Private Bank. Period end deposits were down slightly linked quarter, given expected seasonal impacts in commercial, largely offset by growth in the Private Bank and retail branch deposits.\nOur interest bearing deposit costs were well controlled by 6 basis points, which translates to a 52% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels. About 68% of our deposits are granular, stable consumer deposits, and approximately 70% of our overall deposits are insured or secured. This attractive deposit base has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in the higher rate environment. With the Fed holding steady, we saw the migration of deposits to higher cost categories continue to moderate, and with the contribution of attractive deposits from the Private Bank, non interest bearing deposits are holding steady at about 21% of total deposits. Moving on to credit on slide 13, net charge offs were 50 basis points, up 4 basis points linked quarter.\nThis includes increased commercial charge-offs related to pre General Office, which were in line with our expectations. In retail, we saw a modest seasonal improvement. Nonaccrual loans increased 8% linked quarter, driven by pre General Office. The continued runoff of the auto portfolio drove a modest decline in retail, while other retail categories were stable. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 14, our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.61%, which is a 2 basis point increase from the fourth quarter, reflecting broadly stable reserves with lower loan balances given non-core runoff and commercial balance sheet optimization. The reserve for the $3.4 billion US dollars General Office portfolio represents 10.6% coverage, up slightly from 10.2% in the fourth quarter. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level.\nWe feel these assumptions represent a severe scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong. Moving to slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio is a strong 10.6%, and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be 8.9%. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been among the top of our peers, and you can see on slide 16 where we stand currently relative to peers in the fourth quarter. Given our strong capital position, we resumed common share repurchases, and including dividends, we returned a total of $497 million US dollars to shareholders in the Q1.\nOn the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our Private Bank. First, on slide 17, we have a strong, transformed consumer bank with a robust and capable deposit franchise, a diverse lending business where we are prioritizing relationship-based lending, and a meaningful revenue opportunity as we scale our wealth business. Importantly, we continue to make great progress taking deposit share, with retail deposits up 20% year on year as we continue building our customer base in New York City Metro. On slide 18, let me update you on our progress in building a premier Private Bank, taking the opportunity to fill the void left in the wake of the bank failures last year. Our buildout is going very well and gaining momentum.\nWe are growing our client base and now have about $2.4 billion US dollars of attractive deposits, with roughly 30% non-interest bearing. Also, we are now at just over $1 billion US dollars of loans and half a billion dollars of investments, and continuing to grow. We just opened our newest private banking office in Palm Beach, Florida, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities, with our Clarfeld wealth management business as the centerpiece of that effort. Next, on slide 19, we have built a formidable, full-service commercial bank which consistently punches above its weight. Our multi-year investments in talent, capabilities, and industry expertise put us in an enviable position to provide life cycle services to middle market, mid-corporate, and sponsor clients in high-growth sectors of the US economy.\nIn particular, we are uniquely positioned to serve the private capital ecosystem as evidenced by our consistent standing at the top of the sponsored league tables. We are well positioned to take advantage of a more constructive capital markets environment, and we are excited to start seeing the synergies from our acquisitions coming through in our results this quarter. Moving to slide 20, we provide the guide for the Q2. We expect NII to decrease about 2%. Non interest income should be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect non interest expense to be stable to down slightly. Net charge offs are expected to be about 50 basis points, and the ACL should continue to benefit from the non core runoff. Our CET1 is expected to come in at about 10.5%, with approximately $200 million US dollars of share repurchases currently planned. We are broadly reaffirming our full year 2024 guide.\nWe expect NII to land within the range of down 6% to 9%, consistent with our January guidance, with margin coming in a little better than expected, offsetting the impact of lower loan demand. The other components of PPNR are also tracking to our January guidance. In addition, NCOs are trending in line with our expectations of approximately 50 basis points for the year. Our target CET1 ratio for 2024 is approximately 10.5%, and the level of share repurchases will be dependent on our view of the external environment and loan growth. Given the changing rate outlook, I wanted to update you on how the swaps and our non-core portfolio are expected to impact NII and NIM as we look out further in 2024 and beyond. We've included slide 25 in the appendix, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027.\nBy Q4 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown. Looking out further, we expect a significant NII tailwind and NIM benefit from the impact of non-core and swaps over the medium term, given runoff and lower rates. This will be partially offset by the impact of the asset-sensitive core balance sheet, resulting in a medium-term NIM range of 3.25% to 3.4%. To wrap up, we delivered a solid quarter featuring stable NIM, strong fee performance led by capital markets and cards, tight expense management, and in-line credit performance. We have a series of unique initiatives that are progressing well. Our consumer bank has been transformed, our commercial bank is exceptionally well positioned, and we aim to build the premier bank-owned Private Bank and wealth franchise.\nWe enjoy a strong capital, liquidity, and funding profile that allows us to support our customers while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives. Given several tailwinds, combined with continued strong execution, we are confident in our ability to hit our medium-term 16% to 18% return target. With that, I will hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, John and Alan. Let's open it up for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You'll hear an indication you've been placed into queue and may remove yourself from queue by repeating the one then zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset and make certain your phone is unmuted before pressing any buttons again. For questions, press one then zero. At this time, our first question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, Bruce. Good morning, John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMorning, Ryan.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nMaybe to start off with some of the guidance you broadly reiterated, can you maybe just flush out how some of the expectations have changed, particularly around NII? John, I think you noted you still expect to be in the range, but what are the main drivers to get you there, and what would it take to be better than the low end? Just as a follow up on the margin, you held it flat, and it sounds like it could be a little bit better. How have the expectations changed relative to 280 to 285 and the 285 you were expecting at the end of the year? Thank you.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, sure, I'll go ahead and talk through that. I'd say, as you may have heard in some of the opening remarks, we do expect that net interest margin trends have been quite good. We do expect net interest margin to come in a little better, maybe at the high end of that range rather than where we were at the beginning of the year. A lot of the drivers of that net interest margin can be pinned on the investments we've made in the deposit franchise over the years that are really starting to come to fruition. When you look at it, deposit levels are better in the Q1 than we expected, and interest bearing deposit costs are a little bit better. Funding overall, when you look at our borrowing mix, has improved significantly.\nThat's underpinning a lot of the net interest margin. When you combine that with the other side of the balance sheet, where you see the front book, back book dynamic playing out, it's very powerful. We're feeling better about NIM trajectory, and I think that's what you're seeing with respect to our confidence in hitting that net interest income range, given the confidence around net interest margin as you get towards the end of the year. As I mentioned, I think previously we set our average, our guide would be around 280 to 285 in that range. I'd say we're probably going to come in at the upper end of that range. Now, when we look out and maybe a tad above, we'll see as it plays out, and then we'll see the loans just given where loan demand has started off the year.\nMaybe average loans, maybe towards the lower end of that original range. Those offset a couple of basis points of NIM equals about a percentage point on loans. That math just works out to be right down the middle of the fairway in terms of our guidelines. You know, what could cause it to come in a little better, you know, continued execution of our strategic initiatives. If, you know, if we see our execution kind of accelerating, you know, across the Private Bank and our other key initiatives on the deposit side. Let's see how the second half commercial rebound plays out. We are expecting, you know, working capital starting to pick up in the second half. We're expecting utilization levels to pick up.\nWe're expecting activity in general, even in the M&A front and M&A finance to be part of the story in the second half. If that starts a little earlier or comes in a little stronger, you could see us coming in maybe towards the lower end of that original NII guide.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I would just add one thing, Ryan. It's Bruce, that the fact that the loan demand is a little light is, I think, okay, given there's a kind of loop to what we're doing on the deposit side. We're not going to chase loan growth. If therefore there's a little shrinkage in the balance sheet, we can run off our higher cost source of either FHLB funding or broker deposit funding. We're taking full advantage of that, which is helping bolster the NIM. The other thing is with less loan growth, you end up freeing more capital, and that gives us the wherewithal to step up and continue to repurchase stock. I think our stock is great value here. We're all in on that.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thanks for all the color. Just maybe as a follow-up, any color in terms of what you're seeing on the credit side, which seems to be tracking in line with your expectations, and maybe specific to office where we saw a jump in the losses this quarter relative to the past few. Maybe just some color on what's driving that. Was that increased severity? Are you front loading some losses, and when inevitably do you think we could see the allowance in that portfolio peak? Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nLet me start and then flip to Don. You know, I'd say there's no real surprises here, Ryan. We can basically see all the office maturities. We've got kind of bespoke, careful handling on all of the significant exposures that we have. We've been working with the borrowers just to make sure that we can have a win-win situation. You know, we can come through getting the best return on our loans, and the borrowers can stay with their properties through a tough environment. I think that's all going well. If you have a quarter where the charge-offs tick up $20 million US dollars, or the next quarter they go down $15 million US dollars, you're going to kind of see some modest variation around that line.\nBasically, to use a colloquialism, the pig is going through the python and, you know, it's going to take a few more quarters for that to fully work its way through. We're not seeing any surprises, which is the good thing about this. Don, with that, maybe you could pick up.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nNo, I think that's exactly right. We've taken our general office from about $4.2 billion US dollars to $3.4 billion US dollars, so it's actually coming down nicely. The charge offs have actually been modest. Most of the charge offs are where we're selling out of properties and doing AB loan structures, basically deciding to move on. We've had quite a few pay downs also, so it's not all doom and gloom. I go back to what Bruce said.\nIt's name by name, property by property. We've got our workout teams fully involved. It's kind of playing out exactly as we expected it to be. If I took myself back a year and a half ago and looked at the office portfolio, there was a lot of uncertainty. I think there's a lot more uncertainty now. Remember, I've got a huge amount of absorption capacity just in my P&L for any losses that are materializing. Our reserve levels for the portfolio are well above where the severity of losses to date have been. We feel like we're going to work through this, as Bruce said, over the next few quarters, and begin to peek out the loss levels.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I just. Maybe, John, you can add to this, but, you know, in terms of where do we go from here, you can see that the coverage ratio on office remains high, and it's gone from 10.2 reserves to 10.6, but that rate of increase is slowing. You know, we've been taking the full charge off through the P&L and holding the reserve in high levels. At some point, we'll be able to start drawing down on that reserve. I don't want to make the call on that, but just take note that that build is starting to slow. I don't know if it's maybe later this year, beginning of next year, but we will eventually get to a point where we can start drawing down on those reserves, which will be good for P&L.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I agree with all that. I just add a point or two. What's built into the 10.6, you'll see it in some of our slide materials, is an expectation of a 7% to 1% decline in property values. That's, you know, that's what drives this 10.6% reserve for remaining losses.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWhich is more severe than anything we've seen historically, including the Great Financial Recession by a wide margin.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nExactly. I think we should also mention that just given what we put behind us implies another 6% of losses that we put behind us. We've got 10.6 in the reserve, we've charged off about 6%. Say you're up over 16% in terms of coverage. We feel pretty good about it, and that's where we think the losses are going to play out. As Bruce mentioned, the charge offs themselves, maybe they peak later this year or early next, but we think we've got the reserves covered.\n\nRyan Nash\n\nManaging Director of Regional Banks and Consumer Finance, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for the call, guys. They're very good.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. John, maybe just a thought on how much longer negative deposit migration continues. I think the prevailing wisdom is that it's slowing, but just curious to hear your updated thoughts on kind of when and why we might trough.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean we've been saying for a while that things have been decelerating, and I'd say our deposit performance this quarter has been excellent in terms of versus what we were expecting coming into the year. Deposit levels overall look good. DDA flows and low cost to high cost migration overall continuing to decelerate. I think we can point to, if you look at where we are, we were at around 21% of DDA at the end of last year at 31 December, and that flattened out. We were at 21% at 31 March. DDA for us is stabilizing. However, the low cost to high cost again decelerating, and it'll continue to decelerate. What we've been indicating is that's going to continue until you see the first cut out of the Fed, which is historically what we would expect.\nIt's getting to the point where it's having a diminishing impact on net interest margin. When you elevate overall, the contribution that our deposit franchise is delivering for net interest margin trends is excellent. We're feeling very good about the trajectory of DDA stability throughout the rest of 2024 and getting back to growth, because when you think about what's idiosyncratic to us and the strategic initiatives that we're launching, the Private Bank non-interest bearing is accretive to the overall company. We're at maybe around 30% or more, and so that's dragging that number up. I think we have some.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nNew York City Metro offers another opportunity.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nNew York City Metro as well is a really good point. The combination of those strategic initiatives, we have some expectation of GDA flattening out and growing as you get into the latter part of the year, and that underpins the net interest margin quite nicely.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Maybe Brendan, you could add some color.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYep, sure. You know, we've been talking for a couple years now around how since so much of our deposit book comes through consumer that we believe that we've transformed the book to be peer-like or better. I would just reiterate that that's what we're seeing. We were up modestly linked quarter on overall deposits in the consumer book, with some benchmarking that we get from a variety of sources. We believe we were number one in our peer set linked quarter on DDA. On a relative basis, we still have a lot of confidence that we're outperforming peers, and it's demonstrating the franchise quality that we've built.\nWhen you look at the customer level. Customer deposits have actually been quite stable, around $31,000 US dollars per customer, and the remixing as John pointed out is pretty dramatically slowing. I think that's kind of indicating that the COVID burn down is beginning to really run its course. There may be a little bit bute feel pretty good that we're getting kind of to the end of that behavioral cycle. We look at overall deposits on an an inflation-adjusted basis, they're back to basically pre-COVID.\nI think we're kind of nearing the operating floors here for consumer. Given the strength of low-cost deposits. That we have had relative to peers. The other implication is how we're managing interest bearing deposits. I do believe that we peaked in the consumer segment in Q1 in our cost of funds. I believe that because we had $3 billion US dollars in CD rollover in March alone, that were priced around 5%. We've retained 75% of those as they flipped over at materially lower prices between 3% and 4%. You start to see the tailwinds building in that you can imagine the cost of funds in the consumer segment. Potentially beginning to reduce. We'll see how it plays out where rates are at. I do believe we've sort of peaked here in Q1, and it's really driven by the strength of our low cost performance. We don't need to chase high interest bearing costs as a result of that. I feel really good about where we're at.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood. All right, good. Thank you very much for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nMorning. Wanted to see if I can get some additional color on the loan growth commentary. I know you said it could come in at the low end of your initial expectation for the year, and you cited weaker line utilization at this point. Where could you maybe elaborate a little bit, where you're seeing some weakness, in what pockets, and where do you see some ultimate strengthening there in terms of timing? Separately, a similar question around your deposit growth expectation. I think for the full year you had out at around up 1% to 2%. Any additional color you can provide on how you're feeling around that guidance at this point?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'll just start off on loans, and others can add. What we're seeing is that utilization coming in a little lower in the Q1 than was originally expected. Nevertheless, we still see in the second half the interest around putting some working capital to work, and commercial activity starting to pick up is really going to drive a reversal of that utilization trend as you get into the second half. On the retail side of things, we're still seeing good opportunities in relationship mortgage and HELOC, and in the Private Bank where we've gotten a nice start in terms of which is mostly a commercial lending driven amount of activity in the subscription line space, and we see that picking up. All in, H1 playing out about as expected, meaning we may be just a little bit lighter on loans, but we had expected that would be the case, and then the pickup in the second half will be coming out of the commercial business and Private Bank. Maybe any other color?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think that's well said, Don. Any color?\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes. No, I think it's across the board on the commercial side, and part of it is due to the booming bond markets. We're seeing a lot of customers access the bond markets as opposed to draw down existing lines. I think there's a positive to it also, not for loan levels, but customers are running with lower leverage levels because they've been concerned about the economy.\nWe're seeing a broad, more positive view of the overall economy across really wide swaths of our client base. That would indicate that they're going to get more active in things like plant construction, working capital growth, M&A, and that should drive some bounce back in the back half of the year.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAnything from you, Brendan?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, the only thing I would add is maybe just strategically that there's a lot of ins and outs under the COVID, as we run down auto by essentially a billion a quarter. Other non-core is getting replaced with high relationship high returning asset growth, whether it's on the HELOC side or the Private Bank. The headline numbers, if you see around our loan growth, what you have to dig into is the transformative use of capital that we're doing around a handful of areas to have more durable sticky revenue sources that are going to create more cross-sell around fees. Other things over time. We're pleased with how that's going.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYep. You had a question about deposits on the deposit side of things in the Q1. As I mentioned before, we saw DDA flatten out for the first time in many quarters. That is really, really good to see. We also saw low cost flatten out. Overall, we were at 42% last quarter, and low cost were at 42% this quarter, and low cost plus DDA. The deposit trends from a mix perspective have been favorable, and from a quantity level, deposits at the end of the quarter came in higher than expected. That's driven by just strong execution and our strategic initiatives contributing.\nAs we mentioned earlier, New York City Metro and Private Bank, along with the blocking and tackling that Brendan and Don have been at for a number of years to invest in the franchise, all of those investments are paying off, and we do expect to see deposit growth supporting our loan growth in H2 2024.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would just highlight just one last quick piece of color is that very pleased to see the Private Bank now has had kind of two quarters with a billion plus of deposit growth, and we certainly think that that's sustainable and could even accelerate. The ship has landed, and we're off to a great start, and we expect that to continue and even accelerate.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nGot it. All right, thanks Bruce. On the capital front, good to see the resumption in buyback, the $300 million US dollars in repurchases this quarter with seeing Q1 here at around 10.6% or 8.9%. When you dial in the AOCI scenario, how do you look at the likelihood of incremental buybacks from here in terms of a pace of buybacks? Do you think that could be reasonable given where you're sitting right now on the CET1? Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think this capital position that we've generated and have maintained is really creating a lot of flexibility. When you think about our capital waterfall, I mean, our top priority is to put capital to work that is, you know, to support customers and clients that is accretive to our cost of capital over time. That's really what we want to do and that we're expecting to do.\nYou know, and that's what capital allows us, that flexibility. You know, it also cushions against uncertainties. There have been, you know, we look at the macro and being at a very strong capital level to be there for our clients, but also to cushion the downside to the extent uncertainties manifest is another use of a strong capital position. When you get down into kind of other potential uses of the capital, we support our dividend, of course, that's top of the list. If we're left with elevated capital levels, then we're able to give it back to shareholders. We, which we did in the Q1, we're planning to do that here in the Q2, and that flexibility will continue into the second half. As we monitor loan demand and the macro, that'll play into the trajectory of buybacks in the second half.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would also just go back to an earlier comment that we have. I'd say a front-loaded plan this year because there's less loan growth. In fact, there's loan contraction earlier in the year that then turns around, and we start to see loan growth in the second half of the year. That would by definition mean we need capital to support the loan growth, and there'd be less capacity for share repurchases. Anyway, we gave the—you saw the 300 number in the Q1. John mentioned 200 in the Q2, and then we'll see where we get to in the second half. If the loan growth fully doesn't materialize, we can actually just turn around and keep repurchasing the stock.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore\n\nAll right, thanks, Bruce. Appreciate it.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Thanks.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nGood morning. You guys maintain the net charge-off guidance for the year, if we assume no rate cuts this year, could it lead to higher net charge-off than forecasting just given kind of no relief on debt service coverage ratios or loans coming up for renewal at higher rates?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell, what I would say on that is, you know, that the broad credit quality is still very good. If you look at our C&I book, that's in really good shape. Companies weathered the pandemic and leaned our business models, locked in lower cost financing. They're doing more of that now early in the year. We don't really see hotspots even with kind of a higher for longer scenario in C&I. Similarly, in consumer we're still in very good shape. The consumer's benefiting from still strong liquidity levels, a strong labor market, and we haven't seen any adverse migrations in delinquencies or NPAs or anything like that. That's the bulk of the loan portfolio. If you then kind of look at the commercial real estate and the general office in particular, that's relatively small as a percentage of the overall loan book.\nI think there's potentially some trends. We're watching the reports that return to office is picking up, and so maybe there's a little counter trend in office that offsets the kind of additional burden of hire for longer. I think at the margin it's not going to change that charge off number materially.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nPeter, I'll just from my side, you know we made no assumptions in our forecast that we were going to benefit from lower rates because we just didn't know. That's our credit policy. We don't go out on the future curve. We run all our scenarios based on where rates are today. I think you've got a peakish kind of rate environment. If it lasts another couple quarters or even another year, I don't think it's going to make a material difference to the way we forecast charge offs.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThe only point I would add on consumers, our delinquency levels are actually net down year over year, Q1 over Q1, led mostly by Resi. We're seeing really no signs of stress in the book as Bruce Van Saun pointed out. I feel really good, and even in a higher for longer, that unless there's a big economic shock, we're in really good shape.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nJust quickly, just a follow up on office, I guess, I believe that more than half of the maturities in office happen this year. Do you think net charge offs could peak towards the end of this year, maybe early next year and then start to trend lower?\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIt's really hard to forecast that. I think they will be early next year or late this year, probably. It depends how much we extend, how the negotiations go, how much capital is put into some of these transactions. Working through the book loan by loan, I don't have the crystal ball to say exactly when the peak is. Go back to what I said before, we're comfortable how it's kind of progressing and progressing according to our expectations.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning, guys. Just a question on the B side. It's really nice to see the capital markets improvement as you had been thinking, as we're seeing more broadly. I'm just wondering, a couple line items went well, a couple items kind of went backwards. Just wondering just how you're thinking about the fee progression, the drivers, and what's your pipeline look like relative to the better start point here for the Q1 capital markets.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks. Yeah, I'll start off and others can jump in here. I mean, the drivers, I mean, you look at the big three for us, capital markets, card fees, and wealth trust and investment services are all trending well, and we expect to be significant contributors in 2024. Each of those businesses have had significant, significant strategic investment over the years and even more recently. It's really nice to see the investments made in the capital markets business come to fruition.\nWe had a good, strong quarter in the Q1, number one on the league tables on the sponsor side, big rebound from the fourth quarter, and early in the Q2, the pace of activity has continued. We feel very good about the trends there not only for Q2 but for the full year. In the card business, we've made a strategic conversion to Mastercard, and that's driving a number of positive developments there. In the wealth business, as you know, all of the advisor hires, the Clarfeld acquisition from a number of years ago, are all coming together along with the Private Bank to drive those flows throughout 2024. We are feeling quite good about the trajectory for fees.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes. I would just say to your point, Ken, also that there were those three strong areas, and then we had a little bit of weakness in some other areas. Service charges, mortgage, the global markets, FX, and interest rate lines were a little below our expectations. The good news there is there's nothing structural that we worry about. I think we'll see bounce backs over the rest of the year, which will add to our overall growth and our confidence that we'll maintain strong fee performance for the year.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. Just one more follow up on the NI and the swaps. I'm just looking at your pages 25 and 26 from the deck, and it's pretty clear that you're saying the increases you've made to the swap book are all incorporated in the guide. That Q1 to fourth quarter, $35 million US dollars cumulative net interest income impact, is that inclusive of everything that is both active as of now and then will prospectively still come on as the year progresses?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, yeah, it is. What that is, that $35 million US dollars is made up of about $50 million US dollars, primarily driven from active swaps that are outstanding. There's about $20 billion US dollars notional of active swaps outstanding. That grows to about $30 billion US dollars by Q4, and that's incorporated into that number.\nThen it's offset by the positive benefit from non-core of about, call it, $17 million US dollars or so, or $15 to 20 million US dollars coming from non-core. That gets you to the $35 million US dollars drag. When you play it out for the rest of the year, again, broadly, net interest margin trends are coming in a little better. Incorporating all of our swap activity, what you see on page 25 is just the receive-fixed swaps. We actually have pay-fixed swaps in the securities portfolio that are offsetting this, as well as, of course, everything that's happening in the core balance sheet. You have to kind of think, in the broadest sense, that NIM trends are actually coming in a little better.\nAs you get out to later years, you start getting all of this tailwind really baked in, and you start seeing the fact that terminated swaps begin to contribute. It gets to the point where you get out into 2026 and 2027 that a majority, a super majority if you will, of the tailwinds are actually baked in and aren't rate dependent. You have that right in terms of the Q4 components that incorporates everything on the receipt swap side, plus non-core.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, I think. Yeah, go ahead, Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nCan I just add a color there, Ken? I think coming into the year people were concerned about that step up that we had forward starting swaps in Q2 and then more in Q3. The guide that we're giving in our confidence in the NIM outlook incorporate that. We're able to absorb that because higher for longer is better for the core balance sheet. We have some pay fixed swaps we did in the securities book. We're able to absorb kind of that step up in the swap book and continue to maintain confidence in the NIM outlook for the year.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYes, that's great, Bruce. If I can just bring that all together, you broadly affirmed your broader guidance of down 6% to down 9%. We kind of know the Q1 and have the Q2 outlook. What would be the biggest swing factors within that range based on all these points that you're making about the NIM coming in better and now knowing more of this detail about how the swaps work?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yeah, to me it's really volume would be the keys to where we land in that range. You know, do we actually see that strong growth in the Private Bank accelerating? That could be strong for deposits and attractive deposit funding, and then the spread that they're making on their loans is also very attractive. That's totally accretive to front book, back book. Do we see the growth in commercial that we expect come in?\nI think we, based on our kind of pipelines and our conversations with our customers, and also a feeling that the sponsor community right now, there's been a lot of pull forward and refinancing. I think you're going to start to see some more new money deals in the second half of the year. I think those volume factors will have a big impact. The way we kind of see it, looking out the window today, we're highly confident that those things will materialize. I don't know, John, if you want to add anything.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes, I agree with all that. I'd say that even with a little bit of lighter loan demand, we still think that range is good. Maybe it comes at a higher end versus a lower end, but I think that's a swing factor. All the other components of the balance sheet are playing out well. Our outlook for deposit mix and funding mix is underpinning the net interest margin. I would hasten to add that those pay-fixed swaps that we added last quarter in Q1 and also in Q4 have really driven really nice uptake in the securities yields. You see the securities yields up almost 40 basis points in the Q1 and that's offsetting. That's a huge component of our balance sheet and that's a big driver. I should also make clear that the core balance sheet is contributing as well.\nWhere we're seeing front book, back book on the loan side, that is in the range of 300 basis points in the Q1. You're getting front book back on the securities book of around 200 basis points. There are good dynamics in the core balance sheet, and all of the swaps are baked in.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thanks for all that. You said we could come in at the higher end. I think you meant the better end.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah.\nJust for everybody's clarity on that point. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor. Pardon me, I'm having technical difficulties. Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nMorning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I'm curious, when you talk about kind of this medium term net interest margin, what are your thoughts on the size of the balance sheet. I guess specifically, do you think the overall balance sheet will grow, or is there the remixing? Clearly, you're running off the non-core book, growing the Private Bank, but do you envision net balance sheet growth as you look out the next few years? Thank you.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'd say that we do expect the balance sheet to grow. I think we do have a balance sheet optimization program that's turning over a certain portion of the portfolio. When you look at the grand total of the initiatives that we're putting in place, you see interest earning assets are, will be growing in the second half of the year and as you get out over the medium term. I think that we have the opportunity to optimize and grow, and that's our expectation.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would say the kind of flex point is kind of middle of the year when we have done a lot of that heavy lifting on the repositioning, and then we start to see the Private Bank growth and commercial bank, as we discussed, start to kick in. We should see net growth already in the second half of the year, and then kind of looking out 2025 to 2027, we would expect in a strong economy that we could get back to reasonably strong growth rates. Again, being selective where we play, focusing on primary relationships, and primacy. There's no reason we couldn't grow back at nominal GDP the way we did for kind of many years before we hit the pandemic. That plays into Matt, the delivery of positive operating leverage, which is part of how you get your return on equity up. That's the model we'd like to get back to.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\n\nThomas Letty\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC\n\nHi, good morning, this is Thomas Letty calling on behalf of Gerard. Circling back to capital deployment quickly, you guys were pretty busy in 2023 in terms of strategic actions. Can you update us on how you're thinking about further investment opportunities for the franchise, and how you guys prioritize organic growth versus team lift outs or even outright M&A?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. You know, I'd say that right now we have a very full plate in terms of the things that we're investing in, the organic growth initiatives we have. I would not. We're not really looking much at inorganic situations or opportunities. I want to just stay focused on great execution. There's a big payoff for getting these initiatives right, and they're all kind of on the trend line. I would say team lift outs you mentioned is something that we're hinting at at this point because while we have the Private Bank in place and we have kind of Clarfeld as part of a Private Wealth complex, we need to scale up our Private Wealth capabilities to a large extent.\nWe are having discussions with teams and, you know, you can watch this space because I think you'll start to see us build that part of the business out. Again, it'll be prudent. We'll treat them like they're kind of M&A transactions that are accretive, they fit our strategy, and they're good cultural fits. That's kind of the only thing I would say that we're looking kind of outside, and to some extent that's organic. You could argue whether that's organic or whether it's acquisition-like, but we're kind of using the same acquisition lens on these as if they were small deals. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to hit any color on that.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMaybe two quick points. One is that I'd just say the interest in Citizens from a wealth management perspective is at a high like we've never seen before. We're talking to some of the very best wealth managers across all the big brands in the United States. We're going to be very selective. You know, the interest in what we're doing here is quite unique and distinctive. We expect to board some top talent and really give a boost to our wealth strategy. The point around capital that you mentioned though, just to even though we're mentally. Potentially thinking about the return metrics, like we would, an M&A deal, keep in mind that a lift out what we do with the Private Bank really is a very de minimis impact on capital.\nThat's why when you look when we talk about the break even of the Private Bank being second half of this year, it's really just eating through the expense guarantees and getting the revenue throughput. It has a very de minimis impact on capital and the same will be true on wealth lift outs where the teams we bring on board will be much more of expense guarantee mindset and getting them through their revenue curve versus having any real material impact on our capital.\n\nThomas Letty\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC\n\nOkay, great, that's helpful. Thank you. Then just separately on loan growth, C&I demand has obviously been pretty tepid despite pretty healthy growth in the economy as measured by real GDP. Do you think that lack of C&I loan demand is being driven by just general customer caution, or are you guys seeing more competition from non-bank players like the private credit market and others?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think it's just a general caution about what's going to happen in the economy, what's going to happen with rates. I think most of our companies have had good years, but they're still expressing caution. We're actually not losing business to private credit. It's interesting. We're actually, it's coming the other way because there's been opportunities to take loans that are out with private credit and move them over to the bank syndicated lending market, refinance those, and kind of lock in lower cost financing. That's been a big part of the story here in the Q1, and it's continuing into the Q2. Don?\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think that's right. I think the area that we see private credit most active is in the leveraged buyout market, which we don't hold a lot of that on our balance sheet anyway. They're a source of distribution for us. We've actually done a couple deals in the Q1, we've distributed into the private credit market. It doesn't have a balance sheet impact, and that helps drive some of our fee lines.\n\nThomas Letty\n\nResearch Analyst, RBC\n\nOkay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from, pardon me, the line of Dave Rochester with Compass Point. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Rochester\n\nManaging Director, Compass Point\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Earlier you mentioned that the lows were a major driving swing factor of that NII guide. I know you mentioned expecting a little less loan growth this year, but you mentioned possibly hitting the better end of that NII range if, for whatever reason, net loan growth doesn't materialize in the back half, and C&I growth only ends up filling in for the runoff that you're expecting. Can you still hit that NII guide for the year?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYep. I mean, I would say that we're still confident in the range. You know, if things break our way, we could be at the better side of that range. If they don't, we could be at the lower end of that range. I'd still kind of use that as the guardrails. You'd have to have quite a bit of deviation from expectation to fall outside of that range.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, agreed. Just to reiterate that point, what we've been saying is that we have an expectation that we'll come in at the better end of the range for net interest margin based on the trends that we're seeing and the performance we were able to generate in the Q1. You would see us being at the upper end of that range, maybe a tad better on net interest margin. That's offsetting the fact that there's some lighter loan demand that we're also seeing. You put those together and we're right down the middle there in terms of that range. We have got back to the point Bruce just made, and that's our base case now that we're updating. You know, there could be puts and takes to that depending upon the volume point that Bruce made earlier.\n\nDavid Rochester\n\nManaging Director, Compass Point\n\nYep, perfect. All right, thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Konrad with KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nDavid Konrad\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nHey, good morning. Sorry if I missed this earlier, just kind of drilling down on the NIM discussion. Just looking at this quarter, curious on C&I yields dropped around 36 basis points, quarter over quarter. I didn't think this was a heavy swap onboarding this quarter, but just curious where we're looking at that. Maybe in the next quarter before the swaps come out in the Q3.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean, really, what's going on as you've hit it? I'd say just broadly, I would try to make the point that all the swaps are incorporated into the NIM guideline. When you look at the underlying fundamentals of the loan book, the front book, back book is driving an increase in loan yields ex swaps. That's the first point as it relates to when you pull the swaps together from an accounting standpoint. Why there is a negative impact from a swap standpoint is that there was a mix shift. We had the swap notionals didn't change much, but we had some maturities at higher receives being replaced by some forward starters coming in at lower receives. Overall, that net receive rate fell in the quarter, and that's why you ended up with that negative impact just on that line itself.\nOverall, net interest margin was flat for the quarter. When you put it all together with all the components, we had quite a strong net interest margin performance, even incorporating that swap drag.\n\nDavid Konrad\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nYeah, agreed. You talked about the securities book, both the front book, back book, and then the pay floaters coming out. Just curious, your outlook for the growth of the securities book going forward?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean, I think we've gotten to the point where we had the liquidity build late last year, and that's basically largely done. Where you see the securities book right now as a percentage of overall interest earning assets is about where we'll be over time. As we grow loans, we'll probably grow securities and cash on a similar mix basis from a volume standpoint. The percentage of cash and securities to overall interest earning assets at the end of the Q1 is about where we'll be for the rest of the year. I would hasten to add that when you look at that, that's reflective of our deposit franchise and being primarily consumer and having a much higher proportion of insured secured deposits than most peers. If you crank it all through, the way the Fed looks at standardized category one banks, RLCR incorporating all of that at 331 was 120%, which is incredibly strong from a liquidity standpoint. That plays through based upon the balance sheet mix overall, including cash and securities.\n\nDavid Konrad\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KBW\n\nPerfect, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nMaybe as a follow up to the last question, is there any change in how you're thinking through positioning in the medium term with the expectation for fewer rate cuts coming through? You know, with loan growth being a little bit weaker right now, deposit growth being pretty solid, as you noted, are you willing to put on a little bit more duration on the security side? Separately, has it got cheaper to put in some downside protection on NIM as you look into 2025 and 2026? Is that something you're considering right now?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would say on the security side, I'd say there's a couple of objectives being addressed, and it's the interplay between capital, liquidity, and interest rate risk management. What we did over the last couple of quarters is we've added $7 billion US dollars of PayPal swaps.\nThat's paid off quite nicely because of our view that rates were likely not to be down, however many cuts we thought they were at the beginning of the year, five, six, seven cuts, we thought that was probably a little overcooked. We put on those PayPal swaps, in part related to that, but in part related to the multi-year objective to reduce the duration of the securities book, given how it will likely be treated from a capital standpoint. Both of those objectives came into play when we shortened the duration of the securities book, which right now is about 3.8 years. We're likely to continue to shorten the duration of that securities book over time and get down to something closer to three or thereabouts. That's really the driver there. You got to look at the overall balance sheet.\nFrom an overall balance sheet standpoint, it made sense to add a little asset sensitivity in the fourth quarter and the Q1. At 331, we remain an asset sensitive balance sheet when it comes to adding downside protection in the out years. We do note that we have a significant drop-off of receive-fixed swaps when you get out into 2026 and 2027. You know, I think entry points matter. If rates continue to stay elevated and we think there's value there, you know, we want to be careful that we don't give up our upside that the C&I loan book provides us. We'll do that when the entry points are attractive in terms of that trade and locking it in.\nIn general, that would be consistent with something that would be north of 4% of a receive rate out into 2026 and 2027. We'll be opportunistic as the rate environment plays out in terms of how we continue to protect the balance sheet over the medium term.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Very helpful. This morning, one of your peers suggested that they're seeing corporate behavior shifting from NIB to IB. Are you seeing some of your corporate clients take another look at optimizing their NIB balances in the higher for longer rate environment recently?\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think it's pretty much run its course at this point. We've had a little bit of a shift in the book, but it's really slowed down, I think. I think. The clients have been pretty opportunistic in terms of taking advantage of higher rates. I'd say our book and our mix is pretty stable right now, and we expect it to stay here.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'd say overall, you saw our DDA stable at 21% at the end of Q1, 21% at the end of Q4. That's important. That's the first time this has happened in a while. That stability we expect to continue as you get throughout the rest of the year, and actually see growth, as we mentioned earlier, based on other strategic initiatives and the Private Bank contributing.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay. All right.\n\nOperator\n\nPardon me. There are no further questions in the queue. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, well, thanks, everyone, for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support for Citizens. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T event teleconferencing. You may now disconnect. We're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up. We're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

My name is Keeley, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Keeley. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and CFO John Woods will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation located on our investor relations website.\nAfter the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.\nWith that, I will hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was an incredible year in many respects. With the Fed's aggressive moves to subdue inflation, the West Coast bank failures, a surprisingly resilient economy, and several significant proposals from bank regulators, it was important in navigating this dynamic environment to focus first on playing strong defense while continuing to play disciplined offense and take advantage of opportunities in the market. Defense starts with the balance sheet and risk management, and I feel really good about how we ended the year.\nOur capital position is one of the strongest among the large regionals, with a CET1 ratio of 10.6%, CET1 adjusted for AOCI of roughly 9%, and a tangible common equity ratio of 6.7%. Our liquidity position is at an all-time best, with a loan to deposit ratio of 82%, pro forma category 1 LCR of 117%, and 156% liquidity coverage of our uninsured deposits. Our ACL ratio is at 1.59% compared to 1.30% pro forma day one CECL, and general office reserves are at 10.2%. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lending risk appetite and are focused on deep relationships, which deliver stronger relative returns.\nWe are using a non-core strategy to shut off loans and free capital for better opportunities on offense. We have several important initiatives we are driving, such as the private bank buildout, the New York City Metro initiative, our focus on serving private capital, and growing our payments business. These are all tracking well. In particular, we are pleased to see the private bank team reached $1.2 billion US dollars in deposits soon after our launch in late October.\nOur financials over the course of the year came under some pressure, primarily given higher funding costs. Nonetheless, we delivered a 13.5% underlying ROTCE for the full year, with a 95% return of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We continue to see smaller sequential declines in NII than in the prior quarter, as the Fed last hiked in July and the pressure on funding costs has lessened.\nWe saw a modest bounce back in fees, but are very encouraged by the tone of the markets in 2024 to date. Hopefully we start to see our big capital markets pipelines begin to deliver. We took some meaningful cost actions in Q4 to set the stage for very modest expense growth in 2024. We only had the private bank for two quarters, so if you normalize for that, we're actually reducing the legacy expense base by 1.4%.\nI should reinforce, though, that we are doing this while protecting our critical initiatives. Credit outlook continues to track expectations. CRE general office is being carefully managed. Losses are being absorbed in net charge-offs. It's relatively predictable, with few surprises so far away from that. Credit quality is strong. In Q4 we saw a dip in absolute criticized loans and in the ratio, which is a promising sign on the capital front. We did not buy in any stock in Q4 given the charges related to the FDIC special surcharge, as well as associated with our cost initiatives.\nWe expect to be back in the market in Q1, and for that to continue through 2024. Turning to our outlook, we expect NII to continue with modest declines through mid year, and then start to tick up. The exciting news on NIM, NII is that we project meaningful benefits from swap and non-core runoff over 2025 to 2027, which will power higher EPS and returns. We are poised for strong fee growth, led by capital markets. Net charge offs will rise modestly, but we are likely to see ACL releases over the course of the year.\nOur key priorities for 2024 will be to continue to operate with a strong defense, prudent offense mindset. We have many exciting things on our technology, our digital, data analytics, and AI roadmap that we need to deliver on. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We feel we are well positioned for medium-term outperformance. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering great effort in 2023. We know we can count on you again in the New Year.\nWith that, let me turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. I'll start out with some commentary on 2023. We demonstrated excellent balance sheet strength while delivering solid financial performance. We were resilient through a turbulent environment, benefiting from near top of peer group capital levels, and strong liquidity based on stable consumer insured deposits and diversified wholesale funding sources.\nThis strength allowed us to execute well against our multi-year strategic initiatives while opportunistically building out the private bank. On slide 6, you can see that we delivered underlying EPS at $3.88 US dollars, which included a $0.51 US dollars drag from non-core and an $0.11 US dollars investment in the private bank. Full year ROTCE was 13.5% after incorporating these items. Before I discuss the details of the fourth quarter results, here are some highlights referencing slides 4, 5, and 7.\nOn the slides, you can see we generated underlying net income of $426 US dollars million for the fourth quarter and EPS of $0.85 US dollars. This includes $0.06 US dollars for our continued investment in the startup of the private bank and a $0.15 US dollars negative impact from the non-core portfolio. We had a significant increase in the impacts from notable items this quarter, included on slide 4.\nThe largest driver was the FDIC Special Assessment, followed by elevated TOP and severance-related expenses attributable to meaningful headcount reduction. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 11.8%. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underlying ROTCE of 14.8%. Currently, the private bank startup investment is dilutive to results, but relatively quickly this will become increasingly accretive.\nThe private bank is off to a very good start, raising about $1.2 billion US dollars of deposits through the end of the year, of which more than 30% are non-interest-bearing. While our non-core portfolio is currently a sizable drag to results, it continues to run off, further bolstering our overall performance going forward. We ended the year with a very strong balance sheet position, with CET1 at 10.6%, or 9% adjusted for the AOCI opt-out removal, and an ACL coverage ratio of 1.59%, up from 1.55% in the third quarter.\nThis includes a robust 10.2% coverage for general office, up from 9.5% in the prior quarter. We continued to build liquidity during the fourth quarter, achieving our planned liquidity profile. Our pro forma Category 1 bank LCR rose to 117% from 109% in the prior quarter. We also reduced our period end FHLB borrowings by $3.3 billion US dollars quarter-over-quarter to $3.8 billion US dollars, and our period end LDR improved linked quarter to 82% from 84%.\nRegarding strategic initiatives, as previously mentioned, the private bank is off to a great start, and TOP continues to contribute. In addition, New York Metro is tracking well, and we are poised to capitalize on the growing private capital opportunity. Next, I'll talk through the fourth quarter results in more detail. Turning to slide 8 and starting with net interest income, as expected, NII is down 2% linked quarter, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, partially offset by a 2% increase in average interest earning assets.\nAs you can see from the NIM walk at the bottom of the slide, the combined benefit of higher asset yields and non-core runoff were more than offset by higher funding costs and swaps, the net impact of which reduced NIM by 3 basis points to the 3% level. The additional 9 basis point decline to 2.91% was due to the impact of our liquidity build, which was neutral to NII. Our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta increased a modest 3 basis points to 51%.\nAs the Fed has paused and we see continued but slowing deposit migration, we expect this moderating trend to continue until the Fed eventually cuts rates. Overall, our deposit franchise has performed well, with our beta generally in the pack with peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers.\nMoving to slide 9, fees were up 2% linked quarter given improvement in capital markets and a record performance from wealth. These results were partially offset by lower mortgage banking fees. The improvement in capital markets reflects increased activity with the decline in long rates in November, driving a nice pickup in bond underwriting. Equities improved with strength in the back half of the quarter as the environment became more favorable.\nM&A advisory fees benefited from seasonality and an improvement in the environment given the better macro and rates outlook. Although several transactions pushed to Q1, we see capital markets momentum picking up in Q1 as markets are positive, and our deal pipelines are strong. The wealth business delivered a record quarter with higher sales activity and good momentum in AUM growth.\nThe decline in mortgage banking fees was driven by lower production fees as high mortgage rates continued to weigh on lot volumes. The servicing operating P&L improved modestly, while the MSR valuation net of hedging was lower. On slide 10, we did well on expenses, which were down slightly linked quarter, even while including the impact of the continued private bank startup investment.\nOur reported expense of $1.61 billion US dollars increased $319 million US dollars, including notable items totaling $323 million US dollars, namely the industry-wide FDIC special assessment of $225 million US dollars, and the impact of taking cost reduction actions to adjust our expense base heading into 2024. I'll discuss that in more detail in a few minutes. On slide 11, average loans are down 2%, and period-end loans are down 3% linked quarter.\nThis was driven by non-core portfolio runoff and a decline in commercial loans, which were partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower-returning relationships and our highly selective approach to new lending. In this environment, average commercial line utilization continued to decline this quarter as clients remained cautious and M&A activity muted in the face of an uncertain market environment.\nNext, on slides 12 and 13, we continued to do well on deposits. Period-end deposits were broadly stable linked quarter, with an increase in consumer driven by the private bank, offset by lower commercial. The decline in commercial deposits was driven by a proactive effort to optimize the liquidity value of deposits, running off approximately $3.5 billion US dollars of higher-cost financial institution and municipal deposits during the fourth quarter. Absent this BSO effect, deposits would have been up by about 1.5% this quarter.\nOur interest-bearing deposit costs are up 19 basis points, which translates to 51% cumulative. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels, with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 71% insured or secured. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost-effectively manage our deposits in the higher-rate environment.\nWith the Fed holding steady, we saw continued migration of deposits to higher cost categories, with non-interest-bearing now representing about 21% of total deposits. This is slightly below pre-pandemic levels, and we expect the pace of migration to continue to moderate from here, although this will be dependent on the path of rates and customer behavior.\nMoving on to Credit on slide 14, net charge-offs were 46 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter. We were pleased to see that commercial charge-offs were stable linked quarter, and we also saw a modest decline in criticized loans as we continued to work through the General Office portfolio. We saw continued normalization of charge-offs in the retail portfolio, along with seasonal impacts.\nTurning to the allowance for credit losses on Slide 15, our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.59%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the denominator effect from lower portfolio balances. We increased the reserve for the $3.6 billion US dollars general office portfolio to $370 million US dollars, which represents a coverage of 10.2%, up from 9.5% in the third quarter, as we made modest adjustments to modeled loss drivers.\nWe have already taken $148 million US dollars in charge offs on this portfolio, which is about 4% of loans. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level. We feel these assumptions represent an adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns, so we feel the current coverage is very strong.\nMoving to slide 16, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, and if you were to adjust for the AOCI opt out removal under the current regulatory proposal, our CET1 ratio would be about 9%. Also, our tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.7% at the end of the year. Both our CET1 and TCE ratios have consistently been in the top quartile of our peers, and you can see on slide 36 in the Appendix where we stand currently relative to peers.\nIn the third quarter, we returned a total of $198 million US dollars to shareholders through dividends. In the fourth quarter, we paused our share repurchases in light of the FDIC Special Assessment, having exceeded our target capital level for year end. We expect to resume repurchases in the first quarter. Nevertheless, we plan to maintain strong capital and liquidity levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks of our size.\nOn the next few pages, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank, including our private bank and our ongoing balance sheet optimization program. First, on slide 17, the build out of the private bank is going very well and clearly gathering momentum. Following our formal launch in the fourth quarter, our bankers have raised more than $1.2 billion US dollars of attractive deposits, with roughly 75% of that from commercial clients. This is a coast to coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston, and places where we'd like to do more like Florida and California.\nWe have plans to open a few private banking centers in these geographies, and we are opportunistically adding talent to bolster our banking and wealth capabilities, with our Clarfeld Wealth Management business as the centerpiece of that effort. Moving to slide 18, you are all well aware of our efforts in New York Metro. That's going really well. We are hitting our targets there, and on the commercial side, as I mentioned before, we are starting to see momentum building in capital markets.\nThis should translate into a meaningful opportunity for us as the substantial capital backing private equity gets put to work. Next, on slide 19, we continue to be disciplined on expenses. It's important to remember that a key to Citizens' success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new efficiencies, and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better.\nWe've effectively executed our TOP 8 program, achieving a pre-tax run rate benefit of about $115 million US dollars at the end of 2023. We've launched TOP 9 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $135 million US dollars of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2024. The new TOP program is focused on efficiency opportunities from further automation and the use of AI to better serve. We are executing on opportunities to simplify our organization, and save more on third-party spend as well. Last year we exited the auto business, and we also exited the wholesale mortgage business in the fourth quarter.\nWe are also adjusting our expense base through further meaningful actions. In the fourth quarter, we reduced our headcount by about 650, or approximately 3.5%, and we have also taken a hard look at our space needs and are rationalizing some of our corporate and back office facilities. Given all this work, we are targeting to limit our underlying expense growth in 2024 to roughly 1% to 1.5%, with a net decrease in legacy Citizens expenses of 1.3% to 1.5% being offset by investments in the private bank.\nPlaying prudent defense is at the top of our priority list given the challenging year we saw with the turmoil that began back in March and the uncertain macro outlook. We are reworking both sides of the balance sheet through our balance sheet optimization efforts. Slide 20 provides an update on our efforts to remix the loan portfolio through our non-core strategy and optimization on the commercial side, with a focus on relationship-based lending and attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nOn the left side of the page, you'll see the relatively rapid rundown of the remaining $11 billion US dollars non-core portfolio, which is comprised of our shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans. This portfolio is expected to decline by about $6.4 billion US dollars from where we were at the end of the year to about $4.7 billion US dollars at the end of 2025. As this runs down, we plan to redeploy the majority of remaining cash paydowns to a reduction in wholesale funding, with the remainder used to support organic relationship-based loan growth and the core portfolio.\nThe capital recaptured through reduction in non-core RWA will be primarily reallocated to support attractive growth in retail and commercial lending through the private bank. In the broader consumer portfolio, we are targeting growth in the home equity, card, and mortgage, which offer the greatest relationship potential. Moving to the right side of the page, we are also working on the commercial portfolio, exiting lower return credit-only relationships, and focusing on selective C&I lending with multi-product relationship opportunities.\nWe are leading more deals in our front book, improving spreads, while also improving the overall return profile of the book. In the appendix, we have included more information covering the broad contours of our BSO program, including how we are managing our high-quality deposit book, remixing our wholesale funding, managing our securities portfolio, and positioning our capital base against the backdrop of a changing macro and regulatory environment.\nMoving to slide 21, I will take you through our full year 2024 outlook, which contemplates the early January forward curve and a Fed funds rate of 4.25%. By the end of the year, we expect NII to be down 6% to 9%, with changes in our swaps book contributing to about half of that decline and average loans down roughly 2% to 3%. However, we expect spot loan growth of 3% to 5%, with private bank growing over the course of the year and commercial activity picking up in the second half.\nOn the deposit side, we expect spot growth of 1% to 2%, and well-controlled deposit costs with a terminal beta in the low 50% before rate cuts are anticipated to begin in May. We expect our net interest margin to trough around the middle of the year and average in the 2.8% to 2.85% range for the full year, and we expect to exit the year around 2.85%. We've included slide 23, which shows the expected swaps and non-core impact through 2027. In 2024, we expect higher swap expense to be partly offset by the NII benefit from the non-core rundown.\nYou'll find a summary of our hedge position in the Appendix on slide 38, which demonstrates how the 2024 headwind, which is incorporated in our 2024 NII guide, reverses to a substantial NII tailwind in 2025 and beyond as the current forward curve is realized. For example, there's an expected improvement in NII contribution from swaps in 2025 year-over-year of approximately $371 million US dollars, with continued meaningful benefits in 2026 and 2027. Non Interest Income is expected to be up in the 6% to 9% range, depending upon the market environment, led by a nice rebound in capital markets.\nWe expect expenses to be up about 1% to 1.5%. Excluding the private bank, this would be down 1.3% to 1.5%. We have provided a walk showing the components of our 2024 expense outlook on slide 22 to provide more context. NCOs are expected to average about 50 basis points for the year as we continue to work through the general office portfolio and expect further normalization in retail.\nGiven macro trends, our remixing of the balance sheet through commercial BSO and the non-core strategy, and expectations for modest portfolio growth, we will likely see ACL releases over the course of the year. We plan to resume share repurchases in the first quarter in the $300 million US dollars range, with more over the course of the year depending upon market conditions and loan growth. Taking that into account, we still expect to end the year with a strong CET1 ratio of about 10.5%, which is at the upper end of our target range.\nPutting it all together, we expect to return to sequential positive operating leverage in the second half of the year, with PPNR troughing in the second quarter 2024. Moving to slides 24 and 25, as Bruce mentioned, we are well positioned to deliver attractive returns as we look out over the medium term. We have a clear path to achieve a 16% to 18% ROTCE. We expect to generate solid returns from our legacy core business, with a substantial NII tailwind given swap portfolio runoff.\nWe expect to deliver positive operating leverage, with strong expense discipline, and we are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully given the investments we've made in our capabilities over the past few years. We also expect a meaningful contribution from the private bank as it matures, and a tailwind from the runoff of the non-core portfolio as we redeploy that capital and liquidity.\nWe will continue to operate with a prudent risk appetite and focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to shareholders through our repurchase program, targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40% over the medium term. We expect our CET1 ratio to remain within a target range of 10% to 10.5%, about 50 basis points higher than our prior target range given continued uncertainty in the macro environment. On slide 26, we provide the guide for the first quarter.\nNote that the first quarter has seasonal impacts due to lower day count impact on revenue, as well as taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses. To wrap up, we demonstrated the resilience of the franchise and maintained strong discipline in 2023 as we work to position the bank to continue to deliver attractive returns to shareholders over the medium term.\nWe delivered solid results this quarter, and we ended the year with a strong capital, liquidity, and funding position. That puts us in an excellent position to drive forward with our strategic priorities and take advantage of opportunities that may arise. We are continuing to optimize the balance sheet, and we are focused on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business and improve performance over the medium term.\nWith that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\nThank you, John. Keeley, Let's open it up for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If you wish to ask a question, please press one then zero on your touchtone phone. You will hear an acknowledgement that you've been placed into queue, and you can remove yourself from queue at any time by repeating the one zero command. We ask that if you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the numbers once again. For any questions, please press one then zero at this time.\nYour first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with DA Davidson. Your line is now open.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nGood morning. Can you guys provide some color on the drivers to that spot loan growth, including some details about the contribution from the private bank, and what you're thinking in terms of commercial line utilization?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'll just start off, and others can add. I think those are the two drivers. As you mentioned, when we look out into primarily the second half of 2024, we are seeing, you know, an expectation that commercial activity will pick up. Loan utilization is flattening out here. We expect early in the year, and then that'll be part of the driver. We also have had some BSO activity in late 2023 and early 2024 that we expect to moderate in the second half of the year as well.\nYou're going to see a number of nice tailwinds on the commercial side. On the consumer side of things, we are seeing opportunities with good relationship business in the mortgage space and in HELOC, which has been a very nice and consistent driver for us. Those are the main drivers. Of course, broadly the private bank, which has gotten off to a great start on the deposit side of things in late 2023, we're going to see some of that loan opportunity pick up in 2024. Those are the big, I would say, components of seeing that spot loan.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMaybe Brendan, you could talk a little bit about what you expect for private bank lending?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would start by just a quick comment on Q4 for the private bank. Obviously, check strong deposit print, and I think demonstrating that the strength of the strategy can be very diversified, and led by wealth and deposits, and not necessarily requiring low interest lending to dislodge the relationship. We're really excited about the print and the start by the team. Having said that, we do expect lending to pick up steam in 2024, given the interest rate environment.\nMortgages are obviously challenged on the retail side. Lending has been more heavily led by commercial lending, which has skewed in the private equity and venture space, which we're really comfortable with, the risk appetite, and the profile of that business. It's been critical to start to dislodge personal private banking relationships from the ecosystem of private equity and ventures. We're off to a really good start. I suspect, given the forward curves, that the first half of the year will continue to be led by current commercial, principally in private equity and venture lending.\nOver time, we expect the loan book to be much more balanced and have more retail lending, home equity lending, and mortgage lending coming in at scale as the rate environment dictates opportunities there. We also expect to lean into partner loan programs to help connect the corporate side of private equity and venture with private banking and personal banking. You'll start to see an asset diversification over time. The first half of the year we would expect it to still be more heavily weighted on the corporate side.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, great. Don, anything to add on the commercial side?\n\nDonald McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think if you look back in the fourth quarter, the things that dampened our loan growth a little bit were about 50% utilization, 50% BSO, with a little bit of bond execution sprinkled in there. People that were carrying slightly higher balances on the commercial side, a lot of them went to the bond market when rates kind of backed off in the last six weeks of the year, that's continued into this year.\nI think the particular area that we're excited about, as we get into the back end of 2024, the private equity space. I mean, that group of clients has been basically dormant for almost two years. There's lots of conversations going on. We're hearing from most of those customers that they expect to get a lot more active, and that will drive utilization on our capital call lines, which is at an all-time low right now. That's what the real driver is, right?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nPeter, did you have another question?\n\nPeter Winter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nYeah, just a quick follow up. It's helpful. On just the fee income you talked about up 6% to 9%. You did mention, you know, the pipeline is strong for the capital markets, just if you could give some color on the puts and takes on the fee income side.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJohn?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, just kind of the main drivers of that. It's basically a continuation of some of the trends we're seeing in Q4 2020 where Capital Markets is starting to pick up again. Pipelines are incredibly strong, and I think that the lead driver seems to be M&A advisory that's picked up in Q4, not only due to seasonal factors, but just in terms of a more constructive backdrop.\nWe're also seeing as you get out into 2024, pick up in underwriting both on the bond side and on the equity side, and solid contributions from Global Markets as well. Those are some of the drivers as we see them beginning in Q4, continuing in Q1 with excellent pipelines, and playing out over the rest of 2024.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou might add something on wealth, Brendan. I don't know if you want to, but we expect continued really strong growth on wealth fees.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWe do. It's been a year of slow and steady progression, continuing to get all-time highs in the wealth management business. Given the private bank investment, 2024 is going to be a really important year. We're out in the market looking to attract a lot of talent. We've made a number of key hires in Q4, both on the leadership side, as well as at the advisor side. Getting the ecosystem of the bankers that we hired in the summer connected with top, in-market wealth managers is critical for us.\nWe're rebranding the platform to Citizens Private Wealth Management to connect the private banking and wealth side together, hand in glove. We do expect steady and significant growth out of wealth over time, really connected into the private banking ecosystem. We're pleased with the momentum, but there's a lot more to come, we hope, if we execute well on the private banking initiative.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nVery good.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nJust on mortgage banking?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJohn hit some highlights on Q4 for mortgage production was down a bit. Our underlying servicing business was up modestly, and then our hedge performance was down over a big quarter in Q3 and Q4. I think as we look at the outlook going forward, we obviously announced the exit of the wholesale mortgage business. If you rewind the clock back to prior to the Franklin American acquisition, we were under scale in mortgage and really were trying to diversify the business.\nWe've done that really successfully. In hindsight, it was an incredibly well-timed acquisition, and we performed exceptionally well through the COVID years. As we exit that period of time and look forward, our MSR concentration versus peers is really strong. It's a little bit on the high side. We looked at our business model and said wholesale mortgage, we're one of the only lenders in there. The margins were really challenged, and the outlook for rates doesn't necessarily suggest a boomload of refi activity in the medium term.\nWholesale mortgage being a non-relationship business, we decided that it was time to move on, and we're committed to correspondent, we're really committed to retail mortgage for relationship lending. Despite rates coming down, we do expect the mortgage market to be, call it, a $2 trillion US dollars originations platform in 2020, which is about a normalized mortgage market. We should see some modest uptick in originations, and with rates coming back down, the servicing business might see a little bit of offsetting pressure.\nI think we feel like we're in the right zone in terms of mortgage performance with where we're at in Q4, within a range of normal volatility. We're going to make sure that we're executing on driving up returns higher, and making sure we're allocating balance sheet to deep relationship-based customers, whether it's in the private bank or in the core retail business, to continue to offer that product to our very best customers.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes, to wrap it all that up in 2024, we do expect volumes to improve as well as margins. That's another tailwind as you get into next year in terms of the production business.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, Peter. Next question.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, DA Davidson\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nMatthew O’Connor\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Can you guys elaborate a bit on the expense cuts that you did this quarter, in terms of where they're coming from? Obviously you're leaning in on the private bank, but kind of exact how do you make sure you're not cutting too much given these initiatives and the ones that you've had in prior years?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll start off here. I think we have been very, very diligent in kind of looking at staffing levels across all the different activities in the bank and seeking efficiencies. There's always the playbook where if you kind of eliminate your bottom x percent of performers and redistribute some of the work, you can kind of run a little leaner. We've gone through that exercise to make sure that we won't be caught short in any areas.\nWe carved out important areas like risk, audit, and some of the control areas, so they were spared from taking reductions. We also carved out the areas that are important investment activities. You know, the roll up of all that math comes to a relatively modest number, 3.5% of total staff count. I think we're kind of lean and mean, and in good fighting shape as we enter into 2024.\n\nMatthew O’Connor\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Just separately, the deposit growth that you've had from the private bank. Have you disclosed what that rate is? I think 1/3 of them are non-sparing. What's the blended rate? I guess are you using promotions, whether it's rate or other stuff, to help grow those? Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWe haven't really talked about that, but I mean, I think we should look at is that this is accretive to the low-cost profile top of the house. When you look at DDA and operating accounts, it's extremely attractive mix that we've seen come in early days, so we're extremely encouraged about our expectations for this to be a, you know, a very sort of solid franchise deposit fully funding our loan growth that we expect on that side of, on the other side of the balance sheet. Yeah, I would say the mix is quite good, and overall cost very attractive and accretive to top of the house.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThere's a slide 11, Matt, that lays out a pie chart of the character of the deposits. DDA and then checking with interest, which are very low cost, roughly 40%, very little term, and most of that in kind of liquid savings and money market with no promotions that are outside the norm of what we're offering to the core franchise.\n\nMatthew O’Connor\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nJust a couple questions on the credit front, charge offs came in at around 46 basis points in the fourth quarter. You expect an average of about 50 basis points overall in 2024. Can you maybe talk to us about where you expect losses to peak and to hit that 50 basis points for the full year and what gives you confidence that they can remain there? Similarly on the reserve front, I know you added to reserves in the fourth quarter, but you implied you could see releases in 2024. What do you need to see to drive the releases? Thanks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'll start and then John can give some more color. I think that the kind of push that we've seen higher over the course of 2023, that could continue a little bit higher into 2024. Going from 46 to 50 is kind of twofold for the most part. One is the CRE general office. You know, we're watching the maturity wall and we're on top of all these credits very carefully, and we're working them out. As I said in my opening remarks, a lot of this is fairly predictable. We can look ahead six months, nine months. We can kind of anticipate where we might have to do some restructurings and where we might take charge offs. I think we have good visibility into that.\nIt's a long process on CRE general office. I think we'll have this with us all through 2024 and likely into 2025 as well. Again, the important thing is I think we're well reserved for it, and it's baked into that charge-off run rate. The second area is really just continued normalization on the consumer side, which has been extremely slow and gradual, but we're still slightly better than where we were pre-Covid. That'll just gently push up as we go forward, and that would be the other driver, I'd say. The good news is that in C&I we're not really seeing any kind of hot spots, and we feel that we have a pretty good outlook for broad C&I through 2024.\nOn the question of the ACL, you know, this year we've been consistently building each quarter and, you know, if you get to the circumstances scenario where there's likely a soft landing or a very shallow recession, we've put away enough reserves that I think we will be able to start to draw that down. Time will tell on that. You can already see that we've been starting to kind of reduce the amount of kind of reserve build from absolute provision over charge offs. In this quarter it was flat. It was $171 US dollars over $171 US dollars.\nEven if charge offs can tick up a little bit, I think it's likely that you could see the need for provision building from having provisions exceed charge offs reduce as we go through the year. I don't know, John, if you want to add any color to that?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, just a little bit. I think that all makes sense. I'd say that, you know, the drivers of where you want to be with your reserve is, you know, we have a relatively conservative economic environment predicted over the horizon, which is a mild to moderate adverse outcome. That's built in. We think that we're seeing stabilization in terms of the performance of the back book and our loan book.\nWe see visibility into the charge-off outlook, and then the build, which could be the other driver of ACL when you're building loans. What we're rotating away from and building into, there's actually a net flat to improved profile in terms of the very high-quality origination front book in the private bank and commercial that we're putting on the portfolio in 2024, while other stuff that maybe a higher ACL load is running off in the back book. Those are the things I would just add to what Bruce said.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. Separately, on the capital front, you indicated that you expect to resume buybacks in Q1 2024, and maybe if you could help us possibly quantify the pace of buybacks, that's fair to assume. Could you be back at that $200 million US dollars quarterly rate, or how should we think about that? Thanks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell, at this point we've given a kind of firm estimate for the first quarter of about $300 million US dollars. We probably, with benefit of 2020 hindsight, could have bought some in the fourth quarter, but water under the bridge for 10.6. We have a little above target capital to kind of play with, if you will, in the first quarter. In the first half of the year, we're not going to have much net loan growth.\nNon-core is going to be running down, and we don't really see the flex in lending coming till the second half in the private bank and commercial, as John indicated. I think the buybacks would tend to be more first half oriented. A lot can happen over the course of the year, so I defer from giving a kind of quarterly run rate. Just to say we'll have a solid print in the first quarter, and likely more in the second quarter, and then we'll see how the year plays out.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I just would reiterate our capital priorities are a strong dividend, and if we have opportunities to put capital to work, you know, serving clients and driving great, really strong risk-adjusted returns, that's our preference. When that moderates a bit, that's when you see us give it back in the form of buybacks. We're in an extremely strong position to be able to have the opportunity.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOne last add-on point to your add-on point is I would say I'm really happy to be buying my stock at these levels because we think it's great value.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell said.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay, great, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to the line of Ebrahim Poonawalla with Bank of America. Your line is open. Hey, good morning.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nI guess maybe one question for you, Bruce. As you think about capital deployment, you've been pretty busy last year in terms of the strategic actions. Just wondering where do you see, like, as you look at investment opportunities for the franchise? Are you done for now in terms of putting the big pieces in place. How are you thinking about new things and new investments that we could see either on an organic basis, team lift outs, or just outright M&A.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes. Yeah, good question. I would say the orientation right now is for backing our organic initiatives. We've mentioned the private bank, and we need to continue to invest there to get that off the ground and make it a big success. We've been investing in the New York marketplace, and certainly to get your brand awareness up is an expensive proposition, but we're doing that, and that is showing very good results. There are certain businesses like Payments that are, I think, going through a lot of change, and that change always presents opportunities.\nMaking sure that we're investing to position ourselves to deliver for clients and continue to gain, share, and grow that business. Those are the things that kind of come top of mind that we're very focused on. I think in terms of acquisitions in our fee-based capabilities, we've made significant investments over time in commercial, and so our M&A size and scale is at quite a good level. We could be selective. I don't see anything imminent, but there are possibilities that if there's an industry vertical that makes sense, maybe we could do something there, and then wealth, we've been looking at trying to buy some things.\nWe bought Clarfeld, which has turned out to be a fantastic acquisition. I think the orientation the rest of this year is to really go the lift-out route and to bring teams onto the platform. We're hard at work on that to try to scale up Citizens Private Wealth. I would say, you know, the franchise is in good shape. There are a lot of initiatives in place that will, I think, have us outperform from a growth standpoint relative to our peers. I think we can sit back and be selective in terms of deploying capital inorganically.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThat is helpful, and I guess just one follow up in terms for whatever reason, when you look at your NII fee revenue guide in particular, just maybe talk to us around expense flex. If some of these things don't play out as expected, should we anticipate some level of like expense offset or are you kind of pretty tight given just everything you've done on the cost side?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean there's always opportunities to look to flex your expense base down. I think we've been pretty hard at it here to get to this level, and I'd say the strategic initiatives offer you some flexibility. Again, if you're looking at the medium term and the longer term to try to scrape to come up with $0.03 US dollars to $0.05 US dollars or something of that magnitude, if that puts at jeopardy your kind of trajectory on things like private bank, it wouldn't appear to be a really advisable decision to take.\nWe will always look at that. You know, you can trust us to do that. At this point, you know, we're trying to manage for both near term delivery, but also with an eye towards the medium term, and really getting that ROTCE back into the kind of targeted range.\n\nEbrahim Poonawala\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGood morning, everybody. John, I think you've got five right cuts built into the guidance. Just maybe a broad thought on sort of where the balance sheet is geared now. In other words, I guess more specifically, how would more or fewer cuts impact the NII outlook?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would say that we're very close to neutral one way or the other, really up or down. I'd say that, you know, I think what's important to the outlook is we have deposit migration continuing to moderate every quarter, and it continued this quarter. We expect to continue next quarter. You know, as our outlook is, didn't get that first cut, it still doesn't completely go away. We have an expectation the first cut comes in the second quarter and we get down to around 4.25.\nI think that's still holding around. Looking out the window today and in the neighborhood of what the forward curve might indicate, I would say that if there's a slight bias, if the cuts came in a little fewer this year, that would probably be okay. Nevertheless, that first cut is key. A general normalization in an orderly fashion over time is what we think is very good for our balance sheet. Again, staying around neutral, with maybe a slight benefit if rates come in a tiny bit higher in 2014.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThe other aspect to that too is just we've had an inverted curve for a long time. When you think about the medium term, presumably we get back to a point where there's a normal yield curve, which also benefits NII.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect, thank you. Also, John, for you. The liquidity, pardon me, the liquidity building efforts have introduced some noise into the margin rate, even if they've been NII neutral. I guess just looking at the guidance, presumably that's gonna be less of a factor going forward. Just maybe a thought on sort of where we are in that journey.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yeah, I think we're basically, we've achieved our objectives with respect to our liquidity bill. Just the headline there, and we believe a very strong kind of position being around 117% of the requirements for category one banks. I think that matches our objectives, and therefore going forward, you will not see liquidity being a headwind to net interest.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think that was something we were talking about in the back half of the year. It affected us in Q3, it affected us in Q4. If you actually look at, I think one of the dialogues on these calls, way back, are we going to exit the year close to 3% underlying. Well, we actually did do that.\nThe underlying performance on our NIM was quite good. It only dropped three basis points, which is showing up well relative to everybody who's reported so far. That liquidity build, which is neutral to NII, took us down another 9. We end up exiting closer to 290 than to the 3. That liquidity build is kind of done, so we can just focus on not having that, excising that from the conversation, and just focusing on what the underlying drivers are from here on out.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. One follow-up, you mentioned the PPNR bottoming in the second quarter. I'm just wondering, do you expect NII to bottom, cool, coincident with that or would there be a slight timing disconnect based on how the swaps work through?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean I think that is the driver basically that we are looking at NII being, you know, that's 75% of our revenues. Yeah, the NII is going to bottom in that quarter as well.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIn, you know, Q3, Ken, then you'd have other things kicking in like fee growth, strong growth starting to kick in. Even though the swap is incremental forward starting swaps, then I think you'd have to look at the whole dynamic around what we expect to see in the business performance that would allow us to absorb that.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, NIM for sure, I'll quote her later. PPNR troughs in Q2.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nWait, I'm sorry, John, can you just clarify that again? They don't want to speak over.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think we were mentioning that the NIM trough is Q3, but the PPNR NII trough is in Q2.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, got it. Just looking out at the longer term guidance you gave, just talking about the 3.25 to 3.40 medium term NIM range, it seems like that most of that can be gotten from the three buckets that you show just getting curing from the fourth quarter level. I see that you put in a 3.25 end of 2025 fed funds rate.\nI'm just wondering how you expect deposit costs and just beta to trajectory. I know there's a lot of moving parts in there too because of the growth that you're expecting as well, and mix changes. Can you maybe just start by talking about if you're getting to the low 50s on the way up, just how that expects to act influences that meeting medium term NIM range. Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, it's a big driver. I think the big puts and takes there, you've got the swap portfolio, which is a big tailwind as we've talked about. If you go over to the deposit side of things, we are looking at deposit migration stabilizing around mid 2024. After that first cut in May, you see deposit migration stabilizing, and then as cuts continue, we start flipping to down beta type of expectations versus the up beta. We look at the early 2000s as being instructive for a lot of this, where that tightening, that loosening cycle or rate cutting cycle would imply a 35% to 40% down beta for the first, call it, 100 to 150 basis points.\nThat's a good, I think, you know, yardstick to think through our expectation that in the early part of the cycle our down beta will be less than the full up beta. Our full up beta is low 50s. Nevertheless, we're going to get big contributions from down beta, and that will grow over time, getting close to where the up beta ended up.\n\nKenneth Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Okay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nConsumer Finance Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. I just had one follow-up question. You know, putting all your answers together, John and Bruce, about the outlook for 2024 and the underlying dynamics of net interest income, it seems to me that if we put together what you just said to Ken about deposit betas in Slide 23, that despite the exit rate of your net interest margin forecasted to be in the fourth quarter, based on everything that you've told us, it seems like you'll see a three handle in terms of that underlying NIM that Bruce discussed, you know, in 2025. Is that, you know, a good bridge to thinking about where you're exiting in 2024 and then that medium-term range that you gave us?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell, I would say, well, we're exiting 2024 at 285. We've indicated that's one where fourth quarter of 2023 is going to fourth quarter of 2024 will be. That is headed to the 325 to 340 range. You would see us, you know, crossing that 3% level in 2025 sometime on the way to 325.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nConsumer Finance Research Analyst, UBS\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nHead of Large Cap Bank Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nBruce, you guys have done a great job from when you went public to where you are today in transforming this company. I'm curious on your medium term outlook for ROTCE, on the improvement you highlight that the private bank you're targeting at 20% to 24% ROTCE. Can you share with us the mix of how you get there? Meaning, you know, what percentage of revenue do you think you need to reach from fees versus net interest income, and then also what kind of pre-tax margin do you think you'll need to get to get to that 20% to 24% target?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, maybe I'll just start off with that. Gerard, it's John, I mean I think you know our fees to total revenues are in the neighborhood of 25%. I'd say over the medium term you're going to see that migrate closer to 30%, and that would be consistent with the balance sheet optimization efforts where all of the capital we're putting to work on the front book would have relationship opportunities with attractive deposit and fee-based opportunities associated with it at a much greater rate than what we're seeing running off in the back book. That's going to drive that fee percentage up closer to 30%.\nYou know, I think that the returns that we expect from a, call it, you know, the ROTCE, the ROTCE return that you're seeing in the medium term is consistent with a return on tangible assets that's north of 1%. You see that getting closer to 125 basis points as a way to think about what the returns are on the asset side.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJohn, you're answering at the comprehensive company on that MTO page. I think Gerard is focused more specifically on the private bank mix, but you know, there I would say it will build over time, the fee percentage as we kind of get the wealth cross sell. You know, we should at least be at kind of where we are today in 75, 25, and then I think there's kind of upside from that over time. I do think the spread on the private bank assets is very significant today given the high percentage of low-cost deposits in there.\nWe haven't really seen the loans come on in size yet, but generally capital call lines tend to be priced with a nice return, and I think some of the other business lending and HELOCs and things that were maintain our price discipline and achieve a good spread there as well. I think if you looked at kind of mature private banking models, to have a 20% to 25% return on equity is realistic. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add to that at all.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think it's well said, so I'll repeat it. I just would reiterate that I think the performance in Q4 is in line with what we would have hoped for in terms of the financial profile to drive that type of return over time. Obviously, more loan growth on the comm, and a lot of it will come down to our ability to drive wealth at scale and recall.\nOur targets at the end of 2025 are $11 billion US dollars in deposits, $9 billion US dollars in loans, and $10 billion US dollars in AUM. If we deliver that profile and kind of expense composition, the profitability profile we're seeing so far is aligned with that return. We're going to work hard to deliver it, and hopefully our performance from Q4 sustains in the first half.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nHead of Large Cap Bank Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. Following up, Bruce, maybe some thoughts from your perspective on what we might see in this Basel III endgame. Obviously there's a lot of talk about scaling it back and maybe it's going to be a delayed implementation because of all the changes. There's a big focus, as you know, we all know, on the operating risk in the capital markets businesses, but for the regional banks it seems like it's more that numerator, including the unrealized bond losses than the available for sale portfolio. Any thoughts for Citizens how you might benefit from a scale back of what was initially proposed and what will be the final proposal?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would say that for banks of our size, the things that we focus the most on have been RWA increases to certain lending activities that would potentially reduce the supply, the appetite to lend in those areas because it wouldn't, it would erode the economics. Things like mortgage lending to lower income people or credit card lines attracting capital, and small business lending attracting more capital. I think those flaws in the proposal have been well chronicled, and even though they don't result in a meaningful RWA inflation for us, I mean we're stewards of the US economy, and we'd like to see those things adjusted.\nThat's been for kind of banks our size. I think the kind of main thing at top of the list, I think the operational risk kind of increases affect the bigger banks more. Nonetheless, they seem to have a fairly big bump on the scale. That likely, I think, we'll have a rethink, and maybe those come down to some extent. That would benefit everybody, but probably the big banks more than banks like ourselves.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMaybe just add, just a quick add to that is that even if it had gone, even if the Basel III endgame had gone through as initially proposed, a very modest impact from a RWA standpoint on us. As it relates to AOCI, as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting that likely survives. In our case we are. We're at 9% by deducting the AOCI opt in, and that's an incredibly strong number. We sort of think about what's going on there as really behind us and really in the run rate, if you will, when it comes to that.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think that's a good point that John just raised, Gerard, is that given the strength of our capital position, both pre and post AOCI, we can absorb any of these regulatory capital impacts, not really worry about them. Many of our peer banks are still kind of catching up, getting in position, and having to kind of hold back on capital distribution, which is really not something that we're worried about given the capital strength. We're more able to kind of play offense and not have to play catch up, which is a good position to be in.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nHead of Large Cap Bank Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAbsolutely. In fact, Bruce, you bring up a good point in your guidance on the medium term for the total company legacy core ROTCE of 15% to 17%. You guys point out significant share repurchases. Should we interpret that to be a combined dividend payout and buyback ratio of 100% of earnings, then once we get the final rules and we're all set to go? Is that a fair number for you guys? Because you are well capitalized.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIf you go back to the time of the IPO and the number has been over 100 and under 150, all over the place. If you just looked at like a 10-year average, almost 10 years, it's about 75%. You know, having enough capital to actually grow your business and lend to customers, you have to certainly work that into the equation.\nYou know, to the extent, you know, as John stated, priorities are dividends, number one, using capital to support organic growth, principally in the loan book, and then repurchasing shares. I think if we get our returns into that level, we'll be returning high levels of our earnings back to shareholders, both through the dividend and through consistent share repurchases. We should be viewed as a capital return story.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think we had a 95% capital return performance in 2023, so it's in that 75% to 100% range over time.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nHead of Large Cap Bank Equity Research, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. I appreciate the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning. Just a follow up to the down beta question on deposits. A few of your peers have talked about how commercial deposit rates are coming down or would come down quickly. There's likely to be some more pressure on the consumer side continuing from here. They've talked about basically consumers still moving towards higher rate accounts. Given that you do have a big core consumer deposit franchise, I was wondering what you're seeing right now and what your expectations are on consumer behavior as rates come down.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nBrendan, you want to take that?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, sure, I'll take that. Well, let me start big picture and then give you a little color on Q4 and expectations. We've been talking for years that the investments we've made in transforming the consumer deposit base have truly been transformational for our performance. I think that's what we're seeing here. Now that our consumer book is performing at a worst case peer like, but certainly there are signs that we may be outperforming peers. We look at benchmarking, our DDA balances were almost 300 basis points better than peer average last year in 2023, and our net deposit growth was actually a couple hundred basis points better than peers as well.\nWhile our betas have been modestly better. You look at that equation, better deposit growth, better beta, really grounded with an outperformance in DDA. That's a good place to be. I expect regardless of what consumer behavior conditions we face in 2024 for our relative outperformance to sustain, and we're seeing those signs already. Having said that, on an absolute basis, what we saw in Q4 was a slowdown in consumers' deterioration and excess stimulus. It's still going on a path of normalizing.\nWe're still seeing that continue, but the pace of normalization has begun to slow, and I think we should see that sustained in the first half of the year as rates start to tick down. On the interest-bearing side, competitive dynamics haven't really shifted yet. It's still fairly aggressive out there on CDs and money markets. We believe we've got more levers than most with Citizens Access as a platform where we can contain interest-bearing growth.\nOn the higher cost side, not sort of put contagion, so to speak, into the full retail bank to reprice all, all of our interest-bearing deposits gives us a real competitive advantage. We're thinking about the private bank in some ways in a similar way. We've got all the tools to compete. We do expect if the rate curve follows as projected, interest-bearing deposits on the consumer side will start to come down as well. We're starting to think about a mix of balances.\nWe've got a lot of CDs that potentially can roll over here in the first part of the year that will be looking to have more balance and put some of those balances into liquid savings to give us more levers to manage down betas over the course of the year. All that is to say, I feel pretty good about how we are situated. We're starting to see good dynamics with the consumer, expect to continue, and I've got a lot of confidence that we'll outperform peers in whatever environment comes our way.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, great, thank you. Just to follow up on credit, given the move lower in long end rates, can you talk about anything you're seeing in the non-office CRE Portfolio, like maybe in multifamily, how do things like the debt service coverage ratios look today versus a couple of months ago? How do you expect that to trend given where the forward curve is right now?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would just answer broadly that we feel good about the multifamily portfolio, its characteristics, its relatively small loan sizes, a lot of fixed term loans, good diversification geographically. We, I think, felt that loss content there was going to be quite low. Now, obviously, with rates ticking down, that provides more kind of air in terms of the distance between the debt service coverage ratio and kind of cash flows. We feel that it's helpful, but we weren't worried all that much previously. Anyway, that's-\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would just hasten to add that it's very different than general office. I mean, the capital markets are still active in the context of buying and selling multifamily properties, and that'll just provide further tailwind to that activity.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThere's a lot of liquidity there.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nVice Chairman and CFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, there's liquidity there. Buyers and sellers are still transacting, so it's just a very different night and day situation compared to general office. Certainly, rates, which won't have much of an impact maybe on the general office, will very much have a positive impact on the multifamily construct that was already okay to begin with.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, very good.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions in queue. With that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, great. Keeley, thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and support. Have a great rest of the week. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. We're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question and answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristen Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristen, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Greg. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and CFO John Woods will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our investor relations website.\nAfter the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures. It's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation, and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Kristen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call. Today we continue to execute well through a challenging environment. Our focus has been on playing strong defense and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During the quarter, we grew our CET1 ratio to 10.4%, near the top of peers, while still buying in $250 million in stock, with non-core loan runoff of $1.4 billion and deposit growth of $500 million in the quarter. We lowered our spot loan-to-deposit ratio to 84% at quarter end. We focused on building up our liquidity even further, given geopolitical uncertainty and the regulatory direction of travel, adding almost $4 billion to cash and securities. We also built our ACL further to 1.55%, well above our pro forma day one CECL reserve of 1.3%, with our general office reserve now at 9.5%.\nWhile the balance sheet has been a principal focus, we continue to execute well on our strategic initiatives, which should drive strong medium-term performance. Our Private Bank is being built out. We had a soft launch during the back half of Q3, and we brought in around $500 million in deposits and investments. Full launch is scheduled over the next several weeks. We're executing well on our New York City Metro push, our deposit strategies, our TOP programs, our ESG initiatives, and our payment strategy. Our underlying EPS for the quarter missed the mark slightly at $0.89, as several capital markets deals slipped from Q3 to Q4 given late quarter market volatility. This was the weakest capital markets quarter since the third quarter of 2020, three years ago, and prior to several acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital.\nThe good news here is that the pipelines remain strong, and we continue to maintain and grow our market share. NII, expenses, and credit costs all track to expectations. We included what we hope is an informative and useful slide in the deck, page five, which breaks out results for our legacy core business, our private bank startup investment, and the drag from non core. Note the legacy core performance shows Q3 EPS of $1.08, NIM of 3.33%, and ROTC of 15.3%. The private bank should turn positive by mid 2024 and be nicely accretive in 2025, and non core will dramatically run down over the next several quarters. This dynamic will help offset the drag from forward starting swaps and help propel results higher over time.\nGiven the continued macro uncertainty and pressure on revenue from higher rates, we've initiated a zero-based review of expenses in an effort to keep expenses flat in 2024. We'll report further on this on our January call when we give 2024 guidance. For Q4, we expect to see key trends begin to stabilize. NII will decline, but by less than in the past two quarters. Fees should bounce back somewhat, though the extent is market dependent. Expenses and credit costs should be stable, and we should buy in a modest amount of stock given continued solid earnings and loan runoff. This has clearly been a challenging year for regional banks like Citizens. Rest assured, we are working hard, we're navigating the current turbulence well, and we're taking the actions to position us well for the medium term.\nLet me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the third quarter, referencing slides 5 and 6. For the third quarter, we generated underlying net income of $448 million and EPS of $0.89. This includes the private bank startup investment of $0.05 and a -$0.14 impact from the non-core portfolio. Our underlying ROTC for the quarter was 12.5%. On slide 5, you'll see that we provided a schedule separating out our non-core runoff portfolio and the startup investment in our new private bank from our legacy core results, so you can see how those impact our performance. Our legacy core bank delivered a solid underlying ROTC of 15.3%. Currently, the private bank startup investment is a drag to results, but relatively quickly, this will become increasingly accretive, 5% EPS benefit in 2025.\nSimilarly, while non-core is currently a sizable drag to revenues, it will run off quickly, further bolstering our overall performance and partially mitigating the expected impact of forward starting swaps. Back to slide 6. Total net interest income was down 4% linked quarter, and our margin was 3.03%, down 14 basis points, both in line with expectations. Deposits were up slightly in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing resilience of the franchise. We continued our balance sheet optimization efforts, further strengthening liquidity during the quarter. Given the uncertain geopolitical environment and in preparation for potential changes to liquidity regulations, increasing cash and securities by about $4 billion. In addition, the non-core portfolio declined by $1.4 billion, ending the quarter at $12.3 billion.\nWhile we await clarity on new liquidity rules for Category 4 banks, it is worth pointing out that we currently exceed the current LCR requirements for both Category 1 and 3 banks. Our period-end LDR improved to 84%, while our credit metrics remained solid with net charge offs of 40 basis points. Stable linked quarter, we recorded a provision for credit losses of $172 million and a reserve build of $19 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.55%, up from 1.52% at the end of the second quarter, with the increase primarily directed to raising the general office portfolio reserves from 8% in Q2 to 9.5% at the end of Q3.\nWe repurchased $250 million of common shares in the third quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.4%, up from 10.3% in the second quarter, and our tangible book value per share decreased 3% linked quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates. Turning to Slide 7 on net interest income, linked quarter results were down 4% as expected, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 14 basis points to 3.03%. As you can see from the walk at the bottom of the slide, the decrease in margin was driven by deposit repricing, which includes mix shift from lower cost to higher interest bearing categories, non-interest bearing deposit migration, as well as the mixed impact of the liquidity build I mentioned earlier. These factors were mitigated by positive impacts from asset repricing and rundown of the non-core portfolio.\nOur cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 48% through Q3, which has been rising in response to the rate cycle and competitive environment. Our deposit franchise has performed well, with deposit betas generally in the pack with peers. This is a significant improvement compared to prior cycles when our beta experience was at the higher end of peers. Our sensitivity to rising rates at the end of the third quarter is roughly neutral, down slightly versus the prior quarter. Moving to slide 8, fees were down 3% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets and card fees, partly offset by the increase in mortgage banking fees.\nThe capital markets fees outlook was positive early in September, but with market volatility and higher long rates picking up through the end of the month, we saw a number of M&A deals pushed into the fourth quarter, resulting in lower linked quarter M&A advisory fees, as well as lower bond underwriting. While we continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines, uncertainty continues around the timing of these deals closing given the level of market volatility. Card fees were slightly lower, reflecting lower balance transfer fees. The increase in mortgage banking fees was driven by higher MSR valuation. The servicing P&L provides a diversifying benefit, which in the quarter more than offset the decline in production. As higher mortgage rates weighed on lot volumes, on slide 9, we did well on expenses, keeping them broadly stable in the quarter, excluding the $35 million private bank startup.\nInvestment.\nOn slide 10, average loans are down 2%, and period-end loans are down 1% linked quarter. The non-core portfolio runoff of $1.4 billion drove the overall decline, partly offset by some modest core growth in mortgage and home equity. Average core loans are down 1%, largely driven by generally lower loan demand in commercial, along with exits of lower returning relationships, and our highly selective approach to new lending in this environment. Period-end core loans are stable. Average commercial line utilization was down slightly this quarter as clients looked to deleverage. Given the environment and higher rates, we saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment. Next, to slides 11 and 12, we continue to do well on deposits. Period-end deposits were up $530 million linked quarter, with growth led by commercial and consumer deposits, broadly stable.\nOur interest area deposit costs were up 39 basis points, which translates to a 48% cumulative beta. Our deposit franchise is highly diversified across product mix and channels, with 67% of our deposits in consumer and about 70% insurer security. This has allowed us to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in this rising rate environment. As rates rose in the third quarter, we saw continued migration of lower cost deposits to higher yielding categories, with non interest bearing now representing about 22% of total deposits. This is back to pre pandemic levels, and we would expect the decline to moderate from here, although this will be dependent upon the path of rates and consumer behavior.\nMoving to Credit on slide 13, net charge offs were 40 basis points, stable linked quarter, with a decrease in commercial offset by a slight increase in retail driven by auto, which normalized following a very low second quarter result. Non accrual loans increased 9% linked quarter to 87 basis points of total loans, reflecting an increase in general office. We feel the rate of increase in non accruals is decelerating after a jump in Q2. Turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide 14, our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.55%, which is a 3 basis point increase from the second quarter. This reflects a reserve build of $19 million, as well as the denominator effect from the rundown of the non core portfolio. We increased our general office coverage to 9.5% from 8% in the second quarter.\nYou can see some of the key assumptions driving the general office reserve coverage level, which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the general office portfolio to $354 million this quarter, which represents coverage of 9.5% against the $3.7 billion portfolio. We have already taken $100 million in charge offs in this portfolio, which is about 2.5% of loans. In setting the general office reserve, we are factoring in a very severe peak to trough decline in office values of about 68%, with a remaining 18% to 20 default rate and a loss severity of about 50%, so we feel the current coverage of 9.5% is very strong. It's worth noting that the financial impact of further deterioration beyond our outlook would be manageable, given our strong reserve and capital position.\nWe have a very experienced CRE team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrower-specific elements to derisk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. I should also note that about 99.2% of CRE general office is in current pay status. Moving to slide 15, we have maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.4% as we look to grow capital given the dynamic macro environment and new capital rules proposed by the bank regulators. We returned a total of $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWe plan to maintain strong and growing capital and liquidity to levels that fortify our balance sheet against macro uncertainties and position us to quickly transition to any new regulatory rules that may impact banks at our size. Turning to slide 16 and 17, I'll update you on a few of our key initiatives we have underway across the bank so that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on slide 16, we've included just a few of the business initiatives we are pursuing to drive improving performance over the medium term. On the commercial side, we highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital.\nAlthough deal activity has been relatively muted recently, many sponsors have meaningful amounts of capital to deploy, so there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for MA and capital markets activity given the right market conditions. We have been serving the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years, and we have established ourselves at the top of the middle market sponsor league tables. Our new private bankers will significantly expand their sponsor relationships, and we stand ready to leverage our capabilities in this space when sponsor activity picks up. We also think there is a tremendous opportunity in the payment space, and we've been investing in our Treasury Solutions business, developing integrated payments platforms, and expanding our client hedging capabilities.\nOn the consumer side, our entry into New York Metro is going very well, with some early success attracting new customers to the bank and growing deposits about nine times faster than in our legacy branches, as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The build out of the Private Bank is also going very well. These bankers have hit the ground running and have already brought in around $500 million in deposits and investment balances through a soft launch in the back half of Q3. This is a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston, and places where we'd like to do more, like Florida and California.\nWe plan to open a few private banking centers in these geographies and build appropriate scale in our wealth business, with our Clarfeld legacy wealth business as the centerpiece of that effort. Turning to slide 17, on the top left side is our balance sheet optimization program, which is progressing well. The chart illustrates the relatively rapid rundown of the non-core portfolio, which is comprised of our $9 billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and purchased consumer loans.\nThis portfolio is expected to decline by about $7.6 billion from where we are now to about $4.7 billion at the end of 2025. As this runs down, we plan to redeploy the majority of cash paydowns to building core bank liquidity, with the remainder used to support organic, relationship-based loan growth in the core portfolio. The capital recaptured through reduction in non-core RWA will be reallocated to support the growth of the Private Bank. In summary, this strategy strengthens liquidity and has already been a source of about $3 billion of term funding EVS issuance this year. It builds capital by reducing RWAs, and it's accretive to NIM, EPS, and ROTC. Next, to our TOP program on the right side of the slide, our latest program is well underway and on target to deliver a $115 million pretax run rate benefit by year end.\nOur TOP programs are essential to improving our returns over the medium term, and we are ready to launch on TOP nine, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are looking at ways to simplify our organization and save more in third-party spend as well. In light of pressure on revenue given the rate environment, we are targeting to keep 2024 underlying expenses flat. On the technology front, we have a very extensive agenda with a multi-year next-gen tech cloud migration, targeting the exit of all of our data centers by 2025, and a program to converge our core deposit system onto a cloud-based modern banking platform.\nWe've come a long way modernizing our platform since the IPO, and on the ESG front, we recently announced a $50 billion sustainable finance target, which we plan to achieve by 2030, and commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. We are working diligently to help our clients prepare for and finance their own transitions to a lower carbon economy. Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter on Slide 18, our outlook incorporates the private bank and assumes that the Fed hold rates steady through the end of the year. We expect NII to be down approximately 2% next quarter, given the impact from non interest bearing and low cost deposits migrating to higher cost categories, albeit at a decelerating rate, more than offsetting the benefit of higher asset yields, non core runoff, and day count.\nBased on the forward curve, we expect the cumulative deposit beta at the end of 2023 to be approximately 50% and to rise to a terminal level of low 50s percent before the first rate cut. Non interest income is expected to be up 3% to 4, with a seasonal pickup in capital markets depending on the market environment. Non interest expense should be broadly stable, which includes the private bank and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Net charge offs are expected to rise to approximately mid-40s basis points as we continue to work through the general office portfolio and expected further normalization. We feel good about our reserve coverage around the current level, and the ACL level will continue to benefit from loan runoff.\nOur CET1 is expected to increase to approximately 10.5% with the opportunity to engage in a modest level of share repurchases, the execution of which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment beyond the Q4 2023 guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we are targeting flat 2024 underlying expenses. This includes the Private Bank and the non-core portfolio, and excludes the anticipated FDIC special assessment. Also, we've included slide 25 in the appendix on the swaps impact through 2027. We expect higher swap expense in 2024 to be partly offset by the benefit to NII from the non-core rundown. Notably, the swap expense drag will reduce meaningfully over 2025 through 2027 as swaps run off and the Fed normalizes short rates. In addition, the impact of terminated swaps is dramatically lower in 2026 and 2027.\nTo wrap up, we delivered solid results this quarter while navigating through a dynamic environment. Importantly, we made good progress positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity, and funding position, which will serve us well as regulatory requirements are finalized, and if the environment becomes more challenging. Our balance sheet strength also positions us to take advantage of opportunities through our strategic priorities as we continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, John. Greg, why don't we open it up for some Q&A?\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers once again. If you have a question, please press one and zero at this time. One moment please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. My first question is for John. John, there has been a lot of feedback from investors on, you know, uncertainty over the NII trajectory for 2024 in the environment of higher for longer. I think, you know where I'm going here. I think that investors are trying to sort of square the $1,112 billion increase in notional swaps, right, at a received fixed rate of, you know, 3.10% in the second half of next year and trying to square that in a higher for longer environment with some of the balance sheet optimization. If you could just sort of take us through a little bit of the moving pieces and perhaps simplify it for the investors listening in terms of how that impacts your NII trough timing, what happens after you hit trough?\nAre you still confident in what you said, I guess a month ago, that you could exit Q4 2024 with a 3% NIM?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Erika. Maybe I'll take that a little bit in reverse order because it might help us with the jump off conversation. Net interest margin came in as expected in the third quarter. We talked about that at 3.03. I think that the two big forces that I would talk about broadly as you look out into the fourth quarter would be our basic ongoing deposit migration and how that is expected to play out. I'd say that if you look at overall net interest margin, we're going to see another, call it, mid single digit sort of headwind into the fourth quarter just on the entire balance sheet outside of liquidity Bill. That 3.03 kind of gets to comes in right around that 3%. That's kind of playing out the way we expect it.\nNotwithstanding the fact that we are seeing ongoing migration, I'd say that that's holding about where we think it should be. The other item, as you may have seen in some of our walks in the slide deck, is the fact that given the uncertainty and regulatory environment, we've endeavored to actually build liquidity in a much more meaningful way. That liquidity build is NII neutral, but it does have a nominal impact to the net interest margin. You could see that being an impact in the fourth quarter. It was a couple, you know, maybe two basis points or so in the third quarter. That could be maybe another, call it, you know, several basis points as you get into the fourth quarter. You can see things playing out as we expect in the fourth quarter when you basically get to the 2024 dynamics.\nOnce you reset the table in the fourth quarter, the big puts and takes are we do have the swap portfolio increasing as you get into it's flattish when you get into the first half of the year, but it rises in the second half of the year. It happens that as it relates to 2024, that's about when the forward curve would start implying that cuts are starting to come in. I'd say that when you think about some of the mitigants to the outlook with the swap portfolio, you're going to have potentially the Fed beginning to cut in the second half of 2024. You have the ongoing benefit of the non-core portfolio, you've got the growing accretive contributions from the private bank, and with long rates being where they are, asset front book, back book will contribute positively.\nThe broader balance sheet optimization efforts that we're doing across the bank I think are all the areas that I would highlight as nice mitigants to what we're seeing play out. Let's see where the rate environment plays out. I mean, the forwards have it in one place. We have economic Bloomberg economists consensus are probably 50 basis points lower than where the forwards are. Nevertheless, we see this potentially playing out to a very manageable and, frankly, growing momentum as you exit 2024 on the net interest margin.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nJust to clarify, are you still confident that you could exit, taking all that into account, exit for Q4 2024, have a NIM of about 3%? Based on sort of what you're telling us, it sounds like if the Fed doesn't cut as the forward curve indicated, that would be the risk to that 3%.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think in the fourth quarter I'd say that we're, you know, all else equal, you know, we're getting, we're getting, you know, around that 3% level, you know, depending upon the impact of liquidity bills, which are NII neutral. It's that liquidity bill piece that I would say, which is kind of sort of set that aside just given where. Just given where we are, it doesn't drive NII. When you're thinking about the net interest margin that drives NII, we're going to be in that neighborhood of 3% ex liquidity bill.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. I'm going to step back after this because I think I'm taking up too much time. I just want to clarify, I'm asking about 4Q 2024. Are you talking about 4Q 2023? I just wanted to make sure we.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWe're on the same page. Q4 2023? Yeah, sorry. I needed to make sure that was clear. Everything I was just saying was about, and that last bit was that we're getting around that 3% level, give or take, in Q4 2023 ex liquidity build. The liquidity build is NII neutral. If you're trying to think about where we're driving NII, it's around that ±3% level ex liquidity build for 2023, and all the other forces that we talked about earlier as you're going into 2024, when I was ticking off the tailwinds from Non Corp Private Bank, Asset, Front book, back book, and BSO. All of those are tailwinds into 2024, which will be mitigants along with, let's see where the rate cuts actually start kicking in H2 2024. We'll see where we exit 2024.\nThat's something we'll come back to you on in terms of adding more color in January, as we typically do, and we'll assess our environment and all of those forces and puts and takes at that time.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nHey guys, thank you for taking the question. I guess I want to revisit that. Fourth quarter margin, just to make sure everybody's on the same page. The reported margin, it sounds like, will be below the 3%, however. Right? Because you do. I know it'll be dependent on liquidity build, but it sounds like you do anticipate liquidity build. We'd be talking kind of something in the mid-290s. Would that be sort of the reported Expectation\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nit will be lower? It just depends on the NII neutral liquidity build that we determined to be appropriate. I think it's useful to talk about the next liquidity build given the fact that that's the driver of NII, and there'll be possibly additional just in terms of the variability of cash and how that gets funded. That's flat to NII, but it'll be a denominator effect that would take the NIM below that ±3% that I talked about before, but not an NII driver. Yeah.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. All right, perfect. Maybe as we look out. Just in terms of sort of the handoff from the non-core loan runoff to more visible Private Bank growth, when do we sort of think that will become sort of more neutral in terms of visibility to the balance sheet, like when would we expect a loan portfolio to sort of level out?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYes, I think that we were saying that we think that the non-core runoff will be a continued driver in the first half of, in Q4 and H1 2024, you'll see some declines in the loan portfolio. In H2 2024, we start seeing the private bank contributing, as well as organic contributions starting to see loan growth, such that year over year we would have an expectation you'd see us starting to see loan growth in H2 2024. Okay. All right.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. All right, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nThank you. I was wondering on the credit side, we've just seen in general some pre. Announcements on charge-offs in the shared national credit space. Can you just remind us what your exposure is to shared national credits and how you fared in the recent exam?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou want to take that, John?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure. Just in general, as I think there's a lot of focus on shared national credits, actually when we came through the exam this year, we had more upgrades than we had downgrades, so we didn't have any forced charge offs. In terms of our shared national credit book, we've been taking our participations down as part of our BSO exercise. They're about 10 basis points, 10% lower than they were a couple quarters ago. I think there's a lot of focus on shared national credit. We treat participations or shared national credit deals exactly as we treat every other credit extension. One, it has to return. People think about it as hanging paper and then deploying loans and not returning. We go through the exact same process whether we're participating or leading a transaction or a sole lender.\nWe do full credit analysis of every single extension that we make, whether it be a shared national credit extension or not. Our SNC book doesn't perform any worse than any other book that we have in the bank. Actually, in some cases, it's larger credits, so they might perform marginally better than some of the middle market assets that we have on the book over time.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think just as part of BSO, as Bruce, as part of BSO in general, we're kind of looking at the total relationship returns. If we went into a credit as a participant thinking we can kind of move left and become a more important bank, that's not panning out, we're not getting the cross sell we anticipated, then we're extricating ourselves at the next available opportunity. I think you'll continue to see that trend.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, let me just pick up on that. Just in the last quarter, back to the loan growth question, we had about $900 million of front book loan originations offset by about $1.6 billion of BSO activity. We are really churning the book towards full relationship credits and away from some of those participations that Bruce mentioned. I think a lot of the competition is doing exactly the same thing. We see people supporting their lead bank relationships and moving away from more speculative future opportunities.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nGot it, thank you. Can you just provide a little bit more color maybe on. The deposit repricing and migration and how. You see it playing out with higher for longer rates just impacting. The deposit pricing pressures?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll go ahead and handle that. I mean, I'd say first off, I mean, I think when you look at our performance from a deposit data standpoint, we feel like we're basically in the pack with what you're seeing across the industry, which is a really positive result compared to where we were last cycle. Just part of the ongoing investments we've been making in primacy, product capabilities, and delivering the entire bank for our customers. We're really kind of pleased to see how things are playing out cycle to date. That said, we still are. Frankly, you look at the overall metric of non-interest bearing to overall deposits, we're around 22%. That's basically back to where we were pre-pandemic.\nWe've seen a decelerating migration out of non interest bearing into interest bearing, and seeing decelerating migration even inside of the interest bearing book. Nevertheless, it's getting smaller every quarter. We would expect to see that really, really dissipating over the coming quarter or two. That's really what you see when you get late in the cycle and the Fed's on hold. Feeling very good about that trajectory.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nYeah, maybe Brendan, do track very carefully how we're doing versus peers and some of our strategies to continue to maintain that low cost focus. Maybe you could add some additional color.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, sounds good. You know, so much of our low. Cost deposit book is in the consumer space and obviously was buoyed through the pandemic by all the stimulus. We saw the rundown of the stimulus.\nRate peak in May and it started to abate as we've got into the summer and the fall, although it's still kind of spending down at a decent clip. We do have a lot of analytics, benchmarking analytics on how we're doing, and this is supportive of John's commentary that the franchise has been performing at a very different level than it did the last upgrade cycle.\nWe believe we're number two in the. Peer set in terms of DDA consumer migration. We're performing exceptionally well on the DDA side. When you look at beta on the consumer side as compared with the growth that we're getting, it appears we're about 400 to 500 basis points better in. Net growth on the consumer book through.\nThe cycle so far. Our betas are mildly better, so more growth, slightly better cost on the core book. That's excluding Citizens Access. That's a real indicator of the quality of the franchise and the quality of the customer base, that we've moved from sort of a community banking high price deposit focus to deeply engaged primary banking relationships. We expect the pay down of low cost deposits to continue to slow, obviously depending on rate environment in the economy. That potentially could change. What I do feel really confident in is that our relative performance to peers will be strong and will continue to outperform on the consumer side on the stability of our low cost book. At the individual customer level, they still have.\nA little bit more liquidity in there. Balances than they did pre-pandemic. That's largely held by affluent and high net worth individuals. Our mass market book, and even in the mass affluent space, sort of moderated back down to operating floors.\nWe think those are all signs. That would support a continued slowdown in the rundown of low-cost deposits, pending any recessionary impact that may bring them below operating floors. We feel pretty good. Just on the uninsured and insured.\nDeposit front, we saw a little bit of a blip on the uninsured in March, and since March that has been incredibly stable, and all parts of the book have been growing. All the fundamentals point to continued trajectory of stability, and certainly continued outperform. In addition to that, we're controlling what we can control, as we're performing in the top quartile in the United States in terms of household acquisition growth. The New York market, as John pointed out, is helping to give us an extra lever to drive low-cost deposit growth over and above just the portfolio trends, which are generally outperforming. We do believe we've got a distinctive amount of levers for the franchise to continue to outperform in the medium term. Outlook on low-cost deposits.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nVery helpful. Just one quick housekeeping. I just want to confirm, John, you said that the expense outlook for next. Year being flat, that includes the private. Bank build out expenses.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, it does. Underlying expenses should be flat next year, including the private bank as well as Non Corp.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, D.A. Davidson\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that last question, John, I just wanted to ask you. I know that the private bank build out was $35 million of cost this quarter. Just wondering if there's any changes to your expectation of what that would trend like going forward as part of that cost commentary.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think Brendan will probably have some color on this. It's pretty similar into the fourth quarter, and then, of course, into next year you see it starting to migrate towards a, instead of being an EPS drag, it gets back to break even when you get out into 2024. More broadly, a 5% contribution to EPS is our outlook there.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, there'll be into Q4 some. Very modest upticks, you know, in the low 40s potentially. The reasons for that, you had hired the majority of the team, as you all know, in the early part of the summer. The influencers on that nudging up is our successful securing of various different private banking offices coast to coast to house. The team and start to bring in.\nCustomers into the platform. Some operating expenses, clients come on board as well. As we're playing some very selective second tier offense, there's still a lot of talent in motion. This quarter after the first 150, we also hired another 25 really top A-list talent folks in all of those same offices that we opened in the summer. We're going to be selective, but as we see the right talent pop up, we're going to grab them. Add them to the team.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThe other thing just in the way that COP is structured, Ken, that the folks who came over on guarantees as if they're fully producing. As the revenues come in, there won't be incremental costs, they'll just be kind of earning those pay levels. Another factor to consider.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nYeah, that's a great point. As a follow-up, you guys have done a great job over the years on the TOP program.\nI take your commentary about holding costs flat inclusive of these extra builds. That would imply a real turn exiting the year given that you ramped through the year on cost this year. John, I know you mentioned AI as a piece of that increment, but you've done 100 plus of TOP each year. I'm just wondering where else would you be digging in across the organization to get that magnitude of what seems to be a pretty meaningful implied extra cost save out of the numbers next year? Thanks, guys.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIt's Bruce, and let me start off, then John can amplify. You know, the TOP program, I think, has been a real consistent contributor to our ability to deliver positive operating leverage. To actually get to flat for next year, we have to go beyond that. We've geared up a very nice TOP program, and we're adding to it. I think we're going to have to look at kind of employment levels broadly to see where we can extract some folks, and we'll look at certain business activities that may be less important going forward than what we have been engaged in historically. We've already done some of that this year. We downsized the mortgage business quite a bit. We exited the auto business. I think it's a combination of actions that's continuing to find ways to upsize TOP leverage.\nThings like AI where we can do that, look at our overall board structure and staffing levels, and see if we can pinch some efficiencies there, and then look hard at our business mix and figure out where, you know, the key here is, you know, not to just have a knee jerk revenues. There's revenue pressure in the environment. Let's really take a hard knife at all expenses. We have to be judicious about where we're cutting, and protect the things that we feel are really going to help us grow and outperform in the medium term. Things like the private bank, things like the New York Metro expansion, there's things that we're going to ring fence, and then there's other areas we're going to have to go a little harder with the knife. John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think that covered it well, Bruce. Just ongoing fundamentals, our bread and butter of focusing on organizational related items, third party spend, and the like. I won't repeat all the categories that Bruce articulated, but we've got a fundamental underpinning that we feel like we have the opportunity to broaden out with while protecting the initiatives that are going to help us outperform over the medium term.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, got it. Thank you for the call.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Manan Gosalia from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. You have 67% of deposits from consumer, so strong franchise there, and you noted that you should outperform peers on a relative basis. One of your large peers noted last week that banks may still be over earning on NII. I guess my question was how do you see competitive factors playing out for consumer deposits next year, especially if the rate environment stays high for longer.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nBrendan, you want to?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we certainly have seen continued heavy competition for consumer deposits. You're seeing kind of money market and CD rates in the mid 5s in some spots. We feel like we're competing really, really well on that. Obviously, it's supported by our transformation on low cost. That's where you kind of start on how you manage strong NII levels and NIM levels, is having a solid foundation of low cost, highly engaged customers. We have probably more levers than others have to manage through whatever the competitive intensity ends up coming our way in 2024. Certainly, we have Citizens Access, which has been an incredibly positive tool for us to grow interest-bearing deposits in a smart way with really sticky relationships.\nIt also helps not put too much contagion into the retail banking system with heavy kind of window rates on the front of the branches that may drive in hot money and bring the franchise into non relationship based banking. That's been an incredibly effective tool to both raise money and also protect how we manage and compete on interest bearing costs. Where we have competed in the core franchise with some of the more aggressive rates, we've done it in an incredibly relationship based way. The access into, no pun intended with Citizens Access, access into higher rates on deposits if you're a core banking customer of ours requires you to be. In a relationship product.\nWe call it Quest or private client, which is our mass affluent or affluent value proposition. When you do more with us, you get more. That strategy has enabled us to be more targeted in how we think about introducing interest-bearing cost into the environment. That we're able to protect and retain.\nBalances in a really thoughtful way versus reprice the entire book in some spots. It's intense out there. We expect that to continue through the first half of the year as deposits are sort of hard to come by through the US banking system. We think we've got the right. Tools and the right levers to continue to win and compete well with our peers.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMaybe just to add, all great points there, and just to add one other point about this, I mean the rate environment is not, is expected to become more constructive. I guess is the point.\nMeaning if you're raising deposits in a world where the yield curve is inverted or at best getting less inverted, that's always going to be a tricky situation for banks until it becomes a more stable, upward-sloping situation, which I think is more likely to be the case as you get into 2024 and certainly to the end of 2024 when you start seeing lower short-term rates and nevertheless an attractive long-term rate where we can basically deploy our capital and make a positive return. That's really what I think is going to shake out as you get into 2024.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOne last piece of color I would add is that as we enter 2024, we're still kind of having a net loan shrink, and that'll eventually turn around as the private bank starts to put on loans. We'll see where the economy is, but we won't really need to. We're not pressured to grow deposits given that dynamic on loans. We can still see the LDR improve just by keeping loans stable or even letting them drop a little bit. Factoring that into the calculus of do you really need to be aggressive, given that's your dynamic around loans and deposits, that helps you manage the cost of your deposit franchise.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. I appreciate all the color there. Just separately on the LCR requirements, you mentioned that you're compliant in both category one and category three now and that this bill is also NII neutral. I guess the question is how much more do you think you need to build from here, and how do you think about that increasing your asset sensitivity in the long run?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yes, I mean they basically say a couple of questions in there. I mean I think the regulatory requirements are generally inducing banks to become more asset sensitive. You got the issue of more broadly, if the long-term debt rule goes in, that would be along with having to hold liquidity that is shorter duration, that's going to cause asset sensitivity to grow over time.\nWe're naturally an asset sensitive bank, and those forces would cause us to be more asset sensitive. We'll have to consider, during the transition periods, whether it makes sense to moderate those positions without balance sheet types of actions. Nevertheless, there's generally a tailwind of asset sensitivity being created from the regulatory environment, but also idiosyncratic to us. Our non-core portfolio, if that runs off, that's mostly a fixed book, and that has a tailwind to asset sensitivity. We're around neutral now, so becoming a bit more asset sensitive over time is some of the underlying forces there that I would say, you know, are in place. We'll decide as the environment plays out how and whether to moderate that. Again, the liquidity build is NII neutral.\nIt's really not a driver, and it's something that, you know, again, at the NII guide of down 2%, is really driven by, you know, basically having the ex liquidity build NIM decline is really the driver of that, and it equates to the 2% that you're seeing in the guide. That's the way to pull it all together for Q4.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I want to talk earlier in the call in terms of the interest income trajectory for next year and all the puts and takes, but I just wanted to circle back on that in a stable rate environment to kind of higher for longer. When and around what level does the net interest income dollars start to bottom?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean we're still working through our 2024 outlooks. Right. We're going to be much more, I would say, transparent about what our expectations are for 2024 as you get into planning season here and completing that. Of course, we do that in January. You know, with that said, we, you know, broadly, you know, as you look at the swap trajectory for us into 2024, we have a swap portfolio growing right around the time that the forwards would indicate the Fed would begin to cut. As a matter of fact, as I mentioned earlier, there's, you know, you could, you could actually see deviation around that and we happen to have a view that it's likely that it'll actually come in a little lower than where the forwards have it coming in at the end of 2024.\nThat'll be a mitigant, and as I mentioned, the non-core rundown is a mitigant, and a private bank as that grows is, of course, accretive. The other thing I'll mention, I mean, if you get beyond 2024 and you look at what's happening in the 2025 through 2027 timeframes, it's certainly more consistent with a more neutral Fed posture. That would represent, regardless of what the transition is in 2024, a significant tailwind getting into 2025 through 2027. As you see the swap portfolio being more of a neutral impact to net interest margin and NII, working our way through 2024, we get some really nice tailwinds, and that's just on the active swap portfolio.\nWe also have a locked in and baked in tailwind from the terminated swaps which run off, as you can see on our slide, in a significant way over 2025 to 2027. I would call 2024 a transition year while the Fed normalizes rates and our balance sheet optimization takes hold with non-core and creates a lot of momentum as you look out into 2025 and beyond.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would just add a little color here, Matt, to you and Erika's question. I think Erika was looking for John to say, you know, are you still holding at 3% in the fourth quarter this year and the fourth quarter next year? I think the reluctance to draw a line in the sand on 3% is the amount of liquidity build and that, you know, some of the cards from the regulators on new liquidity regulation aren't turned over yet. Just putting that aside, if you just say that's a bit of an unknown. Do we still have an ambition to have our exit rate at the end of 2023 be roughly the exit rate at the end of 2024? Yeah, that would still be the ambition.\nWe have to go through the work, as John said, to go through kind of the budget process for next year, but that's still where we'd be hoping to arrive.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nIn terms of the impact of rate cuts versus a higher for longer scenario, what does higher for longer do versus the rate cuts? It sounds like you're still a little asset sensitive, but the roll on of the swaps would obviously benefit from rate cuts. What's the net impact if rates are stable versus what the forward curve? Has for next year? Is it better or worse?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'd say that where we're positioned, we're right around neutral. A small increase in rates is actually positive to our platform. A large.\nWe tend to calculate this stuff using the 100 basis point and 200 basis point gradual rises. We're relatively neutral in those kinds of calculations, which you'll see just go on in our 10Q. When it comes to just another hike or those kinds of conversations, we tend to in those environments continue to make money and have a positive impact on NII the other way. Generally, the forward curve is favorable to us. I think we like the tracking of the forward curve. We start getting cuts at the end of 2024, and that allows the continued front book, back book. We like the long end being more anchored a little higher. That helps too in terms of our originations of our fixed rate loan book. Again, it also provides opportunities to later on lock in higher rates to the extent that that's desirable.\nYou know, the forward curve is, I think, constructive for us. Plus or minus is fine. I think large moves either way is where we would say it starts to kind of create potential headwinds. Other than that, we feel okay with it.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nTo summarize, steeper is better. As a good rule of thumb,\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'd say forward curve is better, and plus or minus is not going to move the needle very much. Having some cuts at a slow, in general, over the long-term, banks do better. We're a maturity intermediary. When we have an upward sloping yield curve, so the short rates are at 5.50%, we think that it's more constructive to see short rates around 3% to 3.50 over the long-term.\nWe also think it's constructive to have a 10-year that's north of 4% in that same environment. Therefore, a gradual decline from 5, 550 down to about 3% to 3.50 over the next two years we think is not only good for us, but good for the industry, and allows us to get back to an upward sloping yield curve. I think that that's the environment where we would be performing in a very good way. That said, we pivot and manage to the extent that the rate environment migrates differently than that. That's the one that I would say works out the best for us and the industry as a whole.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, makes sense. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thanks. I guess I have a couple of clarifications given all the discussions going on. John, when you said let's start with expenses, you talked about underlying expenses to be flat next year. You also said that includes private bank and non core. Non core is not included in the way you define underlying expenses. Are you saying both underlying, which is core, and reported expenses are both going to be flat next year?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nNo, underlying expenses at the top of the house will be flat next year, 2024 versus 2023. Underlying includes private bank. It includes non core. Overall, CFG expenses will be flat in 2024 versus 2023.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nUnderlying does not exclude those things today, Vivek. It includes those things.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Okay. I want to, all these definitions, everybody has a little difference. It's important to clarify that. Thank you. The second one, I guess, John, going back to the rate discussion to get my head wrapped around that, if I heard you right, just in response to Matt's question, you said small increase in rates is beneficial to NII, but then rate cuts is also positive. I'm trying to reconcile how both scenarios are positive for you.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I can clarify that, Vivek. I mean, you know, a small increase in rates from here would drive some NII, a small amount of NII, and a small decline would be a small negative in terms of the small decline in NII. They're both quite small, which is why we're calling ourselves neutral.\nJust from a positioning standpoint, it would be a small positive if rates rose from here. Let's say one additional hike. For example, let's say that if the Fed has a hike in the fourth quarter in November or December, we'll see an NII contribution to that. A small cut goes the other way also, but not a significant decline if there was a cut.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. To be clear, the difference here is what happens immediately, say in the next quarter, versus what happens over time. We are very constructive and feel very good about a gradual decline in rates where the short end gets down to 3% to 3.5 over, you know, call it, you know, an orderly period of time. We think that's very good.\nIt gives time for balance sheets to adjust and to have front book, back books continue to get locked in and be supportive of a healthy balance sheet migration over the next, you know, call it a year or two as our balance sheet optimization continues to take hold with non-core runoff, et cetera. We would, our balance sheet does well with an upward sloping balance sheet that we'll migrate to over the, call it, the 2024 and early 2025 period.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOne more clarification that's helpful on the expenses. Bruce, when you talk about stable for next year, what are you assuming for capital markets? Are you assuming capital markets revenues and therefore incentive comp goes up, or are you just using current level? Any color on that?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, well, we haven't given the full guidance yet on 2024. There is a variable element of pay that if revenues go up in capital markets, the pay would go up. That's probably the one area that has the greatest tie to revenues across the bank. We would have to contemplate that as we go through the budget process. We said we're targeting the flat expenses for next year, and we would incorporate our view on kind of where the capital markets fees are going to be and then what additional payouts would result from that. We'd have to find ways to offset that elsewhere in the bank.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, there are no further questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks. Okay.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks again for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you very much,\n\nOperator\n\nladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.\nWe're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. First this morning, our Chairman and CEO Bruce Van Saun and CFO John Woods will provide an overview of our second quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our second quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.\nOur comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I'll hand over to you Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. The turbulent external environment continued in the second quarter, but we continue to navigate well, and we delivered solid financial performance. In particular, we're pleased with the strong results we achieved around capital, liquidity, and funding. Our CET1 ratio grew by 30 basis points to 10.3% in the quarter, and we were able to repurchase in excess of $250 million in stock. We grew spot deposits by 3%, or $5.5 billion, and our spot loan to deposit ratio improved to 85%.\nOur Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings dropped by $7 billion to $5 billion, and contingent liquidity grew by 20% to $79 billion. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.04 and ROTCE of 13.9%. NII was down 3%, reflecting higher funding costs in line with our expectations. Non-interest income grew 4%, slightly less than expected as capital markets saw a few deals push to the third quarter. Expenses were broadly stable as expected, and credit costs continue to be manageable.\nOne of the highlights of the second quarter was the opportunity to secure a significant influx of talent, largely from the First Republic platform, to meaningfully augment our Citizens Private Bank and Wealth Management business. While expense investments will lead revenues in 2023, we project the business to be accretive in 2024, and significantly profitable in the medium term. In our presentation this morning, we will highlight this initiative in more detail, and we'll also review several other compelling initiatives that we believe will lead to strong medium-term outperformance. Execution of these initiatives continues to be strong.\nWe're setting up a non-core runoff portfolio as a centerpiece of intensified balance sheet optimization efforts. We expect around $9 billion of loan runoff, largely in auto, by the end of 2025. This capacity will be utilized to fund more strategic loan portfolios, to pay down high-cost debt, and to build cash and securities. In parallel, the Private Bank will grow loans over this period by $9 billion, which will be funded by $11 billion of incremental deposits. The net benefit of all of this is a better deployment of capital, along with positive impact on earnings per share, ROTCE, and liquidity. We've also included more detail on our CRE loan portfolio.\nOur General Office reserve is now at 8%. While we continue to see increases in criticized assets and charge offs in this particular portfolio, we believe losses are manageable and readily absorbed by reserves and our strong capital position. Looking forward, we anticipate that the environment, while stabilizing, will continue to be challenging. Our net interest margin will decline again in Q3, given higher funding costs. We expect our terminal beta to reach 49% to 50% at year end. Our fees should continue to grow sequentially, expenses will be well-controlled, and credit should be broadly stable.\nWe will further build our CET1 ratio while continuing to repurchase shares. Overall, we're holding in okay on current period performance with mid-teens ROTCE in 2023, while making the investments to deliver a stronger franchise, attractive growth in returns, and a fortified balance sheet over the medium-term. We continue to build a great bank, and we remain very excited about our future. Our capital strength and our attractive franchise position us to attract terrific talent and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. With that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks Bruce, and good morning everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the second quarter, referencing slide five. For the second quarter, we generated underlying net income of $531 million and EPS of $1.04. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13.9%. Net interest income was down 3% linked quarter, and our margin was 3.17%, down 13 basis points, with funding costs outpacing the increase in asset yields. We delivered very strong deposit growth in the quarter, reflecting the strength of the franchise, with spot deposits up 3%, or $5.5 billion.\nPeriod end loans and average loans were down 2% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, including our ongoing runoff of auto. These dynamics improved our period end LDR to 85%, and our liquidity position remains very strong. We reduced FHLB borrowings by about $7 billion to approximately $5 billion outstanding at quarter end, and we increased our available liquidity by 19% to about $79 billion. Our credit mix and overall position remains solid. Total NCOs of 40 basis points are up 6 basis points linked quarter as expected, primarily reflecting higher charge-offs in CRE General Office.\nWe recorded a provision for credit losses of $176 million and a reserve build of $24 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.52%, up from 1.47% at the end of the first quarter, with the increase directed to the General Office portfolio. We repurchased $256 million of common shares in the second quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio of 10.3%, up from 10% in the first quarter, and our tangible book value per share is down 2% linked quarter, reflecting AOCI impacts associated with higher rates. On the next few slides, I'll provide further details related to second quarter results.\nOn slide six, net interest income was down 3%, primarily reflecting a lower net interest margin, which was down 13 basis points to 3.17%, with the increase in asset yields more than offset by higher funding costs given the competitive environment and migration from lower cost categories. With Fed funds increasing 500 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is 42% through the second quarter, which has been rising in response to the rate and competitive environment, and is generally in the pack with peers.\nOur asset sensitivity at the end of the second quarter is still approximately 1%, which is broadly stable with the prior quarter. Our receive-fixed cash flow swap position is similar to the prior quarter, as we held off on adding further protection as rates continue to rise during the quarter. Moving on to slide seven, we posted solid fee performance in a challenging market environment. Fees were up 4% linked quarter, with card fees showing a seasonally strong increase from higher transaction volumes, and increases in wealth and mortgage banking fees. FX and derivatives revenue was modestly lower.\nCapital market fees were stable, with market volatility through the quarter continuing to impact underwriting fees, largely offset by increased syndications and M&A advisory fees, despite a few deals being pushed into the third quarter. We continue to see good strength in our deal pipelines, and are hopeful that deal flow picks up in the second half. Mortgage fees were slightly higher, as production fees increased with market volumes, partially offset by lower margins and lower servicing fees. Finally, wealth fees were also up slightly, reflecting growth in AUM.\nOn slide eight, expenses were broadly stable linked quarter, as seasonally lower salaries and employee benefits were offset by higher equipment and software costs, as well as higher advertising and deposit insurance costs. On slide nine, average and period-end loans were both down 2% linked quarter, reflecting balance sheet optimization actions in C&I, as well as the impact of planned auto runoff. Education was lower given the rate environment, but this was offset by modest growth in mortgage and home equity.\nCommercial utilization was down a bit as clients looked to deleverage given higher rates, and we saw less M&A financing activity in the face of an uncertain economic environment. On slide 10, period-end deposits were up $5.5 billion, or 3% linked quarter, with growth led by consumer up $3 billion and commercial up $2 billion. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 47 basis points, which translates to a 101% sequential beta and a 42% cumulative beta. Strong deposit flows and the very successful auto loan collateralized borrowing program initiated during the quarter contributed to reducing FHLB levels by about $7 billion.\nGiven our BSO objectives, we grew deposits, which drove a favorable mix-shift away from wholesale funding. As a result, our total cost of funds was relatively well-behaved, up 38 basis points. Next, I'll move to slide 11 to highlight the strength of our deposit franchise. With 67% of our deposits skewed toward consumer and highly diversified across product mix and channels, we are able to efficiently and cost effectively manage our deposits in a rising rate environment.\nWe increased a portion of our insured and secured deposits from 68% to 70% linked-quarter, and when combined with our available liquidity of $79 billion, our available liquidity as a percentage of uninsured deposits increased to about 150% from around 120% in the first quarter. As rates rose another 25 basis points in the second quarter, we saw continued migration of lower-cost deposits to higher yielding categories, primarily in commercial, with non-interest-bearing now representing about 23% of the book. This is back to pre-pandemic levels and should stabilize from here.\nMoving on to slide 12, we saw good credit results in retail again this quarter, and higher charge-offs in commercial. Net charge-offs were 40 basis points, up 6 basis points last quarter, which reflects an increase in the General Office segment of commercial real estate, partly offset by a slight improvement in retail, primarily due to the strength in used car values. Non-performing loans are 79 basis points of total loans, up 15 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting an increase in General Office, which tends to be lumpy. It's also worth noting that overall delinquencies were lower sequentially, with retail and commercial both improving slightly.\nRetail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels. Turning to slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $24 million, which includes a $41 million increase in CRE General Office, even after covering charge-offs of $56 million. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.52%, which is a 5 basis point increase in the second quarter. The runoff of the non-core portfolio, primarily auto, facilitated the reallocation of reserves to CRE. The reserve coverage in General Office was increased to a strong 8%.\nOn slide 14, you'll see some of the key assumptions driving the General Office reserve coverage level, which we feel represent a fairly adverse scenario that is much worse than we've seen in historical downturns. As mentioned, we built our reserve for the General Office portfolio to $313 million this quarter, which represents coverage of 8%. In addition to running a number of stress scenarios across the General Office portfolio, we continuously perform a detailed loan-level analysis that takes into account property-specific details such as location, building quality, operating performance, and maturity.\nWe have a very experienced CRE team who are focused on managing the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis and engaging in ongoing discussions with sponsors to work through the property and borrower-specific elements to derisk the portfolio and ultimately minimize losses. Our reserves reflect this detailed view of the portfolio, as well as the key macro factors we set out on the page. The property value, default rate, and loss severity assumptions we are using to set the reserve are adequate for the risks we currently see and are significantly more conservative than what was seen in previous CRE downturns.\nIt's worth noting that the financial impact of any further deterioration beyond what we expect would be very manageable given our strong reserve and capital position. On the following slide 15, there are some additional disclosures we are providing this quarter to give more detail on the type and location of the General Office portfolio. You can see of the $3.9 billion General Office portfolio, 94% is Class A or B, with a majority in suburban areas, which seem to be performing better than central business districts.\nOn the bottom left hand side of the page, it highlights that the portfolio is quite diversified across geographies, as well as the top 10 MSAs listed on the bottom right hand side. Broadly, for New York MSA, we are starting to see return to office trends picking up, and more than 80% of the portfolio is outside Manhattan, where property dynamics tend to be more favorable. Washington, DC is 100% Class A and B, and 95% suburban. Moving to slide 16, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.3% as we look to add capital given the uncertain macro and regulatory environment.\nWe returned a total of $461 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Turning to slide 17, you'll see that our CET1 ratio is among the highest in our regional bank peer group. This strong capital level reflects a relatively conservative approach since the IPO in maintaining robust capital levels. If you incorporate the removal of AOCI opt out, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 8.5%, and we also expect that this would place us near the top of our peer group again this quarter.\nWe expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward, with the ability to generate roughly 20 basis points of CET1 ratio post dividend each quarter in H2 2023 before share buybacks. As you see, we've been focused for a while on playing really strong defense with a focus on capital, liquidity, funding, and maintaining a prudent credit risk appetite. That's been job one even long before the turmoil we saw in the first quarter. We also recognize the need to continue to play offense.\nWe need to be selective, investing in initiatives that will grow the franchise where we have a right to win. Over the next few slides, I'll spotlight a few of the exciting things we are doing to make sure that we can deliver growth and strong returns for our shareholders. First, on slides 19 and 20, we were excited to announce a few weeks back that we have hired about 50 senior private bankers and 100 related support professionals who were with First Republic. As many of you know, for a number of years we've had an interest in growing our wealth business, both organically and inorganically.\nWe've made a number of investments on the organic side, hiring financial advisors and converting that business from a transactional business to a very customer-centric financial planning approach. That's been a slow and steady build over the years, and then we supplemented that with the Clarfeld acquisition a couple of years ago, and that's gone incredibly well. With our customer-centric culture, our financial strength, and the full range of products and services we offer, we were the perfect fit for these bankers. We really admire their approach to delivering the bank to their customers in a unique way, with white glove service.\nThis is really a coast-to-coast team with a presence in some of our key markets like New York, Boston, and places where we'd like to do more, like Florida and California. In fact, we think the overlap with JMP in San Francisco is extremely complementary. These bankers serve the types of customers we are seeking to attract to the bank. High and ultra-high-net-worth individuals and families, often with strong connections to middle market companies, with a particular focus on private equity and venture capital firms serving the innovation economy.\nWe have a great deal of work ahead of us to integrate these teams and to ensure that they are positioned to deliver the bank to their clients. We plan to open a few private banking centers in key geographies, and build appropriate scale in our wealth business, with Clarfeld as the centerpiece of that effort. We think this is going to be extremely attractive from a financial perspective. These teams and their staff, about 150 people in total, onboarded late in the second quarter, with revenue beginning to ramp in the fourth quarter. Financial impact for the second half will be $0.08 to 0.10 of EPS plus an initial notable cost of about $0.03 for 2023.\nThese bankers have hit the ground running and are out working to build their book of business, and we expect the effort to break even around the middle of 2024. By 2025, we expect EPS accretion of roughly 5%, with 2025 year-end projections of about $9 billion in loans, $11 billion of deposits, and $10 billion of assets under management. Overall, a very exciting advance for us. Now let's go to slide 21, and I'll walk you through how we'll be managing our balance sheet over the next few years. Since the IPO, we've prudently grown our balance sheet while managing the mix of assets and funding with an eye towards maximizing risk returns.\nWith the increase in rates since the end of 2021, plus the advent of quantitative tightening, and more recently the heightened competition for deposits, we are entering the next stage of the journey with a plan to focus on attractive relationship lending while lowering our LDR, which will improve our liquidity profile and benefit returns. In order to make this effort clear and share the benefits we expect, we've established a $14 billion non-core portfolio, which is comprised of our $10 billion shorter duration indirect auto portfolio and lower relationship purchased customer loans, consumer loans.\nThis portfolio will run down fairly quickly, with about $9 billion of runoff expected by the end of 2025. Moving to slide 22 and 23, you'll see that as the non-core loan portfolio runs down, this allows us to pay down higher-cost funding and redeploy capital into more strategic lending and our investment portfolio. We will also be growing relationship-based lending through the Private Bank and raising deposits to self-fund that growth. Despite the size of the runoff portfolio, we expect to see modest loan growth in 2024, picking up in 2025, driven by opportunities across retail and C&I as well as our Private Bank effort.\nThe net result of these actions is an improved liquidity profile with a better loan and funding mix, and higher returns. Next, on slide 24, a quick update on our entry into New York Metro where some really exciting things are happening. With the branch conversions behind us, we have full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities. We continue to be encouraged by our early success. We've seen strong sales in the branches as we leverage our full customer service capabilities to drive some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network.\nMost importantly, we've seen a steady improvement in our Net Promoter Scores. On the commercial banking side, we've got a strong new leadership team in place with local talent joining from larger firms, and we are seeing some early success leveraging our new visibility to build pipelines with middle market firms. We are looking forward to what we can do with our new private banking capabilities in the market. On slide 25, we have a great opportunity to build on Citizens Access, our national digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years.\nWe've moved to a modern, fully cloud-based core platform, and we plan to add checking capabilities later this year. Down the road, we plan to converge our legacy core system with this modern platform. We are confident that a single, integrated platform will be more cost-efficient and flexible in meeting our clients' needs. We aim for this to be a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide, with a focus on the young, mass-affluent market segment. On the right side of the page is Citizens Pay, where we have been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers.\nCitizens Pay has been the top customer acquisition engine for the bank, with very high promoter scores, and it has been a great performer from a credit perspective. We have had some fantastic partners on the platform for a while, such as Apple, Microsoft, Best Buy, BJ's, and Vivint, and we are always very excited to welcome new partners like Peloton, Trek, The Tile Shop, and Wisetack to the platform. On slide 26, I'll highlight how we are positioned to support the significant growth in private capital. Over the last several years, private capital fundraising has led to record deal formation, M&A activity, and substantial fees.\nDeal activity has been relatively muted recently, and many sponsors have not deployed meaningful amounts of capital, so there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for M&A and capital markets activity. We have been executing a consistent strategy to serve the sponsor community with distinctive capabilities for the last 10 years, and we've done a great job moving up to the top of the sponsor league tables, particularly in the middle market. We have made significant investments in talent and capabilities, including five advisory acquisitions since 2017, and our new private bankers significantly expand our sponsor relationships and capabilities.\nOur success supporting private capital has been a large part of our strong capital markets performance over the last few years, and we are poised to capitalize on the next wave of sponsor activity as the path of the economy becomes clearer. Let's move to slide 27 for an update on our TOP program. Our latest TOP 8 program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have decided to augment the program to protect returns, as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance.\nWe have increased our targeted benefit by $15 million to $150 million by accelerating some of our efforts and to further rationalize our branch network and reduce procurement costs. We have also begun planning for a TOP 9 program, looking for efficiency opportunities driven by further automation and the use of AI to better serve our customers. We are also looking at ways to simplify our organization and find even more savings in procurement. Continuous improvement is part of our DNA, and I'm very confident that we'll continue to deliver these benefits to the bank.\nMoving to slide 28, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter for Citizens, which excludes the impact of the Private Bank, and I will also provide some comments for the full year. The outlook takes into account another rate increase, followed by Fed on hold for the remainder of this year. For the third quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 4%, non-interest income to be up by approximately 3%, and non-interest expense should be broadly stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable to up slightly. Our CET1 is expected to rise modestly from 10.3%, with additional share repurchases planned, which will depend upon our ongoing assessment of the external environment.\nRelating to the full year, our liquidity position is quite strong, and given the BSO actions I discussed earlier, we will continue to build on this, targeting an LDR of low to mid-80s by the end of the year, positioning us well for anticipated regulatory changes. Worth noting, we already are fully LDR compliant with Category 3 bank requirements. Based on the forward curve, we are expecting a terminal interest-bearing deposit beta of 49% to 50%. Our net interest margins should begin to stabilize in Q4 as the Fed is expected to reach the end of the rate hike cycle.\nWe are off to a great start at building up a Private Bank, and we expect the EPS impact of this to be $0.06 in the third quarter and $0.02 to 0.04 in the fourth quarter. We really think of this as a capital investment. To wrap up, our results were solid for the quarter as we continue to navigate a turbulent external environment.\nWe are focused on positioning the company with a strong capital, liquidity, and funding position, which will serve us well as we continue to navigate a challenging environment ahead. Our balance sheet strength also positions us very well to focus on our strategic priorities to continue to strengthen the franchise for the future and deliver attractive returns. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thanks John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the conference call. If you would like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You'll hear an indication you've been placed into queue, and you may remove yourself from the queue by repeating the one then zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset and make certain your phone is unmuted before pressing any buttons. Again, for questions, press one then zero. Your first question will come from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning everybody. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question is just on the sort of accretion to the margin from the balance sheet optimization. Do you have a sense for what sort of a steady state margin from Citizens might look like after that is completed? I guess, you know, it doesn't necessarily have to be a specific number, but just in your view, how powerful is that accretion from these activities, and appreciate the sort of the backdrop of the 4.2% yield versus the 5.5% funding costs.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll go ahead and start off. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think broadly we're seeing the impact of the rate environment on our net interest margin. We're managing it quite well as the Fed is continuing on its hiking cycle. As you get into the end of the year, taking into consideration all of the balance sheet optimization activities, we see NIM flattening out and kind of holding in around 3% or so as you get to the end of the year. The tailwinds from balance sheet optimization are meaningful, and will continue to build into 2024. Those are the big drivers there.\nI think that also contributing to that NIM stability would be the fact that we think that balance sheet migration is starting to stabilize. Also, you can't ignore the fact that the Private Bank itself, as you get out into 2024, will start to deliver accretive NIM. We're feeling good about the profile after we get through this last hike from the Fed here in July, watching that NIM start to stabilize as you get into the end of the year.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, perfect, thank you. Is it possible to put sort of a finer point on the, I guess 8% to 10%, pardon me, $0.08 to 0.10 of cumulative expected EPS drag from the Private Bank initiatives. You know, certainly appreciate the sort of the loan and deposit and assets under management outlooks, but maybe any broad sense for dollar value of expected revenues and expenses as we look into the second half.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, it's a little bit front end loaded as the expenses will come in and drive prices probably more in the neighborhood of $0.06 of that $0.08 to 0.10 happening in the third quarter, with $0.02 to 0.04 really into the fourth quarter. It's primarily expenses in the neighborhood of $40 million or so as you get into Q3 and Q4. The loan book starts to build later this quarter and into Q4. That gives you the front loading of that $0.08 to 0.10 into Q3.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThe one thing I would say to that, Scott, it's Bruce, is, this is a very sound approach to scaling up the wealth business. We've been looking for acquisition ideas, and it's been very expensive with very long tangible book value earn backs. Many times would be over five years, which is beyond our appetite. To actually do this in a kind of de novo buildup basis, you incur some capital expense in the short run, but it's almost the same as if you equate it to an outlay that ultimately starts to generate revenues. The nice thing about this is that it's accretive already in the second year, and the kind of earn back on this thing is under two years.\nWe look at it really less as a driver of how does it affect the near-term EPS. Look, there's a capital outlay, which we burned some expense dollars to get it off the ground, and then all of a sudden it's making us money. It really ramps very nicely and can achieve something like a 5% accretion in 2025, which is kind of within two and a half years, in the second year of doing a deal. If you compare that to some of the other transactions that we've done, including the bank acquisitions, it is pretty darn powerful. Very excited about this opportunity.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. Okay, good. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning. John, I was just wondering if you could help us with lots of the moving pieces that's sort of unfurling in front of us. I guess the first question is, you noted stability at the 3% level. Does that mean that fourth quarter 2024 will be at about the third quarter level? I'm just wondering sort of how those dynamics play out in terms of what you expect for how the balance sheet trends for the rest of the year, or will sort of the runoff continue to pressure it at that level? What does that fourth quarter NII about look like from a range perspective?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean I think from the NIM standpoint, you're talking about 2023, just confirming, Erika, is that\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\n2023. And building out of 2024 fund.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, you referenced 2024, but the answer is actually a little bit similar. What we do see is after the Fed hikes here in July and the impact of that burns in, in the third quarter, we do see NIM flattening out there between Q3 and Q4, having a more flat profile as you get into the end of the year, around 3%. Maybe a touch higher in Q3 net interest margin, but seeing that profile begin to flatten out. I think the key drivers of that and the pieces and parts, as I mentioned, we're starting to see a deceleration in deposit migration, in negative deposit migration. That's a good early green shoot.\nThat's consistent with the fact that our DDA levels are basically where we were back to pre-pandemic. That ends up being an expected landing zone as you get into the end of the year. We'll see that flattening out. You'll see the tailwinds from the runoff book start to kick in, the reallocation of that capital and liquidity into relationship lending, and the ability to pay down some higher cost funding as you get into the end of the year. That starts to bolster net interest margin, which we do think carries into 2024. We think that there are a number of positive developments in 2024 that would allow us to hold that NIM out into even beyond the fourth quarter.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would comment, Erika, that this was a really important quarter for us to kind of get the deposit level where we wanted, to get the Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings lower, and really take a big step in lowering the LDR. We paid up a little bit to achieve that, and the impact of that full quarter effect affects the third quarter guide. I think at this point we feel that we don't need to continue to really aggressively grow deposits.\nWe can have a more stable deposit profile, as John indicated, less migration from non-interest bearing to interest bearing. There won't be kind of a full quarter impact of an aggressive plan that affects Q4 from Q3, because we'll be kind of looking at a more stable profile in Q3.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Thank you for that, Bruce. As I think about the fourth quarter, is it fair then to say that your guidance implies NII of $1.52 billion for the third quarter? Do we assume that we're at or around that range for the fourth quarter? As we think about the puts and takes of 2024, John, I have to bring this up because a few investors were noting, I think now it's slide 31 where you have some swaps rolling off that have very heavy weighted average fixed rate that you're receiving.\nAs I think about $1.52 billion, perhaps as a starting point, ±, I assume that your guide for down 100 basis points, NII for full year down 1.2%, is still valid if we assume rate cuts next year and includes those swap roll offs. That is sort of the first question, and the second is, how does balance sheet optimization impact that sensitivity? I am assuming that is extraordinarily static.\nI am assuming that from both sides you are paying off more debt next year as you are waiting for these loans to come on. As you wait for these loans, you are also putting it in higher yield in cash. If you could just help us think through the moving pieces as it relates to that original disclosure, because I think investors are thinking about the potential for rate cuts next year.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMaybe I'll just start off in a couple of areas. Just when you think about NII, some of the numbers that you're throwing out there are probably a little lighter than where we would see them come out. I think our NII would be a little better than that. Into fourth quarter, I think we have some opportunities if interest earning assets are going to be stabilized as Bruce indicated, and net interest margin stabilized. We think the NII is also stabilized at solid levels. That was, I think, the first question that you had. I mean, I think the\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJust to put a point on that too, is that any swap impacts are in our forward guides, Erika. We've already contemplated that, so there's nothing, and they didn't really move. We didn't do any adjustments in the second quarter.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, there's very limited adjustments. Things do roll off and come on. Broadly, our asset sensitivity profile was pretty stable quarter-over-quarter, meaning we were still asset sensitive. A rate rise, which we're about to get from the Fed, does actually contribute to NII and net interest margin for us. From that perspective, all of that has been built into the commentary that we've been giving you in terms of swap roll off and our ongoing positive asset sensitivity.\nAgain, when you think about net interest margin over kind of the next several quarters, we have a number of tailwinds. You've got flattening out, non-interest-bearing migration, so that's no longer expected to be a big headwind. You've got the runoff book that we talked about, and that runoff book is going to be rotated into relationship lending at higher yields. The runoff\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nPaying off high-cost debt.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAnd paying down high cost funding. Right. Where we have a negative kind of spread situation there, we already mentioned the fact that the Private Bank is going to start contributing to the balance sheet later this year, and the net interest margin on that is actually accretive to the overall legacy bank. The other thing I threw out there is just the front book back book dynamics, where you basically have originations in the front book.\nJust in the securities portfolio alone, there's 300 basis points plus positive front book back book in terms of, we're actually creating a bigger securities book, but we're doing it at the right time, where securities yields are actually historically quite favorable. We're putting a lot away from that standpoint.\nWe're seeing back into the loan book spreads on our front book originations higher than they were. For example, in C&I, spreads are up 50 basis points over the last year, year-over-year. That's also a tailwind. You know, all those things are the things that are going to help us manage the fact that, you know, manage the rate environment and the other items that we have\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think what John described, Erika, is a number of tailwinds that should be positive. If the Fed is cutting next year, that potentially is a negative, but we have these positive things to offset that, which gives us kind of that stable view on the NIM into 2024.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. Just to wrap it up, just because I got a few emails to clarify and I'll step aside, it sounds like your sensitivity hasn't changed. Whatever that fourth quarter number is, which is stable to third quarter, the down 1.2% on down 100 is still valid, but then the balance sheet optimization will get you closer to stable despite Fed cuts.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, agree. Balance sheet optimization plus the fact that when, if rates were, rates begin to fall, if they do, we don't have that happening in the fourth quarter, by the way. We have that happening in 2024. We have the Fed on hold for the rest of the year, and we have the Fed just based on the forward curve, right, having the Fed ending around 4% in 2024. It's really not until 2024 where you see those down rate scenarios.\nIn the down rate scenario, I mean, that's where deposit betas start working for you rather than against you. Then you start getting some of that coming in, as well as the fixed loan portfolio that creates a buffer when rates start to fall. I would just add those two things to all the other tailwinds I already articulated as to why we feel like we can hold a stable NIM.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, just, it's Bruce, and you've got an extended period of time here, Erika. We're very interested in NII and NIM, which I'm sure is on a lot of investors' minds. Kind of bigger picture is, we're kind of transitioning the loan book to things that are more strategic and offer better returns on capital, and better opportunities for cross sell and deepening with customers. We're kind of working through a transition period this year and even into next year. It's a little hard to give you full guidance at this point given a lot of uncertainty still in the market.\nWe're giving you our best instincts at this point on that. I feel quite confident that as we kind of emerge through 2024 and then even look out to 2025, that kind of with the liftoff of this Private Bank effort and the kind of rundown of these less strategic portfolios, we're going to get a lot of benefit from this, and we're really poised to do quite well, I think looking out into kind of back half of 2024 into 2025.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes, Bruce, that Private Bank lift out is a boss move. I think everybody just wanted to figure out what that runway looked like, and I think this conversation we just had clarified that runway. Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\n\nNate Stein\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning, this is Nate Stein. On behalf of Matt O'Connor, just one question for me. The capital build was good this quarter with CET1 rising to 10.3% from 10%, and guidance calls for this to increase again in Q3. Just wanted to ask how high are you willing to let the ratio get to?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think, it's Bruce, I think by the end of the year we could see it getting to 10.5%, which, you know, is a bit above our stated range had been 9.5% to 10%. I think given all the uncertainty that's out there in the economy, plus direction of travel from regulators, that managing it up like that is sensible. Having said that, we're still generating quite good returns, which gives us the ability to kind of nudge that up from here in terms of the ratio, but also repurchase our stock, which we think is great value at the current pricing. That's how we're looking at it.\nAs we go through 2024, at this point, our early thoughts would be kind of more of the same, that we can at least hold that 10.5% and maybe build on it based on what we see from regulators. We have the wherewithal to be in the market buying our stock on a consistent basis and holding or building that ratio further.\n\nNate Stein\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nGood morning, Bruce. Good morning, John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMorning.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nHi, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nBruce and John, can you guys share with us? Obviously, Vice Chair Barr has come out with a speech last week talking about RWA increases that will lead to higher capital levels for all banks, over $100 billion in assets. Have you guys given some thought on where you could be most impacted by the new Basel III Endgame rules that maybe will come out next week? Second, as part of this, this week, Bloomberg reported that there may even be some RWA increases for residential mortgages, which really hasn't been discussed. How are you guys approaching what could be coming possibly as soon as next week?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nLet me start. I'll quickly flip it to John. You know, clearly I would say there's mixed views on whether that's a sound proposal at this point. I think the industry itself has acquitted itself very well through the pandemic, through this period of turmoil in the first half of the year. I think many folks have commented that the industry has strong capital. You know, in response to three idiosyncratic bank failures, is it appropriate that the thing that needs to be fixed is more capital in the banking system? I don't know. I question whether that's appropriate. We'll see how it plays out. I think there'll be lots of dialogue around that.\nI think from our standpoint, by moving our capital position higher, we're anticipating any of what could come down the pike is something that we can absorb. We're in a very strong position relative to our SCB, which, by the way, we still have some questions about how it landed where it did. Nonetheless, we're well above that. We're well above, if the AOCI filter goes away, we already have sufficient capital to meet our new proposed SCB. We're in a position of strength, Gerard. I think we can still deliver the kind of returns we aspire to over time as we get through this transition period and hit our medium-term financial targets.\nI would kind of at least comment that I'm not sure that that's the answer when we had a series of management supervisory failures and poor asset liability management. That really was the problem that caused this turmoil, not a lack of capital in the banking system. I'll get off my soapbox and I'll pass it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I agree with all of that, and I think the issue is in credit RWA versus operational risk RWA, Gerard. I think there was a view that there would be some puts and takes on the credit risk RWA, and maybe it wouldn't be much of an increase expected at the regional bank level. I did see, we did see those reports on residential mortgages. We'll see how it all plays out. On the operational risk side of things, you know, with complex, complex fee-based sort of businesses are where a lot of that is directed, and it's not just we don't have as much exposure to that as maybe some other banks in the industry do.\nBroadly, we felt like that we would be impacted possibly a little less than most, and we're sitting with capital a little more than most. From that perspective, we feel pretty well-positioned for the uncertainty of the regulatory rulemaking process. As you heard from Bruce, we're growing capital into the end of the year, and I think a 10, something in the neighborhood of 10.5% CET1 is a pretty strong mitigant to anything that might come down the road from the Fed.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nAnalyst, RBC\n\nGreat, thank you guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the strategic remixing and wondering, can you give us some color on the types of loans and deposits that you think will come over as part of those new hires in the Private Bank? I mean, obviously the First Republic mix had been kind of low-rate mortgages and high-rate CDs. I would expect that's not the type of NIM you're looking to be adding. Just wondering, just, you know, what those producers you're expecting to bring over, and also kind of, you know, we could see it in your AUM expectation, but it looks like it'll be more NII delivering as opposed to fees.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nTurn that over to Brendan.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yeah, so we are really excited, obviously, about this initiative, and it's a very strategic acceleration of our Wealth Management business. To your point, it does come with scaling up the bank as well. While we are aiming to recreate a lot of the customer experience magic that existed in these private banking models, we are going to make some structural changes to make sure that the profile of the business that we get is accretive at the top of the house. What you can expect from us is disciplined credit pricing that, while we'll be competitive, we're not going to kind of lead with undercutting the market and pricing to make sure we have the right margin.\nWe will have incredibly disciplined credit appetite. We don't expect to take a step forward or a step in the wrong direction in terms of credit risk profile. In fact, we think this will enhance the credit risk profile with very low-risk loan generation. We are going to ensure that we're driving lendable deposits on the balance sheet that we put out relative to the Private Bank, that we're getting core operating deposits, whether that's from individuals or from businesses. It's really important that we maintain a sound liquidity position in this growth.\nLastly, from a compensation perspective, we're going to rationalize the compensation model best we can within the confines of a Private Bank to ensure that the combination of those factors give us a return profile that can be accretive at the top of the house on overall ROE, but also on things like NIMs. The balance sheet on the deposit side certainly will have a mix of cash management operating deposits, as well as interest bearing. We are going to tether all relationships to being primary banking, whether it's corporate or whether it's personal.\nYou can expect low-cost DDA to be mixed in with interest-bearing for a healthy profile of primary banking relationships. On the asset side, I'd say we're expecting about a 50/50 mix of what I would call sort of consumer personal retail lending, and small business and corporate lending. On the personal lending side, really the large asset classes are going to be mortgage, home equity, and eventually partner loan program, where putting capital out to individuals to engage as a partner in a higher-end consulting firm or private equity firm, very traditional low-risk assets. But that dislodge the operating deposits and ultimately lead you to AUM.\nOn the business side, as was mentioned earlier, the profile of the team we got over does have a bent towards the innovation economy. We're expecting capital call line lending to dislodge operating deposit relationships with private equity and venture, and a small segment where it's appropriate, relationship wise on potentially multifamily in a very high credit environment where we can also secure the personal wealth relationship.\nAll of our balance sheet usage will be oriented around full end-to-end customer relationships that include deposits, and ultimately AUM growth. It's a very integrated end-to-end business model, and we feel like we've got the right recreation of the service strategy married with the right corrections to the business model to ensure we get better profitability, and also a stable business model that can withstand the test of time. We think we can get really good growth around this. We will control the growth with a guardrail of adequate profile of the business that will be healthy and profitable over the long haul.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat color. Thank you, Brendan. Just one more question on the other side of the BSO, John, obviously talking a lot about the consumer side of the non-core portfolio here. Can you just dig in and let us know, you previously had done a lot on the commercial portfolio, and I'm just wondering, have you done it and do you keep currently deep diving into the CRE book as you've talked about on the credit side? What might there still be to do on the commercial side of the portfolio in terms of BSO from that perspective? Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean, I think as you know, in this portfolio that we set up, it's entirely a retail portfolio in terms of that $14 billion, but there are nevertheless, in parallel, BSO activities continuing on the commercial side, and let Don talk about that.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we've been at this for probably three or four years now. We just prune out relationships where we haven't been able to achieve the cross sell that we thought we were going to achieve when we were going into the credit several years ago. It's really an ongoing effort. It's been running about $1 billion a year, and we probably will be running about that same pace. The good news is we've been able to replace some of that with growth in places like New York Metro, where we see a good amount of opportunity on a full wallet basis, particularly in the middle market as we bring on these new hires.\nOn the CRE side, as everybody knows, there's not a lot of liquidity, but there is some liquidity, and we're actually moving some of our exposures out through the agencies and then through some private capital also. We'll try to liquefy CRE, particularly multifamily, over the next couple quarters, couple years to the best we can and bring those overall exposures down even though they're performing pretty well.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGood. Okay, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Go ahead.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nGood morning. Just on the capital side, I heard you in terms of the CET1 trajectory from here, and that it does still allow for some repurchases, maybe could you help us frame out what's a reasonable pace of buybacks we should assume. Is it similar to the $250 million that you did this quarter?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I would say, you know, that is something we felt comfortable with in Q3, we were going through the, you know, or Q2, we were going through the CCAR process at the time, but we saw the opportunity to build, kind of have our cake and eat it too, build a ratio while also repurchasing shares. I think we'll still be in that position. We still have non-core kind of rundown working for us, which is releasing RWAs. You should again have a chance to somewhat have your cake and eat it too, both in Q3 and Q4.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nOkay, thank you, Bruce. On the non-interest-bearing mix stabilizing, you know, at a, you know, at the 23% near the Q2 level now. What gives you confidence in the stabilization? I know you mentioned that you're not pushing as aggressively. You don't see the need to now on competition, on pricing. Is there anything though beyond that terms of the positive behavior that you're beginning to see that gives you that confidence that this is where it's bottoming?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think there's two items that we look at. One is just the, you know, as we are getting back to the historical place that the platform generated, you know, non-interest-bearing pre-pandemic. That has been sort of a foundational spot that we think creates some solidification of the operating accounts in both retail and consumer. That's one really important spot. Around that 23% level is about how we see it.\nThe second item is that in the second quarter we started to see some deceleration for the first time in several quarters. We started to see the turn and deposits kind of migration decelerating. We have a number of, I would say, activities on the product and low cost strategy front that we're seeing some really positive uptick on in retail in particular, and so.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nLet's ask Brendan to pick up and add some color.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, a couple of quick points. Just a quick recall. As we've talked to over the last whole bunch of quarters, the consumer portfolio has been under a five, six-year transformation for quite some time and is in a very, very different starting point through the beginning of this cycle than ever before for this franchise with significant improvements in things like customer primacy, growth in households, our mass affluent mix has improved, and low-cost deposit profile has moved up. Coming into the cycle, we were very confident that we'd be more peer-like or maybe outperform.\nData that we're seeing with benchmarking suggests that in the consumer bank, we are indeed better than average versus peers right now on all dimensions: interest-bearing cost, beta, as well as low cost control. We feel pretty good about how we're performing against peers. It is starting to stabilize. The excess surge deposits have burned down maybe by about 60%. There's still a little bit out there, but a lot of those are starting to be sticky and turn into wealth creation. If you dissect the various different segments, the wealthier segment is still having some modest outflows of rotation into interest bearing, as well as rotation outside of the banking industry.\nYear-over-year, the wealthier segment is down about 10%. We're seeing the mass affluent segment in deposits on a per customer basis about flat, and the mass market portfolio has actually increased in net deposits. That's a function of a lot of our strategies that we've put in place to really drive primacy, activity, and engagement. We've seen a bit of a bottoming at the lower end in terms of DDA balances. What we have done to drive that is a lot of product innovation. We did things like get your paycheck two days early. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but it's actually an incredibly big deal that's driving a lot of primary banking behavior.\nWe've got technology we put in place that when you open a new DDA, you're automatically porting over your direct deposit. It seems very operationally oriented, but it actually is a dramatic improvement to things like primary banking behavior, which drives low-cost deposits. We've made overdraft reform through our Peace of Mind 24-Hour Grace program and a variety of other things, which has also driven a lot of primacy. We're starting to really rev up the engines on household growth overall. All of those things contribute to some controllables. I think we're outperforming peers on market.\nGiven our starting point in the cycle, we're continuing to invest to try to further outperform through all of these different initiatives and strategies. It is the long game. These are driving privacy and low-cost deposits. It takes a while to build up scale, but I feel like we've got a lot of the right things in place, in addition to outperforming on our back book to win the game on controllables where we're at right now.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWhile you're 2/3 of the deposit base and have all these great strategies, I mean, Don, you've also been investing in payments capabilities and some new products like sustainable deposits. Maybe you could just offer a brief comment.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThat's right. I mean, we've been broadening out our deposit base quite nicely. As Bruce said, it's a combination of just the growth in the cash management business overall, and bringing on more clients. On the cash management side, as I said, you know, in New York Metro, the things that we're adding are really full wallet, full cash management relationships. Those bring really nice deposits.\nOn the product side, we've done a lot around green deposits, carbon offset deposits, and our ESG strategy. Those have proved to be quite profitable. We've built out escrow products and bankruptcy products. There's a variety of product development things which are attracting nice operating deposits with some nice breadth to them.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nOkay, great, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from the line of Manan Gosalia with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. I appreciate all the detail on the office book. It looks like you have a pretty conservative assumption baked into your CRE office reserve levels of 8%. I guess the question is, what would you need to see to take that up even more, or over the next few quarters as some of your office portfolio comes up for renewal, should we expect the reserve levels go down as you have more normalized NCOs in that portfolio?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nLet me start, and John or Don can add. You know, we feel quite good about, A, the overall nature of what we have, and B, then, so there's good diversification, good quality characteristics. We have some really good people that are really focused hard on this, and they're monitoring this loan by loan. They see the upcoming maturities, they get way in front of those. We're having good dialogue with borrowers, and I'd say we did a good job, relatively good job, in the first half of absorbing some of the maturities.\nProbably about 30 loans, I think, came up for maturity, which is about the number that we're going to have in the second half, and it's about the number that we're going to have in the first half of next year. It's about the number that we're going to have in the fourth quarter of next year. If you look at, you know, the net result of that, while we have an increase in criticized, we have an increase. This quarter was a little lumpy in NPAs in this sector, and that probably levels off. I'd say, you know, we were able to build our reserve and absorb charge-offs. We took $56 million in charge-offs, so that's another kind of 1.5% loss content.\nIf you look at the 8%, it's effectively higher by what we just absorbed. Could we go for another few quarters with absorbing charge-offs kind of on a pay-as-you-go basis with what we're providing and hold the reserve flat? Yeah, possibly that could happen. At some point, does that tip over, and then you don't need as much reserve because you've burned some of those losses through your charge-off line? Anyway, that's just a little color about how we think about it. John, I don't know if you want to add anything or go direct to Don.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll just reiterate the fact that, as you mentioned, we took $56 million. That's 1.5%. We've got 8.5%. We've got 8% set aside, so that implies a 9.5% coverage for the losses through the cycle. We think that's pretty darn adequate, as a matter of fact, very strong. I think that you also mentioned NPLs flattening out, and charge-offs kind of getting in the run rate rather than step change from here, which I think is important to reemphasize, and maybe just turn it over to Don.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think you guys have said it was 26 loans, so you're pretty close to 30. That's pretty good that you know that. I think the thing I'd emphasize is we've literally gone through every single loan one by one, and every one is different. It's property specific, it's MSA specific, it's rent roll specific, it's sponsor specific. We're just seeing, we're starting to see outcomes. Outcomes are, you know, a property gets extended and renegotiated with the sponsor. You might have a little bit of equity injected to improve interest carry, and you might charge it off.\nSo, and I think that we have a pretty good eye to the path of the book as we look forward. You know, things could always change. I think we feel pretty comfortable that we've been very conservative based on what we see. I will emphasize, I mean we're not originating anything really of any scale in origination. Our whole origination team, in addition to our credit team, in addition to our work app team, is focused on working with our sponsors to basically.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIn the office sector.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIn the office sector, yes. And the rest, by the way, the rest of the real estate, both multifamily, industrial, data centers, I think looks like it's holding up extremely well. We're really not seeing any weakness that concerns us at all in the rest of the real estate part.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's very helpful. Thanks for the fulsome answer. Just to move on to capital, is there any color you can share on what drove the increase in the stressed capital buffer this year? I know the mortgage was something that was a little bit of a headwind for the whole group, but any other information you glean from your conversations with the Fed, and then maybe what you need to do to bring that down in future years.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we haven't really had the full debrief, so we are getting that set up so we can go through and kind of understand their models better. I think that's been one of the concerns of the industry, that it's not that transparent to us, but kind of when we look at the results, there's a couple of things that could have been a factor. One is the build of the allowance. When we took relatively high charge-offs, we had a significant build was built into their models, which we didn't have in our models, and that alone probably cost us 30 basis points of the 60% increase or something like that.\nSo, that's one thing that we'll want to talk about and understand better. Questions about we did a deal and did the one-time expenses get incorporated, or we've done a lot of hedging in the falling rate scenario, are our hedges getting full benefits? We just have some questions that we want to poke at. In any case, I think the bigger point here is that we can roll with this 8.5% and we have plenty of capital, and we have an appreciable buffer versus that capital. It really doesn't affect kind of our capital management strategies, but we would like to see it get kind of back into line. We think it's a bit elevated relative to where it should be, and we'll be having those conversations with the Fed in the coming weeks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think that as you get past this year where we have those integration expenses, and you know, there's a hypothesis that that will roll off as you get into next year. We'll have another bite of the apple next year given the fact that we're going to be doing this again. In the end, the SCB is not our constraint. Our constraint is our own view of what capital we need to be prudent to support, you know, our business, and you know, frankly, where the Fed and the regulators are headed with required kind of levels outside of the SCB is going to be our constraints.\nWe're going to be, as Bruce mentioned earlier, about 200 basis points over the SCB by the end of the year, and probably heading towards earlier compliance with whatever the Fed comes out with at most. We're feeling pretty darn good about the capital position, notwithstanding the SCB.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. The BSO should have a positive impact on your risk-weighted assets. Should that also have a positive impact on the SCB?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell, it might. I mean, I think more importantly, it gives us a flexibility to rotate RWA capital into relationship lending and return that capital to the extent that those front book opportunities are not there. We probably have the opportunity to do both, where we rotate that capital into relationship lending and provide an ability to buy back. It doesn't have a direct impact on the SCB.\n\nManan Gosalia\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question, one moment please. Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja. Go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thank you. Just to follow up on the First Republic banker question, Bruce, Brendan, what requirements do you, what are your pricing assumptions? You said you're trying to bring the pricing to yours, but then what are the assumptions for what the bankers need to deliver to be able to recoup their or earn their guarantees? Secondly, given that this was a white glove service, which is obviously very expensive, what changes are you planning to make to that to be able to get to your hurdle profitability targets?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, yeah, thanks for the question. We already, prior to the lift out of the private bankers, had a relationship-based pricing in play in all of our asset classes, including mortgage. When you bring heavy levels of deposits in AUM, we price down modestly for that. We don't have any intention of changing what we already do. Our new private bankers will have access to the same relationship pricing grids that we've had in play for a while.\nAs you think about pricing and yields of things like mortgages or even some of the small business commercial lending, we're not expecting a dramatic different profile in terms of profitability or yields from legacy Citizens and how we operate business to make sure that we're considering the full relationship and that we're really competitive in pricing, but we're not undercutting the market by a material amount that will deteriorate either lending return.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think the corollary to that is that the teams that came over understand that.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThey do.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou know, I'd say the one thing that they won't have in their arsenal is deeply discounted mortgages. I think they come in with their eyes wide open on that. Quite honestly, the deeply discounted mortgages are probably now back on your balance sheet because people aren't refinancing those at a good clip. They'll probably sit there for a long time. Anyway, we will kind of do business in a commercial way. Again, the bigger the relationship, the better the pricing, generally. I think the team coming over is very comfortable with that.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAnother question around expenses implied in the comments that John and Bruce both made around breakevens inside of 2024 is, is the team's production covering kind of comp guarantees to come over. We've been really thoughtful about how we do that, but obviously we've got the way these folks get paid, is in a book of business model. They're going to go out and develop a lot of business, and we're going to give them the runway to do that.\nWe had a lot of debate with them on the appropriate timing to make that happen and make sure the operations excellence is available here at Citizens, that the cost of that is considered in all of our guidance and commentary we made about the profitability of the business. We're already well underway on tinkering with the way the bank works to make sure we're creating the conditions for them.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'd say there we probably had the brakes on a little bit to make sure that we get it to the level because you kind of get one shot with some of these customers. We've got a full effort on making sure that we get to the standards that we need. I would say one other silver lining from that also is that that'll help us up our game in customer experience more broadly, the kind of initiatives that we're taking to make sure that we make this a great experience. There'll be some things that spin off from that that we can move to other parts of the bank without question.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. A follow-up for just Don. Don, what are you seeing on the whole sponsor side, given with high rates in the market? When, you know, what level do you expect it to come back to even in 2024, say, just given if rates stay high? Yes, some cuts, but I don't think anybody's expecting it to go back to where we were a year and a half ago. Any thoughts on what level of activity do you think we get back?\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we'll see. High level, our pipelines are about 30% higher than they were at this time last quarter. We're seeing the pipelines build. Sponsors are certainly engaging in conversations, whether they can get to actual transactions or not, although there have been some. There was the Worldpay transaction that was announced a few weeks ago. We're beginning to see some transactions. Remember, one of the things that we benefit from, and I've said this a couple quarters, is we tend to play in smaller deals. Right. We're $100 million to $750 million to $1 billion in terms of deal size, whether it be advisory or financing.\nWe were number one in the middle market leverage finance tables in the last quarter. Volumes were down, but we were the number one institution playing. We're gaining share for what's available. Do I think we're going to be back to 2021 levels? No, but I think if you get stability in rates, the beginning of deal formation will happen, and it'll just depend on valuation dynamics between sponsors and sellers.\nThere's just a lot of companies in our portfolio that need to sell. They want to sell for generational reasons, so there are things that are available. Deals may get over-equitized just to keep the interest burden down if value doesn't come down. We're starting to see a lot of conversations going. I don't think we're going to be off to the races, but I think it's going to continually build. I think 2024 could be a pretty good year.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions in queue. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAll right, thanks, Alan. Thanks again everyone for dialing in today. We certainly appreciate your interest and support. Have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. We're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up. We're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions.\nOur comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nThanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. First quarter brought many unexpected challenges in the environment. Nonetheless, we proved resilient and adaptable, and we delivered a solid quarter for our stakeholders. We maintained a strong capital, liquidity and funding position with our CET1 ratio at 10%, our TCE ratio at 6.6%, and a solid deposit franchise that skews 2/3 consumer.\nWe've seen the churn in the deposit market continue to diminish since the bank failures with our deposits broadly stable in the month of March. For the quarter, we posted underlying earnings per share of $1.10 and return on tangible equity of 15.8%. Our NII was down 3%, reflecting day count impact, slightly lower earning assets and a stable net interest margin of 3.3%.\nNoninterest income and noninterest expense came in broadly as expected, both impacted by seasonality. Our credit metrics are also trending as expected and we built our ACL to loans ratio to 1.47%, which was up 4 basis points during the quarter and it's [ 17 ] basis points higher than our pro forma day 1 CECL ACL ratio. We repurchased $400 million in shares during the quarter, which reduced our share count by 1.7%.\nIn our slide deck, we tackle head-on some of the industry issues that investors have been concerned about. I'll let John run through the details, but the headline is that we have strong confidence in our capital, liquidity and funding position. We have been conservative in maintaining a capital ratio near the top of our peer group in focusing on a stable consumer-oriented and granular deposit base and in establishing a prudent credit risk appetite and reserve level.\nWhile we had some commercial real estate exposure, we feel good about our diversification, the asset characteristics and the borrower quality. CRE criticized assets and workouts will increase during the cycle but we currently expect losses to be manageable, and we've already set aside meaningful reserves.\nOn the regulatory front, it is clear that some changes will occur. Our hope is that the response is thoughtful and appropriate, leaving the bank landscape that has served our country so well intact and even stronger than before. In any case, we anticipate any changes will follow a review and comment process with any revisions likely to be phased in gradually.\nWhile much of the past month has been focused on playing strong defense, we continue to play prudent offense by investing in and advancing our strategic initiatives. We will clearly prioritize deposits deepening and efficiency initiatives for the balance of 2023.\nOur New York City Metro integration is progressing extremely well with a successful core conversion of Investors Bank in February and growth metrics that are well ahead of plan. Our outlook for 2023 still shows attractive RoTCE for the full year despite the challenging environment. There's still a great deal of uncertainty, which makes forecasting more difficult, but we remain confident in the strength of our franchise and the ability to weather the storm.\nWe are building a great bank, and we remain excited about our future. Our capital strength and attractive franchise should position us to be nimble and to take advantage of opportunities as they arise.\nWith that, let me turn it over to John to take you through more of the financial details. John?\n\nJohn F. Woods\n\nVice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nThanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with the headlines for the financial results referencing Slide 5. Big picture, first quarter results were solid against the backdrop of volatility in the macro environment. We continue to progress against our portfolio of strategic initiatives, including the well-executed conversion of the investor platform in February.\nFor the first quarter, we generated underlying net income of $560 million and EPS of $1.10. Our underlying RoTCE for the quarter was 15.8%. Net interest income was down 3% linked quarter given the lower day count and lower interest-earning assets. Our margin was stable at 3.3%.\nPeriod-end loans and average loans were down slightly quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the impact of our balance sheet optimization efforts, such as our ongoing runoff of auto. Deposit levels declined in the quarter primarily due to the impact of seasonal factors, the compounding impact of the rate environment and particularly earlier this occurred in the quarter.\nImportantly, our deposit levels were broadly stable during the market turbulence in March. Our quarter end LVR is 89.8% and our liquidity position remains very strong with current available liquidity as of today of about $66 billion.\nOur credit metrics and overall position remains solid. Total net charge-offs of 34 basis points are up 12 basis points linked quarter, in line with ongoing normalization trends. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $168 million and a reserve build of $35 million this quarter, increasing our ACL coverage to 1.47% up from 1.43% at the end of the fourth quarter, with most of the increase directed to the general office portfolio.\nOur current coverage ratio is about 17 basis points stronger than our pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of 1.3%. We repurchased $400 million of common shares in the first quarter and delivered a strong CET1 ratio at the top of our target range at 10%, and our tangible book value per share is up 6% linked quarter.\nBefore I walk through the details of the results for the quarter, let me address some of the industry issues that are top of mind on Slide 6. First, we have a very strong capital base, which is one of the highest in our regional bank peer group, even if one were to include the rate-driven unrealized losses on all of our investment securities.\nWe have a quality deposit franchise, which has performed very well since the turbulence, which began in early March. We continue to see the benefit from all of the investments we've made since the IPO with 67% of total deposits from consumer and a well-diversified commercial portfolio with about 66% of our clients using us as their primary bank.\nFinally, 68% of deposits are insured or secured. Our liquidity position is quite strong with a diverse funding base, ample available liquidity, and strong risk management capabilities. In fact, our LCR level exceeds what would be required as a Category 3 bank at March 31, 2023.\nLooking at credit, our metrics continue to look solid. Retail is normalizing, but is still performing quite well as the employment picture remains strong. On the commercial side, our focus is on the CRE portfolio and on general office in particular, which is impacted by back-to-work trends and rising interest rates.\nWe have a very strong reserve coverage of 6.7% on the general office portfolio, and I'll go through some of the details later. And lastly, the market is concerned about how the regulators may respond to the disruption in March, which, in our view, was unique to the banks in question and not reflective of broader in regulation or management lapses. We'll watch closely how things develop, but in any case, we think the process will be thoughtful and deliberate.\nFinally, we believe we are well positioned for any increase in regulatory requirements, given our diverse business model and current excess capital and liquidity regulatory ratios.\nLet's drill into the details on the next few slides, starting with capital on Slide 7. We ended the quarter with one of the highest capital levels in our regional bank peer group with a CET1 ratio at the top of our target range of 10%. This strong capital level reflects our prudent approach to deploying capital as we prioritize driving improved returns over the medium term.\nIf you include the rate-driven unrealized loss on debt securities and AOCI, our adjusted CET1 ratio would be 8.7%. If you remove the unrealized losses in HTM, our tangible common equity ratio would reduce by 20 basis points to 6.4%. All of these ratios are expected to be near the top of our peer group again in this quarter.\nWe expect to maintain very strong capital levels going forward with the ability to generate roughly 25 basis points of capital post dividend each quarter and before share buybacks. We have $1.6 billion of repurchase capacity remaining under our current board authorization, timing of repurchases will be dependent on our view of external conditions.\nNext, I'll move to Slide 8 to discuss our deposit franchise. As you can see, our deposit franchise is skewed towards consumer and highly diversified across product mix and in terms of the various channels we can tap. About 67% of our total deposits are consumer, up from 60% at December 31, which puts us in the top quartile of our peer group, and roughly 68% of our deposits are insured by the FDIC or secured, which is up from 60% at year-end.\nDemand deposits represent about 26% of the book down slightly from 27% at year-end as customers have naturally rotated towards higher-yielding alternatives. On Slide 9, the headline is that our deposit performance since midyear 2022 following the investors acquisition and the commencement of TT has been in line with industry performance.\nWe outgrew both the industry and peer average in the second half of 2022. We entered 2023, expecting that the normal seasonal deposit outflows in the first quarter would be somewhat exacerbated by the higher rate environment. And we saw a little more of that than we had forecast by about 1% but most of that happened in January and February. Given our rundown in auto, we were willing to let some deposits run off early in the quarter, trying to hold the line on betas.\nIn March, we saw some elevated inflows and outflows as customers across the industry can look to diversify their deposits in the wake of bank failures. But overall, our deposits were broadly stable during the month. This strong performance is attributable to investing heavily in our deposit offerings and capabilities since the IPO, and this will remain a focus as we continue to build a top-performing bank franchise.\nOn Slide 10, we highlight some of the things that we are doing to attract deposits and drive primacy with our customers. In Consumer, we've developed a compelling set of products and features that drive higher customer satisfaction and encourage them to do more with us. We have strong analytics capabilities and compelling offerings such as Citizens Plus in our Private Client Group as well as Citizens Access, our digital bank to leverage. And with the final conversion complete at investors, we have a substantial opportunity to take deposit share in the New York Metro Market.\nOn the commercial side, we have invested heavily in our treasury solutions capabilities with a state-of-the-art platform and strong talent to serve client needs. We continue to add better tools for our clients to manage their cash and drive higher operational deposits as well as innovative products and capabilities to attract deposits.\nMoving to Slide 11. We are monitoring the commercial real estate portfolio closely given the softening macro environment and the pressure of rising rates impacting refinance needs. The general office sector is a particular concern as tenants rethink their space needs given the remote work trends. Given these pressures, we are evaluating our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. It's worth noting, however, that near 100% of our borrowers are current on their obligations with NPLs under 50 basis points.\nWe are starting to see an increase in criticized assets and have added workout resources, but given the diversity and quality of the portfolio, we feel the credit costs will be manageable. Our total CRE allowance coverage of 2% includes an elevated coverage for the general office portfolio of 6.7%.\nOn Slide 12, we drilled down a bit on the $6.3 billion office portfolio, which includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back to office trends and are expected to perform quite well. The remaining $4.1 billion relates to the general office segment, which we feel is reasonably well positioned across type, geography and suburban areas and central business districts.\nAbout 90% of the general office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas, and the majority is Class A.\nNext, I'll provide further details related to first quarter results. On Slide 13, net interest income was down 3%, given lower day count, which was worth about $29 million and slightly lower interest-earning assets. The net interest margin of 3.3% was stable with the increase in asset yields offset by higher funding costs.\nWith debt funds increasing 475 basis points at the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 36% through the end of the quarter. We continue to dynamically adjust our hedge position so that we have down rate protection in the second half of 2023 and through 2026. As we approach the height of the rate cycle, we have managed our asset sensitivity down from roughly 3% at the end of last year to a more neutral 1.1% at the end of the first quarter.\nMoving on to Slide 14, we posted solid fee results despite seasonality and headwinds from market volatility and higher rates. These showed some resilience amid a challenging environment, down 4% linked quarter with seasonal impacts in capital markets and service charges partly offset by strength in FX and derivatives revenue and a modest improvement in mortgage banking fees.\nFocusing on capital markets, market volatility continued through the quarter and syndications and M&A advisory fees were seasonally lower. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines and signs that deal flow should pick up as the year progresses. Mortgage fees were slightly better with higher production fees as we are seeing volumes rising and margins improving with the industry reducing capacity. This should continue to benefit margins over time.\nAnd finally, card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter. On Slide 15, expenses came in better than expected, up only 2.8% linked quarter, given seasonally higher salaries and employee benefits as well as the impact of an industry-wide FDIC surcharge implemented at the beginning of the year.\nOn Slide 16, average loans were down slightly and period end loans down 1% linked quarter including the impact of planned auto runoff. We have seen commercial utilization decrease a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this, as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of reduced economic activity.\nAverage retail loans are down slightly, reflecting the planned runoff in auto, which was largely offset by growth in mortgage and home equity.\nOn Slide 17, average deposits were down $4.7 billion or 2.6% linked quarter, driven by seasonal and rate-related outflows. As I mentioned earlier, the majority of the deposit decrease occurred in January and February, with balances broadly stable in March. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 51 basis points, which translates to a 73% sequential beta and a 36% cumulative beta.\nMoving on to Slide 18. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 34 basis points, up 12 basis points linked quarter, which reflects continued normalization. Nonperforming loans are 64 basis points of total loans, up 4 basis points from the fourth quarter as an increase in commercial was offset by improvements in retail. Retail delinquencies were broadly stable with the fourth quarter and continue to remain favorable to historical levels, but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumer is faring.\nTurning to Slide 19, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We increased our allowance by $35 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown and the outlook for losses in the commercial portfolio, particularly general office. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.4%, which is a 4 basis point increase from the fourth quarter.\nThe current reserve level calculation contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios such as CRE. Moving to Slide 20, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our target range.\nTangible book value per share was up 6% in the quarter, and the tangible common equity ratio has improved to 6.6%. We returned a total of $605 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.\nShifting gears a bit, on Slide 21, we continue to make good progress with our push into the New York metro market. We were very excited to complete the branch and systems conversion at Investors in February, which went very smoothly. With that behind us, we are full steam ahead working to serve our customers and capitalize on opportunities to capture market share.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the strong early momentum we are seeing in the branches where customer satisfaction has been improving significantly, and we continue to see some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network across the legacy HSBC and Investors branches. We've also seen some good early client wins and a growing pipeline in commercial.\nWe look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product lineup and customer-focused retail and small business model across the New York market.\nMoving to Slide 22 for a quick update on our TOP 8 program. Our latest TOP program is well underway and progressing well. Given the external environment, we have begun to look for opportunities to augment our TOP 8 program in order to protect returns as well as ensure that we can continue to make the important investments in our business to drive future performance. We'll have more to say about this in the coming months.\nMoving to Slide 23. I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter and give you an update on our outlook for the full year that takes into account a modest economic slowdown with the Fed expected to raise rates by 25 basis points in May, and then begin easing late in the year.\nFor the second quarter, we expect NII to decrease about 3%. Noninterest income is up mid- to high-single digits. Noninterest expense should be stable to down slightly. Net charge-offs should remain in the mid-30s basis points. Our CET1 is expected to come in above 10% with some share repurchase planning depending upon our view of the external environment.\nMoving to Slide 24. As we think about the full year, we remain focused on maintaining strong capital, liquidity and funding position while sustaining attractive returns. Of course, there is a continued level of uncertainty in the current environment. For the full year 2023, we expect NII to be up 5% to 7%. We are focused on initiatives that will stabilize and even grow our deposits modestly from first quarter levels over the remainder of the year.\nNoninterest income is expected to be up mid-single digits. Noninterest expense is expected to be up about 5%. Net charge-offs are expected to be in the mid- to high 30s basis points. Our current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and known risks and there should be less of a need for further reserve builds given anticipated spot loan decline for the year as auto runs down, and our CET1 ratio is expected to be above the upper end of our 9.5% to 10% target range, at 10% to 10.25% assuming stable market conditions, our share repurchases are expected to build over the course of the year.\nTo sum up on Slide 25, we delivered a solid quarter despite unexpected challenges and are ready for the uncertainty that lies ahead in 2023. Our strong capital, liquidity, and funding position will serve us well to move forward with our strategic priorities and deliver attractive returns this year as we balance the need for strong defense with the imperative of continuing to play prudent offense to strengthen the franchise for the future. Even as we navigate through the current challenging environment, we reaffirm our commitment to our medium-term financial targets. With that, I'll hand back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (Rhode Island)\n\nOkay. Thank you, John. Alan, let's open it up for some Q&A.",

My name is [Kelly], and I'll be your operator today.\n(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I will turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of IR, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, [Kelly]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our fourth quarter and full year earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We are also referencing non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. We are pleased with the financial performance we delivered for the fourth quarter and the full year, and we feel well positioned to navigate through an uncertain environment in 2023. We are playing strong defense with a robust balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. At the same time, we continue to play disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives. We are focused on building out a prudent, sustainable growth trajectory over the medium term.\nI'll comment briefly on the financial headlines and let John take you through the details. For the quarter, our underlying EPS was $1.32. Our return on tangible common equity was 19.4%, and the efficiency ratio was 54%. Sequential operating leverage was 1% and sequential PPNR growth was 2.6%. Leading our performance was 2% sequential NII growth, reflecting NIM expansion of 5 basis points to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given the impact of a $900 million reduction in our auto portfolio. Growth was 1% ex this impact. Deposits were solid with 1% sequential growth, and our LDR remained stable at 87%.\nOur fee businesses showed resilience and diversity given a challenging environment, down about 1% sequentially. A number of M&A fees pushed into Q1 and mortgage results were softer than expected. We maintained stable expenses in the quarter, and credit metrics remain good. We boosted our allowance for credit losses to 1.43% of loans, which compares with pro forma day 1 CECL levels of 1.30%. We restarted our share repurchase activity in Q4, buying $150 million of stock, and we ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 10% at the top of our targeted range. For full year 2022, we delivered underlying EPS of $4.84 and ROTCE of 16.4% as we captured the benefit of rising rates in our strengthened deposit base.\nThe results handily exceeded our beginning of year guide, which we included in the appendix of the presentation. With respect to our guidance for 2023, we assume a slowdown in economic growth to 1% for the year, 2 early Fed rate hikes and a Q4 cut and inflation getting below 3% by Q4. We project moderate loan growth, partially offset by continued runoff in our auto book of close to $3 billion. Overall, we see solid NII growth as NIM gradually rises to 3.4% over the year, a roughly 8% growth in fees given a rebound in capital markets fees over the course of the year, solid expense discipline with core expense growth ex acquisition and FDIC impacts of 3.5% to 4%.\nWe announced today our top 8 program, which targets $100 million in run rate benefits and about 80% of that is expense impact. Credit should be manageable with net charge-offs in the 30 to 35 basis point range, and we expect to build our ACL to 1.45% to 1.5% of loans. We expect to repurchase a meaningful amount of stock given strong profitability, modest loan growth and limited expectation for acquisitions with our CET1 ratio forecast near the high end of our 9.5% to 10% range.\nCapital return to shareholders should approach 100% and yield to investors of our dividends plus capital return via repurchase put TOP 12%. So all in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2022, and we feel we are well positioned in 2023 to continue our journey towards becoming a top-performing bank. We continue to make good progress in executing on our strategic initiatives across consumer, commercial and the enterprise. We've transformed our deposit base and are reaping the benefits.\nWe've adjusted our interest hedging to protect against lower rates through 2025. Given the improvement in our ROTCE over time, we are raising our medium-term target to 16% to 18% from 14% to 16%. We've stayed focused on positive operating leverage. We've captured the benefit of moving to a more normal rate environment, and we still have plenty of upside in our fee businesses as market conditions improve. Exciting times for Citizens.\nI'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2022. We know we can count on you again in the New Year. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn F. Woods\n\nVice Chairman & CFO, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. Big picture, 2022 was a strong year for Citizens with significant delivery of strategic initiatives against the backdrop of uncertainty and volatility in the macro environment. Most notably, we closed our acquisitions of HSBC and ISBC. We captured the benefit of higher rates with strong NII and NIM, and our balance sheet and interest rate position were well managed.\nWhile fee revenues were impacted by the environment, we are very well positioned across our businesses to capitalize on the upside potential when markets normalize, particularly in capital markets. Mortgage margins and volumes should recover over time, and we are excited for the growth prospects arising from our wealth investments. We are actively managing our loan portfolio, focusing on allocating capital where we can drive deeper relationship business into 2023 and beyond.\nWe continue to maintain good expense discipline, delivering in excess of $115 million of pretax run rate benefit through TOP 7 and generating 4.7% underlying positive operating leverage for the year and 16.4% full year ROTCE.\nLet me give you the headlines for the financial results, referencing Slide 5. For the fourth quarter, we reported underlying net income of $685 million and EPS of $1.32. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 19.4%. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter with 5 basis points of margin expansion to 3.3% and relatively stable loans given a planned reduction in our auto portfolio.\nPeriod ended average loans are broadly stable linked quarter, up 1%, excluding auto runoff. We grew deposits of 1% linked quarter and our LDR was stable at 87%. Fees showed some resilience and met a challenging environment, down 1% linked quarter. We saw a modest improvement in capital markets fees driven by underwriting and M&A, but this was more than offset by a drop in mortgage fees and a CVA/DVA impact in our FX and IRP business.\nExpenses were broadly stable linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 1% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.4%. Our credit metrics were good with NCOs of 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter.\nWe recorded a provision for credit losses of $132 million and a reserve build of $44 million this quarter. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, up from 1.41% at the end of the third quarter and approximately 13 basis points above our pro forma day 1 CECL adoption coverage ratio. Our tangible book value per share is up 5% linked quarter.\nNext, I'll provide further details related to the fourth quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 2% given higher net interest margin. The net interest margin of 3.3%, was up 5 basis points. As you can see on the NIM walk on the bottom left-hand side of the slide, a healthy increase in asset yields continues to outpace funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet. With Fed funds increasing 425 basis points since the end of 2021, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta has been well controlled at 29% through the end of the fourth quarter.\nMoving on to Slide 7. We posted solid fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 1% linked quarter with lower mortgage and FX and derivative fees, partly offset by an improvement in capital markets fees.\nFocusing on capital markets. Market volatility continued through the quarter. However, underwriting and M&A advisory fees picked up. We continue to see good strength in our M&A pipelines, including several deals that were pushed into Q1. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment continued to weigh on production volumes. We are seeing pressure on volumes moderating and size of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time.\nServicing operating fees were stable. Card and wealth fees posted solid results for the quarter. On Slide 8, expenses were well controlled, broadly stable linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program delivered over $115 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. We are excited to announce the launch of our new TOP 8 program, and I'll cover that in a few slides.\nOn Slide 9, average and period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter but up 1% ex auto runoff with 1% growth in commercial, reflecting demand in asset-backed financing and growth in CRE, primarily reflecting line draws and slower paydowns. We have seen commercial utilization moderate a bit over the quarter as inflation and supply chain pressures continue easing and clients are adjusting inventories to reflect this as well as lower CapEx in anticipation of the softer economy.\nAverage retail loans are down slightly, but up 1% ex planned runoff in auto, given growth in mortgage and home equity, which bring an opportunity for deeper relationships and better risk-adjusted returns.\nOn Slide 10, average deposits were up $1.4 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth primarily coming from term deposits, money market accounts and Citizens Access savings. Overall, commercial banking deposits were up 2.4% and consumer banking deposits were broadly stable. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 67 basis points, which translates to a 29% cumulative beta, broadly consistent with our expectations.\nWe began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We achieved overall deposit growth this quarter, and we will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits. Overall liquidity remains strong as we reduced our FHLB advances by $1.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end. Our period-end LDR improved slightly to 86.7%.\nMoving on to Slide 11. We saw a good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 22 basis points, up 3 basis points linked quarter, which is still low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans are 60 basis points of total loans, up 5 basis points from the third quarter, given an increase in commercial, largely in CRE.\nRetail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels but we continue to closely monitor leading indicators to gauge how the consumers vary. Although personal disposable income remains strong, debt service as a percentage of disposable income has essentially returned to pre-pandemic levels while consumer confidence has stabilized as inflation has eased.\nTurning to Slide 12, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. While our current credit metrics are good, we increased our allowance by $44 million to take into account the growing risk of an economic slowdown. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.43%, which is a modest increase from the third quarter. The current reserve level contemplates a moderate recession and incorporates expectations of lower asset prices and the risk of added stress on certain portfolios, including those subject to higher risk from inflation, supply chain issues, higher interest rates and return to office trends. Given these pressures, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office. Back on Slide 32 in the appendix, we have provided some additional information about the CRE portfolio.\nOur total CRE allowance coverage of 1.86% includes elevated coverage for the office portfolio while the multifamily portfolio has a much lower reserve requirement. The $6.3 billion office portfolio includes $2.2 billion of credit tenant and life sciences properties, which are not as exposed to adverse back-to-office trends. The remaining $4 billion relates to the General Office segment for which we are holding a roughly 5% allowing coverage. About 95% of the General Office portfolio is income producing and about 70% is located in suburban areas.\nMoving to Slide 13. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10%, which is at the top end of our range. Tangible book value per share was up 5% in the quarter, and the tangible common equity ratio improved to 6.3%. We returned a total of $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our strong capital position, combined with our earnings outlook, puts us in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders through additional share repurchases.\nShifting gears a bit. Starting on Slide 14, we'll cover some of the unique opportunities we have to drive outperformance over the next few years. We have tried to be very disciplined in prioritizing the areas that we think have big potential and where we have a right to win. So in Consumer, we've got 4 big opportunities. First is our [cushion] to New York Metro. We are investing in brand marketing, doing well in the technology conversions and putting our best people against the market opportunity.\nWe are encouraged by our early success with some recent client wins in commercial and the HSBC branches driving some of the highest customer acquisition and sales rates in our network. The full ISBC conversion is just around the corner on President's weekend, and we look forward to making further strides as we leverage the full power of our product lineup and customer-focused retail and small business model across the New York market. You will see more details on Slide 28 and 29 in the appendix.\nImportantly, we achieved about 70% in run rate of our planned $130 million of investors' net expense synergies as of the end of the year and we expect to capture the rest by the middle of the year. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates.\nMoving to wealth. We've launched a number of exciting initiatives with Citizens Private Client and Citizens Plus as we orient the business towards financial planning-led advice. These should really help us penetrate the opportunity with our existing customer base.\nOn Slide 15, our national expansion is another area where we have a great opportunity to build on our digital platform that has been focused on deposits for the last few years. We've moved that to a cloud-based platform, and we are adding our other product capabilities so that we can offer a complete digital bank experience to serve customers nationwide with a focus on the young mass affluent market segment.\nWhere we might have only had a lending or deposit relationship before, our vision is to build a national platform that allows us to serve our customers in a comprehensive way. And we have also been very innovative in creating distinctive ways to serve customers. Citizens Pay, for example, is an area where we have significant running room. We've attracted many new partners, up about 150 versus a year ago, which should really ramp the business. And we built an industry-leading home equity business, powered by our innovative fast line process, which is enabled by advanced analytics and digital innovations that have drastically reduced originations time.\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on Slide 16 and 17. We filled in all the product gaps. Acquisitions brought us M&A and other advisory capabilities, and we built out debt capital markets capabilities organically. We've hired some great coverage bankers and we are focused on high-growth regions around the country and the right industry verticals to serve larger companies. We also have a very strong sponsor coverage and are well positioned to support private equity capital. Bottom line, we have aligned ourselves with the attractive opportunities with a full product set to drive significant market share and fee revenues.\nMoving to Slide 18. We are excited to announce the launch of our latest TOP program. Even as we push forward on offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens success since our IPO has been our continuous effort to find new revenue pools and realize efficiencies and then reinvest those benefits back into our businesses so we can serve customers better. We've effectively executed our TOP 7 program, achieving a pretax run rate benefit of approximately $115 million at the end of 2022. And we've launched TOP 8 with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pretax benefits by the end of 2023, with that split about 80%-20% between efficiency and revenue-oriented initiatives.\nMoving to Slide 19. I'll walk through the outlook for the full year, which contemplates an economic slowdown and the end of December forward curve view of 225 basis point Fed hikes before an expected 25 basis point cut in the fourth quarter. We expect solid NII growth up 11% to 14%, and we project our NIM to gradually rise towards approximately 3.4% for the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOur overall hedge position is expected to provide a NIM floor of about 3.2% through the fourth quarter of 2024 and a gradual 200 basis point decline across the curve, commencing in Q4 2023. In the fourth quarter, we took actions to transition $3 billion of active swaps from 2023 to forward-starting positions in 2024. And we've done even more so far in January to rebalance the distribution of down rate protection. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 30.\nWe expect moderate loan growth with average loans up about 4% to 5%. We are targeting about $3 billion of spot auto runoff as we shift the portfolio towards products with more attractive risk-adjusted returns. We expect total average earning assets to be up 3% to 4%. On the deposit side, we see 3% average deposit growth and a 2% to 3% spot deposit decline with cumulative deposit betas at year-end reaching the high 30s. These are expected to be up 7% to 9% with a capital markets rebound building over the course of the year.\nNoninterest expense is expected to be up roughly 7% or about 3.5% to 4% if you adjust for the full year effect of the HSBC and investors acquisitions and the FDIC premium increase. If the year unfolds as we expect, we should be able to drive about 400 to 500 basis points of positive operating leverage.\nGiven current macro trends and portfolio originations, we expect that our ACL ratio will rise to the 1.45% to 1.5% level, depending upon how the economy fares. We expect our CET1 ratio to land at the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%, even with our target payout ratio approaching 100%. All of this translates into ROTCE in the high teens for 2023.\nOn Slide 20, we provide the guide for Q1. Note that Q1 is seasonally weak for us with the day count impact and seasonality impacting revenues and taxes on compensation payouts impacting expenses.\nMoving to Slide 21. As Bruce mentioned, we have completely transformed the franchise since the IPO, executing well against our priorities and achieving our desired performance targets, and we are ready to raise the bar, lifting our ROTCE target to 16% to 18%. The key to the further ROTCE improvement is continuing to deliver positive operating leverage. As we look out over the medium term, we should see a recovery in loan and deposit growth and we will continue to balance -- continue our balance sheet optimization efforts to focus on deep relationship lending to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We are well positioned to grow fees meaningfully. And even if rates come down a bit, we expect NII to benefit from the protection we have put on through the swap portfolio.\nYou should expect us to stay disciplined on expenses. Credit is projected to be stable as the economy strengthens. And we continue to focus on returning a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders through our repurchase program and targeting a dividend payout of 35% to 40%. Over this time frame, we would expect our CET1 ratio to remain within our target range of 9.5% to 10%.\nTo sum up, Slide 22, we delivered a strong quarter against the backdrop of a dynamic environment, and we have a positive outlook for 2023. We are ready for the uncertainty of an economic slowdown in 2023 with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position. We've taken actions to protect our NIM and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth. At the same time, we are moving forward to executing against our strategy and making important investments in our business that we believe will deliver sustainable growth and outperformance over the medium term.\nWith that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, John. And operator, why don't we open it up for Q&A?",

My name is Alan, and I'll be your operator today.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAs a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nHead of IR, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun; and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our third quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking; and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We will be referencing our third quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website.\nAfter the presentation, we will be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on Page 2 of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on Page 3 of the presentation and the reconciliations in the appendix.\nWith that, I will hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today.\nWe delivered another very strong quarterly result in Q3. Rising rates positively impacted our net interest income and net interest margin. Fees and expenses were broadly stable and credit performance remains excellent. We grew average loans 2% and deposits 1% as our liquidity and funding position remains strong and our CET1 ratio of 9.8% is above the midpoint of our 9.5% to 10% target range.\nOur TCE to total asset ratio sits at 6.1%. Performance metrics include a net interest margin of 3.25% and that's up 21 basis points. We had positive sequential operating leverage of 6%. We had hit an efficiency ratio below 55% and our return on tangible common equity was around 18%. We built our credit reserves by $49 million with our ACL at 1.41%, and that's above the 1.3% day 1 CECL reserve adjusted for the investors acquisition. Beyond these impressive financial results, we've continued to make good progress in executing our strategic initiatives.\nIn Consumer, we launched Citizens Private Client, which will help drive wealth opportunities. We migrated our national digital bank to a modern cloud-based platform. We continue to grow share with Citizens Pay, and we're executing well on our expansion into New York City Metro region.\nIn commercial, we've successfully integrated recent acquisitions like JMP and DH Capital into our coverage and product model. Our M&A pipelines are at record levels and our geographic and industry vertical build-out is delivering strong results in terms of market share gains. Enterprise wide, we're successfully ramping up our TOP 7 program, while building out TOP 8, Stay tuned on that. Our next-gen tech program has really been the standout initiative that has been a game changer for us.\nThese programs demonstrate our mindset of continuous improvement finding ways to run the bank more efficiently so we can deliver positive operating leverage and self-fund investments for our future. We're also doing some interesting things in ESG such as developing a carbon offset program for clients as well as investing in a virtual power agreement that delivers clean energy, and we have more interesting innovation in the pipeline.\nAs we look forward to Q4 in 2023, we feel that we are well positioned to deliver strong results and to keep growing and enhancing our franchise value. We are well prepared for challenges that may materialize in the macro environment with a really strong balance sheet position and highly prudent credit risk appetite. But we also plan to keep playing disciplined offense with continuing investments in our growth initiatives.\nThe current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our metal and deliver responsible, sustainable growth. One aspect that we emphasize in today's presentation is our confidence in the quality of our deposit base, but we've been able to transform over time. We've had good deposit stability over the past couple of quarters, as some peers are seeing outflows, and our deposit betas are back in line with the pack.\nWe're seeing very strong loan betas and expect these to remain above deposit betas through 2024, assuming the current forward curve. As a result, our NIM will continue to rise more gradually as time goes on. We've also layered in sizable net interest rate hedges to protect NIM and ROTCE through 2024 if the Fed reverses and brings down short-term rates. Moving off of the 0 bound for short rates has unlocked the value of our deposit franchise and significantly benefited our ROTCE.\nWith a clearer macro outlook and less market volatility and we feel the value of our commercial bank build-out will also manifest benefiting further our ROTCE. So very exciting time for Citizens. And with that, I'll stop and turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John?\n\nJohn F. Woods\n\nVice Chairman & CFO, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone.\nFirst, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing Slide 5. We reported underlying net income of $669 million and EPS of $1.30. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 17.9%. Net interest income was up 11% linked quarter, driven by a 21 basis point improvement in margin to 3.25% and 2% growth in average interest-earning assets. Average loans are up 2% linked quarter, with 3% growth in commercial. Fees were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year and mortgage results softened a bit.\nCapital markets fees and service charges were stable. We remain highly disciplined on expenses, which are up 1% linked quarter. Overall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 6% linked quarter, and our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 54.9%. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $123 million and a reserve build of $49 million this quarter, which reflects an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix.\nOur ACL ratio stands at 1.41%, up from 1.37% at the end of the second quarter and compares with a pro forma day 1 CECL reserve of approximately 1.3%. Our tangible book value per share is down 8.6% linked quarter, driven by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with our CET1 ratio at 9.8%, just above the midpoint of our target range.\nNext, I'll provide further details related to third quarter results. On Slide 6, net interest income was up 11%, given higher net interest margin and 2% growth in interest-earning assets. The net interest margin was 3.25%, up 21 basis points. As you can see on the NIM block in the bottom left-hand side of the slide, the healthy increase in asset yields outpaced funding costs, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet.\nMoving to Slide 7. With the current expectation for the Fed to raise rates further, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out. Our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII year-to-date and those benefits will continue to accumulate into the fourth quarter and compound into 2023. Our overall asset sensitivity increased to approximately 3.3% at the end of the third quarter, up from 2.6% for the second quarter, primarily driven by the impact of variable rate loan originations.\nOur asset sensitivity will allow us to have further upside as the forward curve continues to move up. We expect cumulative loan betas to exceed the positive betas through the rate cycle. Our interest-bearing deposit beta is tracking well within our expectations, and the ultimate outcome will depend upon the pace and level of Fed rate hikes from here.\nSo far in this cycle, with fed funds increasing 225 basis points since 4Q '21, our cumulative interest-bearing deposit beta is well controlled at 18% through the end of the third quarter. On a sequential basis, our deposit beta was 26%. We began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity and funding profile, including significant improvements through our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits.\nWe continue to execute our hedging strategy to managing a more predictable and stable outlook for NII as we benefit from the higher rate environment. You'll find a summary of our hedge position in the appendix on Slide 23. In the third quarter, we did an additional $10 billion of hedges with a focus on extending our protection out through 2024 and beyond, primarily through forward starting swaps.\nWe expect our NIM to rise to 3.5% or better by the end of 2023 and for our overall hedge position to provide a NIM floor of about 3.25% through the fourth quarter of 2024. If we see rates come down by 200 basis points across the forward curve, before it could move higher with further hedge actions.\nMoving on to Slide 8. We posted good fee results despite headwinds from continued market volatility and higher rates. These were fairly stable, down 2% linked quarter as our client hedging business returned to more historical levels following an exceptional first half of the year. Car fees were strong again this quarter, while capital markets and service charges were stable. Focusing on capital markets, market volatility continued to impact the bond and equity markets. M&A advisory fees picked up nicely, but this was offset by lower loan syndication revenue amid increased economic uncertainty and market volatility.\nWe continue to see good strength in our M&A pipeline to continue to build with strong pinch activity and a growing backlog. While current market volatility may constrain the ability for deals to close, capital markets fees should see some seasonal improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in M&A advisory and even more broadly if markets settle down. Mortgage fees were softer as the higher rate environment weighed on production volumes, which more than offset the fact that production margins improved modestly this quarter, but still remain below historical levels.\nWe are seeing signs of the industry reducing capacity, which should benefit margins over time and servicing operating fees were stable. Wealth fees are $5 million lower linked quarter given the impact of lower market levels on AUM. And in other income, we saw a seasonal benefit from our tax advantaged investments and an increase in leasing revenue.\nOn Slide 9, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter. Our TOP 7 efficiency program is continuing to make good progress and is on track to deliver over $115 million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Average loans on Slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter driven by 3% growth in commercial with growth in C&I and CRE, given modestly higher loan utilization and slower paydowns.\nRetail loans increased 1% with growth in mortgage and home equity, offsetting planned runoff in auto. Period-end loans were broadly stable linked quarter given higher-than-usual end-of-quarter C&I line paydown, which were generally redrawn after quarter end.\nOn Slide 11, average deposits were up $1.3 billion or 1% linked quarter, with growth coming from retail term deposits and Citizens Access savings and commercial banking deposits were broadly stable.\nDeposit costs remain well controlled. Our interest-bearing deposit costs were up 38 basis points, which translates to an 18% cumulative beta. We feel good about how we are optimizing deposit costs in this rate environment, and our performance to date is reflective of the investments need to strengthen our deposit franchise since the IPO. Overall, liquidity improved as we reduced our flood advances by $2.3 billion and increased our cash position at quarter end.\nMoving on to Slide 12. We saw good credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were 19 basis points, up 6 basis points linked quarter, but still very low relative to historical levels. Nonperforming loans were broadly stable at 55 basis points of total loans. Given the higher risk of recession, we are watching our loan portfolio very carefully for early signs of stress, in particular, CRE office, leveraged loans and selected nonprofit sectors.\nAt this point, we aren't seeing significant issues emerge. Also, the leading indicators for consumer continue to be stable and favorable to pre-pandemic levels. Personal disposable income has declined from stimulus-driven highs but remains above the pre-pandemic 2019 average.\nSpending for travel and restaurants remain steady and above pre-pandemic levels. while credit card and home equity line utilization are still well below pre-pandemic levels and retail delinquencies continue to remain favorable to historical levels.\nTurning to Slide 13. I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see very good credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. While we aren't seeing stress in the portfolio at this point, we increased our allowance by $49 million to take into account an increased risk of recession, partly offset by improvement in portfolio mix. Our overall coverage ratio stands at 1.41% which is a modest increase from the second quarter.\nIf you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%. However, given the investors acquisition and some shifts in the portfolio mix, we estimate our pro forma day 1 CECL allowance to be approximately 1.3%. The current reserve level contemplates a shallow recession and incorporates the risk of added stress on certain portfolios including those subject to higher risk term inflation, supply chain issues and return to office trends.\nMoving to Slide 14. We maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio increased to 9.8%, which is slightly above the midpoint of our target range. This, combined with our strong earnings outlook puts us in a position to resume share repurchases in the fourth quarter. Tangible book value per share and the tangible common equity ratios were both reduced by the impact of higher long-term rates on AOCI. We have increased our held to maturity portfolio for about 30% of total loans at quarter end, which has helped to mitigate the impact of rising rates.\nOur fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage capital allocation. Shifting gears a bit. On Slides 15 and 16, you'll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and what's on tap for our businesses in the near term.\nSince we closed the investors acquisition in April, we've been executing against a phased approach to the integration. In the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. And since then, we have completed the conversion of mortgage servicing. We also successfully completed the conversion of more than 10,000 investors' wealth clients, representing about $1.6 billion in assets to our platform. We have a lot more to do, but I'm pleased to say that we are on track to complete the deposit and branch conversions in mid-first quarter 2023. We have included a high-level integration timeline in the appendix on Slide 22.\nImportantly, we remain on target to achieve our planned $130 million of run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023 of which approximately 70% will be achieved by the end of 2022. We also continue to expect that the integration costs will come in below our initial estimates. In the last 3 years, we have launched a collection of new banking products and features that make it easier to bank with us. Last week, we announced the next step in that evolution with CitizensPlus, which provides financial rewards, banking features and tailored advice that grows with customers from everyday banking to personalized wealth management.\nThis includes Citizens Private Client our new expanded wealth management offering, which will launch by the end of the year. We are fully committed to driving momentum in our wealth business. And as part of the launch, we are hiring more than 200 new financial advisors and relationship managers. We continue to make meaningful strides forward with our national digital strategy and tech modernization. Earlier this year, we migrated Citizens Access to a fully cloud native platform, and we launched a national storefront adding mortgage and education refis to the portal. Over the next year or so, we plan to expand our national storefront, adding card and checking first and then Wealth and Citizens Day. As we add products to the platform, we have an exciting opportunity to build relationships across a growing national customer base.\nOur vision is to migrate our core branch deposits to this modern platform over time, which will be a key change in efficiency and flexibility in terms of implementing upgrades and enhancements. We are also growing our innovative citizen pay offering, which is currently at about 160 merchant partners and expanding across targeted verticals.\nOver the next year, we are working to launch a new mobile app and a unique customer direct experience.\nMoving to the commercial business on Slide 16. Over the past 8 years, we've invested heavily in talent and product capabilities in M&A, corporate finance, bond and equity underwriting, FX and commodities and so on.\nDespite the challenging environment, we remain near the top of the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor book runner and helping corporates and private equity sponsors access capital through the public markets. We have also integrated our cash management and global market solutions as well with our coverage. We are excited about the potential synergies from our recent acquisitions as we target growth in key verticals the JMP acquisition gets us much deeper into the growing healthcare, technology and financial services sectors, expands our equity underwriting and adds research capabilities and DH Capital expands our capabilities in the Internet infrastructure, communication sectors, software and next-generation IT services. These businesses are exceptionally well positioned for when markets reopen.\nMoving to Slide 17, I'll walk through the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect NII to be up roughly 3%, driven by the benefit of higher rates with a margin rising to the 3.3% to 3.35% range. Average loans are expected to be stable to up modestly as commercial growth is partially offset by order rundown. These are expected to be stable to up modestly. Noninterest expense is expected to be stable. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 to 22 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land near the upper end of our target range of 9.5% to 10%.\nAnd our tax rate should come in at approximately 22%. With respect to the full year, we continue to track well and expect to beat our full year 2022 guidance across key P&L categories and performance measures. We expect to deliver positive operating leverage for full year 2022 in excess of 5%, with fourth quarter sequential positive operating leverage of about 3%. We also expect to deliver a full year efficiency ratio of about 57% with the fourth quarter coming in under 54%. And we expect to deliver a full year ROTCE in excess of 16% with the fourth quarter well above both Q3 and our medium-term target range of 14% to 16%.\nTo sum up, on Slide 18, we delivered a strong quarter amid a dynamic environment, and we are optimistic about the outlook for the fourth quarter and into 2023. We expect to continue to see significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment. Our diverse fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business, in particular, is well positioned for when markets stabilize. And our commitment to operating efficiency remains a hallmark. We are well prepared for a slowdown in the environment with a strong capital, liquidity and funding position, and we are being prudent with respect to our credit risk appetite and loan growth.\nAt the same time, we are playing some offense executing well on strategic initiatives in each of our businesses that will deliver medium-term growth and outperformance. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Winfield Van Saun\n\nCEO & Chairman of the Board, Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, John. Alan, why don't we open it up for some Q&A.",

With that, I will hand over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Kristin, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. There was a lot going on in Q2 with a focus on closing the Investors acquisition and commencing our New York City Metro integration efforts. In addition, the Fed's move to rein in inflation through higher short rates and quantitative tightening put a spotlight on adroit management of our capital, liquidity, and funding position, as well as our interest rate management. The good news is that we made strong progress on all fronts while posting very good financial results. Our underlying EPS for the quarter was $1.14. That's up 7% from the first quarter, and ROTCE was 15.5%.\nPositive sequential operating leverage was 11.7% on an underlying basis, and that's 6.3% excluding the impact of acquisitions. Our PPNR growth was 45%. Driving these strong results was a significant sequential jump in net interest income of 31%. That's 9% ex-acquisitions. Spot loan growth reached 19%, which is 4% ex-acquisitions, and our net interest margin jumped 29 basis points. We are seeing a strong pickup in line utilization in commercial, which has afforded us the opportunity to be more selective in lower-returning consumer portfolios like mortgage and auto. Our deposit performance was good, as period-end deposits ex-acquisitions were up 1%.\nOur fees were relatively resilient, up 2% ex-acquisitions, given the diversity of our fee revenue streams. Higher volatility kept capital markets in check, though it benefited FX and derivative product revenue, which hit an all-time high. Wealth continued to grow nicely in the quarter, while mortgage revenue was up slightly. We did our usual fine job on expenses, and credit performance continues to be excellent. We continue to see favorable trends in key credit metrics on both the commercial and consumer side. At this point, we feel the second half should hold up well, with only gradual normalization in loss rates given the solid positioning of our customers today.\nWe currently expect our solid momentum to continue into the second half of 2022. We will continue to benefit from rate rises, our fees should remain resilient, and we will benefit on expenses from our acquisition synergies and the top seven program. We project positive operating leverage in Q3 and Q4, with ROTCE moving beyond our 14% to 16% target range. The market seems concerned about the rising possibility of a recession in 2023, and the potential for much higher credit costs. At this point, we see slower economic growth as the base assumption for 2023, and if there is a recession, we believe it should be shallow and short-lived.\nWe are being highly selective on new loan originations, and we've moved several portfolios to held for sale, largely from investors, to optimize our balance sheet position. We continue to believe our credit performance will be good on a relative basis should a downturn come. It's an exciting time for Citizens. We have many promising initiatives in flight that we are managing well. We are focusing on areas where we can leverage our strengths, and where we have a right to win.\nThe current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our mettle and deliver prudent, sustainable growth. We certainly feel up to the challenge. With that, let me turn it over to John to cover the financials in more detail. John?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter, referencing slides four and five. We reported underlying net income of $595 million and EPS of $1.14. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 15.5%. Net interest income was up 31% linked quarter, driven by a 29 basis point improvement in margin, and strong loan growth, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions. Period-end loans were up 19% linked quarter. Excluding loans added by the HSBC and ISBC transactions, loan growth was a strong 4%, led by commercial growth of 6%.\nAverage loans were up 19% linked quarter. Excluding acquisitions, average loans were up 3%, with 5% growth in commercial. Underlying fees were up 5% linked quarter, or 2% excluding HSBC and ISBC acquisition impacts, reflecting the diversity and resiliency of our fee businesses. Our client hedging business had another exceptional quarter, and we delivered record results in wealth and card. Mortgage fees were up slightly, and capital markets fees were down a bit given continued market volatility. We remained disciplined on expenses, which were up 1% linked quarter, excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions.\nOverall, we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of 11.7% linked quarter, and that was 6.3% excluding the HSBC and ISBC transactions. Our underlying efficiency ratio improved to 58%. We recorded an underlying provision for credit losses excluding ISBC of $71 million, which reflects continued strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. The underlying credit provision for the quarter excludes $145 million for the double count of CECL provision expense tied to the ISBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.37%, down from 1.43% at the end of the first quarter.\nOur tangible book value per share was down 6% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates on securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI. We continue to have very strong capital positions, with CET1 at 9.6%, and we have increased our common dividend by 8% to $0.42 a share. On slide five, we have provided the HSBC and ISBC contributions to our second quarter results, as well as the notable items for the quarter. Also, slide 21 in the appendix provides a summary of the purchase accounting impacts associated with the ISBC transaction. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for our second quarter results.\nOn slide six, net interest income was up 31% given higher net interest margin and 17% growth in interest-earning assets, including the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions. The net interest margin is 3.04%, up 29 basis points, which, as you can see on the NIM walk in the bottom left-hand side of the slide, shows the benefit of higher rates with a 24 basis point increase related to asset yield, reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and improved securities reinvestment rates. There is an 11 basis point benefit from the HSBC and ISBC transactions, largely given the repositioning of the ISBC securities portfolio and the benefit of adding their loans.\nWith rising rates, funding costs reduced the margin 8 basis points, reflecting well-controlled deposit costs. Earning asset yields are up 38 basis points linked quarter, strongly outpacing our interest-earning deposit costs, which are up only 8 basis points. Moving to slide seven. Given the Fed's recent rate hikes and the current market expectation for the Fed funds rate to end the year in the 350 to 375 basis points range, we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out.\nOur asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in NII in the first half of this year, and those benefits will continue to accumulate in the second half of 2022 and compound into 2023. Since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the top left side of this page, we've provided an estimate of our NII sensitivity to further changes in rates, either up or down from the 24 June forward curve. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at about 2.5% at the end of the second quarter.\nThis is down from 7% for the first quarter, reflecting the incorporation of ISBC's NII-based and liability-sensitive profile, as well as hedging actions taken to stabilize the margin and protect against downside interest rate risks. Our improved NII outlook, as well as changes in the balance sheet, also contribute to the reduction in asset sensitivity. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $10 to $15 million a quarter, with that balance between the long and short parts of the curve.\nWe began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity profile, deposit costs as low as they have ever been, and our overall funding profile greatly improved, including significant improvements to our deposit mix and capabilities. We will continue to optimize our deposit base, and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits.Far this cycle, with Fed funds increasing 150 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, we are quite pleased with how our deposit franchise is performing, with a cumulative beta of about 6%. On a sequential basis for the second quarter, our beta was 11%.\nThis puts us on track for a 35% cumulative beta through the end of this rate cycle if the forward curve plays out as expected. Moving on to slide eight, we posted solid results demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee businesses. Capital markets delivered solid results despite continued market volatility impacting the bond and equity markets. We saw M&A advisory and equity underwriting fees picking up a bit, but these were more than offset by modestly lower loan syndication revenue.\nWe continue to see good strength in our pipelines, and capital markets fees could rebound nicely in the second half of the year if markets settle down and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy. We once again delivered a record performance in our client hedging business, up $9 million linked quarter, driven primarily by FX, as we helped clients manage their currency exposures as the dollar strengthened during the quarter. Our interest rate and commodities businesses also performed very well, but were down modestly from record levels in the first quarter.\nMortgage fees were up modestly linked quarter, given improved servicing income as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Production fees remained under pressure given lower industry origination volume, with rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition continues to pressure margins. However, there are clear signs that the industry is beginning to reduce capacity, which should benefit margins as we head into the second half of the year. We delivered record wealth fees, up 8% linked quarter, as rising market interest rates supported customer flows into annuity products.\nCard fees were also a record, given seasonally higher transaction volumes. On slide nine, expenses were well controlled, up 1% linked quarter, excluding HSBC and ISBC. Our top seven efficiency program is continuing to make good progress, on track to deliver $100 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Period-end loans on slide 10 were up 19% linked quarter, primarily driven by the impact of the ISBC transaction, which closed at the beginning of the quarter.\nExcluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions, loan growth was 4%, with strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 6%, led by C&I as we emphasize strong relationships to optimize risk-adjusted returns. Retail loans were up 1% as we continue to be more selective in consumer lending. Average loans were up 19% linked quarter, or 3% excluding the impact of the HSBC and ISBC transactions, with 5% growth in commercial led by C&I, and 1% growth in retail. In commercial, we continue to see strength in corporate banking originations across every region.\nLine utilization continued to rebound, with an increase of about 300 basis points to 39% on a spot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking, with the largest quarterly increase in utilization we have seen since early in the pandemic. Our clients are continuing to use their lines to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices, and some are also looking to pro-rata bank financing as an alternative to the volatile bond markets. Concurring with the ISBC acquisition, we identified certain non-strategic loan portfolios totaling $2.1 billion, which we are in the process of being marketed for sale. These loans were classified as held for sale at quarter end.\nThis will free up capital and enable our relationship bankers to focus on more desirable commercial relationship business in New York City Metro. On slide 11, our period-end deposits were up 13% linked quarter as we added $19.8 billion of deposits from the ISBC transaction. Excluding ISBC and HSBC, period-end deposits were up slightly, while average deposits were down slightly, reflecting seasonal runoff and a decline in commercial search deposits. Moving on to slide 12, we saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were at 13 basis points, down 6 basis points linked quarter.\nNon-performing loans fell 6 basis points to 54 basis points of total loans linked quarter, driven by improvements in C&I, residential real estate, and home equity. Other credit metrics continued to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios, and criticized loans as a percentage of the commercial portfolio are stable after incorporating ISBC, but down on a standalone basis. On slide 13, I'll walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter. We continue to see excellent credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. We added to the reserve this quarter to take into account strong commercial loan growth, as well as the addition of ISBC.\nWhile we aren't seeing any signs of early stress in the portfolio at this point, our allowance takes into account the expectation of a more challenging macroeconomic outlook given the Fed's rate actions to combat inflation. Our overall coverage ratio is 1.37%, which is a modest decline from the first quarter, reflecting the strong performance of our retail portfolio and the addition of the ISBC CRE portfolio, which includes a sizable multifamily component with lower reserve requirements than our legacy portfolios. If you recall, when we adopted CECL at the beginning of 2020, our coverage ratio was 1.47%.\nTo put our current coverage ratio in context, we estimate our pro forma coverage ratio would be slightly lower than the 1.37% level today if we applied our current portfolio mix, incorporating ISBC to our day-one CECL approach. Importantly, our coverage of non-accrual loans strengthened to 256%, up from 238% in the first quarter. We feel good about the improvements to the loan portfolio we've made over the past few years, and the overall positioning of our credit risk. Moving to slide 14, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.6%.\nFollowing the release of the Fed's deepest stress results last month, our board increased our common share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. Today, we announced an 8% increase in our common dividend to $0.42 a share. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company. Shifting gears a bit, on slide 15, you'll see some examples of progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work.\nAs you know, we closed the acquisition of ISBC at the beginning of April, and we are very focused on a successful integration. I am proud of the work our teams have done related to the acquisition. We onboarded more than 1,600 new colleagues through our HR systems on day one, and in the second quarter, we began originating mortgages on our systems. We have a number of conversions planned over the remainder of the year, and we are on track to finish in the first quarter of 2023. We have included a high-level integration timeline in the appendix on slide 22.\nImportantly, we are on target to achieve the $130 million in run rate net expense synergies by the end of 2023, of which approximately 70% will be achieved by year-end 2022. The total represents about 30% of ISBC's 2021 expense base. Also, ISBC integration costs to be incurred through 2023 are now expected to come in below the estimated level at deal announcement. We recently released our fifth annual corporate responsibility report, which highlights our progress on ESG initiatives. The report highlights a number of significant milestones related to our sustainability efforts, including our progress towards targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\nWe also announced that we've joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials, which will accelerate our efforts to measure and disclose financed emissions. Later this year, we'll release our first TCFD climate report, which will describe our climate strategy in more detail. The report also describes our commitment to the communities we serve, and there are a few recent examples here on the slide with some of the community partnerships we are engaged with in Boston, and most recently in Chinatown and Queens, New York. On the consumer side, we are excited about continuing our expansion in Florida with the opening of our latest wealth center in Naples.\nWe recently released a mobile app version of Citizens Access, which we think will be very popular with our customers. We are very proud that our Citizens Pay point-of-sale offering was awarded Best Innovation by the Banking Tech Awards. Lastly, our relentless focus on customer service is driving results, as our ATM channel moved up eight places in the J.D. Power rankings. On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor bookrunner. The diversification in our business model is delivering results, with record revenue in our client FX hedging business.\nWe also closed the DH Capital acquisition this quarter, strengthening our capabilities in the internet infrastructure, software, and next-generation IT services and communications sectors. On the right side of the page, we've included some digital metrics. Mobile active users are up over 20% year-over-year. Digital deposits and Zelle transactions are up over 30%, and we are seeing great success with the customer uptake of automated client service through virtual chat sessions. We are very excited with our digital-first approaches, increasing engagement with our customers, and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction.\nMoving to slide 16, I'll walk through the outlook for the third quarter. Since we closed ISBC at the beginning of the second quarter, our third quarter outlook includes all our recent acquisitions. We expect NII to be up 5.5% to 7%, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. We are very focused on optimizing capital deployment. In consumer, we will reduce originations in mortgage, auto, and education refi, while seeking to grow in home equity, in-school education, and Citizens Pay and card. In commercial, we expect to see further increases in line utilization, but we'll be mindful of balancing growth and returns given current macro uncertainty.\nThese are expected to be broadly stable, though upside exists if capital markets stabilize. Non-interest expense is expected to be up approximately 1%.We expect to continue strong sequential positive operating leverage in the third quarter and ROTCE above our medium target range of 14% to 16%. Net charge-offs are expected to be approximately 20 basis points. We expect our CET1 ratio to land around the midpoint of our operating range at 9.75%, and our tax rate should come in a bit lower at approximately 22%. With respect to full year results, we expect PPNR to be in line with our April guidance.\nFrom a revenue standpoint, we are seeing higher NII given net interest margin reaching approximately 3.25% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher rates and loan growth within our 20% to 22% guidance range. This will be offset by lower fee revenue, largely in capital markets and mortgage. Expenses will be well controlled, which will result in full year operating leverage of at least 400 basis points and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio of sub 55%. We also expect the net charge-off ratio to come in lower than we guided in April, given continued favorable trends. To sum up, on slide 17, this was a very solid quarter, and we are optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond.\nWe are off to a running start in New York with the close of our two acquisitions there, and we expect significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment and strong commercial loan growth. The strength and diversity of our fee business is driving solid results, and our capital markets business in particular is well positioned for when markets stabilize, given strong pipelines. We will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities and building a top-performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1, then 0 on your touch-tone phone. You'll hear an indication you've been placed into queue, and you may remove yourself from queue by repeating the 1, then 0 command. If you're using a speakerphone, we ask you to please pick up your handset and make certain your phone is unmuted before pressing any buttons. Your first question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Go ahead, please.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGood morning. Hi there. Good morning. Just on the loan front, I guess it's also a credit question. I know you indicated that you're being more selective in select areas of consumer lending. Can you maybe give some color there in terms of what areas are you becoming more selective, what you're seeing that's making you become more selective, or is it just actually the broader backdrop and what that can mean for growth in the consumer portfolios? Thanks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, well, let me start, then I'll go to Brendan, and John, I'm sure you might want to chime in. I think we have the potential to continue to grow in consumer maybe at a faster pace than would be ideal in the current environment. We're seeing a lot of growth right now on the commercial side, line utilization picking up. I think in light of the environment that we're seeing out there and transitioning in the investor's balance sheet, just making sure we're focusing on allocation of capital to the highest and best uses and not putting a strain on deposit growth as we're going through this higher rate environment is the game plan at this point.\nWhen we look into the consumer world, clearly mortgages and auto are areas where we've seen a lot of growth over the past couple of years. We're going to basically put mortgage more on a stable path and start to reduce our originations in auto. Those are really return calls. It's a return on capital call where we think we have opportunities to grow in areas that deliver better returns would be things like HELOC, like the in-school student, and then also card, and Citizens Pay. I think overall we'll still see some net modest growth, but we're going to take some pluses and some minuses here and really be focused on capital allocation. With that, Brendan, you want to add to that?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I guess just strategically what I'd add is I think this is a natural pivot point for the journey of our strategy. At the early stages of our IPO, everything was accretive for the most part, and we've really scaled up our business. I believe we have one of the most well-run and diversified consumer lending franchises amongst our peer set, for sure. If we enter this next phase of our journey, capital allocation is king, and we're making some strategic pivots. I also say this is not necessarily brand new news.\nIf you recall, prior to COVID, we had already started signaling we were going to start to put auto, as an example, on a path to reduce and get back into tier levels for concentration. Through COVID, we found some great vintages of returns in market disruption. The benefit of the diversity of our business model allowed us to flex up through COVID, and now we're sort of returning to our original glide path down of auto, given that the auto business is naturally in sort of steady state of lower return and less relationship focus. To Bruce's point on mortgage, we've been outgrowing the Citizens balance sheet on mortgage growth for quite some time.\nWe would like for that to grow no faster than the rate of the bank, just given where we're at right now in interest rates and the long-duration nature of that business. Really making sure we're protecting our balance sheet for long duration for real relationship-focused lending and customers is key. The other place we're curtailing a bit is some fintech partnerships that we've had over the years that served us well and added operating leverage, allowed us to invest back in the bank, but being much more relationship-focused in our capital allocation is king. We're very excited, as Bruce pointed out, about a couple of places of our franchise, HELOC being one where we believe we're the number one originator in the US for HELOC originations. Credit quality is extremely good.\nIt's super prime as it gets, 780 FICOs, six-year-less CLTVs, and we're poised to capitalize on that. The in-school student product, as Bruce pointed out, is coming back strong as the effects of COVID wear off a little bit on student enrollment, and then Citizens Pay. We do have aspirations for medium-term growth in that product. I think we're well positioned. We can flex up. We're not taking down muscle mass, just making some capital allocation decisions as we optimize the balance sheet. I think we said a lot. John, anything to add?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, I think we're good.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nAll right, thank you for that. Just separately on credit again, I know you had indicated in your outlook that you do expect some economic slowing as you look into the rest of this year and into 2023, but also that your reserve does consider a degree of that. How do you think about what you could potentially see to begin to build the reserve more meaningfully here? If that does take hold, where do you think the reserve could traject over time? What do you think is a fair level given your economic outlook?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'll kick off and hand it quickly to John. One of the things we pointed out was that we're about where the day one reserve would have been had we incorporated Investors into those numbers. This 137 ratio, it's down from 147, but if you look at the shift in some of the asset composition, we're about at day one. We have incorporated a Moody's scenario that does have a GDP slowdown and a higher recession risk into that scenario. I would say absent meaningful change in outlook, we could probably hang around this neighborhood for a while. That would be my top-of-the-house view, but John, for more details, please.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, sure. I think that that's right. I think that our base scenario this quarter really relies predominantly on a mild recession, which would last into next year. I think we're covering that part of it. We've even layered in, in certain aspects of the portfolio, more severe recessions. That's also built into where we are. To Bruce's point, the mix shift in our portfolio has been extremely positive over the last couple of years.\nWhen you fast forward from the first quarter of 2020 to the beginning of 2020 to here in the second quarter of 2022, our mix profile is just much better. You can almost think about the fact that we're sort of back to the beginning where we have some uncertainty and some negative scenarios priced in. Without a significant deterioration in the macro, as Bruce indicated, we're likely to be in this range as you get into the end of the year.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think it makes sense if you just step back and think about the consumer's in really good shape, still has a lot of liquidity. Companies have refashioned their business models coming out of COVID. They're all in pretty good shape, contending with inflation and supply chain, and trying to maintain their margins. Historically, if you have a good jump-off point, you go through a shallow recession, bank charge-off rates do not go up all that much. I think you'd have to see a meaningful change in outlook for us to come off that view.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. All right, thanks, Bruce. Thanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Go ahead, please.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just some additional thoughts on how you see deposit cost pressures playing out. I think we can get a pretty good sense from slide seven how you see the full year sort of trajecting, and was glad to see you reiterate the 35% through-the-cycle beta expectation. As we look through the remainder of the year, where specifically do you see the pressures that get you to the 25% to 30% by year-end? Maybe if you can flush out your thinking on deposit cost dynamics once the Fed stops raising rates.\nYeah, I'll take that. I think the best way to describe that, I mean, we articulated that our cumulative beta is 6% through the second quarter, better than we expected. Feeling good about where we're starting off this rate cycle. Our outlook indicates a deposit beta getting into the 25% to 30% range by the end of the year, which implies the sequential betas in the second half in quarters being around mid-30s. That's how that math would play out. That's how that trajectory would work.\nThe drivers of that are predominantly on the commercial side of the business, but as expected, consumer and retail deposits are incredibly well-performing and well-behaved in terms of deposit betas, and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year. We have a little bit of room on the balance sheet for Citizens Access, and all of that has been incorporated into our outlook for the 25% to 30% by the end of the year, and for the approximate 35% through the whole cycle.\nDeposit betas will continue to rise as you get into 2023, and that's the difference between the approximate 35% and the 25% to 30% that we're talking about. They tend to continue to rise when the Fed stops, assuming that the Fed doesn't start easing immediately thereafter, right? The last cycle we had the Fed end of the cycle, the very next quarter, we were easing. That sort of clipped off the lag effect that you would typically see in deposits. If the Fed stops and stands pat, you would see deposit costs continue to rise for another quarter or two after the last Fed hike.\nI should hasten to add that there's the loan beta side of this equation, and the loan beta side of it is loan betas basically are rising, and they will continue to rise into the Fed tightening cycle and even after the Fed stops. In particular, all the tailwind from some of the term fixed lending that often really gains steam when you get to the end of the Fed tightening cycle, that's really what continues to drive that interest margin rising, which we would say would continue to rise throughout 2023, even as the Fed continues to rise, given the fact that loan betas would exceed deposit betas.\nOkay, perfect. That's great color. I guess along those lines of sort of more all-encompassing rate sensitivity, you're a little less asset sensitive now with ISBC in there and a couple of moving parts with the hedging. How would you say your overall rate sensitivity changes from here, or is this sort of kind of a good steady state for where we're at now?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, let me jump in. It's Bruce, and I'll give it back to John. I think what we've tried to do, Scott, is find that sweet spot where we still have asset sensitivity sufficient to participate if the Fed has to keep going beyond what's expected. We like this level of NIM and this level of NII. If, in fact, a recession is in the offing and then rates turn down, we've locked in a fair amount of that NII for a good period of time. Just trying to get that balance right where we take away the downside and allow ourselves to continue to participate in the upside is where we tried to land it over the quarter. John?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I agree with that. I guess the point is that without management actions, as you think about how the balance sheet unfolds from here, a big decline in the quarter really was just pulling in ISBC. Just the base NII alone reduces your asset sensitivity. You just have a bigger base from that percentage to be calculated. That was the source of the decline primarily, and our management's action. If you take away management's actions looking forward, actually our asset sensitivity would tend to begin to rise again.\nAs mentioned earlier, the rotation out of consumer lending into a lot of the commercial lending, and even within consumer lending, the fact that HELOC is a big driver, which is a floating-rate product, you really are reestablishing asset sensitivity as the balance sheet unfolds in the coming quarters. All of that is absent management's actions, right? That's really going to tell the tale about where we land things.\nIf we get towards the end of the year, and if inflation still remains stubbornly high, that'll tell us where we take the balance sheet under that scenario. If it feels like June was peak inflation, as you get to the end of the year, you would see us wanting to lock in a little bit more. We'll just see how it plays out. Naturally, underpinning the balance sheet is some upward lift on asset sensitivity.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. All right, perfect. Bruce and John, thank you guys very much.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Go ahead.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nGood morning. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's question regarding the deposits. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about deposit growth in the second half of this year versus the second quarter?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I think you've got a big driver being commercial, right? There are two drivers there. One is the fact that there was some surge in the commercial business that has been running off. Frankly, most of that's been run off by the end of June. It's down to a relatively smaller level now, and that was a driver. Also, a driver is the natural seasonality of our deposit flows, which tends to have Q2 as one of the lower points during the year. When you think about through the rest of the year, there'll be the broad continuing to execute against all the investments we've made over multiple years in driving consumer deposits, and also the natural uplift, and frankly, driving commercial as well.\nThe natural uplift that the second half tends to deliver in the commercial side of the business from a seasonality standpoint and lower drag from surge runoff is how we see the second half playing out.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nHow much is in?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, just to make that clear, the net would be we'd be expecting to resume growth in the second half. I think that would be led by commercial growth, but consumer also would expect to see some growth as well.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nGot it. You gave some color on the moving parts on loans in the third quarter going to be led by commercial, but I'm just wondering if you could just be a little bit more specific on the type of growth rates you're expecting on commercial versus consumer and maybe line utilization in the third quarter.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Well, I mean, I think in the second quarter, just talking about the jump-off here may be helpful because in the second quarter, we had on the commercial side of the house, we had 5% average growth, but on a spot basis, we had 6% growth. You can see that what that implies is that you're likely to see commercial be a big driver in the second quarter.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYou see the third quarter.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'm sorry, in the third quarter. Sorry. Yeah. You see commercial being a big driver into the third quarter. I think you're going to see puts and takes in consumer where you see home equity and some of the other categories that we like to see drive things in card, and a little bit of mortgage driving it, maybe being offset by auto and student a little bit.\nThat's how I would articulate it. Utilization continues to increase, but it's been about 50/50 utilization and other commercial growth. I suspect that'll be the color into Q3 as well, utilization driving about half of it and the other half coming from outside of utilization. Again, I'd say Q3 driven primarily by commercial loans, maybe a similar amount of loan growth percentage that you saw in Q2.\nOne thing about commercial, and maybe I could ask Don to comment on this, is that when you kind of look at how companies are able to access new financing, right now the public markets are pretty still in the water. You've seen kind of more opportunities for the institutional market as well. The bank syndicated lending market has seen an uptick, which I think is likely to continue as we look out into the second half. Don, maybe you want to give some color on that.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think that's right. Just to put a point on what John said, we've got utilization up by about another 200 basis points across the C&I books and the global markets books in the third quarter. That gives us a couple of billion dollars in potential outstandings. To Bruce's point, we're really starting to see the acceleration of a trend of companies that might want to refinance in the bond market coming to the bank market instead because the access on bank balance sheets is so much more attractive.\nWe're also seeing some transitory financing for M&A transactions and for maybe some buyouts coming more onto the bank balance sheets as opposed to some of the non-bank lenders. I don't know what the exact mix will be, but there's a lot of things that are beginning to materialize. It's not going to all go up because of that. We're going to take some other portfolios down and slow down some other things, similar to what Brendan said, which we've been doing for two or three years now just to change the mix of what's on the books. Get a little more selective in terms of both returns of the capital we're deploying, but also being very careful of credit risk and the like, just in case we go into a little bit deeper slide. We're just being protective of the risk fund also.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. One other thing, maybe just to close out there a little bit, is to broaden it out to the second half. I think we mentioned that there's a lot of moving parts here. We tried to really make it clear that our April guide had a 20% to 22% range of loan growth associated with it for the year. All of these moving parts are going to fall into that range of a 20% to 22% loan growth increase in 2022. Hopefully that's helpful. How it shakes out between Q3 and Q4, there's a lot going on there, but we're expecting to deliver as we indicated we would at our last guide.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nGot it. Thanks for all the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will be from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, Bruce. Good morning, John. Morning.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nHey, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nBruce, you guys have done a good job on credit, and you've identified the outlook as being healthy, strong through possibly the end of the year, but a little more cautious as we go into next year, which is completely understandable. Can you share with us what you guys are thinking about, not so much the traditional credit areas like consumer lending, home equity, or student loans, but more from an institutional market?\nIf the Fed pursues this quantitative tightening, which they claim they will, $95 billion a month, what kind of disruption are you guys kind of looking at possibly that could happen separate from the traditional unemployment rates going up and all that stuff? I think most of us can understand that. The new part is this quantitative tightening that we really haven't experienced. How are you guys kind of thinking about that going forward?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell, we're a bit in unchartered waters because we haven't seen quantitative easing to the extent we have. Now the amount of tightening that they're planning is going to be interesting to watch. I mean, if I step back and think about where did a lot of that additional liquidity end up, I think the biggest banks took on a lot of it, the custody banks took on a lot of it.\nI think when we view our space, the super regional space, maybe we had some benefit from it, but a lot of it was just working on our playbook to deliver better for customers and establish whole relationships where we can capture the deposit opportunities that we were probably suboptimized on, both on the consumer side and the commercial side. I think the tightening process, you'd probably see it most impact the folks where the liquidity ended up, which would, in my view, be the bigger banks and the custody banks.\nA bank like us, we still have a number of initiatives where I think we're not fully optimized in terms of the deposits per our relationship base. We're going to continue to go try to gain market share and grab that.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. Can you think about it also from the loan side? Do you think that the QT could have some type of impact? Obviously, it's going to take liquidity out of the market, but I don't know how you guys think about it in terms of maybe some of the syndicated business that you've been doing quite successfully in the past.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I guess I don't necessarily think that'll be a huge driver in the loan volumes. I think the level of GDP growth, and that spurs activity in the animal spirits and people wanting to put money to work, I think that's a bigger driver. Maybe on that, I'll defer over to Don. If Don, you have any thoughts.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I'm not too sure. I'm not too worried about the loan syndication piece. Again, volumes are much lower than they were. I think it'll be where the action is. The mega deals seem to be struggling a little bit. If you think about the environment we're in, the biggest challenge we have on transactional execution is larger transaction and them clearing through the marketplace. I think you'll see a little bit of a dearth there. That's not really the business we're in.\nI don't think it will affect our business. The other thing is you think about what's the price action that goes on in the securities market as the Fed is a seller versus a buyer. I think one of the things that I'm looking at is the maturity ladder for corporate bonds, particularly high-yield bonds, is relatively light for the next couple of years because everybody took advantage of the low-interest rate environment of the last couple of years and refinanced and pushed those maturities out. I think we have some time for the market to adjust, and particularly the public market to adjust to the QT trend that we're going to see.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. As a follow-up question, you guys put aside $2.1 billion, I think, of loans from investors holding it for sale. Can you kind of give us a description of what types of loans? You also indicated that your criticized loans on a standalone basis went down, which is good, of course, but they were stable when you included the investors' criticized loans. Are any of the criticized loans for investors in the $2.1 billion held for sale?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. The biggest driver of that book is an equipment finance book, which is about half of it. There are some non-accruals and non-pass assets that did go into that portfolio. More importantly, we think our underlying fundamentals with respect to the criticized being stable was a very good outcome. You've got some criticized coming out of ISBC with not a lot of loss content, and that's just a mechanism of migrating from a state chartered approach to how you manage that kind of stuff to an OCC-managed approach.\nThat was the impact there. Loss content quite low. On an ACL basis, pound for pound, the needs from an ACL perspective are actually lower on the ISBC side of things given that profile that came over. We're feeling pretty good about that.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you, fellas. Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Go ahead.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, UBS",
    "content2": "Hi. Good morning. Just taking a step back, you guys have done a great job giving us exquisite detail in terms of what you're expecting underneath that NII outlook. I'm just wondering if we could talk about it more strategically given how much the bank has changed since the last interest rate cycle. Bruce, in the last interest rate cycle, you took advantage of putting forth great offers through Citizens Access.\nI'm wondering, as you think about the composition of your balance sheet now, especially after Investors, how should investors think about this go-forward Citizens deposit gathering strategy? How aggressive are you going to be in terms of competing in rate? Is there room to lower some rates in the acquired portfolio from Investors on the deposit side that would allow you to be maybe slightly more aggressive on the rate side on the Citizens Access front?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Let me start, then I'll pass the baton here to maybe Brendan and John. I'd say we feel really good about the progress we've made in just reformulating the deposit base, both in consumer and in commercial. In consumer, taking a much more relationship orientation and not having that kind of thrift-like lead with rate orientation that we kind of inherited when we got here.\nYou can just see the results of that in terms of the non-interest-bearing growth, the affluent household growth, the stickiness of the deposits, and the size per household going up. All those trends are terrific, and I think they continue. That's a cornerstone of the deposit strategy going forward. I think we have been pretty astute in setting up Citizens Access and giving ourselves a kind of narrow swim lane to go after interest-sensitive deposits and compete for those. I don't think that that's ever going to really become outsized relative to the overall mix. I think it's good to have, and when we need incremental deposits, we can play with the rate.\nWe can bring them in, but it serves its purpose. Ultimately, if we get the national bank to where we want to get it, maybe some of those deposits will be a little rate-sensitive as we try to get full wallet relationships with some of the national customer base. On commercial, again, I think we weren't as aggressive in seeking the operating accounts as we've been over the last few years, and certainly seen a lot of growth there. We didn't have the full range of capabilities, things like escrow services and other services that different segments of the customer base need. We weren't competitive. They weren't built out.\nWe've now built those out, and I think our hold speed and deposit growth going forward can continue to be reasonably strong. Hopefully, we'd like to get it growing faster than kind of the peers, which would give us a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of loan growth that we can fund while maintaining an LDR in kind of the mid to upper 80s. That's a little bit top of the house thought process around that. Brendan, maybe you can add something on the consumer side.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I mean, on the consumer side, I'd say the last upcycle for rates was a bit of a perfect storm for us for higher betas. We had a business model, as Bruce pointed out, that was more thrift-oriented, had higher promotional balances. We were growing loans materially faster than peers, so we had to fund up the loan growth on a base that was a little bit less healthy than peers.\nWe hadn't fully built out all of our capabilities in the bank. As I stare at consumer right now, I look at all of those dynamics. The underpinning health of the portfolio has remixed materially to low-cost deposits, and that's based on just increased primacy and engagement with customers. That's long-term value creation, and that continues to improve quarter over quarter, quarter over quarter. That's allowed us to bring our elastic deposits down. Last upcycle, we had something like $17 to 18 billion in promotionally priced elastic deposits.\nThat's now in the mid-single digits in the core bank, putting aside Citizens Access. The portfolio is mixed from the mid-40% on low cost to into the 60%. That's a big buffer for better beta performance. We still believe the consumer segment will have a 25% to 30% net improvement rate cycle over rate cycle in betas. The other things we've done is we've built a lot of tools and capabilities. Citizens Access is now something we're very good at. That's not it. We built a dramatically different product composition in the core bank. We built highly sophisticated analytic capabilities with better targeting.\nWe do think we can go and very targeted raise deposits in the core bank, but with much more precision than we did in the past, which will really mute the beta impact in consumer and allow us where we need to get deposit growth. We can contain it in Citizens Access. Last point I would make is inside of Citizens Access, we are starting to see some green shoots of deeper relationships beginning to form.\nIt's not just this contained deposit raising mechanism on the side. That's going to benefit both betas, but also cost. We're doing some tests to drive Citizens Access deposit raising across our national mortgage customers and our national student loan customers. Early results have been quite positive as we start to raise rates. That's going to make it much more affordable for us to drive those deposits on the expense side, not just the beta side. A lot of improvements in the health of the franchise. I would suggest the consumer bank is in a dramatically different position right now than we were five, seven years ago.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nGreat answer, Brendan. Don, do you want to add anything?\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I'd say similar to Brendan. I mean, we basically did not have a liquidity and deposit group seven years ago when we started our journey here. Our payments business was fundamentally subscale and subpar. We're getting a good lift on the payment sales and the core operating business, as you said, Bruce, which is bringing some deposits with it.\nJust our analytics and our capabilities, not to mention the product suite that we've begun to develop, is in a completely different place. It's a much stronger relationship pull with the client base. As the client base grows, there's more opportunity to bring in deposits. We feel very confident in terms of the deposit franchise at the moment.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, and you're getting a whole team here, Erika. It's a good question, obviously. Just your other point on investors, I'd say that given our history, I think we're particularly well placed to embark upon that migration of that deposit base as well. We're beginning that process.\nWe closed this quarter, and we've already begun to run our playbook through this rising rate cycle where we're lagging rate on that platform, which otherwise might not have been lagged, etc., etc. We're making the investments necessary. We're optimistic that we'll begin to see some benefits coming out of that, which was also part of your question.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWe'll next go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Go ahead.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Good morning. Just if I can back check on a couple of things. When you referred to the April full-year guidance, I think the output was a ±$3.4 billion-ish for the year. Is that still the zone that we're talking about as you reiterate it this quarter with a different mix? Well, I mean, I think what we're reiterating is the PPNR implied by that guide.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean, I think we talked about the plus and takes on that, seeing NII coming in a little better, with some offsets, and fees and expenses well controlled and well disciplined on that, and credit looking very positive and better than we expected as well.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Second question. Can you give us ISBCs in the full quarter? Any update on the magnitude and expected timing and run rating of the original $130 million of cost saves you expected?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I'd say the best way to think about that is by the end of the year, you'll see a run rate of about 70% of that $130 million, and then the full amount of the $130 million coming in next year.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Do you know what quarter you expect that to be kind of fully captured next year?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Well, next year, yeah, we haven't talked about it. I mean, the big driver of it is getting the close done in the first quarter. It'll substantially all be done by mid-year. There'll be some trickling in benefits in the second half, but most of that will be getting there by the middle part of 2023.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Last quick one. There was an increase in short-term borrowed funds in FHLBs. I'm just wondering, you had the ones that were at ISBC, and you had previously talked about getting rid of those through merger accounting. I'm just wondering, did that chunk that came over from ISBC get taken out, or are we now seeing the adds, and are there extra adds on top of it? Kind of if you could just talk through those two buckets, the short-term borrowed funds and the FHLBs relative to what might have come from ISBC or what's just new adds because of your funding mix. Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, we had a carryover of about $5 billion from ISBC, and then the rest of the balance sheet flows on our end in terms of loan growth and securities growth drove the rest of the changes in the quarter. Yeah, I would say on that that ultimately some of that's timing, Ken, is that the FHLB borrowings from investors will roll off, and we have cash coming in from some of the portfolios that we placed for sale. We would expect this is kind of the high watermark on the FHLB, all things equal, and that we would bring that down by year-end.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nOkay. Got it. Thank you.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYour next question will come from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Go ahead.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. A couple of questions. You mentioned regarding the PPNR guide, well-controlled expenses. Your expenses this quarter, I think, have come in at the high end of the range you gave for last quarter, including HSBC, ISBC. When you mentioned well-controlled expenses for full-year 2022, can you give a little more color on what a little higher than where you were previously expecting, lower, unchanged, and any color on that?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I think we're seeing some positive benefits coming out of expenses. When we say well-controlled, I think we have some optimism that that's going to be no greater than and possibly a little less than we expected.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Even though second quarter was at the high end, are you seeing some other additional cost savings?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI don't know if that's true. If we set up 1% to 2% given higher revenue-based compensation expense was the guide, and they came in up 1%. I'm not sure where that's at the high end of the range, Vivek.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. I'm just looking at reported, Bruce, and you were at 16% to 18%, and it came in at 18% on reported.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I mean, you have to look at underlying because that's really the integration costs that tick that up. If you look at our underlying, we actually thought we did a really good job to keep them virtually flat. We would expect that strong performance to continue into Q3. We called out, I think, maybe 4% for the whole year. It's roughly where we are, so.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nJust on the integration costs, Vivek, we did see more integration costs this quarter, but that's not signaling higher integration costs. Just the opposite. We're pulling some into this quarter. We're expecting integration costs overall to be lower than we announced for the day. That was just a pull forward, Vivek, into Q2.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. That's helpful. A completely different question. Early delinquencies, can you give us the numbers by loan category for second quarter 2022, meaning 30 to 89-day delinquencies?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOverall, on the consumer side, delinquencies have been flat to even some signals of being very modestly down. Actually, we're seeing in no portfolio that we're looking at, do we see any signs of reinflation both at the 30-day level all the way through 90-day. With a 120-day cycle to get to a net charge-off, it would take a whole heck of a lot of what you would need to believe to see net charge-offs in the consumer segment go up materially between now and the end of the year. Obviously, the place we're watching on the net charge-off line is things like used car values and recoveries on the Resi portfolio, but those have been very stable, very high, and very positive.\nWe don't expect that to move very much either. The message overall on the consumer segment side is everything remains in great shape without really any signs of a tick up. The fundamentals remain strong too. Consumers still have 25% to 30% more in liquidity and deposits than pre-COVID, and customer pay rates on credit cards pay in full still are in the low 40% percentile. That was in the low 30s before COVID. To believe that you'd start to see delinquency ticking up, you'd first probably see deposits start to burn down, and you'd start to see customers re-levering. We're not seeing that.\nNow, we're a little bit unique from some peers in that our customer base skews much more mass affluent and affluent. Even when you say segment, and credit score-wise, it's super prime and high prime. We're a super prime lender. Where you see some market commentary on early signs of credit, it tends to be in the subprime space. We don't have any of those businesses. We don't see any signs of credit stress in any portfolio really across any of the segments that we're in.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Not even in the other retail partnerships you've put on the point of sale, are you seeing any stretching by consumers there in terms of levering up more?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nNo. I would direct you to a month or two ago, John and I went to the Morgan Stanley conference, and we shared some credit strats portfolio by portfolio. The Citizens Pay portfolio is performing exceptionally well and is, in fact, multiples below our prime credit card portfolio. Not only is it super prime, but it's performing four, five, six times better than even a credit card portfolio. We feel very good about the quality.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThat's because we draw a tight credit box in terms of what we are willing to take on the credit box.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nExactly. Where you start to, we've been very ambitious in our desire to grow that business, but we've been disciplined on credit. We're not going to be undisciplined on credit in that business to drive growth. Where we've been slower to see growth manifest in Citizens Pay, it's because we're not willing to jeopardize our credit discipline. I don't see equally any signs of stress whatsoever on the Citizens Pay portfolio. It remains in great shape.\n\nVivek Juneja\n\nSenior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. There are no further questions in queue. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mr. Van Saun for closing remarks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAll righty. Well, thanks. Thanks again for dialing in today. We appreciate everyone's interest and support. Have a great day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that will conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. We're sorry, your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

My name is Tony, and I'll be your operator today. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President, Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nEVP of Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun, and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our first quarter results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here to provide additional color. We'll be referencing our first quarter earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation, and the reconciliations in the appendix. With that, I will hand over to you, Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Kristin.\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. There have clearly been changes in the external environment relative to what was expected coming into the year, along with significant volatility. We feel we've executed well in this environment and are positioned to perform well over the course of 2022. Among the highlights of the quarter, we had a successful conversion of the HSBC branch and online customers, which was then followed by closing the Investors acquisition on 6 April 2022. We continued to take actions to position our balance sheet well for rising rates, and we've made further progress on our strategic initiatives, including our digital agenda and top-seven program. With respect to our financial results, we are off to a good start with underlying EPS of $1.07 and ROTCE of 13%.\nThis is generally our softest quarter from a seasonal standpoint, given fewer days in the quarter and the impact of payroll taxes on expenses. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially, given 3% average loan growth and higher NIM, which more than offset a sizable drag from lower PPP loan forgiveness revenue and day count. We saw lower revenue in capital markets and mortgage, given the environment, though high volatility benefited our global markets hedging business. We maintained strong deal pipelines in capital markets, and remain optimistic for a significant revenue pickup if markets stabilize. We managed expenses well in the quarter, and turnover has normalized somewhat. Credit metrics are all excellent, and so far, both our consumer and corporate customers are navigating well through the current challenges. Our balance sheet remains in great shape with a CET1 ratio of 9.7%.\nWe have the capacity to grow loans, pursue fee-based bolt-on acquisitions, raise our dividend in the second half of the year, and buy back some stock. Our loan growth has picked up on the commercial side, and we plan to throttle back our growth in mortgage and auto a little, which will maintain an attractive LDR. I'd like to shift gears to emphasize a few key points that are topical for Investors at the moment. First, to be clear, we will benefit nicely from the accelerated path to higher rates. Our funding base is vastly improved from where it was entering the last rate-up cycle. We have a 7% benefit from a 200 basis point gradual rise in rates, a 10 basis point cost of interest-bearing deposits, and an 83% loan-to-deposit ratio.\nWe project roughly $300 million in higher NII, given the current curve, which annualizes to much more in 2023. This will more than offset roughly $100 million in lower fee income from the environment. John will take you through this in detail in his remarks. Second, while inflation pressures are real, and the possibility of recession in 2023 has increased, we feel our credit risk position is in very good shape. We have maintained a super prime to high prime risk appetite in consumer, and over time, we have migrated our credit exposure in commercial to bigger companies who have better credit profiles. As a result, our overall credit profile has improved over time.\nOur real-life and CCAR stress test results demonstrate that our credit profile is slightly better than middle-of-the-super regional PAC, and we have carefully assessed Investors' credit books and loss history, and remain confident in their positioning, which we will further harmonize over time. Lastly, with respect to acquisitions, I would like to highlight that our focus in 2022 is on integrating the acquisitions that we made last year and getting each of those off to a strong start, particularly our New York City metro area initiative. We will still look for acquisitions in the wealth space, but we are a highly disciplined acquirer and have not been able to get much done as a result. With respect to Florida, we now have eight branches in the state, and job one is bringing them to network performance levels.\nThere does not appear to be much to do that's attractive inorganically, and the likely path is that we will open several more wealth centers in additional cities down the road. In short, you can count on us to maintain the strong financial discipline we've exhibited since the IPO. All in all, we feel very good about how we've started the year, and how we are positioned to navigate the challenging environment. Given the significant move in rates and the closing of the two bank acquisitions, we've provided detailed guidance in our earnings presentation to assist analysts and investors in updating their models. We continue our journey to building a great bank that can do ever more for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bruce. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with our headlines for the quarter.\nWe reported underlying net income of $476 million and EPS of $1.07. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 13%, which includes the impact of a modest credit provision benefit. Net interest income was up 2% linked quarter, driven by strong loan growth and a 9 basis point improvement in margin. Period end loan growth was up a solid 2% linked quarter. Our retail loans are up about 3%, while commercial loans are up 2% or 3% XPPP index. Average loans are up 3% linked quarter, paced by commercial up 3% or 4% XPPP, and retail up 3%. Fees were down 16% linked quarter, driven primarily by lower capital markets fees off of record prior quarter, given market volatility, seasonal impacts, and some pull forward of transactions into the fourth quarter.\nOn a positive note, we had our best quarter ever in interest rate and commodities revenues as we helped clients manage through the volatile environment. We remained disciplined on expenses, which were up 3% sequentially, excluding acquisitions, reflecting seasonal payroll tax impacts. Year-over-year expenses were up a modest 2%, excluding acquisitions. We recorded an underlying credit provision benefit of $21 million, which reflects strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios. The near-term macroeconomic outlook remains positive, though we are monitoring whether Fed actions to slow inflation can do so while engineering a soft landing for the economy. The underlying credit benefit for the quarter excludes $24 million for the double count of day-one CECL provision expense tied to the HSBC transaction. Our ACL ratio stands at 1.43%, down slightly from 1.51% at the end of 2021 and the 1.47% day-one CECL level.\nOur tangible book value per share was down 10.5% linked quarter, driven primarily by the impact of rising rates on securities and hedge valuations that impact AOCI. We continue to have a very strong capital position with CET1 at 9.7% after a 20 basis point impact from the HSBC transaction. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for the first quarter while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on slide six was up 2%, given strong loan growth and the benefit of higher rates more than offsetting the approximately $41 million combined impact from lower day count and the reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness. The net interest margin was 2.75%, up 9 basis points, reflecting the benefit of higher rates with front-book yields rising, which more than offset reduced PPP benefit.\nThis is already starting to benefit NII in the first quarter and is driving the significant improvement in our full-year outlook. Those benefits will continue to accumulate into 2023. Importantly, our expected asset sensitivity reflects how we have completely transformed our funding base since the IPO. We are beginning the current up cycle with a very strong liquidity profile. Our LDR is much lower, our deposit costs are as low as they've ever been, and our overall funding profile is greatly improved. Our period-end demand deposits are now 32% of the book compared with 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle. Within our interest-bearing deposits, our consumer CDs are now less than 3% of total deposits compared with about 10% at the start of the last cycle. We are also starting this cycle with a much lower level of floating wholesale funding.\nThis improved deposit profile reflects the significant improvements we've made to our deposit franchise since the IPO, with improved and expanded retail and commercial deposit offerings. We have also enhanced data analytics that allow us to attract and retain more stable deposits. With a better starting position, and the improvements in our deposit mixing capabilities, we expect our interest-bearing beta to be about 35% over this rate cycle, which is meaningfully lower than the last cycle. Our overall asset sensitivity stands at 7% at the end of the first quarter. This is down modestly from 10% at the end of Q4, with the decrease primarily driven by the denominator impact of our higher NII outlook, given the benefits from the 6 April forward curve and the evolution of the balance sheet. Pro forma for the Investors acquisition, asset sensitivity is slightly over 6%.\nSince the path of the rate cycle is uncertain, on the bottom left side of this page, we've given you an estimate of our sensitivity to further changes in rates, either up or down from the forward curve. Essentially, a 25 basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about $20 to 25 million a quarter, with most of that coming from our exposure to the short end of the curve. This includes the pro forma impact of Investors. Moving on to slide eight, we delivered good fee results this quarter despite headwinds for capital markets, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses, and we drove solid performance across other fee categories. Capital markets delivered solid results despite the market volatility, seasonal impacts, and some pull forward into the fourth quarter of 2021.\nGiven the strength of our pipelines, capital markets fees could rebound nicely as markets settled down and there was more certainty regarding the path of the economy. Demonstrating the diversity of our business, we delivered our best quarterly results ever in global markets, a 46% linked quarter as we worked with clients to manage their foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity exposures. Mortgage fees were down 9% linked quarter against a backdrop of lower industry origination volumes, given rising rates and seasonal impacts. Strong competition and excess industry capacity continued to pressure margins. Mortgage servicing income improved as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the MSR. Card fees, and service charges and fees were slightly lower linked quarter given seasonality. Debit transactions and credit card send continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels, and wealth fees also remained strong.\nOn slide nine, expenses were well controlled, up 3% linked quarter, and just 2% year-on-year, excluding acquisitions. Our Top Seven efficiency program is well underway, targeting $100 million of pre-tax run rate benefits by the end of the year. Period end loans on slide 10 were up 2% linked quarter. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth again this quarter, up 2% or 3% ex-PPP. Average loans were up 3% linked quarter. Driving this was average commercial loan growth of 3% or 4% ex-PPP impacts, led by C&I with growth across almost every region, including our expansion markets. Average retail growth was also 3%.\nLine utilization began to rebound a bit with an increase of about 150 basis points to a little over 36% on a slot basis, primarily driven by corporate banking, led by manufacturing and trade as companies looked to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices, and facilitate some M&A activity. On slide 11, our period end deposits were up 3% linked quarter as we added $6.3 billion of lower cost deposits with the HSBC transaction. Excluding HSBC, period end and average deposits were down slightly given seasonal impacts, as well as continued normalization from elevated liquidity levels. Moving on to credit on slide 12, we saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios. Net charge-offs were up slightly at 19 basis points for the first quarter, with good performance across the portfolio.\nNon-performing loans increased by $87 million linked quarter, primarily driven by residential real estate secured loans exiting forbearance. Other credit metrics continued to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios, and criticized loans were lower. While we are mindful of inflationary pressures and the higher possibility of recession, we feel good about the improvements to the portfolio we've made over the last few years, and the overall positioning of our credit risk. In the appendix on slide 21, you'll see that the risk profile of our commercial portfolio has significantly improved given changes through the pandemic, including prudent lending and a focus on growing the bigger mid-corporate credit portfolio, which is higher rated, as well as reductions in stress sectors such as retail malls, education, and casual dining. On the retail side, we continue to focus on the super prime and prime segments.\n\nOperator\n\nOur risk profile has improved given our disciplined risk appetite and changes in our portfolio mix, including the runoff of our personal unsecured product. Of note, the Investors' portfolios have performed well in prior cycles, and we feel good about them. Moving to slide 13, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.7% at the end of the first quarter after closing the HSBC transaction, which had a 20 basis point impact. We also wanted to mention that we have widened our target CET1 operating range to 9.5% to 10 from 9.75% to 10, reflective of the continued progress we've made in improving profitability, revenue diversity, and overall risk management. Our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed, and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company.\nShifting gears a bit, on slide 14, you'll see some examples of the progress we've made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. As you know, we closed the acquisition of Investors at the beginning of April, further expanding the foothold we established in the New York City metro area through the HSBC branch transaction, and significantly advancing our growth plans. In the consumer business, we were excited to complete the upgrade of Citizens Access to a fully cloud-enabled core platform, which enhances the capabilities of our national digital bank and is the first step toward our multi-year objective of convergence with our core banking platforms.\nWe also recently announced Citizens EverValue Checking, a new overdraft-free checking account designed to meet Bank On National Account Standards and increase banking access for underserved communities. On the commercial side, we continue to perform well in the league tables, consistently ranking in the top 10 as a middle market and sponsor bookrunner. On the right side of the page, we've included some digital metrics. We are very excited with how our digital-first approach is increasing engagement with our customers, and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Given the significant change in the rate environment and the closing of our two bank acquisitions, we've provided a comprehensive update to our 2022 guidance on slide 15. The good news here is that our guide is up for our standalone business. Rates are helping NII more than offsetting the fact that we are down a little on fees.\nPPNR is higher, and there is no change in our positive view on credit, and we remain confident in the outlook for the bank deals. I'll focus my comments on the full-year outlook, including both HSBC and Investors, but we've also added the standalone outlook without the bank deals to help isolate performance. We have also included a comparison to our original guide from January to help highlight what is driving the overall improvement in the full-year outlook. The rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of 6 April, which implies a Fed Funds target of 225 to 250 basis points by the end of the year. On the long end, this rate curve implies the 10-year treasury to be about 270 basis points at the end of the year.\nIt is also useful to keep in mind that the cumulative benefit from rates would also represent meaningful full-year effect upside to NII in 2023. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 27% to 30, driven primarily by the improved rate environment and solid average loan growth of 20% to 22. On a standalone basis, NII is about $290 to 330 million better than our prior guidance given the higher rates. Average interest-earning assets are expected to be up 14% to 16. Fee income is expected to be up 3% to 7. On a standalone basis, fee revenue will be about $100 million lower than the January guide as the environment will impact mortgage revenue, as well as capital markets somewhat. Non-interest expense is expected to be up 16% to 18 given the full-year effect of HSBC and Investors, as well as our commercial fee-based acquisitions.\nCredit is expected to remain excellent, with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly for the year. We expect to end the year with a CET1 ratio of about 9.75%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividends in the second half of the year. Our capital projections include the impact of our expected notable items for the year, including the integration expenses for the acquisitions and our Top Seven costs. You can see those in the appendix on slide 20. Importantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis for the year, excluding the acquisitions. If you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be over 4% operating leverage. Including acquisitions, we expect operating leverage of over 4% and over 7%, excluding PPP.\nOverall, we expect our full-year ROTCE to land solidly within our 14% to 16 medium-term target range. Moving to slide 16, I'll walk through the outlook for the second quarter. On a standalone basis, we expect NII to be up 6% to 8, driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth. With the bank acquisitions, we expect NII to be up 27% to 29. On a standalone basis, average loans are expected to be up 1% to 2, led by commercial, with interest-earning assets up slightly. Fees are expected to be up 3% to 5 on a standalone basis, reflecting some improvement in capital markets and seasonal benefits. Including the acquisitions, fees are expected to be up 7% to 9. Non-interest expense on a standalone basis is expected to be up 1% to 2, given higher revenue-based compensation.\nIncluding the acquisitions, expenses are expected to be up 12% to 13. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable, and we expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%. To sum up with slides 17 and 18, we started 2022 with a solid quarter. We have a winning strategy, and are well positioned to succeed given the strength and diversity of our businesses. We are very optimistic about the outlook for the rest of 2022 and beyond. We expect to materially benefit from a higher rate environment and strong loan growth. Our capital markets business is well positioned as markets stabilize, and we are very excited about the opportunity to grow our business in the New York City Metro region as we integrate and build on HSBC and Investors. We will continue to focus on execution and building a top-performing bank that delivers for all our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for some Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the oe zero command. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nMorning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Sure. I was hoping maybe you could spend just a moment discussing sort of the magnitude of recovery you're assuming in the capital markets and environment in the forward guide. It looks like you assume some recovery in the second quarter, but of course, moderated the full-year target a bit. Just curious for some thoughts or color on how you see things trajecting from here.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll go ahead and start off on that. I mean, I think you had a number of impacts there that we're building into the guide. I'd say that we mentioned our $100 million guide-over-guide, which is driven primarily by mortgage. There's some capital markets implications there as well, given the fact that Q1, we had some pull forward into the fourth quarter. If you look back at the fourth quarter, we had a record quarter. Our pipelines look excellent, so there could be a little bit of time to build that back into delivering in the last three quarters of the year. As markets stabilize, we really think that the momentum there is strong. Maybe Don can cover.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think it's a tale of a couple of different cities. One thing we're seeing is quite a bit of strength in the loan markets, the syndicated loan markets. While the bond market, particularly high yield, and the equity markets have been pretty much closed for the last few months, we're seeing some rotation into the syndicated loan markets as the liquidity there kind of rebuilds. You've seen quite a dramatic rally in the loan markets over the last couple of days, actually, and that's been quite supportive. I think the second quarter will be really a story about syndicated lending. If we get a reduction in volatility, we think we're going to begin to see the bond markets reopen a little bit and the equity markets reopen.\nI will say what John said, which is our pitch activity, our pipelines, and our mandates are extremely strong. It's really a matter of waiting for the constructiveness, excuse me, in the markets to return, and we'll begin to bring deals. We saw three or four deals start to emerge last week, which we were on, and we feel pretty good about particularly the back half of the year.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThe other thing you didn't mention is the M&A pipeline, which I think still looks really, really good. Again, if the markets stabilize a little bit, I think we'll start to pull those deals through. It's typically seasonal that the fourth quarter is huge, which it was for us in 2021, and the first quarter is usually softer seasonally. Pipelines look good. I think as the year goes, we should see a nice build in M&A revenue.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'll also just amplify that, Bruce, to say a lot of our capital markets and M&A activity surrounds private equity. Private equity is still flush with cash, and they actually are looking at quite interesting valuations in the market right now. It's a matter of matching sellers' kind of desires and buyers' desires. That'll just take a little time to kind of work through the system.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, good.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nWonderful. That's good color. Thank you. John, was something you could talk just a bit about how your rate sensitivity changes as the cycle progresses? You're meaning effectively how do the first few rate hikes look in your mind vs the next several?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nDid you say asset sensitivity, or was it funds? I missed the.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, what you're calling. In other words, how much more powerful are the first few rate hikes than the next few?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I mean, I'd say that we mentioned our $20 to 25 million per instantaneous 25 basis point rate hike. That's really an average. You get a little more on the front and maybe a little less as you get to the end of it. That's really driven by deposit betas, which are going to be extremely well controlled in the first 100, and then that starts to build into the second 100 and then beyond. Yeah, I think you will see possibly a bit more on the front end when we're seeing that lag effect and deposit betas contribute a touch more. It'll be a little lower on the back end. I will mention the other point.\nThat 20 to 25 is an average, but it's also a first-year average. There's actually more upside when you get into, even if it's instantaneous, you still get a lag effect benefit from the asset side as well as assets repriced. You might see, for example, in year two, even for an instantaneous 25 basis point change, you would see upside from there in the 15% to 20 range on top of that as you get into rolling year two.\n\nScott Siefers\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nPerfect. All right. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you so much for slide seven. I guess, John, maybe let me start my line of questioning here. Your current asset sensitivity from here is 6% pro forma for Investors.\nI guess I wanted to understand the comment that was made earlier about acceleration, right? On one hand, we do expect deposit betas to accelerate as we are deeper into the rate cycle. On the other hand, you have some swaps on your portfolio today. Can you talk a bit about the interplay of both, and how should we think of this asset sensitivity as we move forward in the rate cycle? Does the swap portfolio give you a different trajectory for enhanced sensitivity later?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, thanks, Erika. I think if you're on page seven, I think the drivers there are that we're entering this cycle much better positioned than the last cycle. You think about just the starting point with interest-bearing deposit costs being at 10 basis points, an all-time low for us. We started the last cycle at 34 basis points.\nThe balance sheet position, the mix on the deposit side is much better with 32% non-interest bearing. We feel just much better prepared to benefit from rising rates this time around. We still benefited from rising rates last time around, by the way. We're much better prepared to benefit from this side around this time around on deposit betas, given all of the strength on the balance sheet. I'd say when you ask about balance sheet, I mean, I think, and swaps, you really have to think about it in the context of the entire balance sheet. We do have a significant amount of asset sensitivity left to play out. That'll decline over time as NII keeps rising.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks, the denominator effect as we update and increase our NII, that alone reduces the percentage of further benefit that could occur for future rate hikes. Just dollar for dollar, it's fine, but the percentages fall. I do think that there is significant firepower left, both with respect to the balance sheet loan growth part of the story, as well as much more hedging left to do before asset sensitivity gets anywhere near neutral. That's how I would describe it. I mean, in terms of deposit betas, again, 2022, you're going to see a lot of lag, a lot of lag in the first 100. It'll start to catch up maybe in the second 100. If we really do get to 300 basis points in Fed Funds, you'll see some of that catch up in 2023.\nI'll just close out with our conversation about NII being up $290 to 330 million guide-over-guide is an important thing to focus on. That's in a gradual rate-rising scenario. It could be it's much higher in a full-year effect when you get to 2023, approaching maybe 2x that.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI would just add, Erika, that we've been, I think, very keen to leave the asset sensitivity high and not do significant additional swaps. We've done a bit. Anyway, we're still, I think, of the view that rates could go even higher here. Feel good about how we're positioned right now.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGot it. The second question is for you, Bruce.\nThe stock is having a good start to the day, but the valuation on tangible book value is underneath your ROTCE landing point for the year, either on a standalone or a pro forma basis. I guess, what do you think, in your estimation, that the market does not understand about the improvements that the bank has made since the IPO? I think part of that is the asset sensitivity and deposits. Wondering if you could answer that question however way you want to, but also, could you give us a sense of how many checking accounts you have, for example, on the consumer side vs previous? Maybe remind us why you have to keep what seems like a 50 to 100 basis point higher capital level than a lot of your regional peers.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, there is a lot in that. I'll try to unpack that, Erika.\nI think partly our objective here is to continue to perform well through cycles. We're a relatively new company with a relatively fresh management team. I think when the market goes into a risk-off posture, some assumptions of how are they going to do, we're not as we don't have the historical track record of some of our peers, I think. I think we've done a good job of dispelling some of those worry beads when we went through the pandemic, and our credit performance was very good. I think there was some concern for a while that we'd grown the balance sheet fairly quickly to get re-leveraged after the IPO. Was that going to end in tears? We've said all along that we've been very disciplined in terms of where we were lending money and how we were allocating capital.\nI think that's borne fruit. I think now with an upcycle at the beginning of the year when the environment looked like rates were going to go up gradually, to use a Goldilocks example, that was the porridge was just right scenario. Our stock performed quite well out of the chute. I think once it became clear that the Fed was behind the curve and was going to start to raise rates much more aggressively, you kind of tipped into a, well, maybe the porridge is too hot. Will our deposit betas go up too fast and curtail some of the benefit from higher rates? I think, again, with all the work we've done and analysis we've provided, we're quite confident that the liability side of this bank is much, much better than it's ever been.\nI've done a lot of hard work on that. We still think whether the path is fast or whether it's more gradual, we're going to benefit significantly in terms of interest rates. I'd say also on fees, there's probably a concern that we've built up some areas that maybe are more volatile in capital markets, and mortgage is kind of the big fee elements for us. Having said that, I think you've seen that there's good diversity in our fees. In a pandemic period when capital markets were a bit softer, mortgage revenues were really, really strong given lower rates. We can see that flip around.\nI think the fact that we've assembled an excellent commercial bank with very strong capabilities and a targeted focus on private capital and serving private capital and helping the industries that really are the engine of the economy, technology, healthcare with our JMP acquisition, I think we're very confident that we can grow revenues sustainably in capital markets. They'll move around a little bit from quarter to quarter. I think the trend line is upwards and to the right. Again, on the mortgage business, I think we've built that out to have a nice diversity of revenues across wholesale channels and our retail channel. I think we can combat some of the lower production volumes by building market share. We plan to hire more LOs this year. I think all of these aspects take time for the market to come around and fully appreciate.\nWe'll just keep doing what we're doing, putting up good results, and executing well. I think ultimately the stock will take care of itself. With respect to the non-interest-bearing liabilities, I mean, the DDAs as a percentage of the total deposit base is up to about 32%. I think when I walked in the door at the time of the IPO, that was probably in the low 20s. That's been a dramatic improvement, focusing on total value proposition to certain target customer segments on the consumer side and also on the commercial side. Actually, just building out our capabilities and investing in our core platform and cash management offering. It's just been a gradual improvement over time as we've enhanced our capabilities and our targeting, and we've had nice growth as a result. I think I'll stop there.\nDoes anybody want to add to that? Brendan, do you want to talk about consumer deposits or Don on commercial?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'm happy to give a, Erica had asked about sort of counts of checking account customers. Just a couple of quick points. When you look at total relationships in the consumer bank, when we went public, we had about 2.9 to 3 million customers. We now have over 7 million customers in total. Now, some of those are loan customers. When you unpack that to core deposit customers, that number is sort of, we went from 2.9 to 3.5 million customers. That's good growth, but that's really not where the action is in the story vs sort of heading down this path. Really, under the covers on that growth, which we've been in sort of top quartile growth of our peers, has been a quality transformation.\nThere's been a dramatic overhaul in how many customers view us as their primary bank. More than 100% of the growth in the household basis comes from mass affluent and affluent customers. When you combine the higher quality customer with deeper relationships, that's what's driving a lot of the improvement in DDA and non-interest-bearing deposits, which is very sustainable. That's kind of ground game, a lot of work over multiple quarters, over a lot of years to get that to scale. Look, we still have some running room. I think there's still oxygen left in that tank for us to continue to improve the quality of the customer base. We've made a lot of progress in catching up to peers, but we still have momentum. It does not seem to be slowing.\nI think you should expect more and more of that, putting aside what happens with the excess stimulus deposits under the covers. The quality story is still continuing and continuing at scale. The other point I'd make mention of as you think about betas for this upcycle. Last time, because of the low DDA balances that we had in consumer, we had about $10 billion in CDs. Now we start that period with only $3 billion, and we look a lot more like a bigger size bank in terms of deposit composition than we do a smaller size bank, where we're not as rate sensitive in how we're driving deposits because of that quality transformation that you see in the customer base.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll just emphasize, Bruce, what you said in terms of we've gone through a complete reconstruction of our treasury service business.\nIt was frankly a basket case six years ago. I would put it up against any other company's treasury service business. That's driving an above-trend growth rate, 7% to 10 in terms of year-on-year growth, and also driving a skew towards non-interest-bearing deposits. We didn't even have a deposit team six years ago. Now we have a built-out team, which has got fantastic analytics, bringing new offerings like green deposits on the ESG agenda, and also building a liquidity portal. It's at a totally different place. We're seeing results in terms of deposit levels, and we're seeing the skew towards non-interest-bearing also.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. We're giving you a long-winded answer, Erika, but I wanted to just come back to the last thing you touched on, which was ROTCE and also our capital targets.\nI think we're pleased that we can say that we'll be solidly in the range for our medium-term targets this year, the 14% to 16. You can see that where we were in the first quarter, that should ramp, and we could be even stronger, I think, as we exit the year. I feel very good about that. We did move the targets from 9.75% to 10 to 9.5% to 10, so we moved them modestly. I'm still a big believer in being somewhat conservative on the capital, particularly as, as I said, we're a relatively new company. I think all our stakeholders take some comfort from maybe being slightly higher than our peers. If you look at it over time, we've been converging to peers.\nHonestly, when you look at the CCAR results and our risk profile, there's no reason that longer term we'll need to have that premium.\n\nErika Najarian\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you for the complete answer.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Foran\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe to follow up on deposits, you've been very clear and convincing on the improvement in the book. That's appreciated and great information. As you think also about the ability to grow deposits over the next two years, I wonder, I know there's a lot of moving parts. There's no one answer, but if you could just give your thoughts on the ability to grow deposits overall and maybe touch on consumer vs commercial and how that might behave as rates go up.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, great question, Brian. Appreciate it.\nI think that you basically look at excellent opportunities to grow deposits over time as our product lineup on both consumer and commercial have improved. I think if you separate the expectation for as rates rise, there's some impact on how those deposits play out. There's also the surge deposits that came in in the pandemic that all appear to be a lot stickier than maybe a lot of us thought when they first showed up. I do think more broadly, when you think about the macro, deposits have grown consistently over the last several decades under a number of different macroeconomic scenarios. Even through quantitative tightening and the like, the banking industry deposit growth seems to continue to chug along.\nWe're optimistic that the industry as a whole, and we in particular, given our significantly expanded product capabilities, will be able to continue to drive really strong deposit growth on both the consumer and commercial side. Maybe I'll just turn it over to Brendan and then maybe Don.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Look, I think we've demonstrated in a variety of cycles the ability to drive deposits at scale. The question is always at what cost. I think we're in a dramatically different position in this upcycle than we were certainly in the last upcycle.\nWe continue to make improvements sort of on the consumer side, starting with just the breadth of the levers that we've built, whether it's the Citizens Access platform nationally to raise deposits away from our core book, the new markets that we're entering where we've got a solid and stable deposit base, but we think there's a lot of up running room. In fact, we're starting to see early signs already of we've got $100 million in inflow of balance sales already in the New York market from great execution and solid sales. We're optimistic continuing to afford that can continue. As we bring in, convert the customer base from Investors post-legal day one onto the platform, we think that same opportunity will exist in New Jersey.\nOur analytics have improved materially over the last couple of years, which allows us to be even more targeted. When you marry that with what I said a minute ago around just the quality and engagement of our customer base, the confidence of being able to grow deposits with highly engaged customers at more market rates than needing to reach for promo rates is high. I feel really good that we'll be able to grow at the pace we need with much more moderate costs.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think I said a lot of it in the last comment around treasury services and the growth of that business. Also remember, we're expanding aggressively in terms of our client base. We're in expansion markets, we're adding a lot of clients, and with that comes the opportunity to gather deposits at reasonable costs.\nWe feel pretty good about it. I'll go back to what Brendan said also. It's really a matter of the day-to-day balancing of volume vs cost and managing that against the asset side of the balance sheet and where we can redeploy capital. It's something that we manage carefully, but I feel confident that we're going to continue to expand the deposit base.\n\nBrian Foran\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous\n\nI appreciate all that. I will say I'm a Citizens Access customer. I'm not loving the renewed beta assumptions you're making, but I guess I'll have to live with it.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell, you can count on us continuing to be disciplined, yet still competitive, so.\n\nBrian Foran\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Autonomous\n\nThank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAll right.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nTwo questions. One was just on the most recent conversation that we had on deposit growth. I was intrigued by that relative to Bruce, your comment about slowing resi and auto lending growth to, I don't know if this is the right word, but keep the LDR or protect the LDR at around the 83% level. I just wanted to understand if that comment about LDR was more about the deposit growth rate that you were talking to just now, or was that because of the opportunities in resi and auto that you're not seeing as much as maybe you have had over the past few quarters.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. No, I'd say it's a factor of a number of considerations. One is that we're already seeing very strong loan demand on the commercial side. We're seeing line utilization tick up.\nThere can be somewhat of a rotation over into more growth on commercial. Therefore, when we look at consumer and in the higher rate environment, some of the margins on the lending in areas like auto and mortgage aren't what they used to be. We can still get to the loan growth assumptions that we had coming into the year with that rotation up to more commercial and throttling back a little bit on the consumer side. We could keep the pedal to the floor and keep pushing on bringing in those consumer assets, but we think we don't need to do that at this point. We've got NIM going up. The rate hike is providing a big lift.\nIf the marginal return on that incremental lending in the consumer side for mortgage and auto isn't hitting our hurdles, we have no problem backing off that. The net result of that is that benefits the LDR vs keeping the pedal to the floor. We think that's a trade-off worth taking.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. I guess the underlying question is how high up are you willing for LDR to go? I also had just a quick question on yields in general. This past quarter, you had some nice uplift in resi and the securities book, other retail loans. I'm just wondering, was that a function of swap activity that drove up those yields QQ, or it didn't look like the balances would have driven that QQ? Just wondering how the yield went up so much there. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nLet me start off, and then maybe John and Brendan can add on the yield question. We've been historically, since the IPO, we've had a relatively higher LDR that we worked hard to bring down from the high 90s down into the mid-90s. With this big influx of liquidity into the market, we've been able to bring the LDR back down to 80-ish. It's inching up a little bit here with all the loan growth that we're experiencing. I think we should still be able to manage that in the 80s. I can't really call exactly where that's likely to be. Partly depends on the amount of loan growth that we see.\nI think just the way we over time brought it from high 90s down into mid-90s, I think we can take another step function here with all the liquidity that we have in the house and continue to manage that in a reasonably conservative position with lots of liquidity. That would be my answer there. John, maybe you want to pick up the yields.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I'll start off on securities, and maybe Brendan can take mortgage. I can tell you overall that it's not swap activity that's having an impact on either of those. As it relates to securities, just to give you a sense, there are two dynamics going on there. One is the front book, where current yields on the stuff going into the portfolio are north of 3%. We're in the 3% to 3.30 basis point range.\nThat's a driver in Q1. It wasn't at that level during Q1, but it was well over 2%. It was probably 230 to 250 during the first quarter. That was compared to maybe 175 in Q4. That's the dynamic you're seeing, 175 in Q4, 230-ish in Q1, and now it's over 3%. That'll continue into the second quarter. The other dynamic is the backbook premium amortization declines when rates rise. You're seeing the tailwind from that into the securities book. That's the driver there. Maybe Brendan can talk about mortgages.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yeah. There's a handful of things on the consumer side. On other retail, there's a good percentage of that book that's variable linked to the market with our merchant partners and such. You can see that kind of ramp up as the market changes.\nOn the resi side, we're obviously a very big lender in HELOC, which is essentially all variable. We've had four sequential quarters in a row in net balance sheet growth and believe we're the number one originator in all of the United States in HELOC. We're really striking while the iron's hot and taking advantage of that business. You're seeing that flow through in the resi book with the yield improvements there as the rates kind of march north. On the mortgage side, it's a couple of things. One is front book pricing. We've been disciplined on front book pricing to the point of being a little out of the market at times as the market lags capacity. We're going to make sure we're using our balance sheet for deep relationships and try to push our rates up as fast as we can with the market.\nThe other just technical dynamic that you're seeing, if you're looking at linked quarter on mortgages in Q4, we did have a one-time reserve adjustment to the yields in Q4 that is non-recurring and didn't happen in Q1. If you look back a couple of quarters, you'll see a little bit of noise on what you saw in Q4, but that's kind of gone. That's sort of washed out. We should start to see the mortgage book begin to climb with the percentage of that book that is in variable rate and continued expected discipline on front book pricing.\n\nBetsy Graseck\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nJackie Sam\n\nSpecialist, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I was hoping you guys could remind us with Investors, is there any portion of the loan book or securities book that you're looking to kind of de-emphasize or run off?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I'll just start off there. I mean, I think that the securities book and Investors has a profile that we would migrate, and frankly, I've already been migrating to our profile, which is mostly clean duration, plus mortgage-backed securities, agency type paper. We've been in the process of migrating the securities book on that front. In general, we like the loan book that comes over from Investors that's performed well from a credit perspective. They have a nice core portfolio over there. Maybe Don can talk about anything else that might be migrated at the margin.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. There are certain elements of the book that might be a little bit different as we move forward, but it is not going to be quick and aggressive. We are going to do it over. We are going to migrate it over time. A lot of the business that they do is very diversifying for us. They are in different elements of the CRE business than we are, so it looks quite different. A lot of the C&I business is smaller company business banking, and we are looking to grow that segment as we move forward. You will see some adjustment at the margin, but no aggressive asset sales, I think, out of the box. Other than, I will say, I will say, Matt, on my side, we are doing roughly $1 billion to $1 billion to a BSO adjustments on the Citizens side.\nYou'll see us do some of that as we move around low-yielding assets that we might be acquiring, but we don't have full plans on that yet.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, balance sheet optimizations.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nI guess, obviously, there's some opportunities as well to essentially cross-sell. As we think about layering in Investors to the kind of medium term, do you think it'll have any net impact as we think about your loan growth, either a little bit less than Citizens standalone, a little bit more, or roughly the same?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWell, I mean, I look at it as what Don and Brendan have been able to accomplish when we go into expansion markets, right?\nIn particular, Don's business in commercial, when we entered the Southeast, is a good playbook for how we've been able to grow those expansion markets a little faster for a period of time until it converges over time. I think you would expect that once we get the engine running with respect to all of the integration and conversion, and we've been able to make our investments that we plan to make in New York Metro, I would suspect for a number of years, you could see the growth rates. Once that all settles out and baselines, you could see those growth rates actually being higher than Citizens standalone for a number of years until it balances out in terms of the expected market share that we plan to take in that metro.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. John, I'll also add that they have a very limited product set on the C&I side. Bringing in the variety of products that we can offer, and capabilities that we can offer, we think there's an opportunity to go after larger companies and also serve their clients in a much more substantial way.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Same comments on the consumer side. Our product set is significantly more diversified than both HSBC and Investors, which is great. We didn't build those revenue synergies into the deal model. We're seeing early signs of significant sales opportunity in New York. We're delivering on that. We're starting marketing middle of the year. We're going to convert early on mortgage and wealth for Investors inside of 2022, and then the rest of the platform will convert in 2023.\nIt will take some time, but we see an outsized opportunity for sustainable revenue growth over time.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Let me just chime in here as well, is that we think these deals are going to be a big success. It's really not just the expense synergies, which we're going to go get, but if it's a big success, it means that we were successful in cross-selling more to the customers who haven't had the benefit of our broader products and services, and then just gain market share. I think we have some very clear ideas about how to go after that, both on the commercial side and the consumer side. Really, none of that has been put into our forward forecasts at this point.\nGoal would be within 3 to 5 years, if New York starts to take on a look and feel of what we built in Boston and what we built in Philadelphia, it's going to be a home run for us.\n\nMatt O'Connor\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning. I had a question about reserving and provision. Just looking back at where your 1.43% ACL is pre-ISBC, and then just with all the CECL stuff going on, just wanted to kind of understand where do you think that the reserve lands vis-à-vis a blended day one, and what does that mean for further release or provision growth relative to your expectation that you laid out for charge-offs? Thanks.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. That's a good question.\nI mean, I think the first thing I would say when you were saying blended, if you were speaking about Investors on a blended basis, I think that their profile is actually quite good. When you look back in different cycles, their loss rates actually are lower than not only ours, but the regional bank peer set, given the collateralization, etc., and a number of other things that help that profile. Pound for pound, they come on with a slightly lower ACL and CECL hit to what the CFG standalone is. Not by a lot, and they're smaller, so it won't have a huge impact. They come in a little lower than, call it, the 1.43% where we are. From that perspective, it gives you a sense for how that might cause us to tick down on a blended basis. CECL day one was 1.47%.\nWe're at 1.43%. We've cleaned out a lot of the portfolios of concern that might have existed back at the end of 2019 when CECL was adopted. There's been significant, as we mentioned earlier, and we have in the slide deck in the appendix, significant improvements in both commercial and kind of retail businesses since then. You could see some opportunity, all else equal, for backbook needs as long as the macro holds for those needs to tick down. I think all of the variability will be on loan growth. We're just going to provide for our loan growth and all in probably be a little lower than we are here, but not by a lot.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThe other wildcard, obviously, Ken, is what does the kind of long-term or the medium-term macro forecast look like? Can the Fed engineer a soft landing?\nIs there a higher possibility of recession which could change that dynamic somewhat? I think certainly right now, with respect to 2022, we feel really good about how we're positioned from a credit standpoint. I would, if you asked me to make a call, say it's unlikely we'll have a recession in 2022. At least the clean credit metrics should continue for a while. Whether we can still show net benefits on the provision line, I think those days are probably numbered. In any case, I think there's still going to be good numbers. As John said, the ACL may tick down a little more from here, but it's kind of starting to feel like we're not going to go a huge amount lower.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nYep. Bruce, as a follow-up to that, it was good, nice to see the commercial line utilization up 150 basis points. You talked about you're reiterating your full year loan growth guidance. Just wondering if you can give us some on-the-ground color about business activity, supply chain constraints, just in terms of, and also that trade-off possibly between loans going on the balance sheet vs out the door in capital markets. Just kind of a feel for just how the commercial side of the economy is feeling and how that influences your views on commercial growth. Thanks.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Let me just say a word, and then Don really has the best color. Clearly, it's nice to see the line utilization tick up. Some of it is a little defensive in nature. People have been worried about their supply chain and inventory levels.\nWhen they can get a hold of the materials that they need, they go out and buy it. I'd say inventory build in light of supply chain issues probably has been the biggest driver. A little of that also is inflation, which is causing those materials to cost more. That would be, I'd say, number one. There are still people doing deals, doing smaller deals, and playing offense in terms of growth. There's a little bit of that ticking in as well. I think what continues to give us confidence is a thing that Don mentioned earlier, that private capital has amassed tons of firepower to work in the markets and is looking to get deals done. There's still deal-related activity that should continue to fuel some loan growth. With that, let me turn it over to Don.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I think you covered most of it. Back to the second half of the question, a lot of the capital markets activity we do is in the leveraged buyout area and things like that. That is an origination for distribution business, which it should be. We do not want a lot of that on our balance sheet. We continue to maintain average holds of about $12 million in our sponsor business. Very diversified, very careful from a risk profile. I will say that the utilization trend that we are seeing is actually even a little bit higher as we sit here in mid-April. That trend really is driven by cost of goods. There is an inflation aspect and some of the stockpiling. The broader question is, we are hearing generally positive things from our customers. The credit qualities, as we said, feel pretty good.\nThere's a little bit of pressure on margins as companies have varying degrees of inability to pass on cost increases where they're seeing them. Remember that these companies have been through hell over the last two years with the pandemic, and they've cut their costs. They've restructured their businesses, and they're entering whatever we're entering, whether it be a slowdown or something that's just slower growth, in a much better position from a management standpoint than they were just two years ago. That gives us a lot of confidence. Certain clients are being opportunistic. As Bruce said, where they're seeing competitors that are slightly weakened, we're seeing a little bit of M&A activity in the middle market channels that are companies that are buying each other right now.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOne last thing you might also add on is on the subscription line financing and some of the securitization.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. We're seeing significant volume in our subscription line financing for private equity and significant volume in our asset-backed securities businesses in the warehouses. Those markets are very strong, and we continue to see growth in the loan books on both of those activities.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks for all the color.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay.\n\nKen Usdin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nGood morning. I appreciate the color you gave there in terms of the commercial drivers and the trend behind the demand. Are you able to perhaps help unpack the high single-digit loan growth expectation ex-deals and ex-PPP for 2022 in terms of how you think about C&I growth and perhaps growth in your CRE portfolio as well? Thanks.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Why don't I start with that?\nWe're down to basically almost nothing on the C&I side on PPP. That's in the rearview mirror. That's not in any of our loan growth projections. The loan growth that we've referenced is really CFG loan growth. We've assumed a little bit of growth on the Investors Bank side, but not a lot for the rest of 2022. All the comments we're making are CFG-specific. I would say subscription lines are growing the fastest, C&I is growing the second fastest, and CRE, we're seeing very, very modest growth. We're basically on our CRE business, really still focused on purpose-built office, industrial, and life science, and a little bit of multifamily, but not a lot. We're really off-risk on hospitality and retail, so not a lot of CRE business there.\nThe issue that we're fighting and continue to fight, although it's getting a little bit better, is our originations are really strong. We're seeing lots of activity both coming into the book and also in the pipelines, but paydowns have been quite high. This was the first quarter where we saw paydowns begin to decline. Maybe that's a little bit of the volatility in the capital markets. Maybe that's a little bit of the loan market aggressiveness right now. We're seeing a little bit of a benefit from lower paydowns, which were running very, very high last year for almost the whole year and really eating up a lot of the origination activity that we were seeing.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay. Great. That's helpful. Then separately, on the credit side, just have a question there. In terms of the increase in the NPAs and the increase in the 90-day delinquencies, I know you indicated that's mainly mortgage coming off forbearance. Just want to give you, if you can give us a little color in terms of your confidence there in terms of the resolution of those items. Separately, any signs of faster-than-expected credit normalization on the consumer side, perhaps in your merchant partnerships or anything? Thanks.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. It's Brendan. I can take that. On the mortgage side, this is fully expected. These are sort of an administrative move of customers that have been in forbearance for quite some time. We've done extensive analytics on how much loss exposure we have to folks that are coming off of forbearance onto a full repayment schedule, and it's de minimis, especially on the mortgage side. We've got very significant coverage on our loan-to-value.\nWe feel really confident in that. Just broadly on the consumer book, we haven't seen much of any early signs that we're starting to see a tick up and return to normal. We're expecting one, but the delinquency levels generally remain in a very strong spot and significantly depressed. Some of the newer portfolios that we've talked a lot about over the years on these calls and others around student loans and merchant point of sale maintain incredible strength and have not shown any signs of uptick in early delinquency whatsoever. We feel really confident around the outlook, the state of credit, and consumers at the lowest levels it's ever been. We continue to sort of beat to the positive almost every month on what we're seeing on NCOs. I feel really good.\nI think when you look at the other side of the ledger for the average consumer, they're still showing a lot of excess liquidity. The money in consumer checking accounts is still at all-time highs, really hasn't moved down. While we're seeing a lot of velocity in customers using credit cards and spending and paying for things, it's not adding to outstanding. In order to believe that you'll start to see a meaningful correction on the credit line, I think you'd have to see some deflation on the excess cash built up in the consumer's wallet and start to see a rebound in receivables building up on the credit card. We haven't seen that. All the early indicators just aren't moving yet. Of course, we do expect it will, but just right now, it's not. We'll take it.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'd just add to that, John, all the early warning signs are flashing green, which is great. On the consumer side, delinquency roll rates, some of the things Brendan quoted, all appear really, really good. Similarly, on the commercial side, the credit class ratio continues to go down, and there's very few credits that are in heightened monitoring. That also bodes well for the future. At these very low levels for things like charge-offs and NPAs, you can see kind of one item can kind of move that number around a little bit. Overall, we feel really, really positive about the outlook for credit for certainly the balance of this year.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bruce.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nThanks. I was just curious, are there any plans to manage the available for sale securities portfolio just given the rising rates? Or any plans to move any of it into held to maturity or hedge some of this?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. That's a good question. I mean, I think we're in about a little bit less than 10%, called high single digits, of HTM in the first quarter. I think you'll see that that number will rise in the second quarter based upon a number of things that we're doing. We're putting a lot of securities to work just in CFG standalone, just given the environment now that there's a highly attractive place to grow the securities book at north of 3% yields just on standalone.\nWe're, of course, we've closed on the acquisition of Investors, and there's about $4 billion of securities there that we're rotating out of the profile that they had into the profile that looks like the kinds of securities that we own. There's lots of opportunities to address that, and you're likely to see the HTM percentage rise in the second quarter.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks. Secondly, just on the HSBC acquisition, I think at the time of the announcement in May, there was about $9 billion in deposits, and you closed it with $6.3 billion in deposits. Do you think at these levels, deposits hold steady? You can grow them. If you could just talk about that change in the outlook.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Pre-legal day one, the rundown in deposits is principally driven by their online business and a segment of international customers that were rotating into banks that have more global capabilities. The good news on that is that we didn't have to pay a premium of any kind for those customers that we weren't really going to consider core. We had modeled in essentially twice the level of deposit attrition post-legal day one than you would normally expect in a deal like that, given the profile of the customers that were banking at HSBC. The good news is since legal day one, it looks like a lot of that attrition had accelerated pre-legal day one, and we've seen the portfolio at a broadly stable level, with good sales, very strong sales, and normal expected ins and outflows on the back book.\nWe do expect that to be stable now and start to get into growth mode as we ramp up our marketing activities, which will obviously be a bit of a benefit on the deal model side, offsetting some of the shortfall in deposits we got on legal day one. We feel really, really good on the early signs that we're seeing here. We are six or seven weeks in.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'm just going to add, given we had the transition pre-legal day one, that we didn't have to pay for it, and it reduces the trend with the attrition happening post-legal day one. Just wanted to add that data point.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nManaging Director, Wedbush Securities\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nMorning, John.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMorning.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nMorning, Bruce. Bruce, you said in your opening comments that obviously the focus this year is to integrate the acquisitions you did in the Metro New York marketplace, but in the wealth space, if something was priced right, that would be something you'd consider. Thinking about the Florida franchise as you build that out, if a depository came up at attractive pricing, and again, I know you've played us full with what you're doing in New York, is that something that you could consider or are you really, nope, we're going to wait until we get these things fully integrated before we consider a depository deal?\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I don't see us looking at a depository there anytime soon. I think we've got enough on our plate that getting off to this really great start and launching New York Metro is job one.\nWe do have a strategy in Florida that I think is interesting. We had a couple of De Novo wealth centers, one in Palm Beach and one in Naples, that we focused on launching and starting to get those to the right customer levels and the right staffing so that we can really make some traction in those markets. We had five or six come over from HSBC, very attractive locations and branches with good staffing in the Miami area. That's job one, to try to really make that work, what we have, and really drive up the performance of those sites and keep getting smart on the market, keep talking to people, keep trying to figure out kind of where would the next city be where we think we could come in and make an entrance and gain some share.\nTo me, that's the focus. We'll keep trying to get smart on the market, but let's digest what we have and make that productive. The other point I'd make with respect to Florida and elsewhere where we're kind of outside of our core footprint is we're investing heavily in the digital bank. Very recently, we've migrated to a new cloud-based core platform, which is really exciting for us, and it's going to unlock the ability for us to really broaden our offerings and integrate those offerings on the digital platform. That's kind of also twined with some light branches in markets like Florida. Can we really start to bang the opportunity through our digital platforms? Over time, we'll figure out what physical presence we need to complement those digital offerings. It's pretty exciting.\nWe have a similar opportunity in the Greater Washington Area where we picked up, I think it's nine or 10 branches from HSBC. We can try to attack that market through digital and decide, is nine or 10 the right number? Are they in the right locations? Do we need to alter that? Using test and learning from Florida and from DC, are there some other attractive cities where we might want to go next and really put effort into growing the digital presence combined with some thin branch presence.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nVery good, Bruce. To pivot, the next question is on deposits. How do you guys weigh? You talked about how certificates of deposit have come down dramatically. You've got a very strong DDA balance core now, much higher than when public, of course.\nWith rates moving up so quickly now, the 10-year is almost at 3% today. When does long-term funding with low-cost CDs make sense? Don, when do your customers start asking for higher compensating balances as rates move up? Have you guys seen more discussions there as well on the compensating balances on the commercial side?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I'll go ahead and start. A couple of thoughts there. I think that as you heard from Brendan earlier, and you saw on our slide seven, our CD portfolio is much smaller than it was before. What that at the start.\nI think what the point there is, is that CDs could be part of the story, but we would do it in a way that's connected to a deep customer relationship rather than sort of a pseudo wholesale funding approach, which is, I think, how things got played out early in the last cycle for us, whereas this cycle is all going to be about customer relationships. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that over the last cycle, we expect CD betas to be lower during this cycle, in part due to how quickly you think the cycle is going to go. The last cycle took a longer time, two to three years, and you kept getting that ratcheted up cost of CDs every time they came to maturity. I do think CDs can be part of the story.\nGiven deep customer relationships and a shorter cycle, CDs can absolutely be a tool that we'll utilize coming off a lower base. That's the first point. The second point is that on the commercial side, you will have balance migration. That's natural as compensating balances don't need to be quite as high as earnings credit rates actually rise over time. Yeah, there'll be some of that migration that's built into the deposit betas that we articulated earlier and built into our deposit costs overall. It's the same point there that given the number of ways that we can interact with our customers on the commercial side, we're deepening our relationships there and expect that those migrations will be well controlled and as expected.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I think that's exactly right. We've actually gone out over the last month or so with a full information package with all of our bankers to discuss deposit and pricing levels as part of the overall relationship with all of our relationship managers. We're well on top of it. We have had some people pull deposits, but we haven't had a problem backfilling and bringing in other deposits to basically cover any outflows.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC\n\nGreat. Thank you for the color.\n\nBruce Van Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay. I think that's it for the questions in the queue. Let me just close by thanking everybody again for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. We're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up. We're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a brief question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this event is being recorded. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kristin Silberberg, Executive Vice President of Investor Relations. Kristin, you may begin.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, this morning, our Chairman and CEO, Bruce Van Saun, and CFO, John Woods, will provide an overview of our Q4 results. Brendan Coughlin, Head of Consumer Banking, and Don McCree, Head of Commercial Banking, are also here, and will discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway. We'll be referencing our Q4 and full year earnings presentation located on our Investor Relations website. After the presentation, we'll be happy to take questions. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to differ materially from expectations. These are outlined for your review on page two of the presentation. We also reference non-GAAP financial measures, so it's important to review our GAAP results on page three of the presentation, and the reconciliations in the appendix.\nWith that, I'll hand over to you, Bruce.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Kristin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We are pleased with the financial performance we delivered for Q4 and the full year, and we feel well-positioned to continue our momentum through 2022. The investments that we've made to transform and reposition Citizens since our IPO are really bearing fruit. Our customer-centric approach, backed by a full range of product offerings, and strong digital, data, and technology capabilities, has allowed us to gain market share, deepen relationships with customers, and develop sustainable growth opportunities. We've navigated the pandemic environment well, shifting to offense over the course of 2021 to accelerate our strategy, including five acquisitions, as we strive to build a unique and special top-performing bank. I'll comment briefly on a few of the financial headlines and let John take you through the details.\nFor the quarter, our underlying earnings per share was $1.26, and our return on tangible common equity was 14.6%. Sequential operating leverage was 1.5%. That's 1.8% ex-acquisitions, and sequential growth in PP&R was a strong 6%. Leading our performance was an unbelievably strong quarter in our capital markets business, led by M&A and loan syndications. We've built a great business through hiring top talent, in combination with several acquisitions, and our approach to market is really clicking. For the quarter, we were number one in the league table for middle market sponsored transactions, and number four for overall middle market. We only had JMP results for six weeks of the quarter, but we're very excited about how they'll augment what we've already assembled. Our highlights for the quarter include strong sequential loan growth of 4% on a spot basis, 5% ex-PPP, while average growth was 2%, and that's 3% ex-PPP.\nCommercial growth and a pickup in line utilization were bright spots, and we entered 2022 with a good jump-off point. We did a nice job on expenses, pulling across our top efficiency saves to help offset higher incentive comp tied to revenues. Credit remains pristine, as good as it gets. Our capital position remains strong with a CET1 ratio of 9.9%, giving us a great deal of capital management flexibility in 2022. We have the capital and liquidity to fund the attractive loan growth we expect to see in 2022 while looking for selective acquisitions and ensuring strong returns of capital to shareholders. With respect to our guidance for 2022, we assume solid economic growth of around 4%, several Fed rate hikes, and improvement in loan demand.\nOur top six and top seven programs should allow us to keep expense growth ex-acquisitions below 3%, and we're targeting 2% positive operating leverage, including the bank deal scheduled to close soon, and almost 5% XPPP impact. Credit is expected to continue to be highly favorable, and I'd expect our return on tangible common equity to move over 14% in the second half of the year, potentially reaching 15% in Q4. All in all, a very strong year of execution and delivery for all stakeholders by Citizens in 2021, and we feel we are well-positioned to do well in 2022 and continue our journey towards becoming a top-performing bank. I'd like to end my remarks by thanking our colleagues for rising to the occasion and delivering a great effort in 2021. We know we can count on you again in the new year.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Bruce, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll start with the headlines for the quarter. We reported underlying net income of $569 million and EPS of $1.26. Our underlying ROTCE for the quarter was 14.6%, which included the impact of a credit provision benefit. Revenue of $1.7 billion was up 4% linked quarter, given strong growth in fee income. Average loans are up a solid 3% in the quarter before the impact of PPP forgiveness, led by retail, which is up by 4%, and 3% growth in commercial. Overall spot loan growth of 5% for the quarter, excluding PPP, provides good underlying momentum for loan growth this year. Linked quarter fee growth was 16%, or 10% before acquisitions, including outstanding results in capital markets driven by record M&A fees and loan syndications, as we've executed well and gained market share.\nExcluding the impact of the two commercial fee-based acquisitions we closed in the second half, we delivered underlying positive sequential operating leverage of approximately 2% this quarter, with well-controlled expenses. We recorded a credit provision benefit of $25 million, which reflects strong credit performance and the improving economy. Our year-end ACL ratio stands at 1.51%, above our day-one CECL level of 1.47%. We continue to have a very strong capital position, with CET1 at 9.9% after returning $360 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Next, I'll provide some key takeaways for Q4 while referring to the presentation slides. Net interest income on slide six was down 2%, given lower net interest margin, partially offset by strong loan growth.\nThe net interest margin was 2.66%, down six basis points, reflecting a reduced benefit from PPP forgiveness and lower earning asset yields, given changes in loan mix and spread compression, partially offset by the impact of lower cash balances as we redeployed some of our excess liquidity into loan growth. We also made continued progress lowering our interest-bearing deposit costs, which are down one basis point to 13 basis points. On the bottom left side of the page, you can see we remain highly asset-sensitive at the end of the quarter, with an overall sensitivity of 10.1% to a gradual 200 basis point rise in rates. At the end of the year, about 60% of our sensitivity is geared towards the short end, so we are well-positioned to benefit when the Fed begins to tighten.\nReferring to slide seven, we delivered terrific fee results this quarter, demonstrating the strength and diversity of our businesses, with outstanding results in capital markets, reflecting our long-term investments in the business, and solid performance across other fee categories. We set a new record for quarterly capital markets fees, with exceptional strength in M&A advisory and loan syndication fees, amid a backdrop of good market activity. We continue to gain market share and have nice momentum as we enter 2022. We also delivered our best quarterly results of the year in FX and IRP, which are up 21% linked quarter, given an increase in currency transactions driven by robust M&A activity and an increase in client hedging, given the outlook for rate rises. Mortgage fees declined in the quarter against a backdrop of strong competition and excess industry capacity.\nWe saw ongoing pressure on gain-on-sale margins, particularly in third-party channels, and seasonally lower production volume. Mortgage servicing income improved as our third-party servicing book grew 3% linked quarter to $90 billion. Card fees were stable, as debit transactions and credit card spend continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels. Wealth fees also remained strong. Service charges and fees were modestly lower, reflecting the impact of Citizens Peace of Mind, our new customer-friendly deposit account feature. We are seeing these changes drive clear benefits in customer experience, as customer satisfaction is up and call center volume is down since we implemented the changes. On slide eight, expenses were well-controlled. Excluding the impact of the fee-based acquisitions that closed in the second half of the year, non-interest expense was stable, and we drove linked quarter operating leverage of about 2%.\nThese results reflect higher incentive compensation tied to strong capital markets revenue and strategic investments, which was balanced by strong expense discipline and the benefit of top efficiency initiatives. Period-end loans on slide nine were up 4% linked quarter, or 5% excluding PPP. We were pleased to see strong commercial loan growth, up more than 6% excluding PPP. Retail loans were also growing, up 4%. Average loans were up 2% and up more than 3% excluding PPP. Retail strength was driven by mortgage and auto. Commercial originations were very strong, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, led by corporate banking, subscription line financing supporting deal-related activity, and asset-backed lending. After line utilization levels ticked up last quarter, we saw a larger increase of about 270 basis points to 35% on a spot basis this quarter, primarily driven by deal-related financing activity.\nWe continue to expect a gradual recovery in utilization over the coming quarters as some of the issues holding back investment, such as supply chain challenges and labor shortages, resolve. In addition, our period-end commitments are up a very strong 8%, which will benefit us as investment continues to pick up. On slide ten, deposit flows continue to be robust, especially in low-cost categories, and our liquidity ratios remain strong. Average deposits were up 1% linked quarter and 5% year-over-year, with strong growth in demand deposits, which now make up 32% of total deposits, up from 30% last year. Interest-bearing deposits were broadly stable as the continued runoff of higher-cost term deposits was offset by growth in demand deposits and lower-cost categories. We continue to make good progress on deposit repricing, with interest-bearing deposit costs down one basis point to 13 basis points during the quarter.\nGiven the changing tone of the Fed and the potential that they may begin to tighten early this year, we thought it would be helpful to make a few points about how we see our deposit costs behaving in the next rate cycle. First, we have made significant improvements to our deposit-related capabilities since the IPO. Our enhanced data analytics capabilities allow us to optimize the deposit base by attracting more stable deposits with targeted offers, and by employing more dynamic pricing. We also have the added lever of Citizens Access, which has proven to be a very efficient deposit channel, and we have strengthened our commercial offerings and invested in enhanced tools to drive higher operating deposits.\nSecondly, our mix of lower-cost deposits is much better, with demand deposits now 32% of the book compared to 27% at the beginning of the last rate cycle, and consumer CDs, which were at 14% of total deposits at the end of the last cycle, are now down to 3%, which is below peer levels. Also, note that the HSBC branch acquisition will add almost $8 billion, or 5%, to our core deposits when we close this quarter. Lastly, we have vastly improved our overall liquidity profile with a lower LDR, and much lower deposit costs than when we entered the last up cycle. When you add that all up, we are confident that our deposit base will be meaningfully lower than the prior cycle. Moving on to credit on slide 11, we saw excellent credit results again this quarter.\nNet charge-offs were broadly stable at 14 basis points for the fourth quarter, with good performance across the portfolio. Non-performing loans decreased 6% linked quarter, with continued improvement in commercial. Other credit metrics continued to improve as criticized loans were lower, and internal ratings upgrades exceeded downgrades. Moving to slide 12, we maintained excellent balance sheet strength. Our CET1 ratio remained strong at 9.9% at the end of the fourth quarter after returning $360 million in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and closing the JMP acquisition. On the bottom right of the page, we expect a 22 basis point impact to CET1 from the pending HSBC acquisition, and the ISBC transaction will be effectively neutral given the stock to be issued in the deal.\nShifting gears towards business strategy a bit, we thought it would be useful to have Brendan and Don discuss some of the exciting strategic initiatives that we have underway, and how we are poised for strong and sustainable growth. Brendan, over to you.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, John. Good morning, everybody. On slide 13, you can see we've dramatically transformed the consumer bank since the IPO and have a strong foundation to propel us into the future. Let me share a few highlights. We're acquiring customers at a pace that far exceeds the pace of household formation in the US, nearly doubling our customer base from approximately $3 million at the time of our IPO to $6.4 million today. Further, our mobile engagement is up 15% year-over-year, closing gaps to peers and allowing us to thin our physical network by another 8% this year, about 20% since our IPO. This enables us to reinvest in growth strategies. We've built one of the most diversified consumer lending businesses in the US, giving us a number of additional levers for revenue growth and customer deepening that many of our peer banks lack.\nWe've transformed our deposit book, repositioning our deposit mix quite significantly with strong DDA growth, which has really driven down our cost of funds by about 75% compared with the time of our IPO. While we have more work to do, our wealth business has been repositioned for growth, and our AUM is more than three times the size at the time of the IPO. Five years ago, we were very much a traditional regional-only bank. We have strong momentum in the business, have broadly caught up with peers, and in a number of places have built best-in-market capabilities that have led to differentiated growth rates. Moving on to slide 14, and looking forward, we've prioritized several strategic initiatives that should help us deliver above-trend revenue growth, adding about $1 billion by year five.\nFirst, we expect to leverage our acquisitions in the New York Metro market to grow share and deepen relationships. We will pick up almost 1 million new customers who have been underserved, given that their current banks do not have the breadth of product capabilities that we have. There is strong upside if we can replicate in New York what we have done in our core markets like Philadelphia and Boston. The second area is wealth, where we have a great opportunity as well. We've recently attracted a new and strong leadership team with a long track record of industry success. Our regional footprint, and our bank customer base, is highly attractive and provides significant opportunity for sustained growth. Third, our Citizens Pay offering is unique amongst all the industry players in the fast-growing buy now, pay later space.\nWe were early movers in this space, starting with the Apple partnership in 2015. We built a very strong position, now with 44 partners. We've added industry verticals, and have remained focused on gaining marquee partners, providing good momentum, and with a strong pipeline for 2022. Lastly, our national push will be led by our digital capabilities, including our efforts to build on the Citizens Access launch in 2018 and the integration of our full range of products and services on a modern cloud-based platform. We'll continue to add products to the platform in 2022, and we'll aim to drive improved customer deepening. We will also leverage this strategy to accelerate our technology transformation of our core bank, as we ultimately aim to converge the operating platforms into one national digital-first structure. Now, let me pass it over to Don.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, good stuff, Brendan. Let me shift to our commercial priorities, which are on slide 15. We've added some great talent to the commercial bank on both the coverage side, as well as the product side, and we're able to do more for our customers over their life cycle than ever before. We've been near the top of the middle market league tables, helping corporate clients and private equity sponsors access capital through private and public debt and equity markets, and we've integrated our cash management and global market solutions well with our coverage teams. On the coverage side, we've been expanding geographically and moving up market into the mid-corporate space, where it is critical to deliver deep industry expertise. Our JMP acquisition, which closed late last year, gives us a much broader and deeper corporate finance coverage in technology, healthcare, and financial services.\nPlus, we gain an equities business that is very well-run, focused, and highly regarded, and we're already seeing great cross-sell dividends off of it. As non-bank lenders continue to take lending market share from banks, and private equity ownership of companies continue to increase, we've broadened our capabilities to better compete successfully in the new landscape. We will increasingly generate more fee revenue across our customer base, given these expanded capabilities. It's also worth noting that Willamette, the transaction we closed mid-last year, dramatically expands our valuation services business with a very prestigious outfit. This capability is highly synergistic with our M&A and broader capital markets effort, and has annuity-like qualities. You can see the success we've had in building and scaling up our businesses to deliver more than just traditional banking products to our clients.\nWe are highly confident this list will continue to drive sustainable and growing revenue streams. Over to you, John.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nThanks, Don. On slide 16, you'll see some examples of the tremendous progress we've made against the key strategic initiatives that Brendan and Don mentioned, and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make Citizens a great place to work. We are very excited to see how our digital-first approach is increasing engagement with our customers, and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction. Moving to slide 17, I'll touch on our top programs. Even as we pivot to offense with our strategic initiatives and acquisitions, it is important to remember that a key to Citizens' success since their IPO has been our continuous effort to realize efficiencies and reinvest these savings back into our businesses, so we can serve customers better.\nWe've effectively wrapped up our top six program after achieving our targeted pre-tax run rate benefits of approximately $425 million at the end of 2021. Now, we have launched top seven with a goal of an exit run rate of about $100 million of pre-tax benefits by the end of 2022. We are really doubling back to mine areas where we have already been successful. For example, continuing our multi-year journey of digital transformation across consumer and commercial, looking at further organizational streamlining, accelerating and building on our next-gen tech initiatives, and doing more in the cloud. We're going to focus on maturing our agile operating model, and take another look at our vendor spend as well. Based on the work we've done so far, we feel confident that we can deliver on this new program.\nMoving to slide 18, we made a lot of progress on the ESG front last year, and we will continue to make meaningful progress in 2022. A few highlights were the launch of a new green deposits program to allow corporate clients to direct their cash reserves towards companies and projects that are expected to create a positive environmental impact. We adopted targets to meaningfully reduce our scope one and scope two greenhouse gas emissions. We have a strong commitment to social equity, and our colleagues continue a tradition of being highly focused on volunteering in our communities. To serve our clients better, we introduced new deposit account features that help customers avoid unexpected overdraft fees, and we immediately saw changes that indicate a meaningful improvement in customer experience. This should help attract and keep more customers with the bank.\nNow for some high-level commentary on the outlook for full year 2022 on slide 19. First, let me be clear that this is a standalone outlook that includes JMP and Willamette, which closed late last year, but does not include any benefit from our pending acquisitions of HSBC and Investors. The bottom left corner of the page includes information that should help if you are trying to also layer in the expected contribution from these acquisitions in 2022. For 2022, we expect NII to be up 3% to 5%, driven primarily by mid-single-digit average loan growth. Excluding PPP, we expect NII to grow high single digits, driven by high single-digit average loan growth. Average interest-earning assets are expected to be up slightly as excess liquidity is deployed into loan growth.\nThe rate scenario used in our outlook is based on the forward curve as of 5 January 2022 and includes three implied Fed rate hikes of 25 basis points each in April, July, and December. On the long end, we are planning for the 10-year treasury to be about 1.9% by the end of the year. The rate curve benefit on net interest margin will allow us to be, excuse me, to allow us to be to more than offset the 2022 impacts from lower PPP forgiveness and swap revenue while presenting meaningful upside to NIM in 2023 and beyond. Fee income is expected to be up 4% to 7% given continued strength in capital markets and wealth following record performances in 2021.\nNon-interest expense is expected to be up 5% to 6% given the full-year effect of our commercial fee-based acquisitions, or up less than 3% excluding the impact of these acquisitions. We have included an expense walk on slide 24 that lays out the drivers. Credit is expected to remain excellent, with net charge-offs broadly stable to down slightly, and provision expense less than net charge-offs. We plan to continue operating with a CET1 ratio within our targeted range of 9.75% to 10%, which incorporates an anticipated increase in our dividend in the second half of the year. On the lower left of the slide, you'll see our expectations for the pro forma impact of HSBC and Investors, with EPS accretion of about 5% based on consensus at the time of announcement and approximately $475 million in additional PP&R to our 2022 results.\nImportantly, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage of approximately 2% on an underlying basis for the year, including HSBC and Investors. If you set aside the impact of PPP, that would be a very strong 5% operating leverage. Moving to slide 20, I'll cover the outlook for the first quarter. We expect NII to be down about 1% despite solid loan growth given a $20 million smaller contribution from PPP and an $18 million impact from lower day count. Including the impact from HSBC, NII will be broadly stable for the quarter. Average loans are expected to be up 2% to 3% with interest-earning assets broadly stable. Fees are expected to be down 8% to 12%, reflecting seasonally lower capital markets fees than the record we delivered last quarter, as well as other seasonal impacts.\nNon-interest expense is expected to be up approximately 6% given seasonal compensation impacts and the full quarter impact of the JMP acquisition. Net charge-offs are expected to be broadly stable with provision less than net charge-offs. We expect our CET1 ratio to land at around 9.75%, including an impact of about 22 basis points from the HSBC transaction, which we expect to close mid-quarter. To sum up with slide 21, we feel that we finished 2021 with a great quarter and entered 2022 with strong momentum. We have a winning strategy. We are building capabilities organically and through acquisitions that deliver value to our customers and growth for our shareholders. Our strong leadership team will continue to focus on execution and building a top-performing bank. With that, I'll hand it back over to Bruce.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay, thank you, John. Operator, let's open it up for some Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. Van Saun. We are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call. If you'd like to ask a question, press one, then zero on your touch-tone phone. You'll hear an indication you've been placed into the queue, and you may remove yourself from the queue by repeating the one, then zero command. Should you be on a speakerphone, we ask you to please pick up your handset and to make certain your phone is unmuted before pressing any buttons. Again, for questions, press one, then zero. Your first question will come from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open now.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nAnalyst, Wedbush Securities\n\nGood morning. I had a question. One thing I hear from investors is the potential for deal risk noise just between the HSBC and Investors Bancorp, and then also the investors' loan mix being heavy in commercial real estate. The question is, is there a need to remix the loan portfolio at Investors and lead to some near-term revenue headwinds and just potential volatility closing both deals in the first half of the year?\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nLet me start, and John, you can jump in. It's Bruce, Peter. I think we're working really well and hard to make sure that these deals come off very smoothly. Customers have a good experience, and we can introduce our approach to banking right off the bat and take advantage of, I think, some really great synergy opportunities. We've set up a separate integration office. We've had outside help helping us through and put dedicated teams to make sure that we get off to a good start. I don't really see any disruption from the smoothness of operations. I think that'll come off very, very well. We're monitoring the performance of both businesses, and they seem to be performing to our expectations, so that's also a good fact. We will end up taking on more commercial real estate exposure when Investors closes.\nHowever, most of that is in multifamily, and the kind of risk of that portfolio is relatively modest in terms on the spectrum of commercial real estate risk. I think we'll look to grow our other loan categories faster over time, which will bring kind of that exposure back into more alignment of where a targeted balance sheet would be. We don't think there'll be any need to do any dramatic surgery or anything that would disrupt the momentum that we have in loan growth. I'll stop there. John, if you want to add anything to that.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I think that's well said. I would just add that as it relates to the operational side of things, we've had a number of mock conversions and dress rehearsals that have gone extremely well. The last one is, I think, next weekend. We're right on schedule for HSBC for that closing conversion in the middle of February. That's really sort of well handled, and we're deep into the planning on Investors as well, planning for legal day one, planning for customer day one, planning for conversion. Those plans are also well in sight and appear well able to be executed. On the balance sheet aspects that Bruce mentioned, just reemphasizing our front book originations will look different than the back book.\nThe back book has the multifamily loan portfolio, as Bruce Van Saun indicated, but that front book is going to have a lot more C&I, and a lot more consumer lending going forward than Investors has had in the past. I'll go ahead and leave it there.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nAnalyst, Wedbush Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks. Very helpful. If I could just ask, John, I'm wondering, could you quantify the impact to net interest income for every 25 basis point rate hike, and what you're assuming for the deposit betas?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll go ahead and talk about that. I mean, I think we are highly asset-sensitive, and that's built into the guide for NII for 2022 based on the 5 January curve. I mean, as you know, since then, the curve has increased a fair bit as of just looking at it where things ended up yesterday. There's more upside in 2022 if the rate environment continues to unfold as we're seeing it in the last several days. As it relates to the actual sensitivity, the way that shakes out is that on the short, we're mostly sensitive to the short end, and that'll drive about $20 million if there's an extra 25 basis points on top of the forward curves.\nAs of 5 January, we'll generate another $20 million per quarter on the short end, and we'll get another $10 to 15 million per quarter on the long end versus the 5 January forward curve for an overall $30 to 35 million per quarter of additional benefit if you have 25 basis points across.\nIt's a parallel shift.\nYeah, on a parallel shift up from the Jan 5 curve. As it relates to deposit betas, I mean, this is a very exciting story. I mean, we've completely transformed the deposit franchise since the IPO. I would say that, as I mentioned in my remarks, I think that our deposit betas are going to be meaningfully lower in this next cycle. Of course, as you start off the cycle, there's a lag, and we've got that lag built in, but we also have some betas built in. I would say that the 2022 betas at the beginning of this cycle are going to be much lower than the betas that we experienced at the beginning of the rate rise cycle last time around, given all the investments we've made in product capability, in pricing, and approach, and with the added lever of Citizens Access.\nWe're really excited about being able to demonstrate the strength of the deposit franchise in this cycle going forward.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Just to quantify that a little bit, if you look at the last move up 2% on Fed funds and then you compare it, if that happened today, we'd probably be 1/3 less in terms of our deposit betas than we were last time around.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nExactly.\n\nPeter Winter\n\nAnalyst, Wedbush Securities\n\nOkay, thanks very much.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Ken Usdan with Jefferies. Go ahead, please.\n\nKen Usdan\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning, guys. Thank you for the detail on the merger updates and the timelines. Just wondering, can you just give us a sense of at what point do you expect to get both converted? Do you have an understanding of when you think you'll get to kind of full run rate cost saves from the combination of HSBC and ISBC?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, I'll go ahead and start. As it relates to we're targeting to the end of 2023 when we'll have substantially all the synergies done. As I mentioned, we're going to close and convert HSBC here in February. The expectation is our target is to close Investors in early first quarter, early April. I would say the way to think about conversion is that that's not going to be a big bang approach. We're going to see that conversions happen on a staged and phased basis throughout 2022. Assuming we close in early April, we'll see a couple of platforms close throughout 2022 and into the end of 2022. There could be some stragglers into the early part of 2023. Again, it's not going to be a big bang. We're going to move certain platforms over as they become ready to go.\nI think, as an example, mortgage and wealth are two platforms that will go early, and the overall core would happen later. Maybe I'll just turn it over to others if they want to add any color to that.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI think that's right, John.\n\nKen Usdan\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. My second question is just I know you've said very clearly that you wouldn't expect to update capital targets and such until you reach your medium-term goals. I'm just wondering, how should we be thinking about share purchase in terms of getting through closings and any anticipations you have about anticipating this year's CCAR process with you getting back into it in 2022?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nI'll just start off. As you may know, I mean, we've talked about the CCAR, our capital priorities start off with the dividend, supporting organic growth, and fee-based bolt-ons. We want to put capital to work in that manner. To the extent that those opportunities leave some capital around, then we engage in buybacks, which we did this past quarter for Q4 as we articulated in our remarks. I mean, I think we're coming into CCAR season, and we tend to, on an annual basis, take another look at capital targets and what the trajectory of capital return will be. We also have the deals that are pending, so I think you'll get a, we can be a little bit more, sort of give another update on that as you get into the first quarter call.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Ken, just from a technical standpoint, we had an authorization to buy back $750 million of our stock, and we've used about $300 million of that to date. We have $450 million left for this year, which should give us plenty of running room. When we get through CCAR, you might see us do an adjustment to that. Anyway, that's a little bit of the framework that we're operating under.\n\nKen Usdan\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. Okay, thanks, guys.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nMorning.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMorning.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nJust on the loan trends, clearly, the commercial trends came in very solid and better than expected. I just want to see if you can give us a little more granularity on where you're really seeing that strength and the drivers. I know you mentioned deal financing. Are you seeing CapEx plans start to drive some drawdowns there? Separately, just in terms of the end-of-period loan balances, it looks like there are a few billion above the average balances. Therefore, are the end-of-period balances a good leading indicator into outlook as we model this out?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nMaybe I'll just start off, and Don can weigh in here. I mean, I think, as we mentioned, corporate banking, subscription line finance, and asset-backed lending all contributed, and it has been an excellent quarter. There is momentum with spot balances higher than average. That's right, John. I would say when you split it out, we are seeing last quarter, we saw a tick up in utilization from our sort of bread and butter corporate banking clients. This quarter, we saw another tick up in that sense. A lot of the increase was driven by deal financing, but we are seeing some underlying tick up, maybe 50 basis points last quarter, another 50 or so this quarter. Maybe I'll just turn it over to Don to add any additional.\n\nDon McCree\n\nHead of Commercial Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, no, I think that's right. I think the big macro is our origination volumes are just huge, record quarter on quarter on quarter. They've been offset by payoffs as people have gone to the capital markets, or, in particular, real estate. A lot of properties are trading, so we're being taken out of loans due to underlying property sales. We're really encouraged by what we're seeing on the origination side. The subscription line business that we have is really going quite well, and it's growing quite quickly. Some of the deal financing that happened in the fourth quarter will be refinanced out in the capital markets probably, which is good for us because we'll participate in that. We think the trend continues. The other thing that we are seeing is a lot of activity in our real estate business on the origination side.\nWe're seeing quite a bit of warehousing, quite a bit of industrial, quite a bit of life sciences, and then increasingly build-to-suit office, believe it or not. Investment-grade corporates building new office space to occupy post-pandemic. In terms of working capital and CapEx and things like that, it's really hard to kind of discern how quickly that's going to happen. You've got the new supply chain challenges, you've got some of the labor challenges, you've got some of the international countries shutting down. It's kind of fits and starts, but we think it feels pretty good to us overall.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. Thanks. Bruce, just a question from a higher level. I know you've certainly been acquisitive here in adding to your business both on the banking side as well as cap markets. Could you just talk about, from the banking perspective, the need for scale and the whole debate that do you need scale to be able to compete effectively? More specifically, do you think ultimately you need a national franchise? Thanks.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure. I like our size, John. I think we have enough scale that we can compete against all comers. We have to be extremely disciplined, we have to prioritize well, and we have to leverage external parties, our principal core application vendors. We have a lot of partnerships with fintechs, but we do a really good job there, and we're moving the company to be a digital-first bank. I like the progress there. One of the advantages you have if you're not super big, you're not in the mega bank weight class, is that you can be more nimble, you can move faster, and you can stay focused on the things that really matter. Scale does help to some degree. Doing this New York Metro play and picking up another $30 billion of assets, I think, is a positive.\nWe don't feel compelled to have to run out and do more deals to stay competitive. Was there a second part of your question, John?\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nWell, it was just, do you believe you need a national presence including some bread and butter?\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOh, that's right. Yeah. I think we have a pretty unique opportunity because we have a deposit franchise that's national with Citizens Access. We do have consumer lending activities that are national. We've basically gone to market in kind of a product siloed fashion without a fully comprehensive platform that allows us to deliver a full range of products and services to customers. That's been really our focus, and we've put it under the umbrella of national expansion. We think there's a really good opportunity to migrate to a cloud-based digital platform that delivers great customer experience, then leverage that to target specific, very highly specific customer segments where we think we have a right to win. When we look at what we do really well in our regional core footprint, that's mass affluent customers, particularly young professionals. We have a great offering there.\nIt starts with our student loan refinance product, and we've wrapped a bunch of things around that. We think we can target that segment around the country once we pull this all together and make some real headway. What goes with that is, right now, we're largely all digital with that national play. We will pick up some branches in the Washington, DC area when HSBC closes, and some in South Florida. That'll give us an opportunity to go digital first into those markets, combined with a light physical presence, and do some test and learning, because there may be other attractive cities around the country where we have a concentration of customers or colleague base.\nWe have more brand visibility where we might decide to open some branches and then see how that could augment our push to really attract those customers and gain primacy with those customers. A lot to play out on this, but it's very exciting. I don't know, Brendan, if you want to add anything to that.\nWell, Fed, I guess I just the color as that ties into scale for me is, while we don't feel like we are required to get scale, I think the digital-first world is providing an opportunity to scale distinctively with revenue. In my opening remarks as part of our call script, you see us going from 3 million customers to 6 million customers since our IPO. I would argue that in a pre-digital world, that was not possible without M&A activity. We've got a demonstrated track record of scaling our consumer business organically. That's what you should think about as we bring together all our product capabilities nationally, is how do we get scale and provide distinctive revenue opportunity without necessarily needing to do a big M&A acquisition. We have confidence we can do that.\nObviously, we're supplementing that with HSBC and Investors, but really, we think we can get great customer growth and deepening organically. The big question is, do you need physical presence over time, what does that physical presence look like, and can you run it with a thin network, to Bruce's point around piloting in Washington, DC and Florida, and then potentially other markets over time? All paths lead to the next 18 months or so of really building out our exceptional mobile-first digital platform nationally, and then we can start to think through our distribution opportunities over time.\n\nJohn Pancari\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nOkay, great. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Go ahead, please.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGood morning, John. Good morning, Bruce.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nHey, Gerard.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nBruce, I share your bullishness on the outlook for the industry and you folks as well. You presented it very well today. At the same time, we're always looking over our shoulders. When you guys sit around the conference room table to talk about the outlook, what are some of the risks that you have identified that maybe could kind of delay or interrupt this bullish outlook?\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. To me, Gerard, it's usually around the macro would be the principal risk. As the macro goes, it certainly has a big impact on bank results. It looks like the kind of OMICRON wave is not as lethal as feared, and it hasn't interrupted business, commerce, and people's behavior as much as it could have, as much as prior waves did. I put that as a tick in the plus column, although you never know what could happen later on over the course of the year. I do think the Fed has a fine balancing act to achieve here in bringing inflation under control. Inflation is really something to be feared, and the Fed is going to aggressively combat that.\nHopefully, they apply the medicine at a good pace with good kind of forewarning, and the market adjusts to that, and it doesn't kind of snuff out the signs of a good recovery. We think that GDP could grow at 4%, but what could happen if the market doesn't respond well to those rate increases or if the equity market falls a bit because of that? That's another thing. I think that the fiscal situation seems stable at this point. It's going to be hard, I think, to pass more legislative initiatives that increase fiscal spend. I think the spend that we have built up from prior rounds of fiscal stimulus is sufficient to carry us through. Anyway, those are some of the things that we watch. I still feel that the fundamental underpinning is very good, and the credit outlook is very good.\nI think there's a strong probability that this turns out to be a good year, but there's always that tail risk that stuff could happen, and that's the thing that we watch carefully.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery good. Thank you for those insights. Just to follow up, John, on the guidance, the non-interest income, I think you highlighted that you expect the mortgage fees in 2022 to be weaker than 2021. Correct me if I'm wrong there, but more than offset by the strength in capital markets. What's your outlook? Because the capital markets number, as you guys pointed out, was extraordinary in the quarter. I assume you're not expecting that to be a run rate, but can you give us some color on what you're looking for in that capital markets line in 2022 versus 2021, and also the mortgage banking fees?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group",
    "content2": "Yeah. I'll start off and turn it over to Don and Brendan if they want to add any further color. I think we had an extraordinary quarter in the fourth quarter taking share and kind of climbing the lead tables. This was a result of multi-year kind of meticulous investments organically, with some fee-based bolt-ons that are coming together and, frankly, haven't really fully achieved its potential in some respects in terms of synergies from the deals that we've done, etc., that are going to contribute in 2022. I'd say that the momentum and the backdrop is still strong. Bruce mentioned that the macro is one of the areas. As long as that keeps going, we do see some very solid momentum in the cap markets business.\nM&A and loan syndications were the leads in Q4, and the pipelines look very good into early 2022 in terms of what we can see there. I'll make a comment on mortgage and then maybe just see if Don and Brendan want to add. I mean, on mortgage, I would say the way to think about that is, yeah, it'll be down, but I still think that given the investments we've made, and the share that we've been able to take, we'll be above pre-pandemic levels. The 2019 base year, I think 2022, you can think of that as being a year where we'll solidify, normalize a bit in terms of volumes. I'd say that maybe the market's down 30%, but our volumes will be down less than that.\nMargins are still a bit under pressure, in particular in the third-party space in production, but that is meaningfully offset by what's going on on the servicing side of the business, where you see continued increase in UPBs for us. As the rate rise is starting to take off here a little bit, you see lower amortization. You put all that together, and you're going to have continued contributions from mortgage that will be greater than pre-pandemic. Maybe I'll just turn it to Don if he has anything else to add.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. My perspective is, assuming the markets stay strong and we expect them to stay strong, think of that as relatively low interest rates, lots of liquidity, and a reasonable economy. That's a great backdrop for continued deals. We saw a lot of things try to run to the finish line in the fourth quarter due to potential changes in tax laws. I have to say our pipelines are as high as they've ever been as we roll into the first quarter, and we expect those to continue to build. The other thing I just give you perspective on is we've got a diversification of revenue streams now in our capital markets business, and that is furthered by JMP, which moves us into the equity business. It's an interesting industry verticals.\nWe have DH Capital, which should close sometime in the first quarter, maybe early second quarter, which will give us incremental opportunities. That's only just beginning to be realized. The thing that's really driving the fee lines is we're playing multiple roles on every transaction. There are lots of transactions now. Not only are we advising, but we're also financing, and we're capturing the wealth business. There's a lot of very good cross-sell, and a lot of value-add for our clients. It feels very strong. I think we've got an increasingly strong reputation with the private equity community, particularly in the middle market space, as we show them these interesting opportunities and we execute well for them. It feels very good.\nWhat the exact number is going to be is very hard to tell, but sitting here in the second week of January, I'm pretty optimistic about what the year is going to look like. Yeah. On mortgage, I'd just add that, obviously, pulling up at a high level, as you all know, mortgage is a natural hedge against the interest rate environment for us. While in many ways, this cycle was a lot like other cycles, the difference is that it was exacerbated significantly. You got a much bigger pop just given how quickly everything came at us in COVID, and you got a steeper decline. Having said that, John's point, we feel much better positioned than pre-COVID levels in 2019.\nI think you'll see in our results in 2022, despite us projecting the MBA and projecting the market down 30%, we should outpace our performance in 2019. That's with the backdrop of margins at historically low levels. I think the question for us is, how much better will we be over time than our 2019 pre-COVID run rates? A lot of that will have to do with how quickly margins renormalize as capacity leaves the system. We're starting to see that now as rates tick up. Lenders are starting to shed capacity. We have not yet seen margins stabilize or certainly turn around, but we expect that to happen at some point. The question is, does that happen in the first half of this year, second half of this year? We'll see.\nWe feel very good that the underlying strength of the business is significantly better than 2019 levels. Okay. Let me just close and give everybody a shot here with a comment to your question, Gerard. If you just think about the long term, amplifying Don's comments about where we're positioned, the commercial bank and capital markets in particular feel really, really good about what we've built out. The secular trends, there's big private equity pools of capital. They're increasing their ownership of US companies, and we're very well positioned to cover those companies and provide services to them. With the big middle market and mid-corporate space that we have, we have an opportunity to connect the intermediation of capital from private equity to corporate America. That's a trend that I think is going to stay in place for a long time.\nWe're extremely well positioned to capture that and drive revenue growth. We like what we've put together, and I think we're still scratching the surface of the potential of really gaining the synergies that come from what we've assembled. To follow up on Brendan's point, it was always important for us to really get a profitable and highly respected and good mortgage business in place because if we want to be in our consumer bank, a trusted advisor on somebody's life journey, the mortgage is an incredibly important product to individuals. We've now accomplished that. We feel good about what we've done in the capital market space and what we've done on the mortgage space. It's been a combination of organic investments as well as inorganic acquisitions.\nThe one place that we're still kind of short of the mark that we haven't moved, so to speak, to the other side of the river and get where we want to get to is in wealth, and it's not for lack of trying. We've made significant organic investments there. We've had one successful acquisition with Clarfeld Advisors, which has gone very, very well. We're still in the hunt to see if we can put more together there to get us where we need to get to.\n\nGerard Cassidy\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat, I appreciate all the insights. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from Terry McEvoy with Stephens. Go ahead, please.\n\nTerry McEvoy\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nA question for John. Could you just update us on the size of Citizens Access and maybe how do you best use that product in a rising interest rate environment? The HSBC online platform, will the conversion there occur on the same pace and same timeline as the bank itself?\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. With respect to the first question on Citizens Access, yeah, we're in that kind of $4.5 to 5 billion range. Most of that is we've had some runoff in terms of the CD book.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIntentional.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, intentionally. Yeah. I mean, when we went out with that, that was a balanced approach in terms of savings and CD offer, and that was extremely successful in the third quarter of 2018 and has really served us well. We're building on that platform. We've launched a national storefront on the back of that platform where we've added the ability to start bundling mortgage and education loans in that storefront when you log on to Citizens Access. Over time, that will be, again, a big driver of how we are distinctive with our deposit offerings and being able to broaden out that product set. The second half of the question was on HSBC.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nHSBC coming across and timing.\n\nJohn Woods\n\nCFO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. That timing is mid-February. We feel really good about that. I think that's almost $8 billion of deposits in the middle of February. That's going to add a lot of cash to where we are at the end of the first quarter. That should be thought of, though, in the context of the Investors acquisition, where we looked at those deals as one sort of entry into the New York Metro, not just strategically, but also financially. When you put those two banks together, that's around an 80% or so LDR combined profile. Those deposits are there to be thought of in the context of the overall Investors and HSBC acquisition.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. Brendan, maybe you could just kind of carve out the online aspect of HSBC because that was another thing that really was intriguing when we had the opportunity to buy that business.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah, absolutely. It does help us further accelerate our national scale with our online deposit platform. To the question, the timing on the online integration will be the same exact timing as the core branch network acquisition in mid-February; that will all happen together. There are a few small differences with the HSBC online platform from our Citizens Access. One is that the interest rates are actually a lot lower. They are at 15 basis points versus our Citizens Access is at 40 basis points. One of the reasons why they are a little bit lower is that a handful of those customers have some minor connectivity to their physical channels. We are maintaining that and making sure the customers have access to our new distribution footprint where they happen to be in our franchise.\nYou can start to see the physical and digital worlds coming together in this strategy. We view this as a significant accelerant to our national expansion plans and it provides a great pool of customers for us to ultimately deepen with. To John's point, we've expanded the storefront with mortgage and student loan refinancing. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're going to add more products over the course of 2022. This is fertile ground for revenue growth that we did not put into our deal model.\n\nTerry McEvoy\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nThank you. Just a quick follow-up. Can you just remind us the impact on service charges and fees in 2022 expected from the rollout of the Citizens Peace of Mind product, the Citizens Peace of Mind?\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nYeah. I can tell you that. The way to really think about this is opportunity cost of not re-inflated. The Peace of Mind program really is a 24-hour grace. It's a third or fourth move we've made, in addition to a handful of other moves, including a student account that is completely protected from overdraft. We've got a $5 overdraft pass, we've got a once-a-year oops automatic forgiveness for customers in certain products, and now we've introduced Peace of Mind, which is essentially a 24-hour grace period and a great customer experience for all of our customers to empower them to avoid unnecessary fees. We think the payback on this is quite strong. It'll be about year three where we break even and turn the corner for the revenue benefits to offset the fee shortfall that we're giving up.\nReally, we expect the overdraft line to be flattish going forward. It would have cost us, we would have been able to get a pop of, call it, $8 to 10 million a quarter at a normalized market where stimulus benefits burn down. We think it's the right thing to do.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nAbout a $40 million opportunity.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nIt's about a $40 million opportunity cost annually. That more than offsets over time with revenue benefits. To John's comment, we've already seen significant early indicators of positivity coming from our customer base. Call center and complaint volume are down about 40% in this category. Our NPS score, particularly with under 40 aged customers, has really started to increase right away. We just rolled this out in October. We're very, very pleased about it, about the early behavioral impacts from our customer base.\n\nTerry McEvoy\n\nManaging Director, Stephens\n\nGreat. Thanks, everyone.\n\nBrendan Coughlin\n\nHead of Consumer Banking, Citizens Financial Group\n\nSure.\n\nBruce Saun\n\nChairman and CEO, Citizens Financial Group\n\nOkay. It looks like that's the end of the queue here for Q&A. I know it's a busy day with other banks reporting, but once again, I want to thank everybody for dialing in today. We appreciate your interest and your support. Have a great day. Everybody stay well. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat will conclude your TeleConference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event TeleConferencing. You may now disconnect.\n\nKristin Silberberg\n\nEVP Investor Relations, Citizens Financial Group\n\nWe're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, [ Kate Walsh], Director, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. [ Walsh], you may begin.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nWelcome to the third quarter earnings conference call for ADM. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast.\nSome of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation and the materials. Unless otherwise required by law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements due to new information or future events. In addition, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings press release and presentation slides, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the ADM website. I will now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Kate. Hello, and welcome to all who have joined the call. Please turn to Slide 4.\nToday, ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 and total segment operating profit of $845 million for the third quarter. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 6.7%, and cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $2.1 billion year-to-date. With a challenging industry-wide operating environment, we remain flexible adapting plans were needed, taking action on what it is in our control and investing for long-term growth.\nA key part of this dynamic environment relates to the status of highly anticipated U.S. biofuel policy. We believe progress on this front will drive significant biofuel and renewable diesel demand and lead to elevated pricing, volumes and margins across several of our key operating areas, which we expect will set up a constructive environment over the long run.\nBut based on the current short-term environment, our AS&O business is significantly impacted. Against this backdrop, we have made good progress with our self-help agenda. We made the strides in improving our plant efficiency. We've entered into numerous strategic transactions, which advance our portfolio optimization objectives and we are accomplishing cost savings through several targeted streamlining initiatives.\nThese actions have generated robust cash flow this quarter and strengthen our business going forward. Our strong balance sheet, driven by a disciplined capital allocation process give us flexibility to invest for growth and continue to return value to shareholders. Following our second quarter earnings call, we announced our 375th consecutive quarterly dividend.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Let me share some specific examples of how our team continues to drive simplification, optimization and execution excellence across our segments through our self-help agenda.\nFor our services and oilseeds, results for the third quarter were sequentially in line and aligned to the expectations we set out in our second quarter earnings call. The team continued to focus on operational excellence which was reflected in [ crush ] volumes increasing 2.6% sequentially and 2.2% compared to the third quarter of last year, [ a dating ] a lower-than-expected margin environment.\nOur Ag Services subsegment executed a robust export program during the quarter, supported by strong corn and [ meal ] programs. We achieved the best total export volume for the month of September since 2016, which helped offset some of the weakness we experienced in our crush business.\nFor carbohydrate solutions, the business delivered sequentially steady results overall with lower global demand for sweeteners and starches, offset by strength in ethanol pricing and exports. We achieved a key milestone in our decarbonization strategy connecting our Columbus, Nebraska dry corn mill plant into Tallgrass [ driblazer ] CO2 pipeline and are commencing CO2 injections. This marks the second ADM facility that is reducing its carbon footprint by CO2 sequestration.\nAnd for Nutrition, the team drove another quarter of sequential improvement, led by our flavors and animal nutrition portfolios. Flavors North America achieved record quarterly revenue in the third quarter and Flavors internationally recently won a notable contract that is connected to a deep AS&O customer relationship. We're engaging directly with major customers of AS&O and carbohydrate solutions on our Nutrition portfolio, highlighting the power of our interconnected value chain.\nOur Specialty Ingredients subsegment is expected to benefit from [ dedicator ] is plant being back online and consistently producing [ white flake]. During the quarter, we announced network simplification in Specialty Ingredients to streamline our production footprint, and we expect results to improve as this takes hold and we build back our third-party sales business.\nWithin our Animal Nutrition portfolio, our turnaround continues to deliver better results with more progress to come. In Q3, we announced plans for a North American animal feed joint venture with [ Altec ] to further transition our Animal Nutrition business into higher-margin specialty ingredients, and we expect this JV to commence operations in 2026.\nThrough these efforts and several other initiatives we have undertaken this year, we remain on track to achieve our targeted $200 million to $300 million in cost savings in 2025 as well as our aggregate cost savings of $500 million to $750 million over the next 3 to 5 years.\nStrong cash management allows us to continue to invest in areas of innovation where we see attractive growth potential. For example, we are developing the next generation of Flavor systems for our growing energy drinks portfolio. Our cutting-edge energy emulsion technology provides enhanced product stability consistent quality and a simplified supply chain. Additionally, there is a strong demand momentum behind our natural colors portfolio and we are exploring accretive opportunities to expand both products and geographies in this business.\nAnother area of attractive growth for us is postbiotics, where ADM is investing in innovation. Recently, we were honored with an innovation award at a global premier trade event for our proprietary post biotic formulation designed to support human immunity and digestive wellness. We also launched our second pet-focused postbiotic. These are examples of the diverse in-house research and development expertise we've developed in the biotic space.\nWe're also underway with advancing ethanol production performance improvements. Through close collaboration between R&D and operations, we've implemented advancements that are delivering improved yield gains, rollout to additional plants is in progress and further enhancements are in testing designed to drive ongoing optimization across our facilities.\nWe're also investing in [ size ] stream valorization as part of our continuous efforts to optimize our production processes and add value to our byproducts. As we close out 2025, we will continue to action our self-help agenda while adapting to evolving trade policy and remaining flexible to offset the impact of challenging dynamics to the best of our ability.\nGiven the deferral in U.S. biofuel policy and other global movements, it is difficult to predict the timing of when we will see a structural increase in biofuel demand. The result were lower in our expectations for full year 2025. We now expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $3.25 to $3.50, down from the approximately $4 per share as we discussed last quarter. Monish will review this in more detail.\nOverall, the recent progress with the trade deal with China, coupled with our expectation of gaining U.S. biofuel policy clarity within the next several weeks or months, is an encouraging setup for next year. We expect 2026 will offer a more constructive environment for both the industry and the American farmer, and that should create both positive economic opportunities and drive additional long-term investments throughout our business and the agricultural sector.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Monish to share a deeper dive into third quarter financial results and our full year 2025 outlook.\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6.\nAS&O segment operating profit for the third quarter was $379 million, down 21% compared to the prior year quarter. The deferral of U.S. biofuel policy and the evolving global trade landscape continued to impact demand for AS&O, primarily in our crushing and refined products businesses.\nIn the Ag Services subsegment, operating profit was $190 million, representing an increase of 78% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher export activity in North America with support from our operations in South America.\nSouth America improved year-over-year as the prior year quarter was negatively impacted by higher costs related to logistics take-or-pay contracts. Additionally, there were net positive timing impact of approximately $54 million year-over-year.\nIn the crushing subsegment, operating profit was $13 million, down 93% from the prior year quarter. Both global soybean and canola crush execution margins was significantly lower than the prior year quarter. Both soybean and canola crush margins were down more significantly in North America, driven by global trade evolution and reduced biofuel production.\nThere were net positive timing impacts of approximately $41 million in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the prior year quarter, partially offsetting the net timing benefit year-over-year for insurance proceeds of $24 million in the prior year quarter.\nIn the Refined Products and Other subsegment, operating profit was $120 million, down 3% compared to the prior year quarter as positive timing impacts helped offset lower biodiesel and refining margins. There were net positive timing impact of approximately $12 million year-over-year.\nEquity earnings from our investment in Wilmar were $56 million for the quarter, down 10% compared to the prior year quarter and excluding specified items. We typically record our share of Wilmar's financial results on a 3-month lag basis with the exception of material transaction or events that occur during the intervening period that materially affect the financial position or results of operations. During the third quarter, we recorded a $163 million charge related to the penalty imposed on Wilmar by the Indonesian Supreme Court and for our AS&O segment, have presented this as a specified items.\nTurning now to Slide 7. For the third quarter, Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $336 million, down 26% compared to the prior year quarter. In the Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, operating profit was $293 million, down 36% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to a decline in global S&S demand, which impacted both volumes and margins. This is a continuation of consumer buying trends we have been experiencing throughout 2025, with softness in demand in sweeteners and a reduction in starches demand primarily from less consumption of packaged goods and corrugated paper.\nAdditionally, in EMEA, S&S volumes and margins continue to be impacted by persistent high corn costs related to crop quality issues we discussed in the last quarter. Global wheat milling margins and volumes were fairly stable in the third quarter relative to the prior year quarter. Additionally, the prior quarter benefited from approximately $45 million of insurance proceeds. In the Vantage Corn Processor subsegment, operating profit was $43 million, up from a $3 million loss in the prior year quarter, driven by strong export activity, coupled with industry downtime for scheduled maintenance, decreased ethanol inventory stocks and strengthened pricing. Overall, ethanol EBITDA margins per gallon for the quarter were approximately double, and the volumes were roughly flat compared to the prior year quarter.\nNow turning to Slide 8. In the third quarter, Nutrition segment revenues were $1.9 billion, up 5% compared to the prior year quarter, including foreign exchange gains that accounted for approximately 2% of the increase. Human Nutrition revenue increased by 6% and the Animal Nutrition revenue increased by 3% compared to the prior year quarter.\nForeign exchange gains accounted for approximately 2% of the increase in human nutrition revenue and approximately 1% of the increase in Animal Nutrition revenue. Nutrition segment operating profit was $130 million for the third quarter, up 24% compared to the prior year quarter. Human Nutrition operating profit was $96 million, up 12% compared to the prior year quarter as a result of strong flavors growth and an uptick in biotic demand.\nThe third quarter of 2024 also benefited from approximately $25 million of insurance proceeds as compared to $10 million in the third quarter of 2025. Animal Nutrition operating profit was $34 million for the quarter, up 79% compared to the prior quarter as a result of the combination of an increased focus on higher-margin product lines, disciplined cost control and progress with ongoing portfolio streamlining initiatives.\nTurning now to Slide 9. The strength of the ADM model is that we generate strong cash flow through multiple commodity cycles. For the first 9 months of the year, ADM generated cash flow from operations before working capital of approximately $2.1 billion, down by $254 million relative to the prior year quarter as a result of lower overall total segment operating profit.\nWe continue to maintain a solid cash position and have made good progress in improving our working capital efficiency. For example, we reduced inventory by $3.2 billion year-to-date compared to $1.2 billion during the prior year period, largely driven by sharpening our inventory management practices. We continue to be very disciplined in the areas in which we invest.\nDuring the first 9 months of 2025, we invested $892 million and maintain our expectations of full year 2025 CapEx to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, we have distributed $743 million in dividends.\nThe last point I'll mention on this slide is that our net leverage ratio as of the end of September was 1.8x, improved from last quarter and in line with our previously communicated year-end target ratio of approximately 2x.\nNow turning to Slide 10. We have provided details on our revised 2025 outlook. Earlier today, as Juan mentioned, we revised our full year 2025 adjusted EPS expectations. Taking into account our year-to-date results and the continued softness primarily in crush margins, we now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.50 per share for full year 2025, down from the approximate $4 per share guide we provided during our second quarter earnings.\nI will now provide some color on several assumptions that are underpinning our revised guidance range. First, with our self-help agenda, we remain on track to deliver between $200 million to $300 million in cost savings for 2025. Second, for AS&O, as we have previously discussed, as we move through each quarter, we increasingly lock in our book of business for the upcoming quarter.\nBased on the portion of our business already booked plus our view of the market, we are expecting continued softness in global soybean crush margins which is a step down from our expectations last quarter when we were expecting global soybean margins to be in the range of approximately $60 to $70 per metric ton.\nOur Ag Services subsegment is expected to benefit from the robust harvest season we are having in North America. But given trade dynamics, results are projected to be weaker than we had forecasted at the time of our second quarter earnings. And the team will continue to progress our advancements related to plant up time, manufacturing efficiencies and working capital improvement. We expect insurance proceeds of $10 million in the fourth quarter as compared to $50 million in the prior year quarter.\nThirdly, for carbohydrate solutions, on the Sweeteners and Starches front, we expect a continuation of the same pressure from softer demand trends that we have experienced throughout 2025 and expect high corn costs to persist in EMEA.\nEthanol export flows are projected to drive similar sequential demand throughout the fourth quarter. However, margins are expected to be lower than the highs we experienced during third quarter. Ethanol EBITDA margins for fourth quarter 2025 are expected to be roughly 10% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024 EBITDA margin. We expect insurance proceeds of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to approximately $40 million in the prior year quarter.\nAnd lastly, for our Nutrition segment, we continue to take action on our portfolio optimization and are making sequential progress in network streamlining and cost improvements. In Human Nutrition, Flavors typically experience seasonal softness in the fourth quarter given our product concentration in the beverage categories. This is expected to be partially offset by improvement in Specialty Ingredients now that our Decatur East plant is returning to planned utilization rates.\nIn Animal Nutrition, we will continue to pursue our ongoing turnaround action, which includes a transition into higher-margin specialty ingredients. We expect insurance proceeds of approximately $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter. Insurance proceeds at the segment level for fourth quarter 2025 are expected to be funded roughly half by a captive insurer and half by third parties as compared to third parties funding the vast majority of insurance proceeds in the prior year quarter.\nAs Juan mentioned, we have continued to make good progress on our self-help agenda, focusing on strategic portfolio optimization, cost reductions and improved working capital management, all of which are strengthening our cash flow. Further, we have refined our digital strategy and are pivoting away from large global implementations and are directing our resources to prioritize regional and more agile projects and accelerating our data journey while continuing to invest the appropriate amount in cybersecurity and network and application resilience.\nTo conclude, I want to take a moment to thank all our ADM colleagues for their focus, adaptability and contributions to the company's long-term success. These efforts are integral to our ability to navigate the current dynamic environment. Back to you, Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThanks, Monish. Let me wrap up by saying, overall, we will continue to drive operational excellence and strong cash flow through our focus on manufacturing efficiencies, portfolio simplification and cost streamlining.\nIn AS&O, our team is positioning our asset network to maximize opportunities from the expected improvement in market conditions, primarily as a result of global trade evolution and the pending U.S. biofuels policy.\nIn Carbohydrate Solutions, we will continue to drive operational excellence and closely monitor softening consumer demand trends and broader economic signals, while maintaining momentum around our decarbonization strategy, which we expect will open value opportunities in low-carbon solutions.\nAnd for Nutrition, we expect steady progress across our portfolio with additional opportunities in natural colors. With that, we'll take your questions now. Operator, please open the line.",

    "content": "Half Year 2025 Admiral Group PLC Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2025 Admiral Group PLC Earnings Call\n\nADMLONDONAUG 14, 5:00 AM\n\nMilena Mondini-de-Focatiis\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nGood morning, and welcome, everybody, to Admiral Group Half Year 2025 results. Once again, we delivered excellent financial performance, growth and strategic progress across the group. As usual, I will be sharing our main highlights. Geraint will provide us more detail on our financial performance. Alistair will talk to us about the excellent results in UK Insurance and Costantino will bring to life for us our progress overseas.\nSo in the first 6 months of the year, we delivered a record profit of GBP 521 million. That is almost 70% increase year-on-year, while at the same time, adding 1 million customers to our book, that is a 10% increase versus last year. The main driver of this profit increase was UK Motor insurance that was also supported by positive claims trends. But it was nice to see material growing contribution coming from different parts of the business, and in particular, UK Household and Admiral Money, both doubled their profits while at the same time growing and building on their strong track record.\nAs we anticipated in March, we announced the sale of our U.S. business Elephant due to complete later this year. It will be sad to say goodbye to our colleagues but we do think that's in the best interest of all our stakeholders. We also made great progress in our -- enhancing our data and technology capability as well as improve our customer experience reflecting a strong Net Promoter Score above 50%. As very typical and usual of Admiral, we maintain pricing discipline in a softening market. And this will put us on a strong footing for further growth when the cycle will turn and the time will be right.\nWe have a strong capital position and strong fundamentals and continue to build on this strong track record. A bit more in detail now. The first 6 months of 2025 were very much a continuation of the second half of last year. We stay focused on our strategy and execute well across the board with progress in all the different parts of the business. In our largest business, UK Motor, we remain close and reacted fast to market trends with decreased prices to reflect improved frequency and reduce claims inflation, but we did so with measure and less than the market. Our historical discipline resulted in three points improvement of combined ratio, and a 5% customer growth year-on-year.\nBeyond Motor, we're extremely pleased with our progress in the U.K. We continue to deliver strongly on our dual strategic objective. To grow at pace other lines of business with also 30% more customers in Travel, Household and Pet Insurance versus one year ago, while at the same time deliver good margins with a combined ratio for the half year of 88%. In Europe, we also successfully delivered on our two main objectives. First, to turn around ConTe, our Italian business, with fast recovery towards profitability. And second, to continue growing profitably in France, where we can leverage on L'olivier's strong position in the direct market.\nOverall, good continuous progress in our diversification strategy with the majority of our business increasing contribution to the bottom line and all fuel still in the investment phase. A [indiscernible] across the group is the relentless focus on ensuring that our data and tech capabilities are market leading to continue to support our key competitive advantage in underwriting and in providing excellent service to our customers. In the last months, we have continued to optimize our machine learning models in production, not only in pricing, where we already had strong foundations and scale, but also beyond pricing and with particular focus on claims, where the strong inflation of the last few years, increased even more our sense of urgency to deliver innovation and to deliver more cost effectively for our customers.\nWe're excited about the potential of GenAI to improve our customer experience to support our agents and increase automation. We're setting strong foundations for the adoption of it across the board with the first models in production and several life pilots with promising initial results. Foundational to data adoption excellence are stronger data platforms, and those have been strengthened, both in the U.K. and in Europe.\nAnother pillar of our strategy is to continue growing our EV portfolio with strong financials and stay close to other relevant motor market trends. And we're exploring new propositions for young driver with Veygo and developing new capabilities in commercial motor also leveraging our partnership with [indiscernible]. Beyond financial and strategic progress, there is so much for us to be proud of. primarily our customers that are recognizing our effort with strong Net Promoter and feedback scores. Most importantly, we continue to deliver accessible and affordable products for the majority of the population.\nSecond, our colleagues that continue to rate us as one of the best places to work for with another ranking top 25 worldwide and #2 in the U.K. Our people engagement is also reflected in the high retention of talent and competence. Our commitment to diversity also remains as strong as ever. Finally, it's been pleasing to see our AAA score reaffirmed by MSCI a few days ago, as we continue to progress on our net 0 transition plan and on our science-based targets.\nBefore closing this section, I would like to take a step back with you and look at the long-term trajectory. As you see in this graph, in the last 10 years, we delivered a 9% PBT CAGR and delivered return to our shareholders, that is 4x the FTSE 100. This track record is built on five pillars: Number one, strong technical expertise in claims and underwriting, combined with sharp focus on expenses and continuous innovation, particularly in the use of data. This is what underpins our large combined ratio advantage versus market. Second, an extremely capital-efficient model, enabled by strong long-lasting insurance partnerships. This supports our growth and a great return on capital for our shareholders.\nThird, a disciplined approach to investment and a prudent reserving approach. We always value our shareholder money and are skilled to being resilient in our account, managing the business as it was our own and maybe that's also because we are all shareholder in Admiral. Fourth, a proven agility and ability to navigate better than market, a strong industry cycle, change in regulations and other external challenges. Last few years have been an example of this. We managed to flex the business trajectory and navigated these changes successfully. Finally, or maybe first, our culture. I'm deeply convinced that this is the most important competitive advantage that we have as it underpins all the points above. And it's our colleague's commitment to our customer and the business that allowed a strong set of results and I would like to take, again, this opportunity to thank them for their great work.\nThat's all from me for now, and Geraint will share with us more detail on our financial performance.\n\nGeraint Jones\n\nCFO & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Milena. Good morning, everyone. I'll cover some of the financial highlights from a quite positive first half of the year. I cover the main drivers of the group profit, plus a strong capital position and the much higher interim dividend.\nSo let's get going with some of the highlights. So pretax profit was up by 69% to GBP 521 million, and earnings per share was up similarly to 132.5p a share. Excluding the impact of Ogden on H2 last year, those are our highest 6-month profit figures ever. U.K. Motor was the key driver, reporting a significantly higher underwriting result. And there were also pleasing contributions from around the group as we'll see. And just to note, all these figures are now continuing operations basis until they exclude Elephant.\nReturn on equity was extremely high, close to 60% as the big profit increase significantly outweighed the higher equity. And we continue to report a robust and very satisfactory solvency position, net of a very large increase in the interim dividend of over 60% to 115p a share, maintaining our usual approach to dividends, so quite a positive set of results.\nOn the bottom half of the page shows turnover, customer numbers and loan balances. Turnover is just over GBP 3 billion and was flat against the first half of last year, although that half was 43% up on the first half of 2023 and so it was a big comparative period. Through the presentation, we'll see that the drivers were reductions in turnover in Italy and UK Motor, offset by a large increase in UK Household. As Milena has mentioned, we added 1 million new customers to the group over the last 12 months, seeing growth in every business with the exception of ConTe in Italy.\nAs you know, the total focus of our team in Italy was on restoring profitability. And a consequence of that right now is a smaller portfolio. And last, but definitely not least, Admiral Money's on balance sheet loans increased by around 0.25 to GBP 1.3 billion and a very good first half. And that business also now services around GBP 200 million of off-balance sheet loans as well.\nNext, on to the components of group profit. And these next two pages will show the breakdown of the group pretax result by business against last year. Quick comment on the group ratios to start. We report a broadly flat and very positive loss ratio for the group at around 57% and we saw a decent improvement in expense ratio period-on-period. UK Motor, UK Household and Europe, all delivering better expense ratios in this first half, which is good to see.\nUK Insurance increased overall profit by GBP 221 million, all lines delivering higher results. Home Insurance profit was more than double, a really pleasing first half with good growth in revenue and customers and another very decent combined ratio of 84%. Travel and Pets in aggregate broke even, which was positive, and I'll talk about UK Motor shortly. In Europe, as you can see, the result was flat half-on-half, just under breakeven. Within that total, European motor, which is the very large majority of the business, was also flat but at just over breakeven.\nCostantino will cover in more detail, but the key points are continued profits and growth in France. Good progress in Spain, notably on broker distributed business and very encouraging signs of profit recovery in Italy. Admiral Money, an extremely positive first half with profit more than doubling from GBP 7 million to GBP 16 million. The result did benefit from a GBP 10 million net profit impact from selling around GBP 150 million of previously originated loans from the unsecured loan portfolio, and that won't repeat in H2. But selling newly originated loans will be an ongoing feature of the business, with GBP 90 million of loans sold during H1.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the on-balance sheet loans balance grew by around 25% over the 12 months to GBP 1.3 billion and that growth contributed to higher interest income in this half. We see promising early signs in terms of car finance volumes following the relaunch of that product last year. Admiral Money continues to see positive credit loss trends and of course, we retain an appropriate and prudent provision for losses on the balance sheet. The share scheme costs were higher because of the higher share price this half versus last and the other items were positively distorted in H1 last year, when we realize the profit on the sale of Insure shares we received when we sold Compare.com. There's more analysis of that line in the appendix.\nNext, let's take a closer look at the really positive UK Motor result. This is a summarized income statement plus the key ratios with some observations on the key changes. Starting with turnover. That was GBP 2.3 billion in this half, which is GBP 2.4 billion last half. And there are two drivers of that small decrease. One is a shift in the sales mix in favor of renewals for away from new business as the new business market was smaller in size and more competitive. And the second was our reduced prices over the last year or so, which leads to lower average premiums at new business and renewal.\nThe main contributor to the much higher overall profit was the big increase in the underwriting result, which was up by GBP 180 million, and that was mainly due to much higher premiums from the 2024 underwriting year earning through and consequently, a better combined ratio. As expected, the quota share reinsurance cost was also notably lower this half due to the much lower reinsurance assets on the balance sheet at the start of the period compared to last. And that 2024 underwriting year is also the main contributor to the higher profit commission income.\nOn the key ratios, firstly, we see a better expense ratio, which benefits from the big increase in earned premiums, a slightly better current period loss ratio positively impacted again by 2024 and slightly lower but still strong reserve releases. Let's dig a bit deeper into UK Motor loss ratios. And this chart shows UK Motor booked loss ratios by underwriting year on a discounted basis. Alistair will cover the current claims trends shortly, but on the back years, we see continued good development. And as we reported back in March 2023 and in particular, 2024, will be extremely good underwriting use. Our estimate of claims burn cost inflation for '25 versus '24 is somewhere in the 5% to 7% range, including a small reduction in frequency versus last H1.\nAnd because of the combination of that inflation and lower prices, 2025 will be a lower margin year than 2024 for Admiral, and we believe the market -- we still project a profitable year for Admiral, of course. And then on the book loss ratios, the first discounted booking of 2025 is at 73% or 79% undiscounted. And that's actually in line with 2024 at the same point. But because of the higher ultimate loss ratio we expect for 2025, the book ratio for '25 is very likely to increase in H2 as the lower premiums start to earn through.\nIn the claims reserve, we've opted to hold the risk adjustment strength in the balance sheet at the maximum level, but we expect that to start moving modestly down within the coming year. And finally, reserve releases, they continue to be an important element in the income statement at 13% of earned premiums this half. Don't forget that earned premium was significantly higher in this half compared to last half, partly accounting for that lower percentage. Anyone that's panicking that they don't see the other chart on ultimate loss ratios that we normally show here, please refer to the appendix.\nMoving now to the capital position and interim dividend and starting with capital on the left. These are the movements in the solvency ratio from full year to half year. Key points: Firstly, slightly lower capital generation as expected, given the lower underwriting margins in 2025. Second, growth, albeit lower growth in the capital requirement. And then thirdly, the interim dividend, which almost offsets the capital generated. Our closing position at 194%, obviously, is still very satisfactory. On the internal model, we continue to progress in line with our plan towards full application. And the next important piece of news will be when we make that step.\nAnd then on the right-hand side, the interim dividend. As you can see, we're paying 115p a share. That's around 60% higher than last year's interim and a nice round 50% CAGR over the past couple of halves; 115p, just under 90% of the first half earnings. No change to report in our approach to dividends. But just to note that we will start buying shares in the market for our share plans, either in the fourth quarter of this year or the first half of next year. in anticipation of share awards and share vesting in 2026. And so as we flagged, the special dividend, we'll start to see the impact of that in 2026.\nA couple of comments just to finish off. Firstly, very pleasing set of financials for the first half of 2025 led as usual by our UK Motor business, but with further positive results in other parts of the group, notably UK Home Insurance and Admiral Money. And in line with that significantly higher profit, we've declared a much bigger interim dividend, but still, of course, maintain a very satisfactory and strong solvency position. And then on the outlook for the rest of 2025, in terms of top line and customers, we expect to grow in all our operations, obviously, subject to how our markets play out and probably with the exception of Italy.\nTurnover in H2 is likely to be a bit below H1 as was the case last year and that's due to lower average premiums and some seasonality. Then in terms of profit, the group results will be well supported by the continuing earning through of the 2024 underwriting year in UK Motor. We project continued good results from the businesses highlighted just now, UK Home Insurance, Admiral Money plus L'olivier in France. And we expect a much better Italian result for the full year compared to last subject to the profit recovery there continuing.\nOver now to Alistair to give us more insight into the UK Insurance business and market.\n\nAlistair Hargreaves\n\nChief Executive Officer of UK Insurance Business\n\nThank you, Geraint. Good morning, everyone. Let's look at our excellent UK Insurance results. We grew customer numbers by 13% year-on-year, maintained revenue and reported a 60% increase in profits. In Motor, we grew to 5.8 million customers. And in Beyond Motor, we now ensure over 3.5 million homes, holidays and pets for our customers, all driven by giving customers great value and service, which also resulted in our #1 position on Trustpilot.\nWe're very happy with the More Than integration, which is nearing completion. 339,000 home and pet customers have renewed with us in the last 12 months. The More Than brand is live for pet new business customers, and we expect a positive impact on earnings from H2 '25 onwards. As a result, we delivered profits of GBP 584 million, mostly driven by Motor and contributed to by another record profit for Home and continued profit growth for Travel.\nLet's look at what drove our strong results in Motor, starting with motor claims trends. There's a continuation of favorable '24 motor market claims trends, decreasing frequency and severity continuing to moderate. Frequency decreased year-on-year, reflecting vehicle safety features on more vehicles, increased road safety measures and favorable weather. Severity inflation continues to moderate. We estimate mid- to high single-digit inflation. Damage severity benefited from stable secondhand car prices and more normal repair cost inflation. Bodily injury inflation is stable.\nTogether, frequency and severity trends drive claims burn costs, the average claims cost per policy. The resulting better-than-expected claims burn costs since the start of '24 has contributed to falling market premiums. Admiral continues to benefit from years of cumulative experience and expertise. We consistently achieved good outcomes and motor claims NPS of over 55 whilst maintaining claims cost discipline. In line with the FCA multi-firm review, we've completed our analysis of total loss valuations. We will be taking action to rectify some historic cases and have increased our total provision to GBP 50 million.\nThis is around 3% of the total loss claims costs over the relevant period.\nMoving to Motor pricing. Admiral managed margins and volumes well in H1 in the face of continued reductions in market prices. In the first half of '25, we saw market -- the motor market continued to respond to better-than-expected claims trends by reducing prices, with slightly slower decreases in Q2 than in Q1, as you see on the left-hand side. The price indices use different data points, but the average reflects market movements this half and it shows prices down 7%. Admiral times top, which is the percentage of times we are cheapest on price comparison sites, a measure of our competitiveness is illustrated on the right-hand side.\nAt the start of '24, we became very competitive when prices and new business volumes were at their peak. Since then, market premiums have fallen in response to improved claims experience. We've also reduced prices but by slightly less than the market, somewhat reducing our competitiveness. We welcome that the FCA confirmed that motor premium increases in '23 and '24, were driven by claims costs and that their interim update on premium finance recognize that premium finance allows customers to spread costs helping affordability. We're confident our premium finance product provides fair value. We have a competitive APR of 15%, and that compares favorably to other sources of finance. So a good first half for UK Motor.\nLet's look -- move on to look at another step-up for Household where we delivered a combined ratio of 84% and a record first half profit of GBP 25 million. In the first half, Household market claims burn costs continued to moderate due to lower frequency and relatively benign weather. As a result, after peaking in Q3 '24, market premiums continued to decrease in the first half of '25. For Admiral, we're keen to maintain pricing discipline, and our price decreases were more modest than the market. We continue to drive growth through a combination of More Than, strong retention and multicover and we're pleased to see an improved current year loss ratio.\nAlthough H1 weather has been relatively benign, it has been particularly dry. So we've included provision for elevated subsidence risk. This combination of good growth and margins resulted in a record half year profit for Household of GBP 25 million. We're engaging with the FCA on their review into household claims handling. Admiral is well placed to navigate both market and regulatory dynamics with strong pricing, claims and customer centricity and a disciplined approach to balancing growth and margin. We're very pleased with our recent Household performance.\nJust a reminder, save the date. As we mentioned in March, we'll hold a deep dive session on our household business in November.\nA very strong first half across UK Insurance overall, so now let's look ahead. Starting with Motor. We expect market claim severity inflation in the second half to be similar to the first, although macro volatility causes some uncertainty. We expect claims frequency to remain stable or gradually decrease due to the long-term trend of improving vehicle technology with some uncertainty due to weather. More positive than expected claims trends have led market premium decreases of more than 17% since the start of '24. Going forward, we expect premiums need to increase in the near future or we'll see a marked deterioration in the '26 market combined ratio. A delay in market premium increases will mean larger increases are needed.\nIn Household, market claims inflation is broadly stable, but with an increased subsidance risk in H2. Assuming relatively benign weather, we expect to see continued reductions in market prices in the second half. For Admiral, our pricing will remain disciplined, reflecting market claims outlook, whether for home and our own trends. Looking beyond trading, we remain confident of driving sustainable profitable growth over the medium term, driven by three areas of focus. First, our customer centricity, delivering great products and service with strong NPS and very competitive prices.\nSecond, motor operational excellence, balancing continued growth with market-leading combined ratio performance, both benefiting from strong retention. Third, building a strong track record of sustainable profitable growth in home, travel and pet, helping 1.5 million customers with two or more products. So a great set of results, and we remain confident of driving sustainable, profitable growth over the medium term.\nAnd now over to Costy to talk more about our international results.\n\nCostantino Moretti\n\nChief Executive Officer of International Insurance\n\nThank you, all. Good morning, everyone. To compete with Geraint, I've also put my best picture top right. So the story of our European business this half is one of a turnaround and good progress overall on our strategy. The year-on-year result is flat with a small profit, but we recovered this semester from a significant loss reported for the full year 2024, thanks to disciplined execution across our markets. Let's see the highlights.\nOur focus has been on improving margins, careful risk selection and increasing efficiency. We have also made good progress on our key strategic initiatives. The turnaround in our bottom line over the past six months was driven by targeted performance across our markets. Our French business has continued its positive track record of profitable growth. We have made significant strides in our recovery plan for Italy and we are making good strategic progress with intermediary distribution channels, both in Italy and Spain. Underpinning all of this is our continued investments in analytics and technology to strengthen our pricing capabilities make our claims processes more effective and better serve our customers. Indeed, we are maintaining a leading position in the customer service scores across our markets.\nLet's look at the numbers in more detail. Our French business, L'olivier, continues its good performance. For the past several years, the business has delivered double-digit growth with a very good combined ratio, thanks to our solid foundations in risk selection and focus on direct acquisition. This half, we again achieved double-digit top line growth, increasing our customer base to over 0.5 million, while maintaining an excellent combined ratio. We expect to continue on this positive trajectory of building more scale and delivering good margins.\nMoving to Italy. We executed a significant turnaround in ConTe. As I mentioned at the full year results presentation, we faced challenges, but our response was swift and effective. As you can see from the chart, we materially reduced our losses, improving the combined ratio by 13 points. We took strong pricing actions, pruned the portfolio, shifted to lower risk segments and implemented cost savings. While this necessary discipline led to a planned reduction in our policy count, the benefits are already clear, and I expect them to materialize fully in the coming quarters. ConTe has consistently delivered profit for a decade prior to 2024. And I believe the actions taken have put ConTe back on a solid footing to return to be profitable and to grow in the near term.\nIn Spain, our underwriting discipline continues to deliver profitability in the direct business. We are also seeing a promising trajectory in the brokers and ING Bank distribution channels, which have reduced their losses while growing volumes. The groundwork laid by these two more recent initiatives provide a strong foundation while all signs confirming that we have multiple avenues for profitable growth in the medium term.\nSometimes it happens because I don't think people from home see the slides. Keep going. Okay. So now I would like to dive on how we are solving for scale and efficiency. Two key strategic challenges to compete successfully in Europe. To scale, we are transitioning to a multichannel model. We cannot rely solely on the direct market as most customers still shop off-line in Europe. And this move expands our market potential. We began this transition in Italy and Spain, while in France, we continue to focus on a direct market, strong momentum. After a learning period, we redesigned our products. This closed a planned temporary drop in policies as shown in the chart that you cannot see, but you have your presentation.\nThe new products -- yes, here we are. The new products launched a year ago were well received by quality intermediaries and their customers, showing good growth in policy count year-on-year, and also overall loss ratio is improving. This trend confirms our strategy is working and supports profitable medium-term growth. Strong execution will be now key to realizing this outlook.\nNow on the efficiency. To be competitive and achieve good margins, efficiency is imperative, and we are making good progress. Our expense ratios are improving or stable. This is a strong result for ConTe, which held its ratio stable despite lower earned premiums. These improvements are driven by digitalization, automation and artificial intelligence. Our investments in these areas continue to deliver and I expect more opportunities ahead.\nTo conclude, our European operations are emerging stronger and more disciplined. Looking ahead, we will continue to execute our plan with precision and underwriting discipline, targeting a healthy trading margins to deliver growing profitability over the near future. Thank you. Now I hand over to Milena for the wrap-up.\n\nMilena Mondini-de-Focatiis\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Costin. So to summarize, we continue to deliver consistently year after year strong financial performance and growth. And beyond the excellent results in UK Motor, there is so much that we delivered across the group in the last 6 months, from a successful integration of More Than to the sale of our U.S. business, a strong turnaround in Italy, growth in every other part of the business, the sales I mentioned already, the sales of our U.S. business, our first for flow deal in Admiral Money and the list is still long.\nSo looking ahead, we continue to be focused on three strategic objectives: maintaining a leading position with a very substantial combined ratio advantage versus market in UK Motor and grow when the time is right. Second, to grow at pace and profitably other lines of business in the U.K. with a more synergic approach and a single view of the customer; and third, scaling our direct business in Europe, while at the same time, building larger opportunity for the future through different distribution channel.\nIn addition, we constantly develop our franchise. We continue to focus on our customers, continue to focus on our people and embrace and embed new data and technology to future-proof our competitive advantage. We remain agile and adapt to changing market condition and navigate industry cycle with discipline putting ourselves on a strong footing for further growth. And more in general, we remain very confident and excited about the future prospects of the business in the future.\nThank you very much. And that's all from us for now, I'm very happy to take questions from audience first and then from phone. Please, and please take the mic and press the button and hold it, if it's possible.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nWelcome to the first quarter earnings conference call for ADM. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer.\nWe have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast.\nSome of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.\nADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation and the materials. Unless otherwise required by law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements due to new information or future events.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings press release and presentation slides, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the ADM website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Megan. Hello, and welcome to all who have joined the call. Please turn to Slide 4. Today, ADM reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.70. Total segment operating profit was $747 million for the quarter. Our trailing 4-quarter adjusted ROIC was 7%, and cash flow from operations before working capital changes was $439 million.\nADM's first quarter results were aligned with our outlook and market expectations and our business operated well in a dynamic external environment. With uncertainty related to global trade and regulatory policy continuing to have an impact on the business, we were able to drive positive momentum in focused areas.\nOur Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered solid results supported by positive margins in sweeteners, along with strong execution in ethanol.\nNutrition's performance in the first quarter, specifically in our Flavors and Animal Nutrition portfolios, is on a path to recovery. We also made important progress in getting our Decatur East facility back online as it moves into the final stages of recommissioning.\nOur Services and Oilseeds was impacted by challenging conditions and overall market uncertainty and took actions to drive organizational realignment and network optimization.\nAnd thanks to our team's continued diligence in safety, I'm pleased to report that our Q1 total recordable incident rate was the lowest it has been in the history of ADM. These examples highlight our team's ability to drive our strategy forward while focusing attention on the self-help and execution excellence agenda we outlined earlier in the year.\nLet's take a closer look at our progress in the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 5. In our last call, we shared a slate of self-help activities to enable us to deliver on execution and cost goals, drive simplification and strategic growth while maintaining continued capital discipline. We're taking a balanced approach to these efforts across the business. Let me share a few highlights.\nFrom a cost perspective, we made important progress on our target of $500 million to $750 million in cost savings over the next 3 to 5 years. This included a targeted workforce reduction to align our organization to our most critical priorities, along with a thorough review of third-party consulting spend. With this, we are seeing a reduction in our overall SG&A costs.\nWe made the strategic decisions to deliver optimization across the network, including the recently announced closure of our Kershaw, South Carolina crush facility, exit of domestic trading operations in China and Dubai as well as the consolidation of several grain warehouses.\nWe don't take actions that impact our colleagues and the communities where we operate lightly. I have engaged with these groups to clearly explain the rationale for our decisions and provide them with necessary transition support.\nWe're also addressing challenges with operations uptime from our North America soy assets and we are now live with Decatur East and expect to have the plant at full run rate by the end of the second quarter.\nThe focus on our Nutrition business is beginning to show positive results. Addressing demand fulfillment issues and leveraging our innovation capabilities in Flavors has supported a strong year-over-year operating profit. We've unlocked both simplification and growth potential in our recent Mitsubishi MOU announcement, focusing our combined teams on what they do best. We advance automation and digitization across our global manufacturing network, scaling successful pilots, improving reliability and efficiency and driving over a dozen new projects to deliver cost savings and smarter operations.\nWe continue to invest in R&D related to health and wellness solutions. And in February, we announced a partnership with Asahi Global Foods Corporation to distribute an innovative postbiotic design to address challenges with the stress, mood and sleep.\nThe expansion of our Regen Ag partnership and biosolutions business is playing an important role in driving farmer resiliency, creating new high-value avenues for the sale of differentiated crops. Underpinning all this work, we remain focused on capital discipline and actively managing traditional channels to return cash to shareholders.\nAs we look ahead to the remainder of the year, this self-help agenda will be critical to positioning ADM to manage through what continues to be an uncertain external landscape. We remain confident in our team's ability to take the balance of actions needed to support the result that matches the high expectations we have set for ourselves. Our team is keeping close to our customers and remain alert to both the challenges and the opportunities that we're seeing in the market.\nWe're taking full advantage of the breadth of the investment we have made in our business over the past decade and the agility that provides. From our crush and export capabilities across the U.S., Argentina and Brazil to our expansive origination network to our expertise in formulation to our portfolio of ingredients, including all natural colors and flavors, all of these add to ADM's ability to support rapidly evolving needs.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Monish to share a deeper dive into first quarter financial results and our 2025 outlook.\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6. To start, let me provide some perspective on the operating backdrop that shaped the first quarter for the AS&O segment. As we expected, market disruptions related to biofuel policy uncertainty negatively impacted biodiesel and renewable diesel margins and U.S. vegetable oil demand. We also experienced higher global soybean stock levels and an increase in Argentinian crush rates, which pressured global soybean meal value. Additionally, trade policy uncertainty, particularly with Canada and China, created volatility throughout the quarter for canola meal and oil. Taken together, these factors resulted in significantly lower meal and vegetable oil values, pulling down margins across our businesses.\nOverall, against this backdrop, AS&O segment operating profit for the first quarter was $412 million, down 52% compared to the prior year quarter with declines across all subsegments.\nIn the Ag Services subsegment, operating profit was $159 million, down 31% versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by lower North American origination export volumes as order flow was impacted by trade policy uncertainty. North American origination results also reflect the additional expense of $34 million recorded in the period for anticipated export duty.\nGlobal trade results were lower relative to the same quarter last year, largely due to the negative timing impact, partially offset by higher destination marketing volumes and margins. Total net timing impacts were approximately $48 million year-over-year.\nIn the crushing subsegment, operating profit was $47 million, down 85%. Consistent with the previously provided outlook, both global soybean and canola crush execution margins was significantly lower than the prior year quarter. Global executed crush margins were approximately $13 per ton lower in soybeans compared to the prior year quarter and approximately $40 per ton lower in canola.\nBy region, crush margins were down significantly in North America. North America soybean crush margins were negatively impacted by additional capacity from new crushing facilities and lower soybean oil demand stemming from biofuel policy uncertainty. North America canola crush margins were negatively impacted by trade policy uncertainty and lower canola oil demand for biofuel production. There were net negative timing impacts of approximately $36 million year-over-year.\nIn the Refined Products and Other subsegment, operating profit was $134 million, down 21% compared to the prior year quarter due to lower biodiesel and refining margins. In EMEA, margins declined due to significantly lower biodiesel export volume. In North America, refining margins were negatively impacted by additional industry crush capacity and lower demand for vegetable oil due to biofuel policy uncertainty. There were net positive timing impact of approximately $34 million year-over-year. Equity earnings on the company's investment in Wilmar was $72 million, down 52% compared to the prior year quarter.\nOverall, during a challenging quarter, the AS&O team executed on operational improvement like plant and network consolidation and took actions to accelerate cost savings, starting with targeted organization realignment to partially mitigate the less favorable market conditions and be in an excellent position to capture opportunities as we move through the remainder of the year.\nTurning to Slide 7. For the first quarter, Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $240 million, down 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Operating profit for this segment came in slightly ahead of our previously provided segment guidance for the quarter.\nIn the Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, operating profit was $207 million, down 21% compared to the prior year quarter. In North America, S&S results were lower due to lower starch margins from demand softness in the paper and corrugated markets, as well as lower North American Wet Milling ethanol results due to lower ethanol margins. In EMEA, S&S volumes and margins declined as higher corn costs and increased competition negatively impacted results. As a partial offset, North American liquid sweetener margins improved relative to the prior year quarter due to better product mix. Global wheat milling margins and volumes also improved relative to the prior year quarter, largely due to volume growth with key customers.\nIn the Vantage Corn Processors subsegment, operating profit was $33 million, up compared to the prior year quarter due to higher ethanol volumes and improved ethanol margins relative to the prior year quarter. Overall, ethanol EBITDA margins per gallon were slightly negative in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 8. In the first quarter, Nutrition segment revenues were $1.8 billion, down 1% compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to negative currency impact. Human Nutrition revenue was up 4% due to strong Flavors growth and M&A, which offset headwinds related to supply chain challenges from Decatur East. Animal Nutrition revenue was down 6% as negative currency impacts and lower volumes offset mix benefits.\nNutrition segment operating profit was $95 million for the first quarter, up 13% versus the prior year quarter. Human Nutrition subsegment operating profit was $75 million, down 1% compared to the prior year quarter as improved performance in Flavors was more than offset by declines in specialty, ingredients and health and wellness. Animal Nutrition subsegment operating profit of $20 million was higher than the prior year quarter due to higher margins supported by ongoing turnaround actions.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. Through the end of the first quarter, the company generated cash flow from operations before working capital of approximately $439 million, down relative to the prior quarter due to lower total segment operating profit. Solid cash generation and our strong balance sheet remain a critical differentiator for the company.\nWe will continue to seek opportunities to further strengthen our balance sheet to provide financial flexibility to organically invest in the business to enhance returns and create long-term value. We are also taking actions to ensure working capital excellence through stronger rigor on working capital planning, inventory rationalization, improvement of key account payable metrics and more timely collection of past due balances. At the same time, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and we returned $247 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 10. We have provided details to support our 2025 consolidated outlook. Earlier today, we affirmed our full year adjusted EPS guidance. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to be between $4 to $4.75 per share, though we now expect to be at the lower end of the guidance range given the current market backdrop. In particular, we remain cautious about our second half outlook for crush margin improvement as current domestic crush replacement margins are below our outlook.\nWith the uncertainty related to tariff policy and macroeconomic conditions, we are not providing segment operating profit guidance for future quarters. We are providing directional guidance at the segment level for the full year.\nOur directional guidance for operating profit for the full year for Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition has not changed from our previously provided indication. With performance to date and continued pressure on crush margins in the second quarter, we are lowering our directional guidance for AS&O for the full year to be lower than the prior year. As an additional data point, current crush margins for the second quarter are trending lower than the first quarter.\nI also want to share some updates on our overall assumption. We still expect better crush and biodiesel margins in the second half of the year as clarity on renewable volume obligation or RVO is expected to support strong U.S. demand for crop-based vegetable oil. We also expect to deliver our $200 million to $300 million cost savings target for the year, and have already taken several actions that are delivering savings. We are working thoughtfully to accelerate saving realization where possible.\nWe have seen some signs of weakening customer demand, particularly in Carb Solutions and have lowered our volume expectations for select markets and products. While we are not embedding any significant macroeconomic slowdown in our guide, we are actively monitoring consumer demand.\nTo conclude, as we navigate 2025, our focus will remain on what is within our control. A full commitment to remediating the material weakness and making strides to strengthen our internal controls, driving execution to improve operational performance and lower cost while sustaining functional excellence, simplifying our portfolio to enhance focus on core competencies while unlocking additional capital to drive value and position the company for long-term success. These efforts position us in our ability to navigate the current dynamic environment and reinforce our confidence in delivering on our commitments.\nBefore I hand it back to Juan, I want to take a few minutes to thank all my ADM colleagues for their dedication and focus in delivering for our customers and helping to create long-term value for our shareholders. Back to you, Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThanks, Monish. I'll briefly close by recapping our focus as we continue the path into 2025. As I said at the top of the call, we will continue to focus on both execution, agility and our self-help agenda. Our teams are monitoring the evolving geopolitical and macroeconomic landscape, and they are taking actions as we get more clarity about both the short and long-term situation.\nImportantly, we are leveraging cost management, strategic simplification, targeted investments and capital discipline to ensure we are prepared for a multitude of scenarios.\nThe potential impacts on our mitigating actions look different for each part of the business. For Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, we are paying close attention to overall consumer sentiment and the potential for an economic slowdown to mitigate against this, we're taking aggressive action on our manufacturing and SG&A costs.\nIn Nutrition, specifically, we are focused on getting our East plant fully ramped up, optimizing our Animal Nutrition business model, leveraging our leading specialty ingredients portfolio, including all natural colors and flavors, and ensuring we are continuing to execute against a healthy opportunity pipeline in flavors and health and wellness.\nFor Ag Services and Oilseeds, we are monitoring the global trade and biofuel policy environment to ensure that we can enable the export market for our robust origination footprint and take advantage of improving demand conditions later in the year.\nOn trade policy, we have seen positive signals with both delays in implementing tariffs to potential avoidance of tariffs and counter tariffs. The decision regarding USTR's Section 301 proposal have mitigated some of the potential impact of transporting commodity products between China and the U.S. And more broadly, for China exports, we will need to see where things stand as we approach the U.S. soybean harvest in the October to December period.\nBeyond trade, strong policy support for biofuels, including clarity on RVO is expected to support strong U.S. demand for crop-based vegetable oils. In this business, beyond general market improvements, we will continue our focus on both cost management and strategic simplification self-help efforts to manage through uncertainty.\nAs noted by Monish, these factors support our confidence in our full year guidance for 2025, though with current fundamentals, we will be at the lower end of our range. We are a U.S. company that is fundamental to the global food, feed and energy supply chains, connecting consumers with farmers to fuel the world and keep the U.S. agriculture sector competitive. We have a long track record of navigating cycles and are focused on resiliency, which comes from our unparalleled asset network and our employees' commitment to excellence.\nAs in the past, regardless of external challenges and market disruptions, ADM is working with our farmers and customers to be a source of strengthening the economy, always fulfilling our mission to unlock the power of nature, to enrich the quality of life.\nWith that, we'll take your questions now. Operator, please open the line.",

    "content": "Full Year 2024 Admiral Group PLC Earnings Call\n\nFull Year 2024 Admiral Group PLC Earnings Call\n\nADMLONDONMAR 6, 5:00 AM\n\nMilena Mondini-de-Focatiis\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nHello. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Admiral Group's 2024 results. We're proud to share with you another year of excellent results and progress on many fronts. I will start with an overview. Geraint will follow up with more detail on financials. Alistair Hargreaves will today take you through our major business, U.K. insurance. Alistair succeeded Cristina Nestares as U.K. Insurance CEO in October. He has big shoes to fill, its impact to date in previous roles and knowledge of the business are second to none and is already on a great start.\nI'm also pleased to announce that Scott Cargill, Admiral Money CEO, also with us today. After he built such a strong business at mill will be joining Alistair team to lead our personal insurance lines of business beyond motor. Pet, travel and household path, like an alternative path to go an additional path to go alongside motor insurance. I'm proud that we continue Admiral tradition of developing internal talent also in more seniors rolled had they built such a strong track record in their previous positions. We are in the process of identifying successor as a CEO of Admiral Money. Constantino will present international results as usual. He will share a bit more insight than usual on Europe, as we decided to postpone the deep dive on Europe that we anticipated at [indiscernible].\nGoing forward, we will run annual deep dives dedicated to 1 area of the business. And this year, we will start with the U.K. household insurance instead. Good. So 2024 was a remarkable year. Finally, after the pandemic cost of living crisis, major regulatory changes, inflation spikes, the market has been more favorable with inflation reducing and more benign weather. We've been fast to react to market conditions, I'm glad to be able to share with customers some of these benefits.\nWe reported 28% turnover growth as we increased our customer base by 14% and as average premiums were higher on average than 2023 across the board. We manage the business with discipline during inflation spike in 2022 and 2023. And as a result, started last year from a position of trend, able to reduce rates earlier than most and gain market share.\nGroup profitability reached GBP 839 million, an all time high, driven by U.K. motor insurance that delivered close to GBP 1 billion of profits. We were proud to see the progress of other lines of business as well, with 2 international countries, France and U.S. and the 2 largest business in U.K. beyond Motor, Admiral Money and U.K. Household, reporting all double-digit profits. At the same time, we continue to strengthen our capabilities, particularly in data and AI and successfully completed relevant technology projects.\nSofter market conditions are continuing in early 2025. We are well positioned, strongly capitalized with the solvency ratio over 200% and happy the business we are underwriting now. We will continue to remain disciplined, as always, and adapt as needed.\nSo a bit more color on 2024. Great momentum with GBP 1.3 billion increase in turnover and 1.4 million increase in policy number. Main growth driver was U.K. Motor, particularly in the first half of the year with around 0.5 million additional customers at the end of H1. But other lines of business in U.K. were material contributors too with the progressive migration of more than customer in the second half.\nThe integration is proceeding well. The teams are working well together, and we are confirming our expectation for the value creation of this deal. Outside U.K., a mixed picture, with robust performance in France and U.S. U.S. turnaround was a key focus of 2024 and we're very pleased with the results despite having to shrink our customer base there. Spain is also making good progress. ConTe instead had a tough year and reported a disappointed loss mainly due to the challenging market conditions with high BI inflation for increase of BI settlement values of reference. Costantino will expand on this later.\nThe team already put in place bold remediation actions, and we remain committed I'm confident on the prospect of the business. Regulation is a major theme in U.K. as well with the concentration of initiatives focused on motor insurance. Alistair will touch on some of these later. The new government set up a task force in November to look at increase of average premiums in U.K. motor insurance in the recent years. We are collaborating to help identifying the drivers, mainly car technology enhancement and maintenance costs, and cross-sector initiatives to generate savings to pass on to customers.\nThe good news for the customers and the task force is that premiums are already down since the task force was set up, reflecting easing inflation and a positive impact from the change in Ogden rate in December. The U.K. market is indeed extremely competitive and elastic, and we're confident that we'll adapt well to any change that has always been the case in the past. Our agility and performance track record leave us in a strong position with additional flexibility.\nFinally, we're proud of the turnaround of Elephant in 2024, but as we anticipated, we were reviewing strategic options for the business, and we now enter exclusive conversation with a potential acquirer. It's early day, I can't expand more at this point, and we will update you as soon as we have more to share. So before hearing more for [indiscernible] on 2024, I would like to take you take with you step back one forward to reflect on our journey in the last 10 years and our future prospect. Here we are.\nIn U.K. Motor, in the last decade, we maintained an average combined ratio advantage versus market of around 20 points, while at the same time, materially growing the market with a CAGR of around 5%. The graph at the bottom of the slide show how we managed to grow across cycles, often with an acceleration at the beginning of a softer period as it happened in 2024. This track record of sustainable profitable growth is underpinned by relentless focus on insurance fundamentals, technical competence in pricing, in claims and on improving customer service, we know complacency and continuous investment in new data and technology to upgrade these capabilities over time.\nThanks to this consistent outperformance of the market, we are able to secure strong insurance agreements that enable our capital-light business model. Our plan for U.K. Motor is very simple to continue to do the same across the next cycles. In addition, another interesting growth opportunity is represented for us by the incremental retention of the U.K. motor policies for customers that have more than one product with us. And as we will see in the next slide, this segment is growing fast.\nSo looking now beyond U.K. Motor, doesn't really work, yes. In the last 10 years, we built a book of 5.4 million customers beyond U.K. Motor, roughly half of our group total today between new product lines and international countries. These businesses have contributed with a turnover of GBP 1.7 billion. The investment has been limited, and it's now delivering positive results.\nOur plan here is also straightforward and is to increase margins, focusing the growth on the product lines and the market with higher potential when we have a proven competitive advantage and a clear right to win. Last year, the results of these lines of business combined was GBP 18 million with 4 businesses delivering double-digit profit and good combined ratio as well. And to additional profitable business, Veygo and U.K. Travel. But the positive results were partially counterbalanced by ConTe losses and investment in the younger business, such as pet insurance.\nLooking forward, we remain confident in an increased contribution to our profit for this business and in ConTe turnaround. As just mentioned, we're also particularly excited about the increasing customer lifetime value as we develop our multiproduct strategy further. I also mentioned that continuous innovation and continuous upgrade of our data and technology capability is really crucial to our success. In the last 5 years, we renewed the key element of our tech stack, now almost entirely cloud-based.\nWe implement scaled agile across the group sharing learnings [indiscernible] countries and leading to a drastic reduction in release times and better code quality. We extended adoption of predictive AI also beyond pricing, and this last year, we set the foundation to leverage more on GenAI to increase efficiency across the group. We also continue to develop our motor insurance proposition to meet emerging customer needs and new trends. We're one of the leading insurer of electric vehicles with a high-quality product, extensive covers for batteries and charging equipment, good brand association and also good financials.\nWe're in a strong position to continue leading in this fast-growing segment. Finally, our window on the future, Veygo, our brand for the youngest with innovative short-term insurance and subscription offers growing once again for the fourth year in a row by more than 40%.\nLast but not least, very ingrained in our culture is a focus on long-term sustainability of the business. Once again, we were glad to receive strong feedback from our customers and excellent engagement score from our 15,000 colleagues. It has been a pleasure this year to reward the efforts and the commitment of our colleagues that underpinned these results, not only with the usual GBP 3,600 worth of share, but also in additional special bonus of GBP 500 each. This year, we also achieved important milestones for our commitment to the environment, obtaining a AAA MSCI rating, having our science-based stars approved and have published our net zero transition plan. That's all for me for now. And to you, Geraint to deep dive into 2024 results.\n\nGeraint Jones\n\nCFO & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Milena. Good morning, everyone. Okay. So I'll talk through some of the highlights and the main drivers behind this very positive set of results between 2024 for the Admiral Group. And to start us off, these are some of the usual group metrics. Pretax profit was GBP 839 million, or 90% higher. That includes the Ogden impact of GBP 100 million, net of which profit would obviously have been GBP 739 million or an increase of 67%. .\nAmong the main drivers were much higher revenue and a significantly lower loss ratio. Earnings per share was around 217p. That's nearly double 2023. Return on equity was very strong at 56% on the back of the big increase in profit, only partly offset by the higher capital requirement. Solvency ratio remains very strong, over 200% and we followed our usual approach on dividends, which results in a full year dividend of 192p a share. That's around 90% up on 2023, and that full year figure includes 121p a share of final dividend, which I'll cover shortly.\nThen the bottom half of the page shows the main metrics behind a year of very strong growth at group level, as Milena has already mentioned. The growth was around 60-40 weighted to the first half due to the shape in the U.K. And with the exception of Italy and the U.S., all parts of the group grew and turnover broke through GBP 6 billion, increasing by nearly 30% year-on-year.\nNow let's take a look at what's driving the big increase in profit. This slide shows the results by business versus last year. So U.K. Insurance is the big driver of the change. Motor profit was GBP 360 million higher, including the GBP 100 million from Ogden and more on that very shortly. U.K. Home Insurance reported a really nice result of GBP 34 million, a big increase on 2023, which results from higher revenue and a better combined ratio. Internationally, we saw an adverse swing in the European result and a big positive change in the U.S.\nStarting in Europe, L'olivier in France reported another good result, now into double digits millions of profits and sustainably profitable. Our Spanish result was a modest loss overall, profitable indirect whilst continuing to invest in the newer distribution channels, in line with our plans and satisfactory. The biggest story though is in Italy, where we saw an adverse change a result to a GBP 23 million loss, consistent with the trends we reported at half year. ConTe has been consistently profitable for a decade. So as Milena mentioned, this is naturally disappointing. As we said at half year, the change in the Milan bodily injury tables was part of the reason, but there was also disappointing loss ratio development on 1 or 2 recent underwriting years. And our team in Italy is obviously all over this.\nMoving to the U.S. We saw further improvement in the bottom line during H2 and a very large improvement as you see year-on-year, and that was mainly due to a much lower loss ratio, credit to our team there for the turnaround. Admiral Money continued its profitable growth. Outstanding balances increased by around a quarter, and profit was up 30%. Very good progress all around. And Scott will later on also mention an interesting and important development in the Admiral Money business model. with the first deal to use third-party capital signed in the last few weeks, which will allow Admiral Money to continue to grow beyond our balance sheet limits, and we'll boost Admiral Money's return on capital.\nThere were offsetting changes compared to last year in the share scheme costs and the other items, and we've included some comments on the slide here and in the back. Shout out to Veygo for making a small profit and continuing its impressive revenue and customer growth trajectory. Let's take a look now at the U.K. Motor P&L count.\nSo this is the usual summarized P&L with a few of the key ratios and some observations on the main changes. In the back of the pack, we've showed how Ogden impacts the results on the ratio, so you can see what's going on there. Just a quick comment to start with on Ogden. The personal injury discount rates across the U.K. as you know, changed during 2024 to align at plus 0.5%. The approximate ultimate profit impact to Admiral of those changes is around GBP 150 million, of which GBP 100 million has been recognized in 2024. A further GBP 30 million or so will flow into 2025 and the rest thereafter.\nWe adjusted our prices immediately on the news of the change, and so there is no impact moving forward. So the observations and the main movements are quite consistent with the half year. We've already noted the very large turnover increase. And I think the reasons for that are well understood. Investment balances and the rate of return were notably higher than 2023, and they contributed to nicely higher investment income. We've set up more information on investments in the back [indiscernible] pack.\nWord on profit commission, where the revenue for '24 is maybe counterintuitively a bit lower than 2023. As I mentioned at the half year, that's due to the impact of the 2022 underwriting year. That still booked as loss-making and is still restricting our ability to recognize profit commission on the profitable 2023 underwriting year. We expect to start recognizing profit commission on '23 shortly. And then below the P&L, you can see a nicely improved expense ratio on the back of higher average premiums and revenue growth. And on the bottom right, we show the split of the loss ratio into the current year and reserve releases. And here, you see quite a notable change.\nThe current year loss ratio is a lot lower than 2023, high teens percentage points improvement. And that's due to reasonably positive claims experience in your but also the impact of higher premiums combating the elevated inflation we've seen in recent years. And on reserve releases, as at the half year, they were quite flat in absolute terms, but lower in percentage terms. And that's mainly due to the large increase in revenue, but also in a smaller way due to us taking a higher prudent risk adjustment position at year-end '24 compared to year-end '23.\nLet's look in a bit more detail at the U.K. Motor loss ratios. Our usual 2 charts here. These are underwriting discounted ratios. The best estimates are on the left and the booked ratio is on the right. We show the undiscounted ratios in the appendix, and you can see that discounting still has a notable impact on the ratios. There's quite a lot of information here, so let me give a few observations.\nFirstly, the best estimates obviously now reflect the new Ogden discount rates that had a circa 1 point positive loss ratio impact on the '21 to '24 years. But even excluding those impacts, we see some quite nice improvements on the back years and particularly on 2023, where the projection improved by 10 points over the course of the year. Four of those points came in the second half, including the one from Ogden.\nAs I mentioned previously, we expected this pattern for 2023 because of the impact of higher premiums positively impacting the loss ratio for '23 as the premium for the year earned through. The first projection of 2024 is pretty low, 63% discounted. In light of the reasonable claims experienced during the year, particularly on frequency, we're now expecting the 2024 underwriting year to be a bit better than 2023, but not hugely so. And because of the different premium earning pattern on '24 compared to '23, the '24 loss ratio will not develop as materially as the prior year to its ultimate point.\nAlistair will cover the trends we are seeing on severity and frequency in a couple of minutes. And then on the booked reserves, you can see the development in the ratio is on the right. We've increased our risk adjustment strength in the motor reserves to the maximum 95th percentile, effectively taking a cautious approach to recognizing the profit the good news coming through in the best estimates, including from the Ogden change.\nReserve releases, as already mentioned, in absolute terms were strong, slightly lower in percentage terms because of the revenue increase and the risk adjustment position. And there's no change to our recent guidance on reserve releases.\nNext, let's look at capital and dividend. On the left, we show the movement in the solvency ratio from half year to full year. In summary, we saw very strong capital generation during the second half, mainly, but not solely from U.K. Motor plus the Ogden change, and that was not fully offset by the higher capital requirement and the final dividend payment and the position, obviously, is still very satisfactory.\nQuick comment on the internal model. We entered the pre-application process with our regulators during the middle of 2024. And we got the feedback from that at the end of last year. We're now acting on that feedback and planning the full application, though, of course, there remains a lot of work to do on the project. We'll continue to provide updates in due course.\nAnd then on the right is the dividend. Proposed final dividend, as mentioned, is 121p a share. That's just under 90% of H2 earnings, and it's 2.3x the final 2023 dividend benefiting from the Ogden impact in H2. And as you see, the full year dividend is 192p a share, again, just under 90% of the full year earnings, and that's 86% higher than 2023.\nThere's no change to report in our approach to dividends. And a couple of closing remarks to finish off. Obviously, this is a very strong set of results with excellent U.K. Motor performance leading the way, but nice also to see some positive results from a number of our other businesses, including U.K. Household, French Motor, Admiral Money and the U.S. We maintained our very strong solvency position, and we see a big increase in the final and the full year dividends.\nAnd then on the right, I've added a few outlook comments and maybe just to pick out one. In U.K. Motor, we expect the 2025 underwriting year for Admiral and the market to be less profitable than 2024 as prices are reduced, though still profitable. And when thinking about 2025, it's important to remember the increased reserve strength to 2024 year-end and the significant profit [indiscernible] through from 2024 and 2023 in particular, but also the earlier years too and I expect that to be a strong support for profits in 2025.\nThat's it from me, I shall pass you to Alistair to talk about the U.K. insurance business.\n\nAlistair Hargreaves\n\nChief Executive Officer of UK Insurance Business\n\nThank you, Geraint. Good morning, everyone. I've been part of Admiral for 17 years. I'm very proud to be taking the baton of U.K. insurance CEO from Cristina. It's a fantastic business with a track record of sustainable profitable growth driven by a great team who consistently deliver for our customers.\nSo let's take a look at our excellent U.K. Insurance results. Motor grew very strongly as we moved earlier than the market to reflect better-than-expected claims experience by reducing premiums. Beyond Motor grew by 27%, and we now insure over 3 million customers. Our extended breadth of products, combined with our great service, as evidenced by high net promoter scores and our #1 position on Trustpilot is leading more customers to choose Admiral for more than one product. The more band integration continues to go well, providing an additional boost to Household growth and a step change for PET.\nWe completed the pricing systems builds and started the renewal migration as planned. The migration will complete in August 2025. Our new colleagues are making a great contribution to the team and retention performance is in line with expectations. All of this, plus the Ogden discount rate change contributed to an all-time high for U.K. motor profit, a record profit for Home and the second year of profitability for travel.\nLet's look at what drove the strong results in Motor, starting with claims trends, if I can. Frequency was lower than expected, falling in '24 compared to '23. This partly reflected vehicle safety features and more vehicles, increased road safety measures such as reduced speed limits and relatively benign weather in Q4. Severity inflation continues to be elevated compared to the long-run trends, but not to the extent we saw in '22 and '23.\nDamage severity benefited from repair cost inflation slowing from record levels in '23 and lower secondhand car prices. Bodily injury inflation is also slightly elevated but stable, driven by commercial care costs and increases in general damages, but partly offset by the favorable impact of the Ogden rate change.\nThe combination of lower frequency and moderating severity meant better-than-expected market claims burn costs. where claims burn cost is the average claims cost per policy. The second graph illustrates how relatively flat burn cost in '24 contributed to falling market premiums. We, at Admiral continue to benefit from years of cumulative experience and expertise, combined strong supply chain management, and this enables us to deliver good customer outcomes whilst maintaining control of claims costs.\nFinally, total loss. In line with the FCA multi-firm review, our analysis is near completion. The final impact is not expected to be significant to our results, but uncertainty remains. Moving to Major pricing. In 2024, a key driver of our exceptional results has been quick to recognize positive claims experience and reduce premiums earlier than the market. We became very competitive when prices and new business volumes were at their peak. When market premiums started to fall, we maintained pricing discipline. We remained competitive, but less so than at the peak. In total, we reduced prices by around 10% in 2024, broadly in line with the market overall, but our reductions were earlier in the year.\nSo the 2 graphs on the left show that market prices increased in 2023 and reduced in '24. The graph on the right shows at most times top, which is the percentage of times were cheapest on price comparison sites, a measure of our competitiveness.\nLooking at the second half of '23, you see our competitiveness increase as the market continues to increase its prices whilst we remain broadly flat. Towards the start of '24, we responded to improved claims experience and decreased rates by mid-single digits, which led to us being most competitive when customers needed it most. This resulted in exceptional growth in the first half. Since March '24, we've seen competitors decreasing prices. We also made reductions, reflecting both positive claims development and the Ogden discount rate change. But these were less than the market, reducing our competitiveness compared to H1.\nOne area of regulatory focus is premium finance. It's too early to understand the outcome of the FCA market study, but our internal fair value framework means we're confident, this product provides fair value and accessibility to our customers. Our APR is 17%. This is competitive compared to alternative sources of finance and remains at the lower end of the market. So an excellent year for Motor.\nLet's move to look at a strong year in Household where we delivered a combined ratio of 77% and a record profit of GBP 34 million. The market saw a period of elevated claims inflation since 2022, contributed to by the December '22 freeze, which put pressure on supply chains. In '24, we've seen signs that severity is starting to moderate. We also saw lower frequency than '23, largely driven by more benign weather.\nAfter many years of being flat, market premiums increased in '23, and this continued through '24, with '24 premiums reaching 30% higher than in 2022. This led to increased switching with new business volumes up 14% year-on-year and price comparison making up over 75% of new business sales. Admiral U.K. Household was well placed to capitalize on these market dynamics.\nWe have strong pricing and claims capabilities and a disciplined approach to balancing margin and growth, similar to the U.K. motor business. Admiral increased rates slightly ahead of the market whilst continuing to grow through our strong focus on price comparison, multicover retention and More Than. We're very pleased with the development of our current and prior year loss ratio, which along with the benign weather experience, have contributed to our record profit. So a very strong year across U.K. Insurance overall.\nNow let's look ahead to 2025, starting with Motor. We expect claims frequency to remain lower than pre-COVID but is likely to increase from the particularly low levels we've seen in 2024. We expect claims severity to continue similarly to '24 higher than the long-run average, but lower than the level seen in '22 and '23. We're seeing market prices continue to increase in Q1. There are different strategies from various players. So it's not clear how much longer this trend will continue, but no signs of showing -- no signs of slowing yet.\nFor Admiral, our pricing will be disciplined, reflecting claims inflation and our own trends. In 2025, we expect margins on business written to return to more normal levels with much more modest customer growth. In Household, we expect continued stabilization of market claims inflation, while frequency trends remain dependent upon weather. We've seen signs of prices starting to reduce, and we anticipate modest market price reductions in H1.\nOur pricing will continue to reflect inflation, weather and other claims trends. We anticipate continued growth, both organically and through the more than renewal rights migration. We remain focused on delivering great products and service for our customers whilst managing strong combined ratio performance. We're confident this will drive sustainable, profitable growth over the medium term.\nAnd now over to Costa to talk more about our international results.\n\nCostantino Moretti\n\nChief Executive Officer of International Insurance\n\nThanks, Al, and good morning, everyone. In this section about our international business, I'll focus on how we have navigated diverse market conditions to deliver for our 2 million international customers as our core objective remains prioritizing healthy margins and exceptional customer satisfaction.\nLet's move to the next slide, let me highlight the key messages. In Europe, we saw L'olivier in France achieved strong growth and profitability. While Admiral Seguros in Spain made progress with improved combined ratio nearing breakeven. In Italy, ConTe faced challenges due to strong increases in bodily injury cost inflation and some back book loss ratio deterioration, and we are actively implementing a comprehensive turnaround plan.\nAcross all European markets, we have maintained our commitment to delivering market-leading customer service. In the U.S., as Milena mentioned, we are in exclusive talks for Elephant, and we are pleased with the results achieved.\nTurning to the next slide. Let's delve into each country's performance. We observed hardening market conditions in France and Spain, reflecting necessary rate adjustments which are driving direct market growth. While Italy's market remains challenging, we are seeing signs of cycle upturn in recent months, including increasing average premiums and customers returning to shopping. And we expect it to recover in the near future to historical margins levels seen prior to 2020.\nIn this context, ConTe faced significant headwinds for 3 reasons: Unprecedented inflation coupled with increased bodily injury costs from the updated Milano tables and adverse loss ratio developments from the 2022 and 2023 underwriting years. Specifically, during those underwriting years, we expanded our portfolio into newer segments that afterward performed poorly.\nHaving learned from past challenges, we have identified the issues and implemented strong actions, like substantial price increases resulted in a 25% average premium growth since 2022, exceeding inflation, prudent reserve adjustments reflecting the updated bodily injury tables and strategic portfolio realignment to focus on profitable customer segments.\nFurthermore, we contain our costs and achieved a 2% expense ratio improvement despite almost flat turnover. And we are confident that these actions will drive positive returns, although they will take time to fully materialize, and we remain optimistic about ConTe's profitability potential in the entire market.\nL'olivier Motor delivered an excellent performance with an 89% written combined ratio, driven by strong growth in customers and turnover while maintaining our controlled loss ratio. Admiral Seguros showed encouraging improvements in its combined ratio, thanks to sustained positive contribution from its dairy channels that has traded south 90% combined ratio, and also improved performance from new distribution initiatives brokers and the ING Bank insurance partnership.\nOverall, the strong performance of L'olivier and improvements in Admiral Seguros helped mitigate the impact of ConTe's challenging year.\nOn the next slide, let's touch on the key progress on our strategy. We are strategically building scale in Europe, now representing around 18% of group's customers and 10% of turnover. Our commitment to pricing discipline, particularly through significant rate increases since 2022 has resulted in improved loss ratios versus market in France and Spain. While as previously mentioned, in Italy, this has not been sufficient to fully offset yet the worsening loss ratio. We're also focused on operational efficiency, achieving across Europe, a 24% reduction in motor servicing cost per policy since 2019 despite strong inflation. And our investments in technology, including a market-leading telephony system and cloud-based data platform are driving synergies and efficiency gains.\nIn L'olivier, we are progressively expanding into household insurance, metering our successful U.K. direct-to-consumer and multiproduct strategy. In Spain and Italy, we are making significant progress including the broker opportunity gap through refined propositions and portfolio optimization. Crucially, we continue to deliver market-leading customer service across all European markets.\nTurning to the next slide and to Elephant. The U.S. market has been softer and face increased competition. And in this context, we delivered $80 million profit, a significant turnaround from last year's $24 million loss. This was driven by the consistent and effective execution of our turnaround plan announced last year. While we experienced a reduction in top line growth due to our focus on margins, the rate of policy shrinkage has slowed, and we expect it to stabilize in 2025 when we will continue to prioritize profitability. And as I commented a few minutes ago, we are in excellent talks with a potential acquirer to sell the business.\nIn summary, we have seen strong performance in L'olivier and improved outcomes in Admiral Seguros, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategies. We are actively addressing the challenges in ConTe with a focus turnaround plan. In the U.S., we achieved a nice profit improvement, showcasing our ability to adapt and execute.\nAcross all European businesses, we remain committed to continue to improve margins while building scale and excelling at customer satisfaction. Overall, we are confident in our strategic direction and our ability to deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Thanks. Now I hand it over to Scott to present Admiral Money.\n\nScott Cargill\n\nChief Executive Officer of Admiral Money\n\nThank you, Costa. Good morning, everyone. Firstly, I'm pleased to see it's been a very nice year for Admiral Money. I'll start with a few highlights. Throughout the year, we retained a firm focus on prime lending and continue to prioritize a controlled and a conservative approach to growth. Our book at end of December stands at GBP 1.17 billion. That's 23% growth since full year and our credit performance has been more than satisfactory with a full year cost of risk of 2.5%. .\nThis has been our third consecutive year of growing profits achieved whilst maintaining an appropriately conservative IFRS 9 provision. We continue to focus on being the lender of choice for Admiral insurance customers. with now over 6% to 8% of new business coming from current or recently lapsed U.K. insurance customers. And importantly, we're able to confirm the completion of our first third-party capital deal, signed in February and unlocking the ability to grow the business off balance sheet. I'll provide a bit more detail on that in a moment.\nSo coming into the year, we knew there would be continued uncertainty with the higher interest rate environment. We continued our philosophy of protecting our margin and ensuring strong risk resiliency in our pricing. Our net interest margin finished the year a healthy 650 bps. And combined with strong growth in balance has increased our gross income to GBP 113 million. That's 19% higher than 2023. Combined with a solid credit performance, we are reporting a profit of GBP 13 million for the year.\nAs I mentioned, 6% to 8% of new customer flows in 2024 came from Admiral Insurance customers. We achieved this by working closely with the U.K. insurance team. Our goal to be the lender of choice for Admiral Insurance customers is a key pillar of our strategy, and we're expanding our advantage there through greater insight and tailoring our offering making us increasingly competitive for them compared to other lenders. That's where we have the most significant and sustainable competitive advantage, both through direct sales and by searching for them in open market channels.\nThe chart on the bottom left shows that the loss ratio delta between Admiral customers and non-Admiral customers continues to widen demonstrating the advantage of the incremental data and the incremental understanding we have of them. Our NPS score of 75 also pays a very nice point of evidence to our commitment to providing certainty and transparency to Admiral customers on their lending needs is more than meeting their expectations. Let alone strategy. So when we set out Admiral strategy in 2018, we identified 4 key ingredients to create an Admiral like lender. Over the last 7 years, we have made solid progress improving the as pricing and credit excellence, expense efficiency and product differentiation.\nI'm delighted to see us take our first step towards the fourth, which is using third-party capital to enhance capital efficiency. I'm pleased to confirm our first off-balance sheet deal, which is a forward flow agreement with a major U.K. bank. It consists of GBP 150 million back book and GBP 300 million per annum which completely transfers the loan risk of Admiral's balance sheet and exchange for origination and servicing fees.\nThis model provides a travel benefit. It is accretive to return on capital. accelerated profit recognition and enables future growth beyond the group's balance sheet parameters. I've added a slide in the appendix on Page 16, which gives a bit more detail of how it all works. Looking to 2025, we enter with strong momentum, and I expect to see continued growth of up to GBP 1.3 billion on balance sheet and total loans under management growing to up to GBP 1.6 billion. Thank you very much. I'll pass to Milena.\n\nMilena Mondini-de-Focatiis\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Scott. Congratulations on another good year for Admiral Money. So to summarize, an outstanding year with record turnover, record customer number and record profits. This was driven by our U.K. Motor business, but also with an acceleration beyond Motor. We continue -- and we will continue to innovate for our customers and continue to be focused on developing future-proof capabilities.\nThe market help was more favorable in 2024, but it is softening. We will continue to steer the business as we've always done in the past with discipline and with agility to continue to build on this year and long track record of success. Thank you, and we're now happy to take any questions. [Operator Instructions]",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings call for ADM. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast.\nSome of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation and the materials. To the extent permitted by law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements due to new information or future events.\nIn addition, during today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are available on our earnings press release and presentation slides, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the ADM website. Please turn to Slide 4.\nI'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Megan. Hello, and welcome to all who have joined the call. We sincerely appreciate your patience as we work expeditiously to amend the company's fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024. We are pleased to now be able to share more context about our 2024 year-to-date financial results and our outlook. Even though we're holding this call later than usual, we're also in a position to provide qualitative color on how the fourth quarter is progressing.\nTo start, let's recap our financial results for the company. ADM reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, and a total segment operating profit of $1 billion. This brings adjusted earnings per share to $3.61, and our total segment operating profit to $3.2 billion year-to-date for 2024. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 8.8%.\nAlthough we made progress on several important initiatives in 2024, these results are not consistent with the high bar that we have set for our team. While we have seen a decline in our total segment operating profit and a decline in operating cash flow before working capital changes, due to lower net earnings relative to the prior year period, disciplined management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In total, we have returned $3.1 billion to our shareholders with $744 million in the form of dividends and $2.3 billion in share repurchases year-to-date in 2024.\nNext slide, please. Entering 2024 we laid out key priorities for value creation based on the year [indiscernible] that we saw ahead of us. And as we moved into the fourth quarter, it's clear that certain expectations have not all played out as anticipated. The global commodity landscape has continued to shift, stronger-than-expected supply has driven commodity prices down further than anticipated. Canola crush margins have been negatively impacted by regulatory uncertainty and higher seed prices.\nIn addition, China has begun to increase local commodity production and has had a slower pace of demand recovery, negatively impacting the trade of certain commodities and update of Animal Nutrition solutions. We're also seeing the trailing effects of inflation in part of our business. Some new Nutrition projects have been delayed as some customers look for opportunities to manage costs by simplifying their consumer offerings. We have also seen some softness in demand in other end markets such as pet treats and energy drinks, where consumers are prioritizing their discretionary spending.\nThe global regulatory environment has led to additional uncertainties. Programs such as [indiscernible] and the U.S. producers tax credit are still not fully in place, which has left various stakeholders in the ag supply chain without the confidence of a clear path forward. Beyond these external factors creating downward pressure, we're also managing through a balance of both positive and challenging results across our own operational environment.\nIn Carbohydrate Solutions, we've been able to improve production throughout the network in part due to advancements in automation and digitization at the plant level as well as by finding synergies across our milling network. We've seen similar improvements in our crush facilities in LatAm and EMEA, but this has been offset to date by the fact that opportunities previously identified in some of our U.S. plants have been taking longer than expected to be completed.\nHowever, in October, we began to see improvements in unplanned downtime in our U.S. facilities. Nutrition has continued to manage through the downtime of our Decatur East facility, where our expected ramp-up has been delayed from the end of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025 as safe restoration of operations is a top priority. And while the integration of our most recent flavor acquisitions has driven positive results, we have experienced demand fulfillment issues due to the complexity of other integration efforts. We believe that our business is well positioned to grow alongside enduring global trends such as the expansion of functional food and beverage alternatives, the replacement of petroleum-based products across multiple industries and the broader opportunity associated with decarbonization.\nAs we look at the near term in 2025, however, we anticipate that we could still be managing through a challenging cycle, and we have already begun taking necessary productivity actions with a clear focus on cost and cash management. This slide highlights several of the areas we have already taken action on in 2024, along with additional actions we are aggressively driving at the end of the year. As we manage through the current cycle, we've seen success in delivering expansion across strategic initiatives such as [indiscernible] and destination marketing, which achieved record volume handled in October, supporting supply and demand needs through increasing capacity.\nThis is example in our Spiritwood facility, which has achieved near full run rates in the month of October and in ramping up the Drive for Execution Excellence program, which has already begun to deliver toward our cost-saving goals. Moving forward, as we expand our focus on procurement and execution excellence, we believe that we can double this program's target cost savings over the next few years. In addition, the automation and digitization efforts that have already achieved millions in cost savings are being scoped and accelerated across the other plants in our footprint.\nTurning to Nutrition's recovery efforts. To date, we have strengthened our operational leadership driven simplification and optimization opportunities and continue to expand our pipeline and win rates in part of the portfolio such as flavors. These efforts are now being supplemented to increase the pace of recovery. We have placed additional focus on demand generation, supply chain improvement and rightsizing our production to better flex to the needs of a dynamic demand environment.\nAnd finally, from a strategic capital allocation perspective, we have already accelerated our return of cash to shareholders this year in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Going forward, we're being extremely prudent and focusing our attention on cash generation opportunities, while considering specific portfolio optimization efforts to simplify operations, enhance our focus and drive an improvement in ROIC. Along with all these actions, Monish joining us, CFO, has already brought new perspectives to the team. We are using this experience to help identify and accelerate path for continuous recovery.\nWith this, let me pass to Monish for a more detailed financial review. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Juan. First, I would like to take a moment to say how excited I am to be joining the ADM team at such an important point in the company's trajectory. While I've only been on the job for a few months, I have enjoyed the opportunity to personally engage with our teams and learn the company. I want to thank all my ADM colleagues for their warm welcome.\nTurning to Slide 6. On a year-to-date basis, AS&O segment operating profit of $1.8 billion was 42% lower versus the prior year period as ample supplies out of South America have driven lower commodity prices and margins across the segment. Ag Services subsegment operating profit of $461 was 52% lower versus the prior year, driven by lower South American origination margins and volumes, in part due to industry [ take-or-pay ] contracts. The stabilization of trade flows has also led to fewer opportunities in our global trade business, leading to lower results.\nCrushing subsegment operating profit of $632 million was 30% lower versus the prior year period. Slower farmer selling and lower crush rates in Argentina, coupled with solid demand has supported soy crush margins, leading to a year-to-date executed soy crush margin of approximately $50 per metric ton, which is lower compared to the prior year. While year-to-date executed canola crush margins are lower by approximately $15 per ton compared to the prior year, margins have moderated significantly in the second half of the year so far. As higher seed prices and regulatory uncertainty drove lower margins. There were net negative timing impact of approximately $120 million year-over-year.\nIn the refined products and other subsegment, increased pretreatment capacity at renewable diesel facilities and higher imports of used cooking oil has negatively impacted both refining and biodiesel margins leading to subsegment operating profit that was 58% lower versus the prior year. There were net negative timing impacts of approximately $360 million year-over-year.\nAs we look forward, we anticipate AS&O fourth quarter results to be lower than the prior year quarter. The seasonal shift to our North American weighted footprint and strong North American crop should be supportive of volumes. But recent elevation margins are below the levels we expected when we put our guidance in place in November.\nIn crushing, the ramp-up of our Spiritwood facility is expected to support high single-digit volume improvement. However, we expect lower results due to lower soya and canola crush margins versus the prior year. The addition of new pretreatment capacity has continued to weigh on margins within the RPO business and on the food oil side, margins for free-to-sell opportunities have been under pressure due to increased competition.\nBased on the information available today, we also anticipate 100% reinsurance proceeds of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter related to both Decatur West and East. We continue to monitor the impact of uncertainty related to regulation and trade flows on the operating environment as we look forward to the end of the year.\nYear-to-date, Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit of $1.1 billion in the year-to-date period was roughly in line with the prior year as lower margins in the EMEA region and ethanol were mostly offset by strong volumes and improved manufacturing costs. As we look forward, a strong North American corn supply and robust export demand is expected to be supportive of VCP. However, North American ethanol production continues to outpace demand, driving lower margins. We expect to see solid demand and margins in North American Starches and Sweeteners as we finish the year.\nWheat milling margins are expected to moderate from elevated prior year levels. Based on information available today, we also anticipate 100% insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter related to both Decatur East and West incident of approximately $35 million. Taken together, we anticipate the Carbohydrate Solutions fourth quarter results to be in line with the prior year period.\nYear-to-date, revenues from Nutrition were $5.6 billion, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an organic basis, segment revenue was down 3%. Human Nutrition was flat organically as headwinds related to Decatur East and texturants pricing offset growth in flavors and health and [indiscernible]. Animal Nutrition revenue declined 5%, driven by unfavorable mix, negative currency impacts in Brazil and lower volumes due to demand fulfillment challenges. Year-to-date, Nutrition subsegment operating profit of $298 million was 32% lower versus the prior year. Human Nutrition results of $265 million were 40% lower compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by unplanned downtime at Decatur East. Animal Nutrition results of $33 million was slightly higher compared to the prior year due to an improvement in margins.\nAs we finish the year, we expect continued weak consumer demand, lower texturants prices and ongoing operational challenges to be a headwind. And as Juan previously mentioned, we now anticipate the startup of our Decatur East facility to be delayed until the first quarter of 2025. We expect the impact of prolonged downtime [ adecatories ] to be partially offset by 100% reinsurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of approximately $50 million, based on the information available today. We expect Animal Nutrition results in the fourth quarter to be better than the prior year with tailwinds from our turnaround efforts and as we continue to work through operational challenges in pet solutions. Taken together, we expect Nutrition results for the fourth quarter likely lower than the third quarter of 2024, but to be higher than the prior year, which had negative impact of approximately $64 million in nonrecurring items.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Year-to-date in 2024, the company has generated cash flow from operations before working capital of approximately $2.3 billion, down relative to the same period last year due to lower segment operating profit. Despite the decline, solid cash generation has supported our ability to invest in our business and return excess cash to shareholders. Year-to-date, the company has returned $3.1 billion in cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases, allocated $1.1 billion to capital expenditures and nearly $1 billion to M&A announced in 2023 and completed in January 2024.\nOur capital structure continues to provide the financial flexibility to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders. We continue to see opportunities to drive enhanced cash generation through operating improvements, both in our facilities and through better management of working capital. We believe investing in organic opportunities gives us the best return. While we will always look at opportunistic M&A as a way to enhance returns, it is essential that we prioritize maximizing returns from the assets that we have already acquired and also ensuring that we are the best owners of all our assets.\nNow let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on Slide 8. In early November, we announced that we lowered our full year 2024 adjusted earnings per share guidance to the range of $4.50 per share to $5 per share. The lowering of our guide takes into account our year-to-date results and headwinds from slow market demand and internal operational challenges. Additionally, we now anticipate our corporate cost to be in within the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion primarily due to lower incentive compensation and our corporate net interest expense to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. We now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $1.5 billion. We are also increasing our effective tax rate guidance to the range of 20% to 22% due to the nondeductible impairment of Wilmar taken in the third quarter. Our expectations for our leverage ratio and D&A are unchanged.\nLet's turn to Slide 9 to close the call with a reflection on the key priorities that we are driving with our team to deliver improvement and enhance returns.\nFirst, my top priority is ensuring integrity and accuracy in our internal controls and financial reporting. I echo Juan's earlier statement and add my particular thanks for the extraordinary efforts of our team to amend and file the restated financials for fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K and Form 10-Qs for the first and second quarters of 2024. We are continuing to focus on implementing enhancements to our internal controls to remediate the previously identified material weakness and are taking action to enhance the integrity and accuracy within internal controls and financial reporting related to intersegment sales.\nAmong other things, the design and documentation of the execution of pricing and measurement and reporting controls for segment disclosure purposes, and projected financial information used in impairment analysis have been enhanced and the testing of these controls will continue throughout the balance of the year. Further, training for relevant personnel on the measurement of intersegment sales and application of relevant accounting guidance to intersegment sales has been provided and remains ongoing.\nIn the broader category of improving focus and execution, the team will remain adaptable and focus on items within our control. On the cost side, we are optimizing our cost structure and enhancing operational resilience initiatives. In this way, we have the opportunity to create a more cohesive digital strategy. Today, we have invested in numerous efforts to improve our systems and enable a more digital footing for our business. However, we have the opportunity to connect these efforts to accelerate outcomes around how we serve our customers, upgrade our assets and run the enterprise, while also delivering structural cost improvement.\nSimilarly, we have room in our portfolio and broader asset network to optimize through targeted divestitures or rationalization, and we are evaluating numerous actions that we could take to improve our footprint performance and generate cash. We will also maintain a sharp focus on working capital management to further strengthen our cash position.\nLastly, we'll remain disciplined in capital allocation, seeking opportunities to drive ROIC and enhance returns. I see maintaining our capital discipline as essential to value creation. We will work to ensure that we maintain a healthy balance sheet that continues to create strong cash flow and that we rigor investment opportunities appropriately by applying a stage-gated model to ensure that we're achieving key milestones and meeting our return objectives to continue to invest.\nIn closing, I want to take a moment to thank our ADM colleagues for their hard work and dedication this quarter. I am optimistic that today we can successfully tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy and focus on delivering value for our shareholders.\nWith that, we look forward to taking your questions. Operator, please open the line for our first question.",

    "content": "Half Year 2024 Admiral Group PLC Earnings Call\n\nHalf Year 2024 Admiral Group PLC Earnings Call\n\nADMLONDONAUG 15, 4:30 AM\n\nMilena Mondini-de-Focatiis\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nGood. So welcome, everybody, to Admiral 2024 Half Year Results. It's another year of strong results combined with sustained growth, increased margins and continuous progress against our strategic objectives.\nI'll start with the key highlights, followed by Geraint, Cristina and Costantino, who will tell us more about the key financials. U.K. Insurance and International business, respectively. Scott, Admiral Money CEO, is also in the audience if you want to grab him after the presentation and ask him questions on our lending business that had another very strong semester.\nSo last year, we celebrated our 30 years anniversary. So soon we'll be celebrating our 20 years anniversary on London Stock Exchange. It has been a story of profitable growth with 10x the number of customers and GBP 5.6 billion of dividends shared with our shareholders since floating. And this is a story underpinned by a mix of technical competence, agility, but most of all, a unique culture.\nSix months ago, we anticipated to be in a good position to capture more market share and margins. Today we report 43% growth in turnover and 32% in pretax profit. Customer number increased 12% year-on-year to an 8-digit figure of 10.5 million.\nU.K. Motor insurance is the main driver of both these achievements, leveraging on a stronger and earlier response than market to inflation. We've also improved results in International business, but with a different mix than previous years. Beyond Motor, we are continuing to build on a strong momentum and growing contribution to the bottom line.\nWe made good progress on our strategic agenda too. We are strongly capitalized with a solvency ratio of 198%. And looking ahead, we continue to be in a good position in a softening market with inflation still elevated but reducing.\nAs already mentioned, U.K. Motor insurance was the biggest driver of our improved performance. In the last 6 months, we added more than 0.5 million motor policies to our book, leveraging on strong competitive position on price comparison site. This, combined with substantially higher average premiums, resulted in turnover growth over 50%. As price and inflation decrease, the market is becoming more competitive, and we expect slower growth in the second half.\nOverseas our results were mixed. In Europe, the market is taking longer than U.K. to recover. We believe anyhow market condition will improve, and reiterate our confidence for continuous profitable growth in the future.\nIn Italy, there has been a higher-than-anticipated increase in the court values of reference for BI settlement. This impacted ConTe results that reported a small loss for the first time in the last 10 years. The team adopted a prudent approach in reserving, and we expect to return to profitability soon.\nOn the other side, very strong performance in France, increasing margins and growing to more than 0.5 million customers. Spain continued to make good progress, too.\nLast, as a result of strong focus on loss ratio and expenses and strong execution of our Elephant team, our U.S. business reported a profit in the first half. In terms of the way forward for Elephant, we are considering the right outcome for the business and our team, and we'll update you as soon as possible. But in the meantime, we remain very focused on protecting the bottom line.\nLooking now beyond motor. Diversifying our portfolio is very important to us, not only to improve the resilience of the business to external trends, but also to better support the customers and to strengthen the core business. Customers with more product indeed have higher persistency and substantially higher lifetime value.\nLet's take a closer look at our more established business in U.K. Beyond Motor, so household, lending and pet -- sorry, household, lending and travel. In the last 2 years, we almost doubled the turnover from GBP 160 million to GBP 310 million, and added almost 1 million customers. They delivered jointly GBP 18 million of profits in the last 6 months with around 6% margins, while growing at the same time almost 40% year-on-year. Cristina will tell us more later about the progress in household.\nAdmiral Money also had a positive half year, proving its ability to adapt across different market conditions, and continue to be on a strong path for further growth and increasing profitability.\nOur main focus looking ahead is on unlocking more commercial and pricing synergies with a single view of the customer and for the customer. At the same time, we continue to grow our younger business, like pet and small business insurance. Pet almost tripled customers in the last year to more than 100,000, and we are continuing to focus on transferring technical competence from the core to these newer lines of business.\nMore Than acquisition has now been completed, and we are happy to see how the teams are working together, and now we are starting the integration phase. This transaction has the potential to bring us close to double-digit market share both in household and pet. For context, it took Admiral 17 years to reach the same goal in motor.\nSo as mentioned, we continue to make progress at pace on our strategic objective. Just a few examples here. I already touched on diversification in the previous slide. We continue to stay close to key trends in mobility. Our electric vehicle book continued to grow and perform well. We've also continued to evolve our offering for temporary insurance subscription for the younger generations with our Veyga brand. And we signed a partnership with Flock to bring real-time risk management to fleet insurance.\nOur foundational pillar is Admiral 2.0 to evolve our core and technical competence, leveraging our new data and technology. We are massively proud of how much we evolved our capabilities in the last 3, 4 years. Our focus now is on unlocking the benefit of scaled agile implementation for faster delivery and an investment done in data foundation, mainly for predictive AI applied to pricing and underwriting.\nWe doubled indeed the number of machine learning models released, and having seen the strong benefit of new pricing model in U.K., we're implementing it in our European business too. Next frontier will be Gen AI where we're training, testing, learning and moving in production successful pilots. Overall, we feel we have a very efficient flexible platform to continue to evolve our business.\nBut as you can see in the slide, anyhow, at the core of our strategy is our customer and our people. So we're very pleased to continue receiving great feedback from our customers with top 2 place in Trustpilot score across U.K. and Continental Europe and the Net Promoter Score across the Group over 45.\nOur people and culture remain the key competitive advantage of the Group, with recognitions such as Great Place to Work in all geographies, and additional awards for well-being, diversity and innovation.\nOur targets for climate change have been approved by SBTi and we confirm our commitment to reduce emission for Scope 1 and 2 by 70% by 2030.\nI'm pleased to report that a few days ago, our MSCI rating also improved to AAA.\nAnd to Geraint now to deep-dive in our key financial results.\n\nGeraint Jones\n\nCFO & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Milena. Good morning, everyone. So I'll cover some of the main features of the results from a quite positive first half. I'll look at some of the highlights, the Group and U.K. income statements, the key loss ratios, very healthy half year capital position, and an increased interim dividend.\nThese are some of the highlights to start us off. As you've seen, profit was up quite significantly. We see continued positive back-year development, a materially better current year combined ratio, and higher net investment income. Pretax profit and earnings per share were both up around 1/3 to GBP 310 million and 77.5p per share. Solvency remains strong, just under 200%. And we're declaring a nearly 40% increase in the interim dividend to 71p per share following our usual approach to dividends.\nReturn on equity increases nicely to 45%, in line with the increased profits despite some growth in the equity as the businesses grew.\nOn the bottom, we show the main turnover and customer metrics. Turnover in U.K. Motor and Home was up very strongly. In Motor, we saw a combination of a further increase in average premium, coupled with strong market share gain in H1. And a similar -- a slightly less dramatic story in Home.\nOutside the U.K., we saw modest reductions in turnover and customer numbers as price increases impacted volumes. And in Admiral Money, our loans balances were back in line with the level of a year earlier.\nIn aggregate across the Group, customer numbers were up 12% and increased by more than 1 million over the last year to 10.5 million. As usual, we'll cover these metrics in more detail as we move throughout the presentation.\nMoving now to look at the positive first half profit. This slide shows the results by business versus the last H1. Starting in the U.K. where we see the biggest change. Motor profit was GBP 60 million higher, I'll cover that shortly. Home profit was up to GBP 11 million with an improved current period combined ratio and positive reserve releases. And remember that effectively all of the H1 profit last year was a one-off reinsurer profit commission. And so the improved performance is bigger than it seems. Turnover was nearly 40% higher, and good growth in Home continues.\nAcross the international businesses, the total results improved by just under GBP 10 million, though the mix was a bit different, as you can see. Starting in Europe, the result there was impacted by a disappointing loss ratio in H1 in Italy, a big part of which was due to the update to the Milan court tables, which govern most injury claim settlements. The net impact of that was around GBP 12 million. ConTe made a loss in the first half.\nMore positively, L'Olivier in France grew turnover quite nicely, and the Motor business more than doubled its profit. And in Spain, the business continues to grow and diversify distribution, whilst the P&L was near breakeven. Positive performance.\nMoving to the U.S. The Elephant result was significantly better than in H1 '23, our team very much delivering on the objective to materially improve the bottom line, though the business is smaller.\nAdmiral Money enjoyed another positive 6 months, making a profit of around GBP 7 million. It's more than double last half year. Loan balances grew again in the first half after reducing in H2 last year. And all is generally very satisfactory. Good cost/income ratio, positive arrears trends, prudent credit loss provisions. Further detail is set out in the appendix.\nThe loss from Admiral Pioneer more than halved as the result in Veyga improved whilst that business continues to grow impressively. And we continue to invest modestly in Admiral business.\nThere are some notes on the page on the right-hand side on share scheme costs and the other items. And as usual, we include a fuller breakdown of the other items in the appendix. And we do call out 1 or 2 nonrecurring items, as you can see.\nNext, we'll look at U.K. Motor in more detail. So this is a summarized income statement, observations on the main changes. Firstly, as we saw earlier, turnover was up very significantly, and that results from a combination of higher volumes and much higher average premiums. Secondly, as the investment portfolio is reinvested at higher yields, we see a further increase in the average rate of return on the assets, just under 4% for the first half, but also high discount unwind, which partly offsets.\nThird, co-insure profit commission. The lower amount this half is mainly because we're not recognizing profit commission on '23 or '24 years yet. And that's due to the still high booked ratios on '21 and '22. And then on to the ratios. We see good improvements in the reported loss and expense ratios, and that's predominantly driven by higher premiums offsetting the high claims inflation over the past couple of years.\nAnd then on the bottom right, we show the split of the reported loss ratio into the current year and the releases. And it's quite a notable change here with a significantly lower current year ratio versus last half. And then despite being quite consistent in absolute terms, the contribution in percentage terms from releases is lower because of the much higher premiums.\nLet's look in a bit more detail at U.K. Motor loss ratios. Here we show our usual 2 charts, both on an underwriting year basis and they're discounted, best estimate on the left, booked on the right. And we show the undiscounted ratios here in the appendix, and they show consistent movements.\nMy observations would be, firstly, we see very good improvement in the best estimate of '23. That's in line with our expectation for that year in this half given the pattern and the scale of the rate increases. And the book ratio has also moved down, and we expect further improvement to come in '23, possibly not to the same extent that we saw in the first half, which was very strong.\nYears before 2023 have continued to develop in line with our expectations. And 2020 and prior underwriting year should now be quite stable.\nQuick word on 2024. Obviously, it's quite early to comment on 2024, but you might observe on the right-hand side in the bullet that the first booking on that year is quite low. Don't extrapolate from it. It's likely to increase in the second half. And actually, right now, based on what we see today, we don't expect much difference in the ultimate loss ratios for the '23 and the '24 underwriting years.\nOn severity, we see signs of it easing in the first half, but we don't expect big changes this year. We haven't changed our view of '23, and we expect high single-digit inflation in the first half of '24. Cristina will cover more on claims trends shortly.\nWe have held the level of risk adjustment in the booked reserves flat at the half year, in line with '23 year-end. And so we still sit in the upper end of our policy range. That's a very prudent position.\nAnd then finally, reserve releases, as I mentioned, in absolute terms are strong, quite comparable with the first half of '23. And as usual, all being well, we expect significant releases to continue, including from some gradual reduction in the risk adjustment strength. The percentage though is very likely to be lower than in past years because of the very large increase in premiums.\nMoving now to look at capital and dividend. On the left, we show the bridge of the solvency ratio from full year '23 to half year '24. We see very significant capital generation in the first half due to the much improved current year performance. The impact of the higher capital requirement due to growth was around 25 points. As flagged, there was an 11-point reduction in the ratio as a result of completing the More Than acquisition. And then the final step is accounting for the interim dividend. And all that means quite a consistent and really healthy position at just under 200%.\nOn the internal model, we have entered the pre-application process with our regulators. And that's a positive step towards making the full application for approval in due course. And then on the right, these are the dividend details. We've declared a dividend of 71p a share. It's about GBP 230 million in total, and it's roughly 92% of the first half profit after tax. And there's no change to report on our approach to dividends.\nTo wrap up with a few key messages from the financials. After a challenging couple of years for claims costs, our strong pricing response has led to much improved loss and combined ratios and higher profitability. In the U.K., comfort with margins enabled us to reduce prices around the start of the year and take share. We've maintained a very cautious reserve position. And we end the half with a very healthy capital position having declared a 40% increase in the interim dividend.\nOver to Cristina now to talk us through the U.K.\n\nCristina Nestares\n\nChief Executive Officer of UK Insurance\n\nThank you, Geraint. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk about the U.K. insurance results in more detail.\nLet me start by saying that we have had very good growth in all our products in the first half of the year. And having more products in the U.K. insurance is proving very positive for our customers. We see strong retention and very healthy year-on-year growth. Also for Admiral, having more data points per customer allow us to do a better risk selection.\nIn this context, the More Than acquisition of the [indiscernible] rights for household and pet, I'm pleased to say it's going well. We have welcomed around 300 new colleagues at the start of the year, and we have started with renewing these customers. In household, we started a couple of weeks ago, and in pet, we will start in a few days. So as you can tell, very early days.\nMoving to motor pricing. For the market, we have included 2 graphs at this time. The first graph, in blue, this is ABI data that includes new business and renewal premiums. And the comparison that we're making is year-on-year. The second graph, it's for Confused. It only includes new business prices, and the comparison we're making is quarter-on-quarter, to be able to show you better the trends we're seeing in the first half. So as you can see, the Confused data indicates that prices have started to decrease in the first half of the year.\nThe graph on the right, that is a graph that we saw many times, it's time stopped, which is the percentage of times we are cheapest on [ navigators ] and it's indexed to the beginning of 2022.\nIf we start focusing on the second half of '23, the market continued to increase its prices while we remain broadly flat. And that made us or allow us to become very competitive. Also, at the start of the year, we decreased rates by mid-single digits, reflecting improved claims experience. And then from March this year, we're seeing competitors decreasing prices when we have stayed broadly flat, which meant we are becoming less competitive.\nAlso, it's worth to highlight that the growth in the first half has been helped by strong retention and also by a very healthy new business market. Let's now move to motor claims and start by looking at the different aspects of [ damage ] inflation.\nIn terms of frequency for the market, it continues to be around 10% to 15% below pre-pandemic levels. Even though when you look at miles driven, it's already very close to where we were before COVID.\nThe reasons why frequency is small is there are 3. The first one is increased technology in vehicles. It's a constant trend that we've seen for many years, but it is frequency. The second one is change in driving habits. And then the third one, it's the [indiscernible] regulation, which has reduced the frequency for small BI claims.\nIn terms of claims inflation for the market, it remains elevated, although we're seeing certain sites that it is [ stopping ]. For example, secondhand vehicle values have reduced in the last 12 months and have now stabilized.\nIn terms of repair inflation, it also remains high, but it has reduced slightly, thanks to increased repair capacity and parts availability. For the future, we expect repair inflation to continue high as vehicles increase the technology.\nAnd then for Admiral, our repair network is performing very well and is helping us to further strengthen our advantage versus the market.\nMoving to bodily injury. Inflation is in line with our expectations and is largely restricted to increases to pain and suffering awards. We were pleased with the Supreme Court decision on whiplash and it was within our forecast. So we made no changes to our reserves. We hope settlements will increase given that we have now more certainty.\nWe also anticipate an uplift in the whiplash tariff in the coming 6 to 12 months. However, this will need government regulation -- sorry, legislation.\nAlso, we expect [indiscernible] clarity by no later than January 25, but we have not adjusted our reserves or our prices so far.\nAnd we continue to monitor large BI trends, particular commercially carry cost and increases to general damages. And we remain prudently reserved for potential inflationary pressures in this area.\nAnd now a few words on total loans. In line with the FCA [indiscernible] review on these claims, we have been reviewing and refining our processes. The work is still ongoing, but we don't expect it to have a significant impact on our accounts. And we have included an appropriate provision in our H1 results.\nLet's move to the household business. The market has started to see elevated inflation already in '22, driven by increases in the cost of raw materials. And that was -- there was even more pressure because of the freeze event in December '22. And that put a lot of pressure in our capacity for those claims, but also for the cost of freeze claims -- sorry, for the claims which are similar, like [ escape awards ].\nThe market responded by increasing rates after a long time of being broadly flat, leading to elevated levels of customer switching. Admiral increased rates slightly ahead of the market both in '23 and in the first half of '24. And despite these strong increases, we continue to grow with a strong retention.\nWe're very pleased with the development of our current -- with our current year loss ratio. It has improved 6 points year-on-year driven by higher premium earnings through and weather development. And all of this has resulted in a good profit of GBP 11 million in the first half, and it puts the household business in a strong position for the remainder of the year.\nNow to finalize, let's look ahead, starting with Motor. We're seeing prices to continue to decrease in the market in Q3, and we expect this trend to continue. However, it's hard for us to tell for how long as we're seeing different strategies across competitors. For Admiral, we expect to continue growing for the rest of the year, but at a lower rate than in the first half.\nWe're comfortable with our current margin, and we're very happy with the business we have written in the first half. We will continue, as always, monitoring trends in our own claims development and also in the market, and adapt our rates accordingly. We anticipate that inflation could improve slightly over the second half. However, some volatility still remains.\nAnd for household, during the second half, we expect both market and Admiral to increase prices, although at a slower rate than in the first half. Our pricing as in Motor will continue to reflect inflation, our internal and external views, weather and other factors. And we expect inflation to remain high in the second half, but to slow down a bit, always subject to weather uncertainty.\nAs always, we remain focused on pricing discipline, prioritizing medium-term profitability, and maintaining a fuller approach to claims [indiscernible]. And now over to Costi to talk to us more about our International results.\n\nCostantino Moretti\n\nChief Executive Officer of International Insurance\n\nThank you, Cristina, and good morning, everyone. In Europe, we experienced lower motor profits driven by the deterioration of loss ratios in Italy during the first half of this year. However, at the same time, we have seen positive momentum in France, with a solid performance from L'Olivier, demonstrating accelerated profitability. And in Spain, with Admiral Seguros approaching breakeven.\nI'm pleased to report that our focus on efficiencies and expense management is paying dividends, as reflected in improved expense metrics. We continue to invest strategically in digital, data and analytics, which is enhancing our competitive position. Moreover, we are making good progress with our diversification strategy in intermediary distribution in Italy and in Spain, as well as in household insurance in France.\nAs anticipated in our last meeting, we are targeting the second quarter of 2025 for our in-depth presentation of our European businesses. More logistical details will be communicated in due course. In the United States, we have seen a significant improvement in performance, driven by a strong execution and a focus on margins.\nMoving to the next slide. Let's discuss our European businesses. We have navigated the economic cycle with diligence, increasing prices ahead of both competitors and inflation. As a result, we have seen a slight reduction in our customer base, alongside solid growth in turnover, reflecting our commitment to protecting margins over pursuing pure growth. While we observed improved inflation trends, the market remain competitive and challenging.\nStarting with Italy, it's important to briefly provide some context. The market has faced severe challenges reaching the negative peak of the cycle over the last 2 years. The drivers of this poor market performance include the record-low average premium reached post COVID, which has recovered more slowly than inflation, and the new guidelines for BI claim settlement costs issued by the Milano court on June 24.\nIn this context, ConTe has materially outperformed the direct market, but it has not been immune to this unprecedented situation. As you can see in the chart at the bottom left of the slide, we have taken a conservative reserving position and also strong actions with double-digit rate increases and portfolio penetration, and we are seeing our average premium grow strongly and faster than the market one.\nTherefore, we are confident that ConTe will recover its profitability over time, leveraging our proven competitive advantages that have made the business profitable every year for the last decade.\nOn a positive note, higher profits from L'Olivier have resulted from strong loss ratio performance as price increases done in 2023 took effect, with customer numbers up 10% to over 0.5 million. We are also continuing to invest in our household product, aiming to build a solid direct-to-consumer multiproduct business that is well recognized and appreciated by our customers.\nIn Spain, Admiral Seguros had a positive first half, progressing towards breakeven, thanks to sustained rate increases over the last 2 years, continued direct business profits and significantly reduced losses on new investments in brokers and partnerships. Overall, our focus on efficiency continues to pay off with motor customers per full-time employee up 3% year-on-year despite a decrease in customer numbers.\nFinally, we have made good progress in our tech and data strategies, enhancing our competitive positioning in digital and analytics, with the goal of reinforcing risk selection and portfolio management capabilities, as well as gaining more efficiencies while better serving our customers.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with the overall progress made. Despite short-term results being impacted by tough market conditions in Italy, we remain confident in the potential of our European business to deliver meaningful returns to our shareholders.\nMoving on to the next slide, let's discuss Elephant, our U.S. business. As Milena mentioned, we are continuing to prioritize margins over growth. Elephant has shown materially improved performance by focusing on pricing, underwriting, claims and expense management. The U.S. market has seen continued easing of inflation, but increased competition has driven direct market acquisition costs up.\nFor the first half of '24, we achieved a profit of $3.8 million compared to a loss of $12.8 million in the same period last year. This significant improvement was driven by price increases implemented in 2023, which are now taking effect, along with continued cost discipline, better risk selection and strong execution.\nDespite adverse top line performance due to reduced competitiveness and lower advertising spend, we remain focused on maintaining margins.\nThank you. And I'll hand over to Milena for the wrap-up.\n\nMilena Mondini-de-Focatiis\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nGood. Thanks, Costantino. So to summarize, another set of strong results with record turnover, record customer number and improved margin. Once again, we demonstrated agility, effective management across the cycle, anticipating market pricing strategy and taking market share at the right time.\nWe're building optionality for the future with [indiscernible] line of business growing profitably. We continue to strengthen our foundation for lean delivery and improved customer experience. We remain prudently reserved, strongly capitalized and well positioned for the future as uncertainty remain and our core market become more competitive.\nOur strength is our culture, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Admiral crew that delivered these excellent set of results.\nSo thanks a lot. That's all from us for now, and we're very happy to take any question.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome to ADM's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano, our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Ismael Roig, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast.\nSome of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Megan. Today, ADM reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.46, adjusted segment operating profit of $1.3 billion and a trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 11.2%. Our first quarter operating cash flow before working capital was $900 million.\nIn a year where the buildup of grain and oilseed supply is expected to create pressure margins, our teams are proactively taking action to manage through the cycle, driving structural earnings ROIC and cash flow generation. Our strong performance and disciplined management of our balance sheet continue to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. Next slide, please.\nLast, we laid out 3 priorities for value creation in 2024: One, managing through the cycle; two, nutrition recovery; and three, enhanced return of cash to shareholders. We made progress on each of these priorities in the first quarter.\nOur efforts to manage through the cycle highlight ADM's ability to mitigate challenging headwinds while building structurally on enduring global trends such as sustainability. To share a few examples of progress in the first quarter. We have been ramping up production at our Green Bison joint venture with Varathane with increased volumes and utilization in April, and we're expecting to be a sustained full run rate for harvest this fall.\nWe are continuing to evolve the Carbohydrate Solutions business through decarbonization, driving nearly 10% volume growth in Biosolutions in Q1, while managing solid demand across the core business. Driven by increasing demand for sustainably sourced feedstocks and solutions, we are announcing today that we not only exceeded our 2023 goal of 2 million acres in our regenerative ag programs, we have also increased our 2025 acreage goal from 4 million to 5 million acres. This growth highlights the leadership role ADM is playing across the regen ag landscape, which is built upon the long-standing relationships we have with our more than 200,000 farmers partners.\nThe Drive for Excellence program is focused on uncovering efficiency and effectiveness opportunities across ADM, action to improve outcomes and deliver cost savings. To date, we have generated a pipeline of nearly 1,200 validated proposals. Many of these are already delivering results. For example, colleagues in Thailand have developed a chatbot to automate processing of thousands of logistic transactions previously done with a manual process, reducing errors and dramatically improving operating performance.\nColleagues in Spain have released capacity in our Valencia extract facility by more than 35% by adjusting the extraction timing. These projects and more like this will support us in achieving our aggressive cost savings objective of $500 million over the next 2 years.\nMoving to Nutrition. The team is focused on actions across all areas of planned recovery, and we've seen expected sequential improvement coming out of the fourth quarter. The impact of these actions will accelerate in the back half of the year, consistent with what we mentioned in the last earnings call. Let me provide a few examples of progress we're making across the targeted areas.\nOur focus on operations and supply chain has helped us debottleneck some of our demand fulfillment, particularly in EMEA Flavors, where the team has rallied to adjust our fulfillment processes following the go-live of One ADM and improved volumes delivered sequentially.\nWe're leveraging our improved M&A playbook to support the integration of our most recent Flavor acquisitions and now forecast better results than the initial deal model estimates. To increase speed, agility and responsiveness to customer needs while delivering more wins across each market segment, we have fine-tuned our go-to-market and COE organizations to best align to the brand.\nLooking to our capital allocation efforts, we have maintained our balanced capital allocation approach while leveraging excess cash flow for enhanced returns to shareholders. We returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders to date as we repurchased more than 20 million shares. As mentioned last month, our focus for excess capital deployment will remain centered on the shareholder.\nIn summary, we are making measurable progress across each of our 3 major priority areas in 2024, which is setting us up well to navigate the market headwinds we are facing this year and delivered in line with our expectations.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the first quarter financial results. Ismael?\n\nIsmael Roig\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide 6, which provides overall segment operating profit and EPS for the first quarter of 2024.\nAdjusted segment operating profit was $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a 24% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in Ag Services and Oilseeds & Nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and Captive Insurance, we had a 25% increase in operating profit.\nAdjusted earnings per share were $1.46 for the quarter. Lower pricing and execution margins primarily driven by margin normalization in the AS&O business led to a [ $1 ] per share decrease. This includes lower mark-to-market impact in AS&O of approximately $0.38 per share.\nOur enhanced focus on operational excellence and improving the reliability of our assets as well as the ramp-up of our green Bison JV led to volume improvement in the AS&O segment, resulting in a $0.20 per share increase in EPS versus the prior year.\nLower manufacturing costs and input costs led to a $0.15 per share increase versus the prior year, partially offset by negative impacts associated with unplanned downtime at our Decatur East facility. Higher equity earnings primarily related to Wilmar attributed a $0.07 per share increase versus the prior year.\nIncreased corporate costs related to the One ADM implementation and legal fees drove a decrease of $0.11 per share versus the prior year. In Other, benefits from share repurchases more than offset negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate, leading to a $0.06 per share increase versus the prior year.\nMoving to Slide 7, let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the first quarter, the AS&O team delivered $864 million in operating profit, reflecting increasing headwinds from lower commodity prices and ample supplies, partially offset by improvements in process volumes and manufacturing costs as we enhance our focus on items within our control.\nThe Ag Services subsegment operating profit was lower versus the prior year, primarily due to the stabilization of trade flows leading to lower global trade and risk management results. Slower farmer selling also negatively impacted export volumes and margins in South America.\nCrushing subsegment operating profit for the quarter of $232 million was lower versus the prior year. Increased imports of used cooking oil and the anticipation of large South American supplies negatively impacted North American soy crush margins, more than offsetting the benefits from improved process volumes and lower manufacturing costs. There were positive mark-to-market timing impacts during the quarter of approximately $40 million versus positive timing impacts of approximately $240 million in the first quarter of 2023.\nRefined products and other subsegment results were $157 million. Results were driven by weaker North American refining margins due to the increased imports of oil, as well as negative mark-to-market timing impacts of approximately $30 million versus positive impacts of approximately $40 million in the prior year. Equity earnings from Wilmar were $149 million during the first quarter, higher than the prior year.\nMoving to Slide 8, let's look at Carbohydrate Solutions. For the first quarter of 2024, Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $248 million. The team executed well in a solid demand environment as well as advanced our biosolutions platform with strong volume growth.\nTurning to the subsegments. In the Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, Strong Starches and Sweeteners margins in North America were offset by pressured domestic ethanol margins due to strong industry production and elevated stocks as well as moderating margins in the EMEA region.\nIn the Vantage Corn Processing subsegment, strong export demand for sustainably certified ethanol supported both volumes and improved margins, leading to an improvement in year-over-year results. Please turn to Slide 9.\nNutrition revenues were $1.8 billion for the quarter. In the Human Nutrition subsegment, strong M&A revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions, as well as price and mix benefits in Flavors, were partially offset by lower volumes in plant-based proteins and normalizing pricing in the texturants markets.\nOur Animal Nutrition subsegment had lower revenues versus the prior year driven by lower pricing and mix. Demand creation has remained strong and provided significant revenue pipeline opportunities. We anticipate steady improvement in demand fulfillment throughout the course of the year, recovering a significant portion of volumes in the second half of the year. Please turn to Slide 10.\nWhile we have room to go on our commitment to restore the growth trajectory of the Nutrition business, we believe Q1 was an important first step, showing sequential improvement from a challenged fourth quarter, evidencing progress in operations. For the first quarter, Nutrition segment operating profit was $84 million. Human Nutrition subsegment results of $76 million were lower than the prior year, driven primarily from headwinds in the Specialty Ingredients business due to higher fixed cost absorption at Decatur East and normalizing texturants pricing.\nAnimal Nutrition subsegment results of $8 million were higher compared to the prior year, primarily driven by cost optimization efforts and lower commodity prices supporting margins. Please turn to Slide 11.\nFor the first quarter, Other segment of $121 million, up 25% compared to the prior year. The improvement was largely driven by improved captive insurance results on higher program premium claim losses.\nIn Corporate, unallocated corporate costs increased versus the prior year on higher global technology investments to support digital transformation efforts as well as increased legal fees. Other Corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year, due to an investment valuation loss of approximately $18 million. Please turn to Slide 12.\nWith healthy cash flows and a strong balance sheet, we have maintained our balanced capital allocation approach, while leveraging excess cash flow for enhanced returns to shareholders. We entered 2024 with momentum, which has allowed us to return $1.3 billion to shareholders via repurchases during the quarter, with $1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program. We intend to actualize the additional $1 billion of share repurchases approved last quarter throughout the remainder of the year. We still anticipate capital expenditures will be held at a level aligned with depreciation and amortization, focused largely on investments to secure reliability of asset performance through modernization and digitization errors.\nNow let's transition to a discussion on our full year guidance on Slide 13. Our first quarter results were largely in line with expectations, and in turn, our 2024 planning assumptions and EPS guidance remain unchanged. We are raising our corporate net interest expense guidance from approximately $500 million to approximately $525 million, as federal reserve has signaled that the probability of interest rate cuts in 2024 has decreased.\nLast month, we mentioned that the global grain and oilseed supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather would support larger production levels in key South American countries. With this, we anticipate that commodity prices will continue to ease from the recent highs of the past 2 years and the trade flows will adjust at these locations. As a result, we anticipate the global soybean crush margins would moderate in '24, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric tonne to [ $60 ] per metric tonne.\nDuring the first quarter, the team executed on a strong forward book supported by meal demand, leading to executed soy crush margins of approximately $50 per metric tonne. As we look today, we see that the forward curves reflect the assumption of ample South American supplies and the return of Argentinian production, specifically in Q2 and Q3.\nWhile the supply side certainly has pushed forward curves to the lower end of that range in the near term, we remain constructive from the demand side. We continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel as large facilities ramp up in Q2 and Q3, despite the increase in imports of used cooking oil. From the soybean meal side, lower soybean meal prices are incentivizing demand, supporting producer profitability and in turn, leading to higher inclusion rates.\nNow moving to the breakdown of expectations by segment for Q2 2024 on Slide [indiscernible]. In AS&O, we anticipate the second quarter to be significantly lower versus elevated prior year levels. We anticipate our average global soy crush margin to be towards the lower end of the guided range during the second quarter as the market balances strong soybean availability against increased crush capacity [indiscernible] of the year as the world pivots to South American production.\nIn Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate the second quarter to be higher versus the prior year, driven by solid demand and margins in North American Starches and Sweeteners, partially set by moderating margins in wheat milling and international corn milling after elevated results in the prior year period. We anticipate solid demand for ethanol, both domestically and in the export markets, similar to the prior year.\nFor Nutrition, the second quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year as we faced headwinds in Specialty Ingredients. We anticipate to see another quarter of sequential improvement as we continue to make progress in demand fulfillment. Back to you, Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 15. As you can see, our team is continuing to improve execution excellence across our strategic and operational priorities, which requires a level of agility that is a hallmark of ADM's workforce. We are focusing the organization in emanation of productivity and innovation to help offset increasingly challenging market conditions based on growing commodity supply. Our teams are looking for every opportunity to manage what we can control, remaining nimble to adjust quickly to external circumstances while advancing our strategy.\nWhile we look ahead to the rest of the year, our business priorities in 2024 put us in a position to manage through this cycle. Through the differentiation and evolution of our business models in Ag Services and Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions, our drive for excellence program, the recovery of our Nutrition business and continued focus on shareholder returns, we have confidence in outlook for the full year.\nThanks for your time today. We look forward to taking your questions. Operator, please open the line for questions.",

All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode to prevent background noise. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nInvestor Relations Director, DuPont, Inc.\n\nHello, and welcome to ADM's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Our prepared remarks today will be led by Juan Luciano our Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer and Ismael Roig, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared presentation slides to supplement our remarks on the call today which are posted on the Investor Relations section of the ADM website and through the link to our webcast. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance, and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainties.\n\nADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Megan, and good morning to all who have joined for today's call. I realize we're holding this call later than we have in the past and we appreciate your patience as we have managed through our internal investigation and worked expeditiously to complete our 10-K filing. Before we start the business update, I want to provide some perspective on the additional release that we issued this morning on the progress we have made in our internal investigation, which is being led by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. ADM has historically disclosed in the footnotes to our financial statements that intersegment sales have been recorded at amounts approximating market.\n\nIn connection with our internal investigation, we've corrected certain intersegment sales that occurred between our Nutrition reporting segment and our Ag Services & Oilseeds and Carbohydrate Solutions reporting segments that were not recorded at amounts approximating market. The adjustments have no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, statement of earnings, comprehensive income or loss, or cash flows. In addition, we determined that the adjustments are not material to our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole for any period. We also confirmed that these adjustments did not change the achievement levels under our incentive plans. Further detail is included in the Form 10-K we filed this morning.\n\nThroughout this process, we have continued to operate the business and drive our strategic priorities forward. While our internal investigation is substantially complete, we continue to cooperate with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, and we hope you understand that we will not be taking questions related to these matters on the call today. We will provide updates on this matter in the future as appropriate. Please turn to Slide 4 where we have captured our fourth quarter and full year financial highlights. Today, ADM reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.36, and adjusted segment operating profit of $1.4 billion. Our full year adjusted earnings per share were $6.98, the second best EPS in our history, and our adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion.\n\nOur trailing fourth quarter adjusted ROIC was 12.2%, making another year of ROIC performance above our 10% target. Our full year operating cash flow before working capital was $4.7 billion. Our strong cash flow and disciplined management of our balance sheet continues to allow us to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders. In total, we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2023. In January, with the expectation of continued strong cash flows in 2024, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend, raising our dividend to $0.50 per share, which marks 92 years of uninterrupted dividends and over 51 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. Today, we also announced that our Board has authorized the additional repurchase of up to $2 billion in shares in 2024 under ADM's existing share repurchase program.\n\nOur performance for 2023 shows the overall effectiveness of our strategy, where our broad portfolio of business is combined to deliver resilient results for the year. Despite a more challenging operating environment, we maintained strong earnings and ROIC while delivering key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise. Next slide please. To put our 2023 results into perspective, at the end of 2021, we provided a roadmap to create value and growth returns by getting closer to customers and highlighted where we expected to perform on several important strategic metrics by 2025. As I look at our two-year track record over these 2025 objectives, we have delivered adjusted earnings per share at the top end of our $6 to $7 per share EPs objective. We have also continued to deliver ROIC above our 10% target.\n\nThrough our strong performance, we have been able to fund the strategic investments in our businesses while returning cash to shareholders. These strategic efforts and investments have positioned ADM even closer to the customer, whether that connection is through our growing regenerative agriculture programs and partnerships, the growth of our renewable fuels partnerships as seen in our Green Bison JV with Marathon or the expansion of our Marshall, Minnesota starch facility to serve customer needs across food and industrial products. These investments and others like them not only support our current strategy, they will be the base for us to break through the $6 to $7 per share EPS range as we move beyond 2025.\n\nLet's turn to Slide 6, which I summarize our priorities for value creation in 2024. We continue building a stronger company for the future and to support this, we have identified three key priorities for 2024. One, managing the cycle; two, nutrition recovery; and three, enhanced return of cash to shareholders. Let's take a closer look at each of these areas of focus. We know that 2024 will be a more challenging year that we faced in 2022 and 2023. We see tailwinds that supported a portion of our performance over the past few years changing direction, making our continued progress on our strategic metrics more reliant than ever on our productivity and innovation agenda.\n\nIn 2024, we will continue to focus on those strategic initiatives that provide strong growth prospects. Our destination marketing efforts continue to bring us closer to our customers and enable us to serve them in a differentiated capacity and we continue to expand. In 2023, we added three new offices across Asia and the Middle East, and in 2024 we plan to add two to four more. Through this ongoing expansion, we expect to achieve 6% growth in our destination market in volumes.\n\nDirect farmer buying has been steadily increasing over the past several years and provides ADM an opportunity to maximize value for both sides by creating efficiencies through working directly together. We plan to take this even further in 2024, leveraging our network of more than 200,000 farmer relationships to grow direct origination volumes year-over-year by about 10%. And as our customers strive to decarbonize their own products and services, we are seeing a steady increase in the financial returns generated by our own decarbonization efforts from Regen Ag partnerships to lowering the carbon footprint of our operations. The pace of this is accelerating as we move into 2024.\n\nTied to these strategic initiatives, we continue to build capacity to serve growing customer demand. I mentioned earlier the opening of our Green Bison soy processing facility, as well as the expansion of our Marshall, Minnesota starch facility. These capacity additions support growing demand for a wide variety of sustainable products and solutions, from renewable fuels to industrial products.\n\nAnd connected to our productivity efforts, we have formally launched a 2024 program we call the Drive for Execution Excellence within the organization. Over the years, we have consistently encouraged our ADM colleagues to identify and execute both cost saving and cash generation ideas. We've developed processes and systems through our prior transformation programs and now those are ramping up for another cycle. As part of this, we have already commissioned more than 300 projects and plan to see $500 million in traceable cost savings over the next two years across all aspects of our enterprise, from operations to supply chain to corporate costs.\n\nNow let's discuss our plans within the Nutrition business. We're calling this section, of course, nutrition recovery for a reason. Nutrition had a very difficult year with results well below our expectations, and we have been working aggressively to change this and return to growth. For Nutrition, 2023 representing a combination of challenging market forces, some specific non-recurring events and some misses on demand fulfillment. And while market forces such as customer destocking as well as softer demand for plant-based proteins are not within our control, we're already taking action on the areas we can improve.\n\nMany of the supply issues are the result of the complexity built into the Nutrition business over time. In our zeal to meet our customers' needs, we have created one of the strongest pantries in the industry. This added complexity in our operations and supply chain that at times impacted our ability to efficiently fulfill demand. To address this, we have made important changes to drive simplification across the Nutrition business that will ease the pressure on our overall supply chain and dramatically improve our demand fulfillment performance.\n\nFirst, we have created a stronger division of duty across operations leadership and added new leaders with a strong expertise in supply chain management. We have also taken steps to build our COE expertise back into the core business, helping make our overall supply chain capabilities more agile and responsive to commercial demand signals. We have also engaged third party experts to help identify further opportunities for operational excellence improvements across our largest facilities. We have also greatly simplified the product and production line landscape to further achieve operational and supply efficiency, reducing the brands we are presenting to customers by two thirds and downsizing about 17% of our SKUs alongside the strategic production line simplification. A recent example of this is the closure of more than 20 Animal Nutrition production lines in 2023, now better serving the product mix and supply chain efficiency of the business.\n\nWe're also optimizing our Nutrition business portfolio, leveraging our experience in both large scale and bolt-on acquisitions. We have enhanced our approach to M&A integration to increase value creation as we focus more on the integration of recent acquisitions than new targets. We continue to assess our portfolio for a strategic fit, making surgical decisions to achieve the returns targets we expect. For example, during Q4, we took action on two JVs that were not expected to meet our returns criteria. We're proud to see how the team with new leadership has rallied around this recovery plan, which is already showing signs of improvement as we move through the first quarter of the year.\n\nRecent trends suggest that destocking impacts in beverages are subsiding and we are well positioned to capture recovering demand in 2024 as evidenced by the strong demand we are seeing in flavors. After heightening our operational efficiency, we've seen steady increases in shipping volumes and productions throughout the course of the last month. And in Animal Nutrition, we have seen another quarter of sequential improvement in the base of the business, which excludes amino acids and pet solutions and early indications in the first quarter of 2024 suggest that this will continue. Importantly, our nutrition value proposition continues to be well received by customers as evidenced by our robust opportunity pipeline and industry leading win rates across key categories like flavors, dietary supplements and pep. ADM's customer centricity and agile innovation capabilities, supported through our creation, design and development expertise, differentiates us. We continue to believe that Nutrition has an important role in ADM's integrated business model.\n\nBeyond adding value to the ingredients produced by our AS&O and carbohydrate solution businesses, Nutrition is innovating to address evolving consumer needs and is connecting us more closely with a growing customer base. Finally, I'll turn attention to the capital allocation strategy that continues to guide our strategic cash deployment decisions. As noted, we announced today that the Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion in shares through the remainder of the year, including $1 billion in shares to be executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical.\n\nThis will total $6.4 billion in repurchases executed since 2022. And coupled with the already announced 11% dividend growth, this is aligned with our commitment to a balanced capital allocation approach. So, combined, we believe these three areas of focus set ADM to perform well in a challenging external operating environment in 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Ismael for more detail on the results of the operations. Ismael?\n\nIsmael Roig\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Juan. Let's start on Slide 7 which provides overall segment operating income and EPS for 2023. Overall, we delivered the second highest earnings in company history, overcoming a challenging operating environment. Adjusted segment operating profit was $6.2 billion for the full year, a 6% decrease versus the prior year. At a high level, operating profit was primarily down year-over-year in Ag Services & Oilseeds and Nutrition. In the other segment, which includes ADMIS and Captive Insurance, we had a significant increase in operating profit. Adjusted earnings per share were $6.98 for the year. Improved pricing in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, as well as positive impacts from mark to market timing in AS&O more than offset the impact of lower crush margins, leading to a $0.70 per share improvement versus the prior year.\n\nVolume improvement in AS&O was more than offset by volume declines in Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition, resulting in a $0.29 per share reduction in EPS versus the prior year. Higher manufacturing costs partially related to unplanned downtime at the Decatur complex led to a $0.41 per share decrease versus the prior year. And lower equity earnings, primarily related to Wilmar, attributed a $0.46 per share decrease versus the prior year. Increased corporate costs related to higher interest rates and the 1ADM implementation partially offset by higher ADMIS results drove a $0.30 per share versus the prior year. For other, benefits from share repurchases were more than offset by negative impacts related to a higher adjusted income tax rate and cycling one-time benefits from the Legal Recovery and Biofuel Producer Recovery program, leading to a $0.18 per share decrease versus the prior year.\n\nMoving to Slide 8, let's look at our segment performance for AS&O. For the full year, AS&O delivered $4.1 billion in segment operating profit, 8% lower than the record level in 2022. Ag Services segment operating profit was 15% lower versus the prior year as reduced origination volume and margins in North America were partially offset by record South American origination volumes. In global trade, destabilization of trade flows led to lower results compared to an exceptional 2022. Crushing segment operating profit for the full year was $346 million lower versus the prior year as improved process volumes were more than offset by lower crush margins and higher manufacturing costs.\n\nRefined Products and Other results were $469 million higher, resulting in a record year. Results were driven by higher volumes and margins in biodiesel. Market volatility drove positive timing impacts of approximately $235 million, compared to negative timing impacts of $90 million in the prior year. Equity earnings for Wilmar were $303 million in 2023, approximately 45% lower than the prior year. Now let's move to Slide 9 and look at Carbohydrate Solutions. For the full year Carbohydrate Solutions segment operating profit was $1.4 billion, 3% lower versus the record prior year. In the Starches and Sweeteners segment higher pricing and mix were offset by weaker volumes and lower corn co-product values. The teams executed well in a dynamic environment, posting a record year in Wheat Milling.\n\nIn Vantage Corn Processing strong exports and steady domestic demand and blending rates supported ethanol production and robust margins. The prior year also included onetime benefits of $50 million, related to the USDA Biofuel Producer Recovery program. We also continue to make significant progress on our BioSolutions strategic initiative, delivering revenue growth well ahead of our 15% plus target. Please now turn to Slide 10. In Nutrition, revenues of $7.2 billion for the full year were 6% lower versus the prior year. Demand headwinds and destocking impacts, coupled with operational challenges related to the ERP systems integration pressured volumes. This more than offset price and mixed benefits, as well as positive currency impacts.\n\nIn Human Nutrition volumes declined due to lower market demand for plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages, and operational challenges related to the ERP system implantation. This was partially offset by improved price and mix in flavors and texture and pricing in specialty ingredients. In Animal Nutrition, lower complete feed and premix volumes, the normalization of amino acid markets and demand fulfillment challenges in Pet Solutions led to lower revenue versus 2022. Now, please turn to Slide 11. For the full year Nutrition segment operating profit was $427 million, 36% lower versus the prior year. Human Nutrition results of $417 million were 25% lower than the prior year as weaker volumes as well as increased costs related to operational challenges from the ERP implementation and unplanned Decatur downtime at Decatur East were partially offset by higher pricing.\n\nAnimal nutrition results of $10 million were 91% lower compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower volumes and the normalization of amino acid pricing. When bridging from 2022, our performance can be characterized in three buckets: Market forces, one-time items, and operational challenges. Market forces accounted for a majority of the deterioration in 2023. And as previously mentioned, this was mostly related to lower demand and plant-based proteins, destocking impacts in beverages and lower premix and completely demand which impacted volumes across the industry. Secondly, one-time items amounted to $64 million during the year, accounting for over a quarter of the total segment decline in operating profit. $45 million of the one-time impacts was related to underperforming joint ventures in Savan and PlantPlus Foods. The remaining $19 million of the one-time impacts was related to investment valuation losses in health and wellness.\n\nLastly, we also had our own operation struggles that impacted our ability to deliver on the strong demand that we have created. The implementation of ERP systems over the course of the year led to complications in shipping and producing products, negatively impacting both volumes and manufacturing costs. Over the past month, we have seen a steady improvement in operations and are confident that we will see volumes lost in 2023 come back in 2024. Now, please turn to Slide 12. For the full year other segment operating profit was $375 million, up 125% compared to the prior year. ADM Investor Services results improved on higher net interest income. Higher Captive Insurance results on new program premiums were partially offset by higher claim losses.\n\nIn corporate for the full year, net interest expense increased year-over-year on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate cost increased versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was unfavorable compared to the prior year due to one-time investment valuation losses of approximately $57 million. Please turn to Slide 13. Over the last two years the company has generated significant cash flow that have bolstered our balance sheet and provided us with financial flexibility to drive long-term growth. In 2023 we again had strong cash flow of $4.7 billion which were actualized in line with our balanced capital allocation framework. 30% or approximately $1.5 billion of cash flows were reinvested in the business to support growth and modernize our assets, including investments in new capacity and the digitization of our existing asset footprint.\n\nOur cash flows also supported significant capital return in 2023 with nearly 30% earnings going to dividends and nearly 60% of cash flows or about $2.7 billion going to shareholders via share repurchases. In 2024 we expect to hold capital expenditures to a level aligned with depreciation and amortization with focus spend around the safety and reliability of assets. We also intend to manage working capital needs prudently limiting M&A beyond previously announced transactions and focusing our team on cost savings and cash generation initiatives through the drive for Execution Excellence. As Juan mentioned earlier, our priorities for cash deployment in 2024 will remain focused around the shareholder. We finished the year with strong momentum in terms of returning cash, repurchasing nearly 1.6 billion of shares in Q4 and nearly 330 million of shares so far in Q1. Over the course of the year, we intend to actualize 2 billion of additional share repurchases, with 1 billion being executed through an accelerated share repurchase program as soon as practical.\n\nNow, let's transition to a discussion of guidance for 2024 on Slide 14, please. In 2024, global grain and oil seed supply is expected to increase as anticipated improvements in weather should support larger production levels in key South American countries. Assuming commodity prices ease for recent highs and trade flows adjust to the dislocations created over the past two years, we anticipate global soybean crush margins will moderate in 2024, likely moving into a range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton. From the demand side, we continue to expect vegetable oil demand growth from renewable diesel and low single digit soybean mill demand growth to support structural margin improvement. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 per share to $6.25 per share, representing an 18% decline from prior year at the midpoint.\n\nNow breaking down our expectations by segment for 2024, let's turn to Slide 15. In AS&O, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower and the full year to also be lower versus comparable prior periods as increased global commodity supply and normalization of margins will weigh on the segment. We anticipate global soy crush margins within the range of $35 per metric ton to $60 per metric ton as the market balances better soybean availability against increased crush and renewable diesel capacity. Our Operational Excellence efforts and the ramp up of our Green Bison facility should lead to mid-to-high single digit improvement in our process volumes. We expect significantly lower biodiesel margins in 2023, timing gains to reverse as contracts are executed. In Carbohydrate Solutions, we anticipate the first quarter to be lower versus the prior year. For the full year, we anticipate another strong year, but slightly lower than 2023, as the improved volumes and margins in Sweeteners and Starches could be offset by weaker ethanol.\n\nFor nutrition, the first quarter is expected to be lower versus the prior year, as we face headwinds from a normalizing texturants market, fixed costs associated with operational challenges related to the Decatur East and protein volumes. However, for the full year we expect Nutrition to begin its path to recovery. We anticipate conversion of our significant pipeline opportunities in Human and Animal Nutrition to yield mid-single-digit revenue growth. We assume market normalization in texturants to be a headwind in 2024. We do not anticipate the significant one-time events of 2023 to recur. Back to you, Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Ismael. Please turn to Slide 16. In summary, let me once again share the three priorities for our year ahead. We will continue our efforts across the business to drive our productivity and innovation portfolio of projects, taking advantage of capacity gains we have made and ensure that our teams are generating and executing on our drive for Execution Excellence. We continue to take aggressive actions in the nutrition business to ensure that it can deliver on the areas of growth that we have continued to build into our opportunity pipeline. This includes supporting the operational changes we have introduced, driving simplifications through our products and brands, and ensuring that our business portfolio is tuned to best achieve our return expectations.\n\nAnd we're also actively managing our balanced capital allocation strategy, both prudently investing in the business while growing our dividends and accelerating our share repurchase program to return more to shareholders in the near-term. I believe strongly in the powerful role ADM plays as a leader in the agriculture supply chain, and that our ability to bring partners together across the value chain will be critical to driving future transformation in the food, feed, fuel and industrial markets we serve. I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. I'm confident in our ability to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth. Operator, please open the line for questions now.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you'd like to register an audio question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind, please press star two, and please ensure that you are unmuted when speaking.  Our first question comes from Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Adam, the line is yours.\n\nAdam Samuelson\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nYes, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nGood morning, Adam. How are you?\n\nAdam Samuelson\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nMorning.  Good. So, I guess my question is really around framing the go-forward outlook in terms of the cyclical versus the pieces that ADM controls. And you had the targets from the 2021 Investor Day still on the slides of returns and earnings per share. The outperformance the last couple of years has been largely cyclically driven in AS&O, whereas some of the investments and the items under your own control, particularly Nutrition, have not performed up to expectations. As we think about '24 that's at least the cyclical parts are reversing, at least in part. Can you Juan put a little bit more finer point on how you think about 2024 versus normalized earnings for the business and maybe quantify the path forward in Nutrition beyond this year as you work to earn a return on the substantial investments you've actually made in that business?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes. Thank you, Adam. So, let's take each of the businesses in the portfolio. So, when we think about Ag Services and Oilseeds, as you said, we had a spectacular performance over the last couple of years, taking full advantage of the opportunities in the market. But we forecasted in 2021 that margins were going to moderate, although they were going to stay higher than historical averages and we are seeing that. We see the moderation and we see even crush margins, 35 to 60, that we are forecasting are higher than average. We have not stayed quiet waiting for the cycle to reverse. We have been adjusting our business model. You heard me saying about destination marketing, something we didn't have a few years ago, and we continue to grow that. That gives us extra margins and now we are forecasting that we continue to expand and we're going to grow those volumes 6% this year and that programs continue as we expand into new geographies in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.\n\nWhen you think also about the Regen program, Regen AG program that we have with our customers, we are helping our CPG customers with their Scope 3 emissions and we are working together with the farmers and that program is the leading program in the industry and continues to grow. We are also doing everything in the value chain. We're looking at farmer direct. That's an ability for us to get efficiencies between us and the producer, the way we buy grain. So of course, we get an advantage with that as the producer as well. And we're planning to increase our volumes 10%, leveraging on the 200,000 farmer relationships we have around the world. Of course, we have expanded capacity. We are expanding crush in Latin America. We are expanding crush in North America with Spiritwood. So, I would say when you take that, plus our operational improvements, if you will, what we call the push for excellence, that was going to be the productivity and innovation agenda that were going to help us navigate through this.\n\nWe see 2024 still as a strong year for Ag Services and Oilseeds, it's going to be lower, but it's still going to be a strong year. Of course, the market has priced a lot of the extra capacity and the higher argentine crop into the crush margins. But we still see the ability of the market to absorb all that capacity with a strong mill growth and with a strong demand for oils. So, that on the Ag Services and Oilseeds side. On the Carb Solutions side, this business has been very stable over the last few years. It has had a very good 2022 and 2023. We are expecting a very good 2024, maybe slightly lower, but still very, very good. We had a good program for good contract renewals in 2024. We are happy with the margins. We have maintained margins for the most part, and we have gained some volumes, so volumes are strong.\n\nThe milling business has been going, had a record year last year, and it continues to drive very strong. I think both businesses have a little bit of a lower contribution from feed products, where margins have decreased a little bit, but BioSolutions, as Ismael mentioned, continues to grow, is growing beyond 15% per year. And all their decarbonization things that we're saying, we see more and more demand for everything that carb solutions can bring to the table in that area. So, we feel very good about that. Always the question mark in the year maybe is ethanol, but we're seeing right now, Adam, ethanol, the arbitrage to export from the U.S. is open to everywhere in the world. So, it's just a matter of adjusting our capacity and the U.S. capacity to get more dehydrated ethanol, if you will, to be able to export, to adjust the humidity content, if you will.\n\nSo, I think we'd export well north of maybe 1.5, 1.6 billion gallons for this year. That should bode well for recovery of margins as we go into the year. And then you take nutrition. Nutrition has been a growth story for many years, and we certainly stumbled in 2023. I mentioned some of the reasons. Some of the reasons were, there was a big destocking after all the COVID and all the supply chain issues that the industry have, the industry stopped. And now we went through lower inflation and this talking about that. So, we had to go that in beverages, which drives flavors, which is our biggest engine for growth, if you will.\n\nOf course, we knew into the year that plant-based proteins, we have moderated our expectations for growth on that will still grow, but it's not going to be beyond 10%. So, it's still going to be an attractive mid-single-digit growth, if you will. But we knew that, and then we had continued growth in continued good demand in pet and health and wellness and Animal Nutrition has been improving their P&L, doing a lot of self-help from the June P&L. It's been improving all the year. So, unfortunately we get to the Q4 and we had several events in Q4. We have several one offs. We needed to take action on a couple of joint ventures and we addressed that. We needed to take a revaluation of an investment because of the end evaluation and we took that in the Q4.\n\nAnd then we have some issues on our own performance that we needed to implement 1ADM as much as we prepared for that. We had some problems with some of the modules. It was a successful implementation, but some of the modules that were about shipping products gave us trouble during the last quarter of the year. So, when you have all that combination, it gave us a very bad quarter.\n\nWe continue to see 2024 a year of growth or recovery, if you will, from the 2023 value. And from there, we should continue to march on our commitment to nutrition. Our ability to fulfill or to deliver a value proposition that resonates with customers continue to be evidenced by our growing pipeline, both in Animal and Human Nutrition, and our conversion rate we have benchmarked this is industry leading conversion rate. So, we know we are winning. We need to adjust our own internal processes to make sure we deliver that. And we have done that heavily in the last - second half of last year, and we have seen that during January and February that we are delivering much better than we did last year.\n\nSo with that, I still look confident at the numbers, at the overall number for the company that we gave you for 2025. As I said on the onset, we are ahead on what we scheduled. From an EPS perspective, we are above 10% in ROIC and we have purchased already more than the $5 billion of share that we have estimated for 2025. So, it's never going to be a straight line from here to 2025. But we have a resilient portfolio that can help us see that those numbers for the overall portfolio are still possible, as it was in December 2021. Sorry for the long answer. It's a large company.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, that's star one to register a question. We ask participants to limit themselves to one question and then rejoin the queue for any follow-ups.  Our next question comes from Tom Palmer of Citi. Tom, please go ahead.\n\nThomas Hinsdale Palmer\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nGood morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to dig in a bit more on crush margins and your $35 to $60 global soybean crush outlook. Maybe just to frame it, where were global crush margins last year? Where are crush margins currently? When we consider different regions of the world, and then as we think about the items that could drive to the upper or lower end of this year's range, what are kind of the key items you're looking at? Thank you.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes, thank you, Tom. So, as we said before, Ismael mentioning his remarks, we expect crush margins between $35 to $60 for this year, they were about $70 per ton, maybe last year. I think it's fair to say that the market has completely priced or baked all the bad news into the crush margins are we having today? So, I would say board crush has moved significantly lower in the last month as the market probably gained more confidence in the availability of products, especially soybean meal, particularly when you think about Argentina now having sites on a crop that may be 50 million tons. And the U.S. crush industry also has performed very well. And the market continued to look forward to the second quarter of the year when they're going to have basically three offers for meal. That hasn't happened last year. So, if you remember, last year, after Brazil finished in exporting, the U.S. became the only global, only gaming town, if you will. And that increased soybean meal values around the world, which makes soybean meal expensive, if you will for the Russian.\n\nWe see that in the U.S., we saw, at least for ADM, we saw five consecutive months of record exports for soybean meal in the U.S. And the U.S. industry saw similar situation. So, now with the correction in this, we expect that soybean meal will gain back into the Russians. Of course, feeding with meat pros and not soybean milk is not the optimal way to feed. So, now that soybean milk has corrected, we expect that to happen. At the end of the day, Tom, the way I think about where crush is going to happen in the world is going to happen in both places where you have bean availability and where you have a domestic oil market. If you think of Brazil, Brazil is having B14 started in March. And that has helped with the margins of domestic oil for us in Brazil. And of course, you have a big crop, so you're going to have the bean availability and the domestic market. And then it will be the U.S. in which you have all the need of soybean oil to go into renewable green diesel and biodiesel and we have, of course, the bin availability. So, we think that crush will favor those two places.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Strelzik of BMO. Andrew, please go ahead.\n\nAndrew Strelzik\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets (United States)\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess ultimately, my question is about 2025 and whether you view 2024 as kind of the trough here from an earnings perspective in terms of the cycle. And if I just follow up on maybe you made some comments at the end of the response to Adam about 2025. I didn't know if that was specific to the metrics around nutrition or the prior earnings guidance that you had talked about. If you could just kind of clarify the way that you're thinking about that is this 2024 an earnings number from, which you would expect to grow, and then the 2025 comments with that. Thanks.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes. Andrew, first of all, my comment before to Tom's question was the overall number that we gave for the company for 2025 in 2021. We still believe that number is there. I think that that number was never going to be a destination for ADM, was a milestone, if you will. And as we are reviewing our five-year plan that we do every year we see us breaking through that number. So, in that sense, I expect 2024 to be a down year versus 2023 hopefully 2025 will be a positive year versus 2024. There is a cycle here that needs to happen, Andrew, that I described below, soybean mill will get cheaper. All the oil activities related to B-14 or RGD needs to grow. All that needs to happen and how long that adjustment takes, how long it takes for meal to be low enough to increase demand and for flat prices to be low enough to maybe make the farmer correct a little bit.\n\nThey are planting all that process we know historically happens, when exactly it's going to happen. Does it happen in a calendar year? Doesn't happen in six months. Does it happen in a year is hard to say. But we continue to build a company that has more optionality, that's more resilience for the future. So, as the cycle moderates, we continue to have more ability to bring more to the P&L. So, we think with that, I'm optimistic about '25 being better than '24.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben, the line is yours.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nMorning, Ben.\n\nBen Bienvenu\n\nAnalyst, Stephens, Inc.\n\nGood morning.\n\nJuan, I want to ask, as we think about the morning, I want to ask as we think about 2024 for the nutrition segment, you note that you expect mid-single digit revenue growth, operating profit to be higher over year. I think the natural inference would be that the operating profit growth is up by less than 5% or mid-single digit revenue growth. Is that true? And then, as you referenced in kind of the cadence and your expectations for the first quarter, this is a trajectory of recovery that will build throughout the year in 2024. You talk about pipeline conversion. Are there residual headwinds, discontinuities from the Decatur complex still in the first quarter? Help us think through the sequencing of the development of return to growth and nutrition.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes, good question, Ben. Let me give you the puts and takes, if you will, on nutrition as we look at 2024. So, as Ismael said in his remarks, about half of the headwinds that we faced last year were market. That means that half of them were in the other two buckets, the non-recurring events, if you will, and those by nature we hope that we're not going to have going forward. And I think Ismael qualified them about $60 million something give or take. And then the other ones were like some of the demand fulfillment issues that I explained how we have worked aggressively to correct. And we have seen good indication of that over the first two months of this year. So, I would say those are the positive that we don't expect all that to happen again in 2024. You put on top of that a single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit revenue growth because of the pipeline that we have and the conversion of that pipeline.\n\nAnd that tends to happen every year. Then, as you described, we have to have to face a correction of texturizing prices that were exceptionally high last year. We're not going to have that. So, that will be part of the negative side, if you will. And certainly, as we go through the year, we still need to bring Decatur East plant back into operations, and that will have a tail of a cost. So, I would say the year will be driven by a strong recovery in Animal Nutrition, in flavors, and hopefully pet with some tailwinds in the specialty ingredients. That's how we see.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ben Theurer of Barclays. Ben, please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin M. Theurer\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Capital Casa de Bolsa SA de CV\n\nYes. Good morning and thank you very much for taking my question. Juan, Ismael wanted to follow-up on carbohydrate solutions because that obviously, as you've highlighted, has been a very solid performer last year. Even the outlook looks very promising still in comparison to maybe some of the other segments for 2024. And I wanted to understand where you are within your different asset bases, be it on the ethanol side, but also particularly Starches and Sweeteners for the need to invest into the business. Where are you in terms of capacity and what do you need to potentially allocate money to in order to keep that business up where it is, or potentially further grow it as it has gained significance within the consolidated ADM results? Thank you.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes, Ben, I'm glad you're highlighting carb solution. They had a spectacular year. They deserve recognition and they've done a fantastic job of transforming their business into a very resilient and stable business. The assets - let me take it by pieces. The milling business. Milling is an old business that has some old assets. And over the last few years, we have been doing - the team has been doing a terrific job of shutting down some assets and consolidating those in new facilities like Mendota that we launched last year. That is the best and the newest wheat milling plant in the world. So, we are happy with the way they have done that. They continue to do so. So, that business is in good shape. When we look at the wet mills, we continue to invest in part of the wet mills. Unlikely that we're going to build a new wheat mill, as you can understand, but that business continue to be reinvested in.\n\nIt's a business that is a large business has a large asset footprint. And at the moment there is a lot of capital being associated with the path to decarbonize all these assets. So, as you heard, we have a lot of efforts in trying to get pipelines to try to monetize some of our CO2 that come from - the biogenic CO2 that come from the ethanol plants. And I would say we have expanded Marshall because BioSolutions is growing at north of 15% per year. So, we needed capacity. So, the Marshall expansion is about 50% expansion to the final starch capacity that we have there. And that will help a lot with that. I would say the year is exciting as it is developing. It has solid margins.\n\nIt has so far solid volumes. It had a little bit of a rough January because of the bad weather. We have ice in the plants and freezing weather. But February, March, things look good. And we think that that business has the opportunity to get some tailwinds from lower energy cost and maybe chemicals cost as the year go by. And that's a big energy hog, that business. So, that could be an advantage and a tailwind coming later in the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Manav Gupta of UBS. Manav, please go ahead.\n\nManav Gupta\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs & Co.\n\nThank you. I just had a quick question. When we look at the carb, recent proposals and then we look at the 45g, it looks both at the federal level and at certain state levels there is a desire to lower the amount of renewable diesel being produced from vegetable oil. And I'm just trying to understand, do you see that as some kind of a headwind whereby eventually the demand for soybean oil from the renewable diesel or biodiesel industry could actually decline versus what we are seeing or you think this is just passing and the demand eventually will rise again as we move along?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes. Thank you, Manav, for the question. Listen, I think the path is clear for RGD, that RGD will need vegetable oils. When you think about how Europe is doing, Europe not having a raw crop for that, Europe needs cooking oil, waste oils, and they will capture that. The U.S. will have to be fed with soybean oil, canola oil. And we see that commitment to be firm over the years. All these capacities being built, it cannot be filled with anything else. So, we feel that is a strong trend ahead of us.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Salvator Tiano of Bank of America. Salvator, please go ahead.\n\nSalvator Tiano\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nYes, thank you very much. I just want to go back to the 2025 target of $6, $7 in EPS. I mean, that is obviously double digit EPS growth and I understand buybacks play a role into that. But given the comments about controllables versus cyclicals, it seems really tough to imagine getting back there. Can you provide a little bit some of the key components and key buckets that you think will get you there in terms of its segment and specific numbers as detailed as possible?\n\nIsmael Roig\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nYes, Salvator. Listen, a little bit of what I explained early on Adam's question. I think that we will see how the cycle plays in ASNO. As I said, I think that lower prices have this ability to incentivate demand. At this point in time If you think about soybean meal demand, we are forecasting a very strong soybean meal demand, maybe higher than USDA levels, higher than GDP. When you think about Southeast Asian economies recovering and with inflation moderating, purchasing power is improving, tourism is improving in all those areas, you have at the moment very high prices of beef that's favoring pork and chicken. You have protein margins for chicken being better at that.\n\nSo we think that soybean meal will gain in the Russian. So, when we look at all that, we see the soy oil demand very strong in domestic consumption, but also for biofuels, and then we see the meal demand very strong. We think that this correction should be probably short term for crash and that should come back again. I cannot make a prediction on the timing of that, but we know how the cycle plays. So, whether it's calendar year this or six months later or a quarter earlier, it's not for me to venture into those guesses. I think that carb solutions between the exceptional job they are doing on managing their mature businesses and the growth that they are getting through decarbonization and BioSolutions, you will see that ahead of us.",
    "content2": "Again, we just bring in the Marshall expansion. That's not something that it was in our forecast last year. So, we're going to have it more in the next three quarters, if you will, of the year, Spiritwood again, and some of the crash capacity we brought in Brazil, and then you see nutrition. That nutrition was not a contributor, certainly a big contributor to growth in 2023, but we expect it to be back to growth in 2024 and 2025. So, those are kind of the buckets, if you will, that I see at the moment.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Steven Haynes of Morgan Stanley. Steven, the line is yours.\n\nSteven Haynes\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to come back to nutrition, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about some portfolio refreshment going on there and was wondering if you could maybe size, the scope of that. Are you thinking more kind of product line oriented here, or is this kind of more at the business level where you might be looking to monetize something? Thank you.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes, Steven, listen, let me give you my thinking on that and the way we approach these things. So we always look - every time we do our five year plan, we take a look at those units that whether they are not returning, given our return expectations to date, we're not forecasting it to do it in the medium term. And those are the ones that we tend to take action.\n\nSo, we took action with a couple of joint ventures, as I mentioned, and then we look at every unit that is underperforming. What we do first is we try to bring them to performance. So, we make sure that if there are some things that are self-inflicted, if you will, we correct those things. Once we correct those things, and then we have visibility to what could happen over the next two or three years, then we decide as a part of portfolio whether they belong in nutrition or they belong in another part of ADM, or they belong outside ADM. So, that's a regular process. We done, we done it in the past with fertilizers, Latin America, we've done it in the past. We divested Bolivia. We divested cocoa and chocolate.\n\nSo, we've done this, and now we've done it with a couple of joint ventures. We've done it also. Ismael has done it in his previous job as an Animal Nutrition leader with some of the lines in Animal Nutrition that we cut, like 20 lines around the world. So, sometimes we have exited countries. So, it's a regular process that at times, maybe when you have a stumble like we had in nutrition, you look a little bit deeper, because now, all of a sudden, you have more businesses at lower performance. So, we really want to see, is it worth investing in some of those? So, we're in that process. So, nothing to announce today, but we continue to look at that very deeply.\n\nIsmael Roig\n\nInterim Chief Financial Officer\n\nJust a couple of complimentary comments, because not only have we had some experience historically, as Juan correctly mentions, with [inaudible] and fertilizer, but certainly the Animal Nutrition was a good precursor to some of the thinking that we have now in mind for the whole of our nutrition business. In the sense that usually when you acquire these businesses, they come with footprint allocations, labs, farms, in our cases, and warehouses, that when you aggregate them, start aggregate them across a number of different acquisitions, you realize that there are overlaps.\n\nAnd what we noticed is that there was a significant opportunity in Animal Nutrition to significantly simplify the portfolio by reducing the number of labs, reducing the number of SKUs of plants. And we've seen those benefits. They've been occurring since the second half of 2023. And I think that some of that thinking, as we have built this organization via a multiplicity of acquisitions, lends itself now to a pause and reflection, in light of the successes that we've had with this, to apply it more broadly to all of the portfolio. So, that's where our capital prudence is going to come in, by focusing on ensuring that we improve our asset base while returning cash to our shareholders.\n\nSteven Haynes\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nThank you, Ismael.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dushyant Ailani of Jefferies. Dushyant, please go ahead.\n\nDushyant Ailani\n\nThank you for squeezing me in. I just wanted to quickly talk about biodiesel margins going forward. Your thoughts just around the system, both in the U.S. and internationally, just how do we frame our thoughts around that and capacity as well?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nYes. Thank you, Dushyant. Well, all useful biofuel production, as I said, is expected to grow. In Brazil, we're going to go to B14, so there are many countries that are increasing their mandates, whether it's Indonesia and all that. When you look at the overall balances around the world, you see plantations in Southeast Asia getting older, the trees getting older, so maybe less production of palm oil. So, you're going to see biodiesel mandates increasing around the world and less competitive pressure, if you will, for palm oil.\n\nSo, you're going to see the pressure on vegetable oil. So, we think that that will continue to be a strong leg of the crash, biodiesel in particular. Biodiesel margins are better right now for us in Europe. They have moderated significantly in the U.S., and we expect them to be good, but not as good as they used to be in the U.S. So, that will be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2024. But margins are better in Brazil and in Europe. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. With that, we have no further questions, so I'll hand back to the management team for any closing remarks.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nInvestor Relations Director, DuPont, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today. Please feel free to follow up with me, if you have any other questions. Have a good day and thanks for your time and interest in ADM.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Alex. Hello, and welcome to the third quarter earnings webcast for ADM. Starting tomorrow, a replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.\nOn today's webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will discuss our third quarter results and share some recent accomplishments on our strategic priorities. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review segment level performance and provide an update on our cash generation and capital allocation actions. Juan will have some closing remarks, and then Ian and Vikram will take your questions.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Megan, and good morning to all who have joined for today's call. Today, ADM reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.63 with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.5 billion. Year-to-date, this equates to an adjusted earnings per share of $5.62 , that would represent ADM's second best EPS year achieved in just the first 9 months and an adjusted operating profit of $4.8 billion.\nOur trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13.2%. This result reflects yet another strong quarter for ADM. I'm proud of the team's nimble execution against our strategic plan while adjusting our business model in light of both global macro trends and the evolving needs of our customers. The global market is increasingly dynamic with factors that create both opportunities and challenges for ADM to address. Consumer behavior has shown growing variability spending more in some categories while slowing spending in others. And our team has a proven ability to manage through this and the impact of geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures and the constantly adjusting balances of commodity supply and demand. Within each business, we are focused on navigating these external factors carefully while we're also building on the momentum we've seen through the year-to-date. As we look ahead, we are on track to exceed our 2023 previous expectations for the total company.\nIn Ag Services and Oilseeds, we saw the accelerated energy transition support strong demand for vegetable oil, leading to a solid crush environment. We leveraged our flexible logistics footprint to manage Brazil's record crop and our global trade franchise to best match supply to demand worldwide.\nIn Car Solutions, we delivered a record third quarter on the strength of solid margins in starches, sweeteners and flower as well as robust ethanol demand that help us drive strong volumes and margins.\nIn Nutrition, flavors growth continued to outpace the market, where we both grew and executed on our revenue opportunity pipeline. The delivery productivity and cost management actions we have taken in Animal Nutrition are enabling improved performance as we also see market volume recovery, and we continue to navigate pockets of soft demand in certain categories of the Nutrition portfolio.\nNext slide, please. One of ADM's greatest competitive advantage is the breadth and integration of our business model, reaching from farm to fork. 2023 has offered several examples of how we're creating new areas of growth in each business units. On the farm, ADM has one of the largest and most sophisticated global origination networks connecting with hundreds of thousand farmer partners worldwide. We have unique and deep relationships with the people and technologies that are shaping the future of agriculture. So as more of our customers are looking for traceable, sustainable crop sources in their own supply chains, we are a natural connector and influencer. We are proud to have announced partnership with PepsiCo, Nestle and Carlsberg and have a target of 4 million regenerative acres enrolled by 2025. The carbon equivalent powering more than 100,000 homes a year.\nMoving into production as the pace of energy transition accelerates, demand for renewable fuel sources is growing rapidly and ADM is in a leading position to capitalize on this trend. With our Spiritwood JV with Marathon currently being commissioned we are ready to fit the production of a targeted 75 million gallons of renewable green diesel per year. We have announced the Broadwind Energy project, delivering a lower emission power source and critical part of lowering our carbon emissions used to power the cater operations. And we're innovating to deliver new low carbon intensity products within the fast-growing biosolutions portfolio. And as we connect to the consumer, we're working closely with our customers to serve the challenges of their consumers, whether it's sustainable solutions, the latest flavor or a cost-effective ingredient replacement, or exploring the future of nutrition through work with ADM ventures partners like Air Protein and [ Nourish ]. And we are differentiated our offerings with the next generation of evidence-based health and wellness solutions. With the world's largest probiotic manufacturing facility in Valencia, more than 50 clinical trials underway and a growing team of deep scientific experts, we are well positioned for the expanding demand for functional foods and personalized nutrition. And to efficiently execute on all areas of growth while maintaining an efficient cost structure we continue to vigilantly focus on productivity as well as the culture that lets our ADM colleagues bring their best every day. Across our global organization, we're standardizing processes and systems through One ADM and modernizing our operations through digital transformation, driving greater efficiencies while enabling the best use of our workforce and production capacity. Our planned modernization program continues to deliver impressive operational benefits, including advanced analytics and safety improvements across the 17 operations facilities currently in implementation phase. With more than 70 plants in scope, the planned recurring cost savings associated with automation across our footprint in 2024 is already nearly $20 million per year. Our cultural efforts are the critical foundation for all of these strategic initiatives. We have ramped up our focus on a culture of caring, specifically in regards to the safety of our colleagues. This is our top priority, and our recent performance in this area has not live up to our expectations. We are committed to taking action to improve and have already begun to do so with the assistance of both internal and external experts. We will do better. By actively managing productivity, innovation and culture and aligning work to the interconnected trends in food security, health and well-being and sustainability. ADM is well positioned for sustainable long-term profit growth across new and adjacent avenues. And with a strong performance in 2023, and a constructive expectation for the remainder of the year, we are again raising our full year earnings outlook.\nFor a deeper look at our Q3 performance, let me hand over to Vikram, who will cover results of operations.\n\nVikram Luthar\n\nSenior VP, Head of IR & CFO of Nutrition, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 5. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team once again delivered solid results [Audio Gap] dynamic environment by leveraging our experience, scale and integrated global footprint. Ag Services results were lower than the strong third quarter of 2022. South American origination results were higher year-over-year as our team delivered significantly higher volumes and margins on strong export demand. Prior investments in port capabilities have enabled us to structurally grow our earnings while capitalizing on a stronger margin environment across the region.\nNorth American results were lower year-over-year as a result of the shift of export demand to Brazil due to the large crop there as well as low water levels in the U.S. river system, limiting volume and barge capacity. Effective risk management, combined with higher volumes and margins in Global trade led to strong results. However, much lower than the record quarter last year. The current quarter also included a $48 million insurance settlement related to damages from Hurricane Ida.\nIn crushing, we delivered another strong quarter but lower than the prior year as global crush margins remained healthy, but lower than the very strong levels of a year ago. Our strong results were led by North America, as the crush margin environment remains well supported by structurally higher demand for vegetable oils. We officially opened our new crush facility in Spiritwood, North Dakota to meet growing demand. We are currently in the commissioning process and expected to be running at full rates in early November, adding an additional 1.5 million metric tons of crush capacity per year.\nIn EMEA, we continue to optimize our flex capacity to prioritize crush of higher-margin softseed in line with market opportunities. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects which were lower than the net positive impacts in the prior year quarter.\nRefined Products and other posted another strong quarter, higher than the prior year period. Results were led by solid volumes and margins in North America. In EMEA, robust export demand for biodiesel and domestic demand for food oil drove higher results versus the prior year. In the quarter, there were large net positive mark-to-market timing effects, which are expected to reverse as contracts execute in future periods. Equity earnings from Wilmar was significantly lower versus the third quarter of 2022.\nLooking ahead, for the first quarter in Ag Services and Oilseeds, we anticipate strong results that are slightly lower than last year, excluding the $110 million legal settlement in the ag services subsegment from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect Ag Services results to be in line with the prior year, excluding the legal settlement. We anticipate similar year-over-year North American export volumes, a competitive South American export program and continued strong performance from global trade. We forecast our crushing subsegment will deliver strong results similar to the prior year. We expect robust soy and canola crush margins and with the ramping of our Spiritwood operations, higher volumes. We expect RPO to perform well but be significantly below last year as positive timing impacts from prior quarters are expected to reverse.\nSlide 6, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered an outstanding quarter that was significantly higher than the prior year, enabled by the ongoing optimization of our production and supply chain network. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment were higher year-over-year on a healthy demand and strong margin environment across starches, sweeteners, wheat flour and ethanol. Our team generated new customer wins and delivered double-digit growth year-to-date in our BioSolutions platform. As Juan touched on earlier, we also signed a formal agreement with Broadwing Energy to provide lower emissions power to a decade facility, extending our ability to provide low carbon solutions across the value chain. In the Vantage Corn Processors subsegment, our team executed well in a strong ethanol demand and margin environment, leading to significantly higher year-over-year results.\nLooking ahead for the fourth quarter, we expect steady demand and margins for our starches sweeteners and wheat flower products. We remain constructive on ethanol margins driven by solid domestic demand and healthy U.S. exports, supported by lower competing exports from Brazil due to higher sugar prices. We anticipate results to be similar to the prior year period, but with upside potential if the current ethanol margin structure holds.\nOn Slide 7. In Nutrition, strong results in Flavors, health and wellness and recovery in the base Animal Nutrition business, were more than offset by continued lower demand for plant-based proteins and persistent demand fulfillment challenges in pet solutions. Flavors reported impressive results in a complex operating environment, delivering a 29% growth in operating profit on a constant currency basis. Results were led by pricing actions in EMEA and strong win rates in North America. During the quarter, we also implemented a successful go-live of our One ADM project in the EMEA region across 18 locations in 12 countries. This represents a significant milestone as we continue to harness digital across the enterprise to drive productivity gains. In Specialty Ingredients, weak market demand, particularly in the alternate meat category, inventory adjustments and unplanned downtime resulting from the recent Decatur incident led to significantly lower year-over-year results. The plant-based protein market has been experiencing destocking and consumer demand softness over the course of the year that will likely persist into next year. Given these recent market dynamics, we have re-scoped our Decatur protein modernization investment project to better match the expected lower growth demand environment. Also, we are leveraging our expertise in creation, design and development to differentiate our product offerings to serve evolving consumer needs. These adjustments will enable a faster pivot to higher growth and more resilient categories such as specialized nutrition, which have synergies across the nutrition portfolio, and we are rapidly building this revenue pipeline. Health and Wellness results were higher year-over-year due to double-digit biotech sales and a favorable impact related to the revised commercial agreement with fiber.\nDuring the quarter, we realized a significant expansion in our revenue pipeline reinforcing the demand for evidence-based solutions.\nIn Animal Nutrition, we are beginning to see the cost optimization actions and the expansion of offerings in the specialty feed and ingredient space from earlier this year, driving improved performance. However, the recovery in the base business was more than offset by normalized year-over-year amino acids margins as well as lower profit contribution from the Pet Solutions business.\nLooking forward, we anticipate flavors to finish the year strong. driven by growth in EMEA and North America. Health and wellness operating profit is expected to finish similar to last year. Animal Nutrition operating profit is expected to continue to recover sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Specialty Ingredients operating profit is expected to be down significantly, impacted by the recent Decatur East incident and demand softness.\nAll in, we now expect full year 2023 operating profit for Nutrition to be around $600 million. While our results in 2023 have been below our expectations, we expect nutrition to return to growth in 2024. We will continue to build on the Flavors momentum from 2023. Health and wellness should maintain its steady performance. The cost actions in the shopper pivot to higher-margin products will enable animal nutrition to drive growth, further reinforced by improved go-to-market capabilities.\nLastly, for SI, we will work aggressively to restart operational capabilities at Decatur East to minimize the impact in 2024.\nSlide 8, please. Other business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher net interest income. Captive insurance results were slightly lower on higher claim settlements partially offset by premiums from new programs. In corporate results, net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year, primarily on higher short-term interest rates. Unallocated corporate costs of $298 million were higher versus the prior year on higher global technology spend to support our digital transformation efforts. Other corporate was favorable versus the prior year primarily due to foreign currency hedges. We still forecast corporate cost to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was approximately 20% higher than the prior year primarily due to a change in the geographic mix of earnings. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%.\nNext slide, please. Through the third quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $3.8 billion. We continue to invest in the business, allocating $1.1 billion to capital expenditures and have returned $1.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We have ample liquidity with over $13 billion of cash and available credit, and our balance sheet is very strong. with an adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 0.9.\nOur fortress balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to drive our long-term strategic agenda while also returning capital to shareholders and is also a competitive advantage, particularly in a higher for longer interest rate environment. We have completed $1.1 billion of share repurchases through Q3 and expect to increase the pace of repurchases in Q4. Even with the softness in nutrition, and lower-than-expected profit contributions from Wilmar. We are raising our 2023 earnings outlook again and now anticipate full year EPS in excess of $7 per share.\nJuan?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Vikram.\nAs we close today's call, let me share a few thoughts about how we're seeing our efforts in 2023 position ADM to continue solid progression into 2024. We external factors that influence ADM's forward look are closely aligned to the enduring macro trends we have positioned ourselves to be nimble in managing. We continue to see the interconnectivity across food security, health and well-being and sustainability, having an amplifying effect across the industries we serve. More frequent extreme weather, extreme weather, geopolitical events and the recent pandemic have all highlighted the criticality of food security within those geographies and for the regions that are served by their agricultural exports. Connected to this, we see areas of supply abundance growing as evidenced by Brazil's record res and crop cycles and areas of need shifting. In some cases, this has resulted in either more domestic consumption in countries like the U.S. or elevated import demand situations where our unparalleled global asset base and deep experience are critical. Government policies beginning to support new demand patterns, whether based on a move to more renewable energy sources or an effort to increase regenerative agriculture supply. Science continues to accelerate innovation in Nutrition with an ever-present consumer interest in turning their food, beverage and supplement consumption to their personal health and dietary needs. Beyond the challenges and opportunities connected to these external factors, we believe ADM is positioned to leverage productivity and innovation to build momentum in the coming year. a continuation of the strategic efforts we have been driving throughout 2023. We anticipate our services and oilseeds continue to leverage its extended value chain and deliver structural changes to demand. We anticipate that crush margins will remain healthy while our productivity measures enable us to have a more efficient cost structure. We continue to drive opportunistic extension of our destination marketing scope, grow our regenerative agriculture acres and partnerships and expand our renewable fuels feedstock production.\nIn Car Solutions, the compounding effects of our transformative investments coupled with early contracting for starches and sweeteners and what we believe to be a positive ethanol environment are setting up for another strong year in 2024.\nFor Nutrition, we expect continued growth in our revenue opportunity pipeline with significant conversions continuing as we move past some near-term demand weakness. Our expanding results in flavors continue to signal acceleration across our broader portfolio. We expect the positive revenue growth trends in health and wellness to drive into next year, and we're already pivoting specialty ingredients towards high potential areas like alternative daily and specialized nutrition. Our actions in Animal Nutrition are delivering a positive impact and sustained opportunity growth, which we believe will expand further through the segment in the coming year. And by applying our commercial excellence efforts to this portfolio, we are focusing on the value of innovation in the specialty parts of the business. In closing, I want to express my gratitude to the ADM team for their dedication, hard work and resourcefulness. With the momentum we have been building upon the foundation for growth we have established I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver solid results as we move into 2024 and continue to pave a path for long-term profit growth.\nThank you. Operator, please open the line for questions.",

Very pleased to say that despite the challenging market condition, we delivered another period of solid performance, great service to our customer to more customers and good outcome for our shareholders as well despite the high inflationary environment.\nSo thank you for joining us. As usual, I will start with the key highlights. Geraint will follow up with more detail on our key financial metrics. Cristina will explain us how we navigated this extreme cycle, and we'll provide more detail on household and market trends. Costantino will tell us how we strengthen our position overseas. And then I will come back to share some exciting progress on our lending business and our strategy.\nSo well, these are pictures from top 10. This is our most iconic event, in which we celebrate our colleagues that go above and beyond for our customers and our shareholders. So let me start by thanking those who work behind the achievements that we are about to present. Speaking of which, in the last year, our turnover grew by more than 20%, this was mainly driven by price increase to respond to the high inflation. Our customer around the group overall were up 4%, and it was driven by Europe and [ Neuro ] and grow compensated the reduction in active policy base in U.K. motor insurance. Our profit under the new accounting standard, IFRS 17 were GBP 234 million. This figure is higher than last reporting period and it's also higher than H1 2022 restated under IFRS 17, but is lower versus H1 2020, '22 under IFRS 4.\nAnd I think overall, this is a solid combination of results. And it's nice to observe that this was also a truth effort as all our mature business contributed both to turnover growth and improved bottom line. We're proud of the [ pro ] we made in our strategy, particularly the adoption of advanced analytics, tech capabilities and some of the development in the newer business. And I'm pleased to say that we are, again, in a very strong, solid capital position with a solvency ratio of 182%. And that, as usual, we've been disciplined in our underwriting and pricing, and this put us on a strong footing for a turning cycle. And now let me start with a bit more detail on market conditions.\nI wish I could tell you a different story from 6 months ago, but it's a bit more of the same, to be honest. Although we believe that we are closer to a turning point. In the graph bottom left, you can see CPI inflation and average market premium increase in each country for H2 2022 and first half of 2023. Now as you see, CPI inflation is decreasing everywhere, but it's still high. And that's even more true for material damage inflation for which, unfortunately, we don't have comparable data by country, but that sits higher on top of CPI inflation. And this inflation stableness led to stronger price increase than anticipated for the market that should lead to materially improved results in the underwriting year 2023.\nAnother consequence of renewal price increases is a strong growth in shopping. And overseas, where shopping is a less and grain habit. This may lead to an acceleration of the migration toward the direct channel. As for Admiral, we continue to monitor the trend very closely and act very fast on market condition and change. Our objective is always the same. We remain to focus on maximize medium-term profitability that depends by a combination of revised market trend, estimated ratio and price elasticity. And this approach led to different outcomes in different parts of the group.\nIn U.K. Motor, where we have a large book and we had increased price well ahead of the market last year. The rational outcome was to shrink in the first part of 2023. This price -- this gap pricing gap with the market is closing, as Cristina will explain later, and we expect to return to growth soon. In the other country and product, where inflation was lower, market reaction was lower and we have still more potential for economy of scale. We continue to grow, 20% overall, around 20% overall, although more cautiously than previously. The U.S. is the only exception. As anticipated 6 months ago, we are successfully prioritizing capital preservation and loss reduction in the state. And the process to assess future option is progressing. I will provide an update in due course where we'll have more to share. And now to Geraint with more details on our financial results.\n\nGeraint Jones\n\nCFO & Executive Director\n\nThanks, Milena. Good morning, everyone. I'll cover off some of the highlights from a solid first half. I'll give an overview of the impact of IFRS 17 on this period and the restated 2022. I look at the U.K. motor results, U.K. motor loss ratios, and then I'll finish off on the half year capital position and the interim dividend.\nTo start with, these are the usual set of financial highlights. And just to comment quickly here on the basis of preparation, which is obviously the first time that we reported under IFRS 17. Financial statements include a restated set of 2022 figures for H1 and the full year. On this slide, the pretax profit and the earnings per share numbers are the most impacted and the originally reported numbers you see in the footnote. The numbers continue to be influenced by the high inflation we've seen in all our businesses. Though as Milena mentioned, we're satisfied that we've responded appropriately and robustly and to what we're seeing. And whilst not yet very apparent in the profit numbers, there are clear signs of improving performance and more positive markets in 2023.\nPretax profit for H1 was GBP 234 million and earnings per share was 58p. The higher U.K. tax rate of 25% versus 19% explains most of the difference in the percentages there. Return on equity was improved and strong at just under 40%, and that's partly positively impacted by lower equity under IFRS 17 as we flagged. The half year solvency position was strong, again, at 182%, and we declared an interim dividend of 51p per share, which is a touch under 90% of the first half post-tax profits.\nNow despite the payout ratio remaining the same, basically, as the first half of 2022, last year's interim dividend was, of course, based off the IFRS 4 profits, which were higher than the restated IFRS 17 result as we'll see shortly plus, as I mentioned, the effective tax rate is high for this period. And those 2 factors explain the 15% change in the dividend. You see clear evidence of our strong response to claims inflation in the top line metrics where customer numbers increased more modestly than in recent periods, but there was a very strong increase in turnover, driven by significant increases in premiums across the group.\nSo let's take a quick look now at how those numbers break down. This slide will shows customer numbers and turnover across the group. The main observations here are: firstly, on U.K. Motor, customer numbers reduced by around 3% in the first half. As the cumulative impact of our rate changes over the past 15 months or so continue to impact volumes. And it's very apparent though that those rate increases are taking effect with the big increase in turnover reported that you can see. U.K. households delivered strong growth again and with pricing moving up in our business and in the market, we see a large increase in turnover. Internationally, again, we see double-digit growth in customer numbers, growth in Europe, a slight reduction in the U.S. and again, to continue the theme, strong pricing action led to a bigger increase in turnover. And finally, in Admiral Money, we saw continued growth through further tightening of credit rules in response to economic conditions has consciously slowed the rate. This slide doesn't show the growing numbers of customers across the group with travel, pet, Veygo, et cetera. We see very strong growth in those areas.\nBefore we look at the group results, I'd like to make a few points here on new accounting standards, obviously big news. The main qualitative points are at the top are as stated before. IFRS 17 does change the accounting and particularly the presentation and can change profit recognition patterns, though it doesn't change our business fundamentals. In reasonably normal trading conditions, we wouldn't expect to see significant differences in profitability under the new versus the old accounting standard. We don't keep IFRS 4 accounts anymore. So of course, it's not possible to present full reconciliations from here on. [ ANIA ] thankfully is a nonlife insurer, we are able to adopt the simplified approach.\nOn the bottom left, we make observations on the restatement of 2022. IFRS 4 H1 profit was a little higher than the restated numbers and that's mainly due to differences in the reserve strength or risk adjustment positions over 2022. Under IFRS 4, we moved down to the 95th percentile at the end of 2022 from a higher position at the start of the year. Under IFRS 17, we started and ended the year at the 95th percent. And so smaller reserve releases led to lower profit on the IFRS 17 basis. The difference in profit is more pronounced in H2 as the reserve strength movement in H2 under IFRS 4 was more pronounced. So we see this aligning of reserve strength positions at the end of 2022 as part of the transition to IFRS 17 rather than the new standard leading to a different result.\nAnd on the bottom right, some more straightforward observations on 2023, H1. Assuming similar changes in risk adjustment percentage, we would not have seen a materially different IFRS 4 number for this period had we prepared IFRS for [ cats ]. There are some ups and downs a discounting is one of the positive impacts -- there's no real difference to the bottom line from the new standard this year. In the [ APEX ], we include more information than usual to hopefully help me in understanding the new accounting treatments, including discounting and reinsurance, particularly. And we have dedicated sessions, as I think you all know, set up tomorrow and more time available on Friday for technical query. So give us a shout if you're not down to join those who want to. That's the background. So let's now take a look at results across the group versus the last half year.\nAnd here, we also show the IFRS 4 2022 H1 numbers for reference. Main theme in the insurance businesses continues to be claims inflation. And although we see generally strong improvement in underwriting year 2023 combined ratios is predominantly the earlier years that are contributing to profit in this half year and of course, particularly including the lower margin '21 and '22 underwriting years. The U.K. Insurance business reported a total profit of just over GBP 300 million which is around 5% up on the restated 2022 H1. Motor profit, as you can see in the text on the right, was just under GBP 300 million, and that's covered on an expert on one page. U.K. household profit was up to GBP 9 million from GBP 4 million, with a few factors impacting the result there. Firstly, we see a higher non-weather loss ratio this period. That's impacted by inflation. Secondly, there is a lower severe weather costs H1 as a result of lower severe weather. Thirdly, lower reserve releases, which were impacted by an increased estimated cost of the December 2022 freeze event.\nAnd finally, a one-off crystallization of profit commission on one of our quota share contracts on household. Internationally, we saw a decent and expected improvement half year on half year. Starting first in Europe, the overall results improved to a profit of GBP 3 million from a loss of GBP 3 million including a motor profit of 5 versus a loss of 2, obviously, more satisfactory first half. The results are still impacted by high loss ratios over the past underwriting year or so, but the underlying results, again, have improved with significant rate increases. There is continuing investment in distribution diversification in Italy and Spain and investment in growth across all businesses, which does impact the expenses.\nIn the U.S., our goal was to materially improve the bottom line compared to last year. We're satisfied with the improvement and more so in the underwriting year result. The U.S. loss was particularly heavy in H2 last year, and we don't expect a similar pattern to repeat this year. The conditions in the U.S. remain tough. Admiral Money continued to grow, as we noted earlier, business pleasingly remains profitable and is, of course, prudently provided. We'll continue to take a cautious approach to growth and risk appetite. Admiral Pioneer result was a bit worse half year on half year, notably impacted by a handful of large claims in the Veygo business and also continuing investment in growing our SME insurance business. The other items at the bottom were higher, as you see, and there are a number of factors that contribute to that, including some one-offs. There is an analysis in the appendix and happy to take any questions on that later.\nLet's now take a look at U.K. Motor, which is the key driver to group profit. This is a summarized income statement versus the restated '22 H1, comments on the right on the main drivers of the change. First, as noted earlier, despite the small reduction in the book side, rate increases have led to a much higher average premium and a strong increase in turnover. Secondly, higher interest rates had a couple of impacts: firstly, higher investment income, as expected, but also higher discounting impact on current year claims. We've got more detail on investments in the appendix, but there are no changes to report in our approach on investments. Three, in terms of the ratios, we've shown 2 sets ratios on this slide. First set is based on total insurance revenue, so includes add-ons and fees. And the bottom shows just the core motor insurance policy metrics.\nWe see essentially a flat core motor loss ratio which is made up of a higher current period ratio impacted by 2022, offset by larger reserve releases. The expense ratio is higher on an earned basis, partly due to the impact of a lag in the higher premium -- higher average premium earning through but the written basis ratio is flat at around 19.5%. Perhaps the most important metric currently is U.K. Motor loss ratio. So let's take a look at what's happening there.\nTwo charts both on an underwriting year basis for the core motor insurance only. On the left, we show the projected ultimates and on the right, the booked ratios. IFRS 17 means we're showing the ratios on a different basis here. And so they will be directly comparable to the ones you've seen previously. Both these sets of ratios are discounted, which is obviously a more important element under IFRS 17, and we've included guidance in the appendix on how discounting works and we also include the undiscounted triangles. Some key observations. We're not yet seeing notable changes in average claims cost inflation in H1, but we expect inflation to start easing in H2 and beyond.\nWe believe the ultimates on the more recent underwriting years are still prudently projected and for instance, include prudent positions on bodily injury claims where we're not yet seeing particular stress come through in our numbers. We also continue to reserve at the minus 0.25% personal injury discount rate. But as we approach the review date in 2024, tentatively expecting a better rate, we've included some sensitivities. We continue to see improvements related mainly to bodily injury claims on the older years, but the more recent years have been stable, as you can see.\nNow on the [ 10th slide ], the book reserves closed the half year at the upper end of our accounting policy range. As flag, we moved that percentage down slightly from the 95th percentile at the start of the year to the 94th percentile at half year. Reserve releases are still an important contributor to profit, and we expect this to continue, absent any major claims shocks.\nMoving now to look at the half year capital position and the interim dividend. And firstly, on the top, this is the capital position, 182%, slightly higher position than at the full year, and it remains very comfortable. The level of surplus in pounds millions has increased. As you will have seen at the end of June, we successfully refinanced our Tier 2 capital. We increased the size to GBP 250 million and bought back most of the 2024 maturing bond. The movement from full year '22 to half year '23 is set out in the appendix. And that broadly shows half one capital generation offset by the interim dividend and the impact of the new Tier 2 partly offset by the impact of a higher capital requirement, which results from growth. As we're currently in the business written in the second half is more profitable again than in the first half, we would expect capital generation in the second half to be larger.\nMost of you, I think, will be familiar that we also track and report solvency under the PRA approved capital add-on as opposed to the numbers here, which feature an updated add-on, which takes account of the latest balance sheet and risk positions. At our request, the PRAs agreed to reduce that [ grade ] from just over GBP 80 million to closer to GBP 20 million, which is a significant reduction and so there is now a smaller difference between the updated numbers that you see on this slide and the regulatory approved solvency ratios. Now there's no news to report on internal model development where work and regulatory engagement to continue.\nAnd then on the bottom of the slide, the dividend information. The interim dividend, as I mentioned, is 51p per share. That's equal to 89% to the first half post-tax profits in line with our usual practice. I explained earlier the reasons for the change period-on-period despite the flat -- basically flat payout ratio, as you can see on the slide. And again, there's no change in dividend guidance. To summarize a few of the key points from the first half, very strong claims inflation continues to impact the reported results as the profit on the lower margin '21 and '22 underwriting use is recognized. Our response, mainly in terms of substantial rate increases means much improved profitability on the '23 underwriting years across our businesses.\nBut in the very short term, the accounting results will continue to be influenced by those '21 and '22 years. We've seen stronger levels of rate increase in various markets in the first half and we expect this to continue through H2 at least. And as usual, we report a strong solvency position. We've successfully refinanced Tier 2 capital, and we're paying out nearly 90% of the first half profits. Over now to Cristina to talk to us about the U.K.\n\nCristina Nestares\n\nChief Executive Officer of UK Insurance\n\nGood morning, everybody. I am going to cover the results for our U.K. Insurance business, starting with the highlights.\nIn 2023, so far, we have seen inflation, which has remained very high. And we have seen very strong price increases, both in the market and in Admiral. And this trend applies to our both products to the household and motor market. Now interestingly, the impact on the size of our book for those 2 products have been quite different. So in the case of motor, we decreased year-on-year upper books and 3% compared to the end of last year. And in household, we grew by 14%, mostly helped by retention. Our price increases starting from last year are feeding through our average premiums, and you can see strong increases in our turnover for both products. For the rest of the year, we continuation of these trends, price increases for both Admiral and the market. And hopefully, we might start to see cost stalling.\nAnd then finally, Consumer Duty is life became into effect a couple of weeks ago. In the Admiral, we're very committed to delivering good outcomes to our customers and to offer fair value products. So we don't expect any significant financial impact from this reform.\nNow let's move to pricing. Let's start with the market. In the first graph, you have market data in blue ABI, which includes new business and renewals, and in red, the Confused index, which focuses on new business prices on price comparison. As you can see, the market has started increasing prices in the second half of last year, but there has been a clear acceleration of price increases as H1 has progressed. Particularly relevant are the increases that we have seen in Q2 as shown by the Confused index and also good to see that in July, price increases in the market have continued to be quite strong. All in all, looking at Confused, the price increases in the first half of the year have been 23%.\nIn the second graph, you have Admiral Times Top. Just as a reminder that what this graph shows is the percentage of times where Admiral was cheapest on price comparison, and we indexed this to January '22. Now as you can see, we started increasing prices quite strongly from April last year, and we became much less competitive. What has happened since the end of last year is that as the market has started to significant price increases, our competitiveness has improved. This explains why we shrunk by 7%, if you look year-on-year, but less when you compare to the end of last year.\nNow a key question that you might be asking is when are we going to go back to growth. Good news is that in the past few weeks, we are seeing our number of customers in motor stabilizing. So we expect to return to growth in the near future. Now exactly when it's hard to tell, and it will depend on what the rest of the market does with prices. We will continue putting pricing up to account for inflation.\nSo let's now take a look at the motor claims and let's start with frequency. The graph on the top is road usage interesting in the past few months. We're starting to see very similar levels of miles driven as we saw pre COVID. However, frequency remains lower than before the pandemic. Two key reasons. First is the impact of the whiplash reforms. And secondly is that we still see less claims during peak hours.\nMoving now to damage inflation. It remains quite high. You can see in the first graph on the bottom, how prices have continued to increase. And we do a bit of a dip down into the reasons for this definitely, repair delays, there is still some pressure on market capacity. Labor cost have been increasing. Also, when you look at credit hire cost because these claims are taking longer, we're seeing higher cost. On the good news, parts availability is becoming better, which helps is these repair delays. And also second hand car prices have started to stabilize, as you can see in the second graph on the bottom.\nAnd finally, there has been an increase in theft in the market, although it remains a small part of claims. And then in terms of Bodily injury, quite stable. When you look at the claims that have settled in this first half of the year compared to last year, we don't see significant changes. But a couple of things to take into account. First, in terms of small BI, we still wait for the resolution of the court case on mix in due settlement. And we expect this at the beginning of next year. And secondly, in terms of large bodily [ Inder ], they are developing as expected, but we hold some prudent reserves to take into account for a possible increase in wage inflation.\nAnd finally, in terms of the Ogden rate not further news. We expect to know more in the next 6 to 12 months as we think the rate will be decided at the end of '24 or beginning of '25 and then taking everything into account, it's quite pleasing to see that despite all the challenges at middle claims costs continue to be better than the market.\nNow let's move to our household business. We [ wish it ] celebrated our tenth anniversary since the launch. And in this period, average premiums have remained flat. So basically, when looking at the ABI data, the premium -- the average premium in the first half of '23 has been the same as in the first half of 2013. So this puts into context how pleasing is to see finally clear increases in the market in 2023. Overall, and according to the ABI, prices in the market -- or sorry, premiums in the market have gone up by 10%. The rationale for this inflation, very strong and very clear. The second one is [ free ] events and weather last year. And then the third reason we believe is the impact of the FCA reform, which put pressure, especially on renewal premiums.\nIn this environment, Admiral has continued putting prices up. We started in the second half of last year, where we increased about high single digits. And this year, in the first half, we have increased prices even more around 20%. And despite this, we have been able to grow, help by retention, which continues to be above market levels and our multi proposition. As mentioned, inflation for household has continued to be high. And also, there are pressures on our supply chain and the market supply chain, partly more pressure has come from the freeze event, and there are still a lot of claims that need to be settled.\nSo what I want to say is in terms of profitability of our household book, we have seen good profits this first half, but that has been say influenced by one-off profit commission coming from the commutation of our reinsurance agreements. And then to finalize, let's take a look at our expectations for the rest of the year.\nAs I said, continuation of similar trends in terms of prices. Admiral continue putting prices up in household and in motor, and we expect the market to continue doing so. As I said, growth, we hope to continue to see strong price increases in the market, which should help the Admiral Motor book go back to growth. In terms of underwriting performance, we are growing our confidence that for both products, 2023 loss ratio will be better than 2022. And then in terms of inflation, as I said and held by the CPI news this morning, we expect to see costs starting to stabilize.\nSo this is it for the U.K. Insurance results, is a reminder of our core principles. We maintain pricing discipline, and we will continue doing so prioritizing profit over growth. And secondly, we hold very -- or a very prudent approach to our reserves. And now over to Costin to talk to us more about our international results.\n\nCostantino Moretti\n\nChief Executive Officer of International Insurance\n\nThanks, Cristina, and good morning, everyone. 2023 has been a very intense year so far in our international businesses. And although the market continues to be challenging, we have made good progress.\nIn the U.S., we have significantly reduced losses and we minimize capital injections from a group perspective. In Europe, we are profitable on a combined basis with significant growth benefiting from higher premiums and [ missile ] scale.\nMoving on to the next slide and our U.S. business elephant. In line with our stronger objectives, we continue to make progress. both in improving the results and evaluating options for the future, which we will comment on in due course, as Milena already mentioned. Elephant's combined ratio has been improving over time compared to market. Thanks to the [ carrier ] price increases and bold actions to reduce expenses. Improving the bottom line remains a priority. And in the face of a challenging market with very high claims inflation, we continue to take actions focused on improving the profitability of the portfolio and driving efficiencies by leveraging our strong technology platform.\nMoving on to the next slide and our European operations. A very strong half overall. We're almost 2 million happy customers in 14% year-on-year growth, and we were profitable on a combined basis. In all regions, we have a loss ratio competitive advantage over our direct competitors and continue -- and continuous price increases place throughout 2022 and the first half of 2023 have supported this. Our actions have been stronger in Italy and Spain due to the nature of these 2 markets where we have seen a more pronounced downward movement in market premiums in recent years and are now entering a hardening phase of the cycle. All our European operations have been profitable in their core direct business in the first half of the year. We are continuing to invest in distribution diversification, particularly in Italy and Spain.\nHowever, in Spain, these investments have more than offset the positive contribution from the direct business. But we believe that our strategic investments in brokers and partnerships will provide us with significant opportunities to create long-term value, and we will continue to pursue them with discipline. The economies of scale, the increased adoption of digital services by our customers. and the automation of internal processes have benefited our expense ratio in all the businesses.\nIn summary, we are very pleased over the results we have achieved and the progress we have made with our strategy. We are conscious that there is more work to do, and we remain focused on medium-term profitability, continuing to balance margin protections and growth in relation to market condition. Thank you. And now I hand over you to Milena to present the results of the loans business.\n\nMilena Mondini-de-Focatiis\n\nGroup CEO & Executive Director\n\nThank you, Costantino. So now a bit more details on Admiral Money. Once again, we are reporting strong performance in the first half of 2023, with a profit increase to GBP 2.7 million. Gross loans balance have grown above GBP 1 billion at a rate of 16% since full year and slowed in comparison to 2022. We remain indeed cautious during this period of economic uncertainty and we closely monitor the impact of the rice cost of living and higher interest rates on consumers to ensure we remain vigilant for any sign of possible deterioration.\nLending strategy has been proactively calibrated to the latest macroeconomic outlook with action taken to announce assumptions in affordability assessment with more targeted action for those customers deemed to be most at risk. We continue to retain an appropriate prudence in our credit loss provision with coverage remaining at 7.2%, which includes GBP 12.6 million of post model adjustment to account for potential anticipated pressures on our customers. We continue to demonstrate indication of a long-term expense advantage versus the market as an insurance. With a further reduced cost income ratio, down to 38%, which is quite exceptional for a business of this scale.\nLooking forward, we anticipate H2 to be a period of modest growth, and therefore, we confirm our guidance in line with what we provided at full year. Now looking a bit more at the future and our strategy. Our strategy remains unchanged with customer and people at very heart. We continue announcing our capabilities, particularly in data and technology, innovating further to develop our core competencies and also transferring them into the new line of business. So let me call out a few examples of the progress we made in the last 6 months.\nIf you look at the market volatility of the last few years, it's clear to me that speed of change and agility are accrual to succeed and will be even more the case in the future. And we're proud to have completed the transformation from agile to scale agile in U.K. and other European countries. And in Italy, where this change is most mature, this led to halving cycle times and complaints and [ fines core ] every year since. We also increased substantially the adoption of machine learning models that now empower the majority of our U.K. Motor and Household quote, with a positive impact on both loss ratio and conversion rate.\nLooking at mobility in under tendency with the rest of U.K. motor book, we increased our share of electric vehicles, and we continue to learn from connected vehicles and new proposition. Finally, we are pretty proud of Admiral Money cost/income ratio, as just mentioned. And also [ Bolivia ] that now contain is a positive contributor of P&L. We're also in the process of [ ring gluco ] French household business with around 200,000 policies to reinforce our position in the household market and also to replicate the synergy that we achieved in the U.K. with our multi proposition. This was a good moment to do a quick reminder of the main rationale and the focus outside the U.K. Motor Insurance.\nSo the objective for us is to create win-win opportunities for our customers and our shareholders as well as increasing resilience of our business model. And this not only through diversification of profit but also by strengthening the relationship with our existing customers and their lifetime value. The main focus is only on a few large opportunities where we believe we have a clear right to win that we can leverage on our assets and capabilities to create value. And this business that can continue to deliver growth and target a good return on equity over time. And to do so with a fast, possibly cheap learning approach with strong discipline, that includes not be afraid to make bold choice when needed.\nFor example, as we did the Penguin Portals or compare or this year, where we exited a small French fleet business. We have a strong framework in place for efficient investment and we are organizing ourselves to ensure limited distraction to our core business before the new venture is scaled and its business viability is proved. On the right side, the main current area of focus in dark blue, the business that are mature contributors to the bottom line and in lighter blue, the one that are at earlier stage. The biggest growth from GI products, such as household and travel and more recently, pet insurance for our U.K. Admiral private customer. And the results are very strong from retention, customer feedback and a growth standpoint. And return on investment is expected to be fast and solid for all.\nSimilarly, for Admiral Money, it's a different business, not an insurance product to start with. But in reality, surprisingly similar in terms of scheme required to succeed and has good synergy with our core business. In addition, there is our first step beyond private customers. That's in U.K. where we're investing to develop a proposition, a stronger proposition for small menu business. SME Insurance is an appealing market where we can leverage on our brand and also capture similar trends that support our growth in the U.K. 20 years ago. But distribution is to be proof and still early stage.\nFinally, beyond U.K., we continue to grow and develop our European business, as Costin just mentioned, where we believe we can replicate a similar position to U.K., although at smaller scale, given this direct distribution is still limited in those markets. But the core of our strengths remain our culture. We do find the purpose, pride and drive in doing what is right by our customer with good feedback score and trying to make their experience better every day and product awards that testify that. What is right by our communities that we continue to support with a focus on employability, having held more than 1,000 people into new job recently and also what is right by our planet.\nAnd I'd like to close where I started with a big thank you to our people that altogether year after year in every country in which we operate, make Admiral one of the greatest places to work.\nWell to summarize, the key element of this set of results are a solid profit of GBP 234 million. That is up 4% versus H1 restated under the new accounting standard in challenging market conditions. Premium growth across all business with an expectation of secondly, improved profitability of the business written this year but important to remind that this will take time to fit into our reported earnings. Turning cycle, well positioned for future growth, good progress on our new ventures and good progress on our Admiral 2.0 strategy. So our business remains strong and resilient with happy customers and employees. And that's all for now, and we're very happy to take any questions.\nCouple of logistics, let's try to limit questions to 2 and leave some of the most -- more technical question IFRS 17 to our session tomorrow. We will start from the audience, we'll move [indiscernible]. We have a few people listening us from remotely. If you want to ask a question, you have a microphone on your left and you need to take all the button for all the time that you speak. Otherwise, we cannot hear it. And with that, who would like to start please?",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Bailey. Hello, and welcome to the first quarter earnings webcast for ADM. Starting tomorrow, a replay of this webcast will be available on our Investor Relations website.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Some of our comments and materials may constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC, concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation.\nTo the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, as a result of new information or future events. On today's webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will discuss our first quarter results, provide ADM's perspective on the current market backdrop and share progress highlights on our strategic priorities for the year. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review the drivers of our financial performance at the segment level and review our cash generation and capital allocation results. Juan will have some closing remarks, and then he and Vikram will take your questions.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Megan, and thanks to all those joining us for the call today. This morning, ADM reported strong first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, with an adjusted segment operating profit of $1.7 billion and a trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 14%. Our performance demonstrates once again, the advantage of ADM's uniquely integrated value chain and broad portfolio. Along with the team's ability to respond nimbly to opportunities aligned to the 3 enduring trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability.\nAll of this was achieved in a fluid economic environment, where repeal effects are being felt from both inflationary and recessionary pressures. Shifts in global demand and trade activity and the ongoing war in Ukraine. Our team continues to find ways to rise above these challenges and meet our customers' needs for consistency, quality and innovation at every turn, across our business units. We have wrapped up Q1 with a strong balance sheet, healthy cash flows, and we are on track for our 2023 and long-term strategic growth plans, and we continue to pursue growth opportunities and increase shareholder returns, in alignment with our disciplined capital allocation framework.\nThis quarter, we also announced several exciting milestones in our continued growth and innovation strategy, including the opening of the world's first probiotic and postbiotics production facility in Valencia, Spain, which increases our global production capacity by a factor of 5. Agreements with ADM ventures partners, Brightseed and Believer meats to advance innovations in gut microbiome and cell-based meat respectively. And our definitive agreement with Tallgrass to pave the way for carbon capture from ADM's Columbus, Nebraska Complex furthering our decarbonization agenda.\nBeyond the financial highlights of the quarter, we are proud to be named one of Fortune's most admired companies for the 15th year running. And to receive our fourth consecutive Ethisphere award, as one of the world's most ethical companies. It's an honor to be recognized externally and it continues to demonstrate that ADM's culture and people are the engine behind our operational and financial success.\nAs we look back on the quarter, I'd like to review it in the context of the 2023 framing we discussed in Q4's call, and provide a few brief updates. Slide 4, please.\nIn January, we reviewed several factors that underpinned our confident outlook for 2023, and these same factors will continue to shape our performance throughout the year. The supply and demand situation remains fundamentally solid with some normalization of supply, alongside shift in both the products driving demand and the origins providing supply. Supply and transportation constraints in the Black Sea region, severe drought in Argentina, the record Brazilian crop and a resurgence of demand in China post lockdown have allowed our team to take full advantage of our global footprint. Broad-based food demand remains resilient across key geographies. And we did, we are seeing solid volumes and strong operating margins across vegetable oils, flavors, sweeteners, starches and with milling. Demand for biodiesel and renewable green diesel is robust, driving continued strong growth crush margins. The strong biofuels demand and continued expectation for growth supports our investment in new crush capacity like the additional 150,000 bushels per day from our Spiritwood, North Dakota facility scheduled to come online in time for the 2023 harvest.\nNutrition's growth trajectory for the year remains on course with a double-digit increase in our human Nutrition pipeline compared to this point in 2022. As noted, we expect this growth to be significantly weighted to the back half of the year, as we manage through some destocking impacts in beverage, lower margins in amino acids and the broader demand fulfillment challenges, we discussed in the last quarter.\nIt's important to recognize that our team delivered strong Q1 results, despite constantly evolving macroeconomic conditions. ADM's ability to remain agile and apply the principles of productivity and innovation continues to position us well, in a dynamic external environment. Let me take a moment to dig deeper into examples of how we are applying our productivity playbook across the organization, and how decarbonization is helping us find paths for both innovation and growth.\nSlide 5, please. From a productivity perspective, we have continued to focus attention on automation within many of our key operations facilities. Automation not only accelerates the modernization of our manufacturing footprint is helping us deliver significant savings at the enterprise level. Whether we are reducing chemicals usage, delivering yield improvements or supporting operational reliability, our automation program now has a plan to scale cost improvements across our most critical operational assets, over the next several years. 8 of our plans are currently underway, and we expect that most of these will complete their automation implementation by year-end. And we are seeing operational and financial impacts immediately following implementation.\nOur most recent implementation Cedar Rapids is already generating millions of dollars in efficiencies in just the first few months, confirming the double-digit returns, we expect to see from these proceeds. As a whole, the impact on operating profit is significant with a target run rate of approximately $200 million per year, when implementations are complete at more than 70 facilities over the next 7 years. This is only one example of productivity measures we are undertaking to ensure ADM maintains agility given the levels of uncertainty in the external environment. Each of our businesses and functions is identifying opportunities to drive efficiency at the scale, while maintaining a focus on growth.\nOur decarbonization journey continues to move at a rapid pace and is allowing us to showcase innovation in action. Our advantaged position in alternative fuels production has prepared us for the demand cycle that continues to rise across biodiesel and renewable diesel. We continue to explore strategic options to convert ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel. The multibillion dollar addressable opportunity represented by SAF alone, highlights the criticality of access to low-carbon feedstocks at a scale exponentially higher than what it is available today. This is why we are prioritizing the decarbonization of our Decatur complex, as the first critical step in unlocking significant value.\nLast year, we announced one of the world's first, ultra-low emissions power plants would be built adjacent to our Decatur processing complex, supplying ADM with low emissions steam and electricity. This leverages our world-class facility that has been successfully sequestered in CO2 for more than a decade. ADM is a pioneering carbon capture and sequestration, and we are extending that expertise with a plan to triple the number of CCS wells in the Decatur area and sequester up to 7 million metric tons of CO2 per year. This positions ADM as a clear leader in the ability to supply customers with low-carbon feedstocks and accelerate the decarbonization of their own value chain. And we think, this is just the beginning. I'll speak more about how we are defining that next phase, as we wrap up.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\n\nVikram Luthar\n\nSenior VP, Head of IR & CFO of Nutrition, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 6. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team had an outstanding start to 2023 with significantly higher year-over-year results in Q1. Ag Services results were much higher than the first quarter of 2022. In South American origination, excellent risk management and higher export demand due to the record Brazilian soybean crop drove significantly higher year-over-year results. In North America, origination results were also higher. Driven by stronger soybean exports. In global trade, solid margins and efficient execution led to strong results. Crushing results were in line with the first quarter last year.\nIn North America, the team executed well, capitalizing on historically strong soybean and softseed crush margins that were supported by robust demand for renewable fuels. In EMEA, crush margins were lower year-over-year, as trade flows adjusted from the dislocations caused last year by the war in Ukraine. Additionally, there were approximately $240 million of positive timing effects during the quarter, which included both expected reversals of prior timing losses, as we executed the business as well as a positive impact of about $100 million pulled forward from future periods, as crush margins declined at the end of the quarter. Refined Products and Other results were substantially higher than the prior year period.\nNorth America biodiesel results were higher with record volumes and strong margins, supported by favorable blend economics and tight diesel stocks. In EMEA, domestic demand for food, oil and export demand for biodiesel drove strong margins. Equity earnings from Wilmar were lower versus the first quarter of 2022. Looking ahead for the second quarter, we expect RPO to continue its strong performance. Crushing is expected to be strong, but lower than the prior year based on current crush margins. We do not expect last year's significant volatility that impacted energy and grain trade flows to reoccur in Ag Services.\nSlide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions delivered solid results in Q1, though lower than the very strong first quarter of the prior year. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment capitalized on solid demand in the quarter. North America Starches and Sweeteners delivered strong volumes and margins. Ethanol margins pressured by high industry stock levels were down relative to the same quarter last year. In EMEA, the team effectively managed margins in a dynamic operating environment to deliver improved results. The global wheat milling business posted much higher margins driven by robust customer demand. BioSolutions continued on its strong growth trajectory with revenues increasing by over 20% year-over-year. Vantage Corn Processors results were significantly lower due to weaker ethanol margins.\nLooking ahead for the second quarter, we expect resilient demand and strong margins for our Starches and Sweeteners products. Ethanol margins, while improving, are expected to remain below last year. Of note, we also recognized a $50 million benefit from a biofuel producer tax credit in the prior year quarter. That will not repeat.\nOn Slide 8, Nutrition results were significantly lower year-over-year versus the record prior year quarter. Human Nutrition results were in line with the first quarter of 2022, as the business continued to manage demand fulfillment challenges and destocking in certain categories. Flavors results were slightly lower than the prior year as strong results in EMEA were offset by lower results in North America. Specialty Ingredients results were higher year-over-year, driven by healthy margins. Health and Wellness was lower year-over-year. In Animal Nutrition, results were significantly lower compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to much lower margins on amino acids.\nThe Animal Nutrition business, excluding Pet, is expected to face challenging demand conditions over the course of the year, and we are taking actions to mitigate the impact. These actions include targeted cost reductions, refining our go-to-market strategy with a more customer-centric approach, optimizing our production footprint, particularly in EMEA and refocusing resources on our strongest growth categories.\nLooking ahead for the second quarter, we expect year-over-year profit growth at Human Nutrition while Animal Nutrition will still be lapping the higher amino acid margins from the prior year. For the full year, we expect to achieve 10% plus constant currency operating profit growth in Nutrition, led by Human Nutrition. And with continued recovery in demand fulfillment and reduced destocking effects, we remain optimistic about our Human Nutrition sales pipeline and growth opportunities. As we noted before, operating profit growth will be heavily weighted to the second half of the year.\nSlide 9, please. Other Business results were significantly higher than the prior year quarter due to improved ADM investor services earnings on higher interest income. Captive insurance results were in line with the prior year. In Corporate, unallocated corporate costs of $248 million were higher year-over-year, due primarily to higher financing and centers of excellence costs. Other corporate was unfavorable versus the prior year due to the absence of an ADM Ventures, investment revaluation gain, partially offset by higher contribution from foreign currency hedges. We still project corporate costs to be approximately $1.5 billion for the year.\nNet interest expense for the quarter increased $27 million year-over-year due primarily to higher short-term interest rates. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2023 was approximately 16%, in line with the prior year. For the full year, we still expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19%.\nNext slide, please. In the first quarter, we had strong operating cash flows before working capital of $1.3 billion. We allocated $325 million to capital expenditures, as well as returned $600 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to have ample liquidity with nearly $10 billion of cash and available credit. And our adjusted net debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.2x is well below our 2.5x threshold. Our strong balance sheet and single A credit rating provide a stable financial footing for ADM to pursue our strategic growth initiatives, while also returning capital to shareholders.\nIn 2023, we still anticipate $1.3 billion of capital expenditures and $1 billion of opportunistic buybacks subject to other strategic uses of capital. Juan?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Vikram. Before we wrap up today, I wanted to share some insights into how we're thinking about the remainder of 2023, and how we are positioning the company to take on the next phase of opportunities. We are confident that ADM will be able to deliver on our plans for 2023, despite some pockets of soft demand. Supply and demand shifts are allowing ADM to flex our integrated value chain in support of another strong year of results. We continue to advance partnership agreements with major players across multiple industries. From regenerative agriculture to alternative proteins, to sustainable fuels, to plant-based industrial and personal care products.\nAll of these partnerships are supporting ADM, as we evolve at pace with the external environment to capture new growth opportunities. We see accelerated upside emerging from product areas like biosolutions, expected to grow at double-digit rates, again this year. We have significant production capacity coming online within the year across our 3 businesses to support continued demand growth. And we're driving forward the broad-based decarbonization agenda in our Decatur complex which is unlocking both near-term and long-range value for our customers across multiple industries.\nWith the combination of solid business performance in the core business, along with the strong growth opportunities across our value chain. We expect that we will be able to deliver between $6 to $7 in earnings per share in 2023. And based on the strength of our balance sheet and cash position, we continue to pursue opportunities to deliver both near-term value to shareholders while positioning ADM for its next phase of growth. We're anticipating an in-depth review of the opportunities we see, and the path ahead with the investment community in the fourth quarter. We'll share more details on this event in the coming months.\nThank you for your time today. Vikram and I, look forward to answering any questions you may have. With that, Bailey, please open the line for questions.",

I'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Megan. This morning, we reported very strong fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.93. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. Our full year adjusted EPS of $7.85, adjusted segment operating profit of $6.6 billion and trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 13.6% demonstrate once again the great work of our global team of dedicated colleagues who manage unprecedented market disruptions to deliver an outstanding year.\nOur full year operating cash flow before working capital was $5.3 billion. This strong cash flow and the disciplined management of our balance sheet allow us to continue to reinvest in our business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures and return cash to shareholders. In total, we returned $2.3 billion to our shareholders in the forms of dividends and share repurchases in 2022. Next slide, please.\nWith the expectation of continued strong cash flow, today, we are announcing a 12.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share. We are proud of our record of 91 years of uninterrupted dividends and 50 consecutive years of annual dividend increases. And I'd like to thank our shareholders for their continued support of ADM. Next slide, please.\nWhen I examine 2022, our ability to drive structural growth in earnings and improvement in ROIC was supported by key strategic accomplishments across the enterprise, particularly the progress we made on our productivity and innovation objectives. Our productivity work in 2022 included enhancing our operational resilience, including through stabilizing our plant operations and streamlining our operating systems. In order to meet growing customer demand and drive efficiencies, we delivered multiple projects to enhance our operational footprint, from modernization to improving our scheduled downtime to capacity expansions. We completed our Marshall, Minnesota modernization, opened a new mill house in Clinton, completed our Quincy refinery expansion and improved output and yields at our Rondonopolis diesel plant in Brazil.\nWe also continued to optimize our North American milling footprint. As you know, we also introduced a new billion-dollar challenge in 2022. There is no clearer demonstration of how our colleagues and culture are driving returns than the fact that thousands of ADM team members from around the globe took the initiative, stepped up and identified opportunities that unlocked more than $1.6 billion in cash in 2022.\nOn innovation, our accomplishments include a focus on capturing the benefits of organic growth investments and M&A as we continue to get closer to our customers and extend our capabilities to meet growing global demand for our products. Our Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry, with 18% constant currency revenue growth for the full year. We delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year revenue growth in BioSolutions. The portfolio of acquisitions we made in the prior year continued to deliver OP above our financial projections.\nAnd we advanced targeted production capacity expansions to meet growing customer demand. We announced expansions of our alternative protein capability in Decatur, Illinois, and starch production in Marshall, Minnesota. We completed our alternative protein expansion in Serbia, and are about to launch our expanded probiotic capacity in Valencia, Spain. And we continue to expect our joint venture crush and refining facility in North Dakota to be operational by this year's harvest.\nSlide 6, please. Now let's look ahead. We have a robust plan for driving enduring value creation in 2023 and beyond. In productivity, our work has a common theme: changing the way we work by standardizing, digitizing and automating our manufacturing plants and our offices alike. I previously mentioned our successful Marshall modernization. That was the blueprint for our wider work to unlock value across our production footprint through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics. We have now approved the scope for the first 2 years of the program, encompassing 18 manufacturing facilities. We continue to expect double-digit returns from this important initiative.\nAnd we are continuing to advance 1ADM, which is enabling us to improve our processes and expand capabilities across the value chain. 2022 was an important year for our 1ADM business transformation. We completed several rollouts, and we are seeing benefits in areas ranging from indirect procurement to go-to-market strategies to grain merchandising. In 2023, we will continue to expand the breadth and scope of this work, which is empowering our businesses to deliver profitable revenue growth and higher margins.\nNext, we are focused on maintaining our structural growth momentum via our innovation work. As you may recall, we've spoken in the past about our strategic growth platforms: sustainability, differentiated grain, alternative proteins, biosolutions, microbial solutions and microbiome modification. These growth opportunities grow -- go through a natural evolution. When new, we launch them at the corporate level. As they mature, they become more embedded in our businesses. Differentiated grain is now formally part of our Ag Services and Oilseeds segment's everyday work. BioSolutions is growing within Carbohydrate Solutions. Alternative proteins and microbiome are pillars of Nutrition.\nWith these efforts maturing in the businesses, we are able to focus on other opportunities. One of the most important is decarbonization, which is a critical component of our sustainability growth platform and is driving the evolution of our Carbohydrate Solutions business. Our goal is to reduce the carbon intensity of our assets and value chain in order to be the preferred partner in low-carbon intensity feedstocks for a growing demand base.\nWe have made several announcements to mark milestones towards this goal in recent years, including our regenerative agriculture efforts, which enrolled 1 million unique acres over the past year; our Strive 35 goals; our initiatives to connect and expand our carbon capture and storage capabilities; and our heat and energy project indicator. We're looking at multiple other pathways to reducing our carbon intensity, like more sustainable energy sources for our facilities. And our efforts aren't just in the U.S. We have plans for other regions as well, including some EMEA projects we hope to speak about in the future.\nAll of these projects contribute to our ability to offer low carbon intensity feedstocks, and that is allowing us to continue to advance our work to transition our dry mills to produce sustainable aviation fuel; help scale up the scaled food products with new sustainable attributes, like the ingredients we will sell to Pepsi from the regenerative agriculture agreement we announced last year; and propel the expansion of BioSolutions with joint ventures like with LG Chem.\nAnd even as we advance our decarbonization plan, we're always looking at new ways to help solve our world's challenges for food security, health and well-being and sustainability. For example, we are continuing to explore opportunities around precision fermentation, which we used to call microbial solutions, in which microbes rapidly growing -- grown in fermenters fed by dextrose, transform the sugars into a wide variety of products for food, feed and fiber. That's a longer-term horizon for ADM, but it gives us a hint of the kind of opportunities we see in the years ahead.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\n\nVikram Luthar\n\nCFO & Senior VP, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Juan. Please turn to Slide 7. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off an outstanding year, with substantially higher year-over-year results in Q4. Ag Services results were higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. Low water conditions reduced North American export volumes, partially offset by the South American team, which executed well to deliver higher margins and volumes. Global trade results were lower than the strong fourth quarter of 2021, with lower ocean freight results partially offset by higher results in EMEA origination and destination marketing. The business benefited from a $110 million legal recovery related to the 2019 and 2020 closure of the Reserve, Louisiana export facility.\nCrushing results were more than double those of the prior year period. In North America, strong export volumes for soybean meal and growing domestic demand for renewable diesel contributed to strong margins. In EMEA, oil demand powered strong rapeseed margins, more than offsetting higher energy costs compared to the prior year. Expanding margins drove negative timing impacts in the quarter of approximately $40 million.\nRPO results were significantly higher year-over-year as the business continued to execute well to meet demand for food oil, renewable diesel in the U.S. and biodiesel globally. Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the fourth quarter of 2021.\nLooking ahead, we expect AS&O results for Q1 to remain strong, similar to last year's very strong quarter, led by continued strength in crush margins and RPO. Ag Services is likely to be lower year-over-year, particularly in light of very strong global trade results in the prior year quarter.\nSlide 8, please. Carbohydrate Solutions had a strong 2022, with full year results higher than 2021. For the quarter, results were substantially lower than the fourth quarter of 2021 due to pressured industry ethanol margins. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much higher year-over-year results. The North America business delivered solid volumes and strong margins in both Starches and Sweeteners, partially offsetting lower ethanol margins.\nThe EMEA team effectively managed risk and delivered improved results on better margins in a continued dynamic environment. The global wheat milling business delivered higher margins driven by solid customer demand. Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower as higher ethanol inventory levels pressured margins, especially compared to the very strong margin environment in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nLooking at the first quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions, we expect continued solid demand and strong margins for starches, sweeteners and wheat flour. Ethanol margins are currently pressured due to high industry inventory levels. If industry stocks come back down, results for the quarter could be similar to Q1 of 2022. If margins remain pressured, results would likely be lower.\nOn Slide 9, the Nutrition business continued its strong growth trajectory in 2022. ADM demonstrated that it remains the provider of choice in nutrition for systems as our growing pipeline and continued strong win rates delivered full year revenue growth of 18% on a constant currency basis. The business continued to outperform industry growth levels and delivered 11% higher profits for the full year on a constant currency basis.\nFor the fourth quarter, revenues grew 11% on a constant currency basis. Q4 operating profits were significantly lower than the prior year quarters.\nHuman Nutrition results were lower than those of the fourth quarter of 2021. Flavors results were similar to the prior year as strong revenue growth helped offset demand fulfillment challenges. Specialty Ingredients continued to see strong demand for its product portfolio, including plant-based proteins, offset by inventory adjustments. Health & Wellness was higher year-over-year, driven primarily by the bioactives portfolio, including the results from the DLN acquisition.\nAnimal results were substantially lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to the lower margins in amino acids, driven by recovery in the global supply of lysine. Pet nutrition, volumes were lower in Latin America, partially driven by demand fulfillment challenges. Feed results were stronger, driven by APAC and Latin America, partially offset by the impact of softer demand in EMEA.\nAs we look ahead, we expect overall Nutrition results in Q1 to be lower than the prior year's record first quarter, with Human Nutrition delivering similar year-over-year results on strong Flavors and SI growth and lower Animal Nutrition results primarily due to weaker margins in amino acids.\nI want to take a moment to expand on our view of Nutrition in 2023. Nutrition is expected to continue on a positive growth trajectory for full year 2023, including 10-plus percent profit growth and a similar level of revenue growth. The growth is likely to be led by Human Nutrition and to be weighted in the back half of the year as the first half will see headwinds in Animal Nutrition due to the continued impacts of weaker margins in amino acids and because we will see increasing recovery in demand fulfillment as we move through the year.\nSlide 10, please. Other Business results for Q4 were significantly higher than the prior year's fourth quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services and captive insurance experienced favorable underwriting results and lower claim settlements versus the prior year. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $299 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence related to growth initiatives.\nOther corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to higher contributions from foreign currency-related hedge activity and lower railroad maintenance expense. Corporate results also included losses related to the mark-to-market adjustment on the Wilmar exchangeable bond and severance totaling $6 million. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher interest rates.\nWe expect corporate cost for 2023 to be around $1.5 billion, driven primarily by inflation and higher interest expense. Other business performance should be higher than 2022, offsetting a significant portion of the increased corporate costs as higher interest rates positively impact our ADM IS business.\nThe effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately 16% compared to 21% in the prior year. The decreased rate was driven primarily by changes in the geographic mix of pretax earnings in addition to lower discrete tax expense versus the prior year. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 17%. For 2023, we expect our adjusted tax rate to be between 16% and 19%.\nNext slide, please. Year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $5.3 billion are up significantly versus $3.9 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt-to-total capital ratio is about 25%, and we continue to have ample available liquidity. Our strong cash flows and balance sheet have enabled continued investment in the business, with $1.3 billion in capital expenditures for the full year. We currently plan to maintain capital expenditures at about $1.3 billion in 2023 and continue to have significant financial capacity to pursue strategic growth objectives.\nWe have been continuing to return capital to shareholders. We distributed $900 million in dividends and repurchased almost $1.5 billion of shares in 2022. We are planning $1 billion in opportunistic buybacks for 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital.\nJuan?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Vikram. Next slide, please. 2022 was a truly outstanding year for ADM. As we look forward to 2023, we expect another very strong year. There are a number of market factors that we see as relevant for shaping our performance. We still see tightness in supply and demand balances in key products and regions. We see strong demand for vegetable oil, driven largely by robust demand for biodiesel and renewable diesel. Resilient food demand should drive higher volumes and margins in starches, sweeteners and wheat milling.\nWe see continued strong demand for ethanol, including positive discretionary blending economics. And as Vikram mentioned, we expect 10-plus percent constant currency OP growth from Nutrition.\nWe have a strong playbook powered by our deep expertise and our unparalleled footprint and capabilities to manage a dynamic market environment. Our healthy balance sheet provides ongoing optionality as we continue to pull the levers under our control to deliver results. And we expect positive contributions from productivity and innovation initiatives across the company that will help us drive value in 2023. Taken together, we expect to deliver another very strong year in 2023.\nWith that, Bailey, please open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Megan Britt, Vice President, Investor Relations for ADM. Ms. Britt, you may begin.\n\nMegan Britt\n\nThank you, Alex. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's third quarter earnings webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2, the company's safe harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statements that reflects management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risks and uncertainties. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.\nOn today's webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will provide an overview of the quarter and how we're continuing to advance our strategy. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review the drivers of our performance as well as corporate results and financial highlights. Then Juan will make some final comments, and he and Vikram will take your questions. Please turn to Slide 3.\nI'll now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Megan. This morning, we reported a strong third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.86. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.6 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA approached $6.6 billion, and our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC was 13%.\nThroughout the quarter, our 40,000 colleagues around the globe continued to deliver on our purpose by supporting the global food system and providing needed nutrition to billions.\nGlobal demand for our products remained robust, and our ability to meet customer needs demonstrated our team's expertise in managing dynamic market conditions as well as the unique benefits of our integrated global value chain and product portfolio. We continue to generate strong cash flows, which support the continued advancement of our strategy, including investments in new capabilities and growth engines across our 3 businesses and the return of capital to our shareholders.\nNext slide, please. Even as the team demonstrated superb day-to-day execution in the third quarter, we continued to make great progress on driving our strategic growth priorities. In each of our business segments, we've created and are continuing to build new growth engines that are aligned with enduring global trends.\nAs demand for more sustainable produced low-carbon intensity products continues to drive growth across our portfolio, our AS&O team signed a groundbreaking long-term strategic agreement with PepsiCo to enroll up to 2 million regenerative agricultural acres over the next 7.5 years. I'll be talking more about our Regen Ag efforts in a moment.\nSustainability from demand for sustainable packaging to the ongoing energy transformation supported by policies like the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. is also driving the evolution of our Carbohydrate Solutions business. In the third quarter, for example, we formally signed 2 joint ventures with LG Chem for U.S. production of lactic acid and polylactic acid for a variety of applications, including bioplastics.\nBoth sustainability and food security are powering our growth in nutrition, including our continued investment in alternative proteins. In Q3, we advanced several alternative protein enhancements and expansions, including an agreement with Benson Hill for the exclusive rights to process socialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans.\nEach of these investments is aligned with global trends, and each demonstrates how we are advancing new avenues of growth across all 3 of our business segments.\nSlide 5, please. Our strategic work remains focused on 2 pillars: productivity and innovation. As we discussed at our Global Investor Day last December, we are targeting $1.1 billion in benefits from our productivity efforts, which improve our long-term returns profile while helping us mitigate the impact of market forces, including inflation. Strong returns means focusing on both the numerator and the denominator. That is why, around the globe, our team is continuing to identify opportunities to monetize assets and optimize working capital as part of our $1 billion challenge. As of last week, we had realized cash generation in excess of $1 billion from this initiative.\nOn the numerator side, we're investing in new technologies to enhance our efficiencies. Last quarter, I highlighted the operational transformation of our core facility in Marshall, Minnesota and discuss how we hope to emulate that success more widely across our production footprint. We are now advancing an ambitious plan to install enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increase use of analytics in more than 50 production facilities globally, with further expansion possible as we evaluate and size the opportunities. These investments will enable us to unlock capacity, improve reliability and enhance safety.\nWe are currently evaluating partners to support us in this important work, which we intend to execute in a phased approach, focusing on 8 to 10 facilities per year. We anticipate investing more than $1 billion over this period, and we expect double-digit returns on these investments as we are seeing in Marshall. We'll be updating you on our progress towards these goals and other productivity efforts on upcoming calls.\nNext slide, please. Turning to innovation. Sustainability is a driving force both of our purpose and our growth strategy. And one great example is the scaling up of our regenerative agricultural efforts. Regen Ag practices include cover cropping, improved nutrient management and conservation tillage. The environmental and climate benefits associated with Regen Ag can include greenhouse gas emissions reductions, increased soil carbon sequestration, water quality improvements and biodiversity promotion. With global scale and a value chain that reaches from 220,000 farmers to customers ranging from multinational CPGs to start-ups, ADM has a unique opportunity to lead in this area.\nI already mentioned our strategic partnership with PepsiCo, which we believe is truly groundbreaking in its scope and long-term vision. We're working with other partners as well. For example, in the spring, we announced an agreement with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation that includes a commitment of $20 million to sign up more Regen Ag acres. And we're partnering with Farmers Business Network to make their gradable farm management platform available as the Regen Ag technology enabler for our North American farmer base. We've signed about 750,000 unique Regen Ag acres in the U.S. so far this year. We expect this number to grow with every passing year.\nThese programs are getting us closer to farmers and closer to our customers. And we anticipate that within the next 5 years, our annual operating profit impact from this work will reach more than $100 million while continuing to help lead our industry to a more responsible, sustainable future.\nWhile we are on the subject of sustainability, I'm very proud that some of the good work we've done in this arena is being recognized. Just yesterday, ADM was included on the Investor's Business Daily annual list of 100 Best ESG companies. And in July, Environment+Energy Leader magazine recognized our Illinois-based indicator carbon capture and storage partnership as a top project for energy and environmental management.\nWe posted a new update on our website that details our progress in advancing our Strive 35 goals, including our commitment to reduce our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2035. And because Strive 35 isn't the end of our sustainability journey, that update includes our aspiration to work towards net zero emissions by 2050. We'll have more to say about this as we continue to evaluate and develop our path forward.\nNow I would like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\n\nVikram Luthar\n\nCFO & Senior VP, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThanks, Juan. Slide 7, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered substantially higher year-over-year results. Ag Services results were significantly higher than the third quarter of 2021. The short crops in South America supported U.S. exports, driving improved volumes and margins in North American origination, which had significant negative impacts from Hurricane Ida in the prior year.\nBetter margins in global ocean freight driven by good execution amid dynamic global trade flows powered better results in global trade. South American origination saw improved volumes and margins, driven by increased farmer selling in addition to higher volumes through our export facilities.\nCrushing results were significantly higher, with margins driven by resilient global demand for both meal and oil. Strong rapeseed margins in EMEA, driven by robust oil demand and continued market dislocations along with positive impacts from an insurance settlement, helped drive improved results. North American soy crush margins continued to benefit from renewable diesel demand. Also, net positive timing effects in the quarter were about $175 million as compared to the approximately $70 million in the prior year quarter. Positive results were partially offset by lower crush volumes, including impacts from idle facilities in Ukraine and Paraguay.\nRefined products and other results were higher year-over-year in a strong margin environment for both refined oil and biodiesel. Robust performance in global refined oils was driven by healthy demand and elevated refined oil margins amid supply chain disruptions. Equity earnings from Wilmar were much higher versus the third quarter of 2021.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we expect AS&O to deliver much better results in the fourth quarter of 2021. We expect continued strength in crush margins to more than offset the adverse impact of low water conditions on U.S. export volumes.\nSlide 8, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered significantly higher results versus the prior year quarter. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, which includes ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much improved year-over-year results amid steady global demand for sweeteners and starches. Corn coproducts, including continued robust demand for corn oil as well as effective risk management, drove higher execution margins in North America. Wheat milling had a strong performance, delivering improved volumes and margins to meet healthy demand for flour.\nIn EMEA, the business delivered solid volumes and margins and managed through a dynamic energy environment to drive stronger results. Our biosolutions platform continued its upward trajectory with 29% year-over-year revenue growth year-to-date. Vantage Corn Processors results were substantially lower. Ethanol margins were pressured by higher industry inventories, lower domestic demand and elevated corn costs. In addition, the prior year's results included contributions from the now sold Peoria facility.\nLooking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter of this year for Carbohydrate Solutions to be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of last year. Demand and margins for sweeteners, starches and flour should remain healthy, but ethanol margins are expected to be substantially lower than last year's historic highs.\nOn Slide 9, the Nutrition business continued to outpace the industry with Q3 revenue growth of 10% on a reported basis and 16% on a constant currency basis. Third quarter adjusted operating profit was similar to last year and 7% higher on a constant currency basis. Profit was impacted in the quarter by the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar and demand fulfillment challenges as the rapid growth in customer demand exceeded our operational capacity. We are prioritizing unlocking capacity in the face of some persistent supply chain bottlenecks.\nOur year-to-date performance remains very strong, including 20% revenue and 19% OP growth on a constant currency basis. And our portfolio of acquisitions from 2021 continues to deliver OP above our acquisition models.\nIn this quarter, Human Nutrition results were higher than the third quarter of 2021. Strong demand for plant-based proteins as well as solid performance in texturants drove continued growth in specialty ingredients. Flavors results were impacted by adverse currency translation effects in EMEA, partially offset by continued strong demand growth in the region.\nDemand fulfillment challenges in North America and lower demand in APAC, driven partly by the lockdowns in China, also negatively impacted results. Health and Wellness was lower versus the prior year, which included higher income from this fiber fermentation agreement.\nAnimal Nutrition results were down versus the prior year quarter. Pet results were lower in Latin America on lower volumes, partially offset by strong volumes and margins in North America. Softer animal protein demand affected feed volumes.\nLooking ahead, we expect the fourth quarter for Nutrition this year to be higher than the fourth quarter of 2021, with continued strong demand in Human Nutrition more than offsetting adverse currency effects. We expect Nutrition's full year OP growth to be between 15% and 20% on a constant currency basis.\nSlide 10, please. Other business results increased from the prior year quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove improved earnings in ADM Investor Services, partially offset by increased claims settlements in captive insurance. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $251 million were higher year-over-year due primarily to performance-related compensation accruals, higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence.\nOther Corporate was favorable versus the prior year, primarily due to higher results from foreign currency-related hedge activity. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher interest rates. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was approximately 16%. We still project full year corporate costs to be about $1.3 billion, and we still expect our adjusted tax rate to remain in the range of 16% to 19%.\nNext slide, please. Year-to-date, operating cash flows before working capital of $4.7 billion are up significantly versus $3.1 billion over the same period last year. Our net debt to total capital ratio is about 24%, and we have available liquidity of about $11.2 billion.\nWe are continuing to invest in the business with $841 million in capital expenditures and have returned capital to shareholders with $677 million in dividends and $1.2 billion in share repurchases through the third quarter, which reflects the completion of the $1 billion stock buyback announced last quarter. And with an enhanced financial flexibility and in line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of shares by the end of 2023, subject to other strategic uses of capital.\nJuan?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Vikram. Slide 12, please. So to recap, our team delivered another outstanding quarter. And thanks to our execution and the advancement of our strategy, we are well positioned to end 2022 strong. Last quarter, we said we were expecting full year earnings higher than $6.50 per share. Based on where we are today, we now clearly expect to exceed $7 per share.\nLooking ahead, there are several externalities that we are monitoring going into 2023. We anticipate ongoing resilient demand for our products, a strong crush margin environment, a positive outlook for starches and sweeteners and a continuation of our growth trajectory in Nutrition.\nThere is also significant uncertainty in the global economy and geopolitical environment. We expect to carry our strong momentum into the first quarter of 2023. And beyond that, we are confident that our scenario planning and execution will give us the ability to effectively manage through a dynamic environment.\nWe're also going to continue to benefit from our strategic work, and we'll continue to deliver on those priorities throughout 2023. We'll advance productivity initiatives to improve operations and processes, optimize costs and enhance efficiencies. We'll drive innovation, expanding and creating new growth engines across our entire business portfolio, Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions and Nutrition. And we'll advance those strategic objectives as we always have, alongside our team's exceptional day-to-day execution, delivering for our colleagues, consumers, customers and stakeholders.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.",

I will now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Michael. This morning, we reported outstanding second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.15. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.8 billion, and our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA approached $6 billion. And our trailing four quarter average adjusted ROIC was 11.6%. Our team executed extremely well in the second quarter, navigating dynamic conditions to deliver nutrition to billions. And even as we work tirelessly to serve our customers and consumers around the globe, we are continuing to advance our strategy with productivity initiatives that are improving our efficiency and cost structure and innovation work that is powering profitable growth.\nSlide 4, please. Productivity is how we are improving our execution and optimizing costs is key to our long-term success, but equally as importantly, our productivity work is helping us mitigate the impact of inflation. We have a very strong pipeline of productivity initiatives, and I will be updating you on them regularly.\nThere are 2 initiatives I'd like to highlight today. First is a set of operational transformation efforts we are driving across production facilities around the globe and spanning all 3 businesses. Earlier this year, we completed a modernization project in our Marshall, Minnesota corn facility that is unlocking significant new value through enhanced automation, more sophisticated control systems and the increased use of analytics. We're already seeing double-digit returns on the investment we made in that project. This is an example of the kinds of projects we're undertaking across our operational footprint, designed to unlock incremental volumes and deliver safer, more reliable, more cost-efficient operations.\nSecond, as we look to continue to grow returns, we want to focus not only on the numerator but also the denominator. Our original $1 billion challenge and its follow-up, the next billion, help us drive to 10% ROIC. Earlier this year, we launched a new challenge aimed at monetizing assets and optimizing working capital to unlock another $1 billion in cash, helping us to continue to drive returns. In fact, we already realized more than $400 million.\nNext slide, please. We're also advancing our innovation pillar, fueling profitable growth as we continue to expand our capabilities to meet demand across the 3 global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability. For example, last November, we added significant new capabilities in our Health & Wellness business with the acquisition of Deerland Probiotics. Demand in the human microbiome space is expected to reach $9.1 billion by 2026. While in animal feed, probiotic demand is expected to grow to $6.2 billion.\nDeerland, with a broad portfolio of probiotics, prebiotics and enzymes provides a wide array of commercial, R&D and operations-related synergy opportunities to help us meet that demand. And we're taking advantage of those opportunities, from connecting our deal and capabilities with our Biopolis team in Spain to utilize spore probiotics in a functional chocolate bar, to bringing together our expertise to expand our capabilities in pet, a key growth category, to looking across teams to offer new types of dietary supplements.\nThanks to the strong collaboration across the enterprise, Deerland today is increasing our share of wallet for customers in both human and pet solutions. And we're seeing similar outcomes from other recent investments as well. In the first half of the year, our combined portfolio of 2021 nutrition acquisitions has delivered significantly more OP than we had in our acquisition models.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Vikram to talk about our business performance. Vikram?\n\nVikram Luthar\n\nCFO & Senior VP, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThanks, Juan. Slide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team delivered exceptional results in a dynamic market. Ag Services results more than doubled versus the year ago quarter. Global trade had an outstanding quarter. The destination marketing team's ability to meet customer demand around the globe helped drive strong volumes and margins. And good execution in global freight as well as net timing gains of about $65 million for the quarter contributed to significantly higher year-over-year profits.\nNorth America had a solid performance as export volumes remained strong in a good global demand environment, though year-over-year results were lower due to the prior year's insurance settlement and strong positioning gains. South America results were higher based on stronger origination volumes and better margins driven by strong global grain demand.\nCrushing delivered substantially higher results. Strong soy crush margins drove improved performance in all 3 regions as meal and oil demand remained robust. Positive net timing effects of approximately $90 million for the quarter versus the $70 million of negative timing in the year ago period helped drive year-over-year results.\nRefined products and other results were similar to the prior year period as strong demand for biofuels and food oils drove refining premiums and biodiesel margins, offset by approximately $150 million of negative timing effects versus negative $30 million in the prior year quarter. Equity earnings from Wilmar were significantly higher versus the second quarter of 2021.\nLooking ahead for AS&O. We expect Q3, the seasonal transition quarter from the South American to the North American harvest, to deliver results significantly higher than the prior year period driven by continued strong global demand for grains and strong cash crush margins.\nSlide 7, please. The Carbohydrate Solutions team delivered a second quarter of extremely strong results. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much better results due to solid demand as food service volumes reached close to pre-pandemic levels. Corn coproducts, including strong demand for corn oil, and effective risk management drove higher ethanol and sweetener margins.\nBiosolutions continued its strong growth with $81 million in year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 and $136 million year-to-date. Vantage Corn Processors results were slightly higher in an environment of good gasoline demand and strong ethanol blending economics. A $50 million recovery from the USDA biofuel producer recovery program helped offset the prior year's strong industrial alcohol results from the now sold Peoria facility as well as valuation losses on ethanol inventory as prices fell late in the quarter.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter. We expect results significantly higher versus the third quarter of 2021 driven by steady demand for our products and favorable ethanol blending economics. On Slide 8, the Nutrition business continued on its strong growth trajectory with 19% year-over-year profit growth. Revenues increased by 20% on a constant currency basis and 13% like-for-like, and the team did a good job protecting margins.\nHuman Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors grew revenue in North America, EMEA and South America, though profits were lower due to negative currency effects in EMEA as well as weaker results in APAC. Healthy demand for alternative proteins resulted in strong soy protein volumes and margins as contributions from the Sojaprotein acquisition as well as good demand for texturants drove higher results in Specialty Ingredients. Strength across probiotics, including in the recently acquired Deerland business as well as robust demand for fibers, contributed to a stronger quarter in Health & Wellness. Across the Human Nutrition business, we continue to see low price elasticity and good demand for our diverse portfolio of ingredients and systems as we continue to support our customers with new product and cost-out innovation and drive industry-leading win rates.\nAnimal Nutrition profits were up substantially year-over-year driven by continued strong volumes and margins in amino acids. Looking ahead, we expect third quarter results for Nutrition to be higher year-over-year as the business remains on a trajectory to deliver 20% OP growth for the full year.\nSlide 9, please. Other Business results increased from the prior year quarter driven primarily by higher ADM investor services earnings due to higher short-term interest rates. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $267 million was slightly higher year-over-year due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence. Net interest expense for the quarter increased year-over-year on higher rates and higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs as well as higher expense for long-term debt.\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was approximately 18%. Based upon our current outlook, we expect full year corporate costs to trend towards $1.3 billion versus our previous outlook of about $1.2 billion, largely due to higher year-over-year interest rates. We still expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%.\nNext slide, please. Year-to-date operating cash flows before working capital of $3.2 billion are up significantly versus $2.2 billion at the same time last year. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 30% and available liquidity of about $11.5 billion. Driven by our strong cash flows and robust earnings, we expect to accelerate our share repurchase program, adding to the $200 million we repurchased in the second quarter of the year with an additional $1 billion in the back half.\nAnd of course, the strong cash flows and balance sheet also preserve our flexibility to continue reinvesting in the business and advancing upside growth opportunities. Our CapEx outlook is unchanged at approximately $1.3 billion for the year. Juan?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Vikram. Slide 11, please. For context, as we discuss our outlook, I would like to go back to the goals and drivers we laid out at our Global Investor Day in December. We talked about the plan in which our strategic productivity and innovation actions will continue to build a better ADM and align our portfolio to meet accelerating structural demand changes driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability and how that would drive a strong earnings trajectory over the plan horizon.\nWhat has transpired since then is that some of the market factors have reinforced and further enhanced the value proposition of our diverse product portfolio and our integrated global network of assets. This helps drive stronger-than-expected margins. So while we may see some reversion in the medium term, we now believe that margin structures are generally higher than when we have laid out in December.\nWe are on a trajectory to deliver a very strong second half, resulting in expected full year earnings above $6.50 per share. And as Vikram said, the strong cash flows we are generating will enable us to accelerate the timing of our share repurchase program with $1 billion in repurchases in the back half of the year.\nAs we look beyond that, we have not changed our strategy nor our expectations of strong earnings growth and returns over our plan horizon. And as we laid out at our Global Investor Day, there are upside opportunities to our medium-term plan. But as we have already covered today, we are advancing those now and realizing higher value from them. Higher biosolutions revenue growth, higher Health & Wellness OP contributions, the operational transformation across the enterprise, we expect these and more to add further upside in the medium term.\nThe opportunities before us are significant. I'm proud of what our team has achieved, but I'm even more excited about what we're going to deliver tomorrow, next year and in the years to come.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Michael Cross, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nMichael Cross\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Emily. Good morning, and welcome to ADM's First Quarter Earnings Webcast. Starting tomorrow, a replay of today's webcast will be available at adm.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2, the company's Safe Harbor statement, which says that some of our comments and materials constitute forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, company performance and financial results. These statements and materials are based on many assumptions and factors that are subject to risk and uncertainty. ADM has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in this presentation.\nTo the extent permitted under applicable law, ADM assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events.\nOn today's webcast, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Juan Luciano, will provide an overview of the quarter and highlight some of our accomplishments. Our Chief Financial Officer, Vikram Luthar, will review the drivers of our performance as well as corporate results and financial highlights. Then Juan will make some final comments, and our Vice Chairman, Ray Young, will join us for questions.\nPlease turn to Slide 3. I will now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Michael.\nThis morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.90. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.6 billion. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was about $5.3 billion, and our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 10.6%.\nWhat we saw in the first quarter was an extension and amplification of the factors that supported our growth in 2021. First was our team's great execution. Exceptional growth in Nutrition and effective risk management exemplified how we continued to serve our customers and provide nutrition around the globe amid volatile market conditions and an inflationary environment. Second was an environment of tight supply and demand. We operated in the first quarter in a constrained supply environment for crops, mostly driven by the smaller South American crop, and for other products driven by some continued supply chain and labor availability issues. And we continued to see solid global demand across most of our products and in most regions. While the pandemic is not over, and we're particularly monitoring the impact of rising cases and lockdowns in China. Much of the world continued to emerge. Pent-up demand remained solid, even in the face of higher prices.\nThe great work our team did was in service to our customers, our company and our purpose. Our company has come together once again in the wake of the unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. ADM has about 650 colleagues in Ukraine, and of course, our highest priority continues to be supporting and protecting them and their families as well as helping Ukrainian farmers to get as much of their crop production as possible into world markets. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Ukraine.\nSlide 4, please.\nFood security is foundational to ADM's purpose and beliefs, and recent events have only magnified its importance. From a global pandemic to the short crop in South America to the conflict in Ukraine, it has become clear that we cannot take an abundant and efficient supply of food for granted. Even beyond the current dislocations, this issue will remain one of critical importance over the next many years.\nAs the global population grows, the need for Nutrition will continue to grow with it.\nAt our Global Investor Day last December, we talked about how we expect demand to push global trade flows of corn, wheat, soybeans and soybean meal up 21% or 130 million tons in the next 10 years. Meeting that demand will not happen automatically. It will take dedication, expertise and agility as well as global scale and capabilities.\nAn example of that is ADM's destination marketing network, which gives us a presence in more regions where demand is strong and growing as well as more direct connections to customers and the ability to offer the full end-to-end capabilities of our integrated value chain. We are seeing how important that is today as customers are coming to us knowing that they can rely on ADM to meet their specific needs in a supply-constrained environment.\nWe are not immune to the impacts of global disruptions, including those in the Black Sea region, but our broad portfolio of nutrition products and our ability to efficiently move them around the world will allow us to manage through these dynamic market conditions and continue to help support the food needs of billions of people.\nPlease turn to Slide 5.\nSustainability is another one of the global trends so important to our company's and our planet's future. We remain focused on our strategy, which is aligned with fast-growing demand for an array of products that are environmentally friendly, including alternative projects. That industry continues to show impressive growth. Global sales for alternative meats and dairy products are expected to increase 14% annually, reaching a targeting $125 billion by 2030.\nWhen you look at the full range of products that alternative proteins could go into, from meat alternatives and meat extensions to emerging categories like ready meals and specialized nutrition, the opportunities are even greater. Our own growth in this area is faster than the industry's. The quality of our product, our integrated end-to-end value chain, our innovative product development and application capabilities and our global scale make us the partner of choice for our customers. In fact, we never had a stronger demand for our alternative protein products that we are seeing now, and we are confident in continued growth.\nThat is why earlier this month, we announced a significant investment to nearly double extrusion capacity at our Decatur, Illinois specialty protein complex. We also announced the industry's first end-to-end alternative protein innovation center. This, of course, follows up our last year's addition of leading European alternative protein provider, soy protein.\nAlternative proteins are just one of the many areas in which we are expanding our capabilities to meet growing customer demand for more environmentally responsible products. Our biosolutions team, for example, continued to expand its pipeline and advance the evolution of our Carbohydrate Solutions business with an impressive $55 million in revenue growth in the quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 6.\nWe are advancing sustainability commitments in other parts of our business as well. Last year, we unveiled new goals to reduce Scope 3 emissions and eliminate deforestation from our supply chain. This is critical work. We do not make these kinds of commitments without an achievable plan to meet them, and once we move forward, we constantly challenge ourselves to do it faster. That is why last week, we announced that we've accelerated our deadline for a completely deforestation-free supply chain by 5 years from 2030 to 2025.\nWe also recently committed to work with the science-based targets initiative, with the goal of obtaining their approval of ADM's climate target and our alignment with ambitious global goals to limit rising temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nAcross ADM, we are continuing to align our portfolio with the world's growing needs and with our own purpose, positioning us to serve our customers, our communities and our planet and power in our future.\nI'll discuss our business outlook at the end of our call. But in the meantime, I'd like to turn to Vikram to talk about our business. Vikram?\n\nVikram Luthar\n\nCFO & Senior VP, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThanks, Juan. Slide 7, please.\nThe Ag Services and Oilseeds team effectively managed risk and executed exceptionally well in a dynamic environment of robust global demand and tight supply, driven primarily by the short South American crop. Ag Services results were significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021. Global trade results were higher, driven by strong performances in destination marketing and global ocean freight. North American origination margins and volumes were lower year-over-year, including approximately $75 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters.\nCrushing was higher year-over-year in a strong global margin environment driven by robust protein and vegetable oil demand. Improving margins in the quarter resulted in approximately $60 million in negative timing effects, which will reverse in the coming quarters, versus approximately $50 million in positive timing in the prior year quarter.\nRefined Products and Other results were much higher than the prior year period, driven by healthy refining premiums and good refined oil demand in North America as well as strong biodiesel margins in EMEA.\nEquity earnings from Wilmar was significantly higher versus the first quarter of 2021.\nLooking ahead, we expect substantially higher Q2 AS&O results than the second quarter of 2021.\nSlide 8, please.\nCarbohydrate Solutions delivered substantially higher year-over-year results. The Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, delivered much higher results versus the prior year quarter driven by higher corn core product revenues, improved citric acid profits and excellent risk management in North America, higher volumes and margins in EMEA and higher volumes and margins in wheat milling. Sales volumes for Starches and Sweeteners continued their recovery towards pre-pandemic levels. And as Juan mentioned, our biosolutions platform continued to deliver impressive growth, with $55 million in new sales as demand for plant-based products expands into more diverse applications.\nVantage Corn Processors delivered solid execution margins, but position losses on ethanol inventory, as prices fell early in the quarter, drove lower results versus the prior year. The prior year quarter's results also benefited from demand for USP-grade industrial alcohol from the Peoria facility, which was divested in Q4 2021.\nLooking ahead to the second quarter, we expect the current market dynamics to continue, delivering Carbohydrate Solutions results similar to the very strong second quarter of 2021.\nOn Slide 9, the Nutrition business delivered continued strong profit growth. Revenues increased by a very impressive 23%. Even when adjusting for currency effects and removing the impacts of recent acquisitions, revenue was up by 17%. And while margins have softened somewhat, they remain healthy.\nHuman Nutrition delivered higher year-over-year results. Flavors continued to deliver solid revenue growth, offset by some higher costs. Strong sales growth in alternative proteins, including contributions from our soy protein acquisition and positive currency timing effects in South America, offset some higher operating costs to help deliver better year-over-year results in Specialty Ingredients. Health and Wellness results were also higher year-over-year, powered by continued growth in probiotics, including our late 2021 Deerland probiotics acquisition and robust demand for fiber.\nAnimal Nutrition profits were nearly double the year ago period due primarily to strength in amino acids driven by a combination of product mix changes, improved North American demand and global supply chain disruptions.\nLooking ahead, we expect Nutrition to deliver a second quarter significantly higher than the prior year period. And with our recent acquisitions delivering ahead of our expectations, we are raising our profit growth outlook for the full year from 15-plus to 20%.\nSlide 10, please.\nLet me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment as well as some of the Corporate Line items.\nOther business results were substantially higher, driven primarily by better performance in captive insurance, including reduced claims settlements versus the prior year. Some of the claims settlements that we expected to negatively impact Q1 results are now expected in the second quarter. Net interest expense for the quarter was higher year-over-year on higher expense for long-term debt, higher short-term borrowings to support working capital needs and interest related to a tax item.\nIn the Corporate Lines, unallocated Corporate costs of $209 million were due primarily to higher IT operating and project-related costs and higher costs in the company's centers of excellence, partially offset by incentive compensation accrual adjustments. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was approximately 16%. For the full year, we are now anticipating an effective tax rate at the higher end of our previously guided range of 16% to 19%.\nCash flow generation remains strong, $1.6 billion before working capital changes versus $1.2 billion in the prior year period. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 34%, and available liquidity of about $9.3 billion, even with almost $3 billion in higher working capital needs since December.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Vikram. Slide 11, please.\nAs the strong start of the year, we are looking ahead. In the near-term future, we expect lower crop supplies caused by the weak Canadian canola crop, the short South American crops and now the Black Sea disruptions, to drive continued tightness in global grain markets through 2022, well into 2023 and perhaps beyond. As we look further ahead, markets will continue to reflect the importance of the enduring global trends that are fueling performance across our portfolio including a growing global population, driving expansion in demand for full and healthy nutrition.\nThat is why the work we've done to build a better ADM is so important. We have the global integrated network, risk management capabilities and diverse product portfolio to help us navigate through tight market conditions and meet global nutritional needs. This is the challenge we expanded, improved and repositioned our business to meet, and we'll continue to advance our strategy and grow our capabilities through our productivity and innovation initiatives in order to drive performance under our control and deliver on the evolving needs of our customers.\nBut it doesn't stop with ADM. Our working with other participants across the food and agriculture value chain, from farmers who continue to do more every year to sustainably increase production to technology providers who offer new ways to make more with less, to governments who, in a tight supply and demand environment, should resist the impulse to impose export restrictions.\nSo looking at the balance of the year, when we combine the strategic work we have done to align our portfolio with fundamental global trends with our strong execution and the expectation of a continued tight supply-demand environment, we expect 2022 results to substantially exceed 2021's. And as we look further ahead to a future of increasing needs for more and better foods, we will continue to work to add new adjacent products to address the world's toughest challenges and unlock the power of nature to enrich the quality of life.\nOnce again, I'd like to thank our colleagues around the globe for their commitment and hard work to serve vital global needs in a challenging and dynamic environment.\nWith that, Emily, please open the line for questions.",

I will now turn the call over to Juan.\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Vikram. Our team delivered a super fourth quarter. This morning, we reported record fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.50. Adjusted segment operating profit was $1.4 billion, 23% higher than the fourth quarter of 2020. Our trailing fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $4.9 billion, $1.25 billion more than a year ago. And our trailing fourth quarter average adjusted ROIC was 10%, meeting our objectives.\nSlide 4, please. That performance represented a strong finish to an outstanding 2021. For the full year, our adjusted EPS was $5.19, also a record. And full year adjusted segment operating profit was $4.8 billion. This excellent performance was reflected across the company. We have service now team's actions to improve their business portfolio and strengthen their operating model continued to enable superior performance in a strong market environment.\nAS&O delivered full year 2021 OP of $2.8 billion with each subsegment performing at or near historic highs. Carbohydrate Solutions executed phenomenally well to deliver full year operating profits of $1.3 billion. And the team is continuing the evolution of Carbohydrate Solutions from the sale of our Peoria dry mill and the announcement of the sustainable aviation fuel MOU; to our agreement with LG Chem and the continued growth of our exciting biosolutions platform, which delivered new revenue wins with an annualized run rate of almost $100 million; to the project we announced earlier this month to further decarbonize our operations by connecting 2 other major processing facilities to our vacate of carbon capture and storage capabilities.\nThe Nutrition team once again delivered industry-leading revenue and OP growth with full year revenues up 16% and full year OP of $691 million, representing a 20% year-over-year increase. We also continued to enhance our Nutrition business with strategic investments targeted at growing areas of demand, including soya protein, which will expand our participation in alternative proteins; PetDine, which substantially enhance our presence in pet food and treats; Deerland, which continued the expansion of our functional probiotics and enzymes portfolio within our global Health & Wellness business; and Visa, which enhance our flavor footprint by opening up new growth opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean.\nSlide 5, please. Last month, at our Global Investor Day, we unveiled our strategic plan and reiterated our balanced financial framework for value creation, including using our strong cash flows to deliver both growth investments and distributions to shareholders. We are confident in our plan and\nwhich is why we are pleased to announce an 8% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share. We are proud of our record of 90 uninterrupted years of dividends and more than 40 years of consecutive annual dividend increases, and we are pleased to continue to follow through on our commitment to shareholder value creation.\nIt's been a great year, and we're excited about what's to come. Our continued actions to build a better ADM and dynamically align it with the global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability and the steadfast advancement of our productivity and innovation initiatives will help propel our 2022 results.\nI will talk in more detail about the upcoming calendar year shortly. But first, I'd like to turn the call over to Ray to review our business performance. Ray?\n\nRay Guy Young\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nYes. Thanks, Juan. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone.\nSlide 6, please. The Ag Services and Oilseeds team capped off really a truly impressive year, successfully navigating through supply chain challenges to deliver results largely in line with the extremely strong prior year quarter. The Ag Services team performed well in an environment of continued strong global demand, including significantly increased export volumes for customers outside of China. Global trade was substantially higher year-over-year, driven by solid risk management and improved results in global ocean freight. Overall, Ag Services delivered strong results, just slightly off the outstanding fourth quarter of 2020 when we benefit from exceptionally high export margins.\nCrushing executed well on the continued solid demand environment for both soybean meal and vegetable oil. Lower results in EMEA versus a very strong fourth quarter of 2020 and approximately $250 million in net negative timing impacts versus negative $125 million in the prior year quarter drove overall results lower year-over-year. The majority of those negative timing effects are expected to reverse in the first half of 2022.\nThe refined products and other teams delivered substantially higher results versus the prior year period, driven by strong volumes and margins in North America for refined oils and improved biodiesel margins in North America and EMEA, which more than offset weaker South American results due to the reduced biodiesel mandate. Equity earnings from Wilmar were higher year-over-year.\nLooking ahead, we expect a strong first quarter from Ag Services and Oilseeds, higher than the first quarter of 2021 and in line with the just ended fourth quarter.\nSlide 7, please. Carbohydrate Solutions fourth quarter results were more than double the prior year quarter. In Starches and Sweeteners subsegment, including ethanol production from our wet mills, results were lower versus the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by higher input costs, including energy costs in EMEA as well as lower wheat milling volumes, partially offset by continued strong ethanol margins. Volumes for North American Sweeteners and Starches were largely flat year-over-year.\nVantage Corn Processor results were again substantially higher year-over-year, driven by historically strong industry ethanol margins as a result of strong demand relative to supply as well as increased sales volumes due to production at the 2 dry mills that were idle in the previous year period. As we look ahead, we believe the first quarter for Carbohydrate Solutions should be similar to or slightly above the strong first quarter of 2021.\nSlide 8, please. The Nutrition business closed out a year of consistent and strong growth with fourth quarter revenues 19% higher year-over-year, 21% on a constant currency basis, with 26% higher profits year-over-year and sustained strong EBITDA margins. Human Nutrition had a great fourth quarter with revenue growth of 21% on a constant currency basis and substantially higher profits.\nFlavors continued its growth trajectory, driven primarily by improved product mix in EMEAI and continued strong performance from North America, partially offset by weaker APAC results. In Specialty Ingredients, overall profits for the fourth quarter were in line with the year ago period as strong demand for plant-based proteins offset the impact of onetime insurance proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nHealth & Wellness was higher versus the prior year quarter as the business continued to deliver growing profits in bioactives and fermentation. Animal Nutrition revenue was up 21% on a constant currency basis, and operating profit was much higher year-over-year, driven primarily by continued strength in amino acids.\nNow looking ahead, we expect Nutrition to continue to grow operating profits at a 15%-plus rate for calendar year 2022, with the first quarter similar to the first quarter of 2021 with continued revenue growth offset by some higher costs upfront in the year and the absence of the onetime benefits we saw in the first quarter of the prior year.\nSlide 9, please. Now let me finish up with a few observations from the Other segment as well as some of the corporate line items. Other business results were substantially higher, driven primarily by higher captive insurance underwriting results as the prior year quarter included larger intracompany insurance settlements. For calendar year 2022, we expect Other business results to be similar to 2021. Although for the first quarter, we expect a loss of about $25 million due to insurance settlements currently planned.\nNet interest expense increased year-over-year on higher short-term borrowings. In the corporate lines, unallocated corporate costs of $276 million were lower year-over-year due primarily to increased variable performance-related compensation expense accruals in the prior year, partially offset by higher IT offering in project-related costs and transfers of costs from business segments into centralized Centers of Excellence in supply chain and operations.\nWe anticipate calendar year 2022 total corporate costs, including net interest, corporate unallocated and other corporate, to be in line with the $1.2 billion area, consistent with what I discussed at Global Investor Day with net interest roughly similar, corporate unallocated a bit higher and corporate other a bit lower.\nThe effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was approximately 21% compared to 8% in the prior year. The calendar year 2021 effective tax rate was approximately 17%, up from 5% in 2020. The increase for the calendar year was due primarily to changes in geographic mix of earnings and current year discrete tax items, primarily valuation allowance and return to provision adjustments. Looking ahead, we're expecting full year 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 19%. Our balance sheet remains solid with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 28% and available liquidity of about $9 billion.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Juan. Juan?\n\nJuan Ricardo Luciano\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\n\nThank you, Ray.\nSlide 10, please. I hope most of you were able to join us on our Global Investor Day last month. There, we showed that we have consistently advanced our strategy from our work to improve ROIC through capital cost and cash; to our strategic growth and margin enhancement accomplishments, including the creation of a global Nutrition business; to today's focus on productivity and innovation. Thanks to this work, we are moving into 2022 with a better ADM, a more returns-focused organization with higher margins and less volatile earnings and a portfolio that is well positioned to capitalize on the positive structural changes being driven by the enduring global trends of food security, health and well-being and sustainability.\nSlide 11, please. Let me take a few moments to talk about how we see the 2022 environment. In Ag Services and Oilseeds, we see a continued favorable global demand environment. Due to a short growth in South America with the magnitude of the shortfall still to be determined, we expect global ag commodity buyers will rely relatively more on the U.S. market for their needs, assuming we have a normal U.S. crop later this year.\nOn the Oilseeds side, we're starting 2022 with a strong soy crush margins. And as we discussed at Global Investor Day, we believe that increasing demand for meal as well as vegetable oil as a feedstock of renewable green diesel should continue to support the positive environment this year with our soy crush margins in the range of $45 to $55 per metric ton. Assuming these dynamics play out, we believe that Ag Services and Oilseeds in 2022 has the potential to deliver operating profit similar to or better than 2021.\nFor Carbohydrate Solutions, we are assuming\nthe demand and margin environment for our Starch and Sweetener products will be steady versus 2021. We expect the industry ethanol environment to continue to be constructive, supported by the recovery of domestic demand to pre-COVID levels, energy costs driving higher exports, and better clarity on the regulatory landscape. With this in mind, we're assuming higher ADM ethanol volumes and EBITDA margins to average $0.15 to $0.25 for the calendar year.\nIn addition, we are expecting our biosolutions platform to deliver another year of solid growth as we continue to evolve the Carbohydrate Solutions business. Putting it all together, we expect Carbohydrate Solutions to deliver full year operating profit slightly lower than their outstanding 2021. In Nutrition\nfor our unparalleled portfolio of nutrition ingredients and systems, along with the benefits of accretion from our recent acquisitions. With these dynamics, we expect 15-plus percent OP growth in 2022, revenue growth above 10% and EBITDA margins above 20% in Human Nutrition and high single digits in Animal Nutrition, consistent with targets we set out at our Global Investor Day.\nSlide 12, please. So as we look forward in 2022, we see a positive demand environment across our portfolio. And then we add to that things we can do better. Our execution was great in 2021, but we're always identifying opportunities for improvement. Put it all together, and we're optimistic for another very strong performance in 2022 as we progress towards our strategic plans next earnings milestones of $6 to $7 per share.\nWith that, operator, please open the line for questions.",

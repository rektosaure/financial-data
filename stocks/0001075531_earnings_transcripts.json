A copy of Booking Holdings' earnings press release is available in the -- for Investors section of Booking Holdings' website, www.bookingholdings.com. And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Please go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by Ewout, our CFO. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter that underscores the power of our platform, the discipline of our execution and the momentum we're building for the future. Our room nights, gross bookings and revenue all exceeded our prior expectations. Beyond the financial results, I am very encouraged by the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. We are at a moment where advances in AI are just beginning to create new waves that people plan and experience travel. With our history of innovation, scale and data that helps us understand what customers want and when they want it, we are well positioned to harness these developments to drive more value for both our travelers and partners. I'll share specific examples from the quarter shortly. But before diving into those, let's review our third quarter financial highlights. We delivered double-digit gross bookings and revenue growth, reflecting robust demand across our globally diversified business.\nOur third quarter room nights reached $323 million, an 8% year-over-year increase. This exceeded the high end of our prior expectations, driven by healthy demand across all of our major regions. Of particular note was the U.S., where growth accelerated to high single digits, supported primarily by stronger outbound travel and momentum in our B2B business. The better-than-expected room night growth helped drive third quarter gross bookings up 14% and revenue up 13%. Adjusted EBITDA reached $4.2 billion, up 15% from the prior year quarter. All 3 metrics were above the high end of our prior guidance ranges. Finally, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 19% year-over-year.\nConsistent with our prior earnings guidance, I want to note that FX benefited our growth rates by approximately 400 to 500 basis points. As we enter the fourth quarter, we continue to observe stable levels of global leisure travel demand. Ewout will provide more detailed financial insights shortly, including our outlook for this quarter and for the full year. Beyond the headline numbers, I'm excited about the meaningful progress we're making on key initiatives. We're advancing our connected trip vision, strengthening our loyalty programs and building AI capabilities that create more value for both travelers and suppliers. Asia and alternative accommodations continue to remain growth drivers. Together, these efforts are reshaping how people plan, book and experience travel and how we are unlocking greater value for our partners. Let me start with the connected trip. We continue to advance on our long-term vision to make the planning, booking and traveling journey simpler, more personalized and with less friction while providing new opportunities for our partners through data-driven insights.\nToday at Booking.com, travelers can already book accommodations, flights, rental cars, prebooked rides and attractions on our platforms, and we continue to invest to expand these verticals and to deliver a more seamless experience. For example, we enhanced our home screen to adapt dynamically to each traveler's most recent search, making it easier to move across verticals and transition smoothly from planning into booking. And we continue to broaden our flight supply, most recently adding new partnerships with Ryanair in Europe and Southwest in the U.S., giving travelers even more choice. These efforts are resonating. Connected trip transactions, meaning a trip that includes more than one travel vertical, grew mid-20% year-over-year in the third quarter and now represent a low double-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions.\nOur other verticals also continue to deliver strong growth with flight tickets up 32% year-over-year and attractions up close to 90%, albeit from a relatively smaller base. Most importantly, travelers who choose to book multi-vertical trips with us also choose to come back to us for future bookings more often, which reinforces the long-term value proposition of the connected trip vision.\nNow I'd like to spend some time on Booking.com's Genius loyalty program, which plays an ever more important role in attracting and engaging travelers and stands out as one of our core differentiators. The purpose of Genius is straightforward, reward our most loyal customers with extra value while delivering real benefits for our partners. Genius members book more often convert at higher rates, book further in advance, cancel less and choose to come back more consistently than non-Genius customers. In fact, in the third quarter, travelers in Genius Levels 2 and 3 made up over 30% of our active base and accounted for a mid-50% range of our room nights over the last 4 quarters, increasing from last year's levels.\nToday, Genius is available in over 200 countries and territories. The program spans our range of supply from large global hotel chains to independent properties and increasingly alternative accommodations and our other verticals. What sets Genius apart is that travelers get immediate tangible benefits such as tier discounts or perks like free breakfast or room upgrades. We're continuing to invest to make these benefits more personalized, data-driven and relevant to each traveler's journey.\nOn the partner side, we carefully designed Genius so that it provides incremental value rather than simply shifting existing demand. Our data shows that Genius members submit reviews more often, driving higher property visibility and increasing occupancy rates for participating properties, particularly during off-peak periods. That helps partners optimize their revenue management. At the end of the third quarter, over 850,000 partners had chosen to participate in Genius.\nLooking ahead, we see several opportunities to continue strengthening our Genius offering. We're already expanding our offering across verticals and exploring ways to provide additional benefits. Loyalty programs remain a core pillar across our brands, not just at Booking.com. Most recently, OpenTable enhanced its program, which is now called OpenTable Regulars. The updated program offers new ways for diners to redeem points on experiences and introduces a new loyalty tier that provides enhanced benefits such as one named Priority Notify Me, which will alert diners to last-minute tables earlier than others with additional benefit launches planned over coming quarters. For restaurants, it helps encourage more repeat visits from high-value guests. Let me now turn to Gen AI, which we continue to believe represents a major opportunity to enhance the traveler and partner experience. While there is certainly a lot of excitement in the industry, our approach has been disciplined and focused on where AI can make a real difference for our customers, our partners and our business.\nOn the customer side, we saw encouraging developments this past quarter. At Agoda, for example, we launched an AI-powered chatbot that provides travelers with prompt hotel-specific answers. By cutting through complexity and delivering precise information quickly, it helps travelers make timely and more confident booking decisions, reducing uncertainty and improving the overall experience. Another example is Kayak's AI mode, a natural language search experience that combines Kayak and large language model data to deliver smarter contextual results right from the homepage. And at Booking.com, we've begun integrating new features into our app to assist travelers earlier in their planning process. These include natural language search capabilities that offer more inspiration such as destination highlights. As we further develop our hygentic capabilities, combine them with our data-driven insights on when to offer relevant suggestions and advance our connected trip vision, we believe travelers will increasingly recognize the value proposition of our platform.\nWe also see important opportunities for AI to create more benefits for our partners. By driving better personalization and conversion, AI helps generate incremental demand across our verticals. Just as importantly, we are applying AI to make partner-to-guest communication faster, more streamlined and more intuitive. A core strength of our business has always been the unique value we bring to our supply partners and AI is enhancing these capabilities. As an example, Booking.com continued to add to its robust suite of Gen AI tools for partners, including Smart Messenger and AutoRly. SmartMessenger uses intelligent response generation and automated workflows to bring together relevant partner, property and reservation information, knowing when and what to suggest to support accommodation partners in their communications to guests.\nAutoRly takes this further, allowing partners to set custom apply topics that deliver instant personalized responses to both common and unique guest questions. Early results have shown an increase in partner satisfaction compared with our prior messaging tools, underscoring how AI can provide tangible differentiated value to our partners. Beyond our internal efforts, we're also building relationships with leading AI organizations, reflecting our ambition to remain at the forefront of this rapidly developing field and to broaden our potential sources of customer traffic. We recognize that Gen AI is transforming how travelers research and find inspiration for their trips, and we are committed to continue to expand, evolve and meet them wherever they choose to search. Most recently, we were one of the first wave of apps available in OpenAI's ChatGPT App Store after being one of the launch partners for their operator platform earlier this year. Our strong relationship with companies such as OpenAI, Google, Amazon and Salesforce, combined with our disciplined approach, give us confidence that Gen AI will be an important driver of the long-term value for our travelers as well as our partners.\nOn alternative accommodations, we are continuing to strengthen our offering. In the most recent quarter, listings grew to over 8.6 million, up approximately 10% year-over-year with double-digit room night growth. Travelers value choice and the breadth of supply across hotels, homes and unique properties differentiates us as a platform. Alternative accommodations remain a long-term growth opportunity. Customer demand for alternative accommodations is healthy across every region and our ability to combine that breadth of supply with our marketing reach and payments capabilities makes us well positioned in this segment. Finally, I want to touch on Asia, which remains a driver of growth for us and is one of our most exciting long-term opportunities. It is the fastest-growing major travel market in the world with industry growth expected to remain in the high single digits over the next several years, and our ambition is to grow even faster than the market.\nOur offering in the region is built on the complementary strengths of Agoda and Booking.com. Agoda is a strong local player with consumer trust across Asia, while Booking.com brings global reach and brand recognition. Together, they create a combination that allows us to serve both local and outbound travelers across the region. As we look forward, we know we are operating in a period of rapid change, driven by geopolitical developments, macroeconomic uncertainty and accelerating technological innovation. What gives us confidence and makes me optimistic about the future is the strength of our value proposition through the connected trip, our Genius loyalty program and our relationships and innovations in Gen AI, we are building products that engage travelers, generate incremental demand and value for our partners and create differentiators. With that, I'll turn it over to Ewout to walk through the financial results in more detail. Ewout?\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to walk you through our results for the third quarter and share our current outlook for the fourth quarter and full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis, and the reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financials can be found in our earnings release. Now let's turn to our third quarter performance. Our room nights in the third quarter grew 8%, a positive result versus a strong prior year comparison and exceeded the high end of our guidance by nearly 3 percentage points. This outperformance was helped by an expansion of the booking window beyond our prior expectation and what we experienced in the second quarter, resulting in more room nights being pulled forward into the third quarter. We saw broad-based strength in room night growth across all major regions, and each region exceeded our expectations.\nEurope and the U.S. were up high single digits and Asia and Rest of World each delivered low double-digit growth. Our globally diversified portfolio proved its value once again as we continue to see robust growth in certain travel corridors, including Canada to Mexico and Europe to Asia, which effectively offset softer demand in certain inbound corridors to the U.S. Notably, our U.S. Booker room night growth accelerated meaningfully from the second quarter, driven by solid improvements in domestic and outbound growth, and we believe our growth once again outpaced the broader U.S. accommodations industry in a meaningful way. We're also encouraged by the growth in our direct channel in the U.S. We saw the booking window in the U.S. normalize in the third quarter, which is also an encouraging improvement from the second quarter.\nThat said, in the U.S., we continue to see slightly lower ADRs and a shorter length of stay versus the prior year, which may indicate that some U.S. consumers are continuing to be thoughtful on their discretionary spending. More broadly, global ADRs on a constant currency basis were up about 1% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the second quarter, and the global average length of stay remained similar to last year. While we are pleased with our third quarter results, we remain focused on accelerating our long-term earnings potential and are energized by the progress we are making across many key strategic initiatives. We continue to strengthen our direct relationship with our travelers and see tangible progress with increases in our direct mix, mobile app mix and loyalty mix.\nOver the last 4 quarters, our B2C direct mix was in the mid-60% range, which was up versus the low 60% range 1 year ago. The mobile app mix of our room nights was in the mid-50% range over the last 4 quarters, which was up from the low 50% range 1 year ago. We find that a significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. We continue to drive engagement in our Genius loyalty program that delivers value to both our travelers and partners. The mix of Booking.com room nights booked by travelers in the higher genius tiers of Levels 2 and 3 was in the mid-50% range over the last 4 quarters, and this mix increased year-over-year.\nThese Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers have a meaningfully higher direct booking rate than our other travelers, which demonstrates the strength of the program's value proposition. We also see continued momentum in diversifying and expanding our business into growth areas such as alternative accommodations, payments, flights and attractions. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our room night growth was about 10% and growth outpaced our overall business in each of our major regions.\nThe global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was 36%, which was up 1 percentage point from the third quarter of 2024. Our total merchant gross bookings increased 26% year-over-year in the third quarter. Over the last 4 quarters, merchant gross bookings surpassed $123 billion in total transaction value, representing about 68% of total gross bookings, an increase from about 61% 1 year ago. Our merchant payments business is foundational to the connected trip, offers more flexibility for our travelers and partners and generates incremental revenue and contribution margin dollars for our business. We marked another quarter of solid growth in our other travel verticals, reaffirming our strategic focus on building on our connected trip vision.\nDuring the third quarter, over 17 million airline tickets were booked across our platforms, representing an increase of 32% year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of our flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda. We also delivered another quarter of meaningful expansion of our attractions vertical with tickets booked on our platforms growing nearly 90% year-over-year from a relatively smaller base. As Glenn mentioned before, we're seeing healthy growth in connected trip transactions, and our data shows that travelers who book more than one travel vertical with us more frequently choose to book directly with us in the future.\nThe progress across all these initiatives is interrelated, and the combined effect is helping us expand the number of customers who choose to come to us directly and book with higher frequency. Before turning back to our third quarter results, it's important to note that the third quarter has historically been our seasonally highest absolute quarter in terms of revenue and earnings. Gross bookings of $50 billion increased 14% year-over-year or about 10% on a constant currency basis. The constant currency growth rate was approximately 2 percentage points higher than room night growth due to about 1 percentage point from higher bookings growth from flights and other travel verticals as well as an increase in constant currency accommodation ADRs of about 1%. The increase in gross bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance by about 4 percentage points, driven by the room night outperformance as well as about 2% higher accommodation ADRs versus our expectations. The impact from changes in FX was about in line with our expectations.\nThird quarter revenue of $9 billion grew 13% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about 4 percentage points, in line with the outperformance on gross bookings. Constant currency revenue growth was about 8%. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings of 18.1% was lower by about 30 basis points year-over-year due to an increased mix of flight bookings as well as increased merchandising contra revenue, some of which was tied to bookings made in prior quarters. This was partially offset by higher revenues from payments. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 9% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was a source of leverage, driven by changes in traffic mix and lower brand marketing expenses as a percentage of total gross bookings.\nWe continue to make disciplined investments in social media channels at attractive ROIs. On a combined basis, marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings also had leverage in the quarter. As expected, third quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was slightly higher compared to a year ago, driven by an increasing merchant mix resulting in higher payments expenses, partially offset by increased efficiencies in customer service. Adjusted fixed operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year or mid-single digits after normalizing for changes in FX. The year-over-year increase was also impacted by increased cloud costs.\nWe continue to drive efficiencies in our fixed expenses through our ongoing cost optimization initiatives, while at the same time, reinvesting into the business to effectively drive long-term growth. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $4.2 billion grew 15% year-over-year, which was about 6 percentage points faster than the high end of our guidance due primarily to stronger revenue growth. Adjusted EPS of $99.50 per share was up 19% year-over-year, faster than the growth in adjusted EBITDA, helped by the benefit of a 4% lower average share count. During the third quarter, we realized approximately $70 million of in-quarter savings from the transformation program, primarily in sales and other expenses and in personnel expenses. We also took further actions during the quarter to advance certain efficiency initiatives into the implementation phase.\nAnd as a result, we now estimate in-year savings for 2025 will exceed $225 million, and we have enabled approximately $450 million in annual run rate savings, surpassing our prior expectations. For the full program, we now expect to deliver about $500 million to $550 million in run rate savings, and we estimate the aggregate transformation costs will be approximately 1x the run rate savings. In the third quarter, we incurred $105 million in transformation costs, which were excluded from our adjusted results. As a reminder, we're reinvesting approximately $170 million above our baseline investments in 2025 to support our strategic priorities for long-term value creation.\nThis reinvestment is funded by the savings generated from the transformation program, combined with additional operational efficiencies in our ongoing operations. Now turning to our cash and liquidity position. Our third quarter ending cash and investments balance was $17.2 billion compared to our second quarter ending balance of $18.2 billion due to a reduction of $2.4 billion from deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities. We generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow, offset by capital return activities, including about $700 million in share repurchases and about $300 million in dividends.\nAdditionally, we paid $1.5 billion to redeem high coupon debt that was originally due in 2030. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, while there remains some uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop, we're pleased to see continued momentum with steady travel demand trends in our business so far in the fourth quarter. As always, we will continue to closely monitor the travel environment for any changes. Our guidance for the fourth quarter assumes recent FX rates for the remainder of the quarter, including the euro-U.S. dollar at $1.17. We estimate changes in FX will positively impact our fourth quarter U.S. dollar reported growth rates by about 5 percentage points. We currently expect fourth quarter room night growth to be between 4% and 6%. We expect growth to moderate from the third quarter as we expect the booking window to be less expended in the fourth quarter. We currently expect fourth quarter gross bookings to increase between 11% and 13%, including about 2 percentage points of positive impact from higher flight ticket growth. We expect constant currency accommodation ADRs to be about in line with last year. We currently expect fourth quarter revenue growth to be between 10% and 12%, lower than the increase in gross bookings due to a higher mix of flight bookings. We currently expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion or about 14% growth at the high end. We currently expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margins to be slightly higher than last year, driven by leverage on adjusted fixed operating expenses.\nTurning to the full year 2025. With a strong third quarter on the books, steady trends to date, along with improved visibility for the fourth quarter, we're increasing our full year guidance. Assuming recent FX rates will remain steady for the remainder of the year, we estimate changes in FX will positively impact our full year reported growth rates by about 3 percentage points for gross bookings and revenue and by about 4 percentage points for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. On a constant currency basis, our latest expectations are above our long-term growth ambition of at least 8% gross bookings and revenue growth and 15% adjusted EPS growth. On a reported basis, for the full year, we now expect room nights to be up about 7%, gross bookings to be up about 11% to 12% revenue to be up about 12%, adjusted EBITDA to be up about 17% to 18% adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by about 180 basis points higher than our prior expectation of about 125 basis points, revenue to grow faster than both marketing and adjusted fixed operating expenses, sales and other expenses to grow similar to revenue and adjusted EPS to be up slightly more than 20%.\nIn conclusion, we're energized and highly motivated by the clear momentum in the business. Our continued progress reinforces our confidence that our loyal customers and global supply, along with our technology and data, all powered by our people, are industry-defining assets that will fuel our long-term success. Thank you to all of my colleagues across the company for their shared commitment and extraordinary work. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines?",

These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.

A copy of Booking Holdings' earnings press release is available in the -- for Investors section of Booking Holdings' website, www.bookingholdings.com.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Please go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report a strong quarter that demonstrates the resilience of our business and the enduring appeal of global leisure travel.\nOur top line trends saw solid improvement with room nights, gross bookings and revenue, all exceeding our prior expectations. This revenue outperformance combined with our continued disciplined expense management, increased adjusted EBITDA 28% year-over-year. Even more than these financial achievements, I'm proud of our team's progress in accelerating our strategic priorities. This year continues to underscore the exciting intersection of technology and travel.\nOur legacy of innovation and our scale and proprietary data position us well to continue to drive meaningful value for our travelers and partners. I'll share specific examples from the quarter shortly. But first, let's briefly cover our second quarter financial highlights.\nDuring the quarter, we delivered strong results that exceeded our expectations, reflecting robust demand across our globally diversified business. Room nights reached $309 million an 8% year-over-year increase exceeding the high end of our prior expectations driven by strong performance across Europe and Asia. Asia, in particular, saw a healthy growth up low double digits, and we remain optimistic about our long-term outlook for the region.\nThe U.S. continues to be our slowest-growing region, but growth in the second quarter improved slightly from the first quarter and likely outpaced the broader U.S. accommodation industry. The stronger-than-expected global room night growth helped drive second quarter gross bookings up 13% and revenue up 16%, both were above the high end of our prior guidance ranges. It's important to note that FX favorably impacted our growth rates by approximately 4 percentage points, consistent with our expectations. And finally, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 32% year-over-year. Ewout will provide more detailed financial insights shortly, including our outlook for the third quarter and full year.\nBeyond the headline numbers, I am energized by the significant strides we are making across several key initiatives. We continue to expand alternative accommodations, enhance the Genius loyalty program, and grow our presence in Asia. We are also pushing forward our connected trip vision and continue to develop our AI capabilities. All these initiatives and others contribute interactively synergistically allowing us to deliver a better planning and booking experience for our travelers and bring incremental demand to our partners.\nLet's start with alternative accommodations. Strong relationships with our partners and our broad selection for travelers are fundamental to providing a comprehensive planning and booking offering. And we're constantly working to meet the alternative combination experience even better for both sides of the marketplace. We strengthened our payment capabilities to deliver our partners a faster, simpler and more efficient experience.\nAlso, we are further rolling out request to book functionality with prebooking messaging through an API, providing access to a segment of the alternative combination of supply that relies on this model. For travelers, we continue to broaden supply. With Booking.com's alternative accommodation listings reaching $8.4 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year. This growth provides even more choices for our travelers and contributed to a 10% year-over-year growth in alternative accommodation room nights for the quarter, outpacing our core hotel business.\nAnother core way we deliver benefits to our travelers is through Booking.com's loyalty program called Genius. This program offers discounted pricing and other, mostly supplier provided benefits to our travelers. We continue to extend our Genius program beyond accommodations into other travel verticals, bring these benefits to more elements of travel. We've also been experimenting on how we can continue to reward and provide a differentiated offering to our most loyal customers with additional features like dedicated customer support agents.\nWe're encouraged to see more of our travelers continue to move into our higher level 2 and 3 Genius tiers, which now represent over 30% of our active travelers and book a mid-50% of Booking.com's total Romax. These Genius travelers exhibit meaningfully higher direct booking rates and a higher booking frequency than our other travelers.\nFrom a regional perspective, Asia remains central to our long-term strategy. Its size and economic momentum make it an attractive travel market. and our strong position there allows us to benefit from that growth. We expect industry growth in the region to be in the high single digits over the medium term, the fastest among our major markets. And our ambition is to keep outpacing the broader industry as we have for several years.\nAs mentioned earlier in the call, in the second quarter, we delivered low double-digit room night growth in Asia, reflecting the strength of our 2 brand approach with Agoda and Booking.com. This success comes from localizing the user experience, expanding flights and attractions, tailoring payment methods and ensuring travelers can engage with us in their own language, all supported by thousands of our dedicated employees across the region.\nNow onto the Connected Trip. We continue to make progress there towards our long-term vision. It's all about making the plan booking an overall travel experience easier and more personalized, providing more value for the traveler, along with a data-driven process to enable partners opportunities to obtain incremental business. Travelers who book Connected Trip directly with us meaning a trip that includes booking more than 1 travel vertical, more frequently choose to book directly again with us in the future.\nTo put it bluntly, we see greater loyalty in our customers who have purchased a connected trip. A lot of our foundational work in recent years has been about growing verticals outside of accommodations, with a view to facilitate a more comprehensive travel experience, and our efforts are showing results. Connected Trip transactions grew over 30% year-over-year in the second quarter and now represent a low double-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions.\nOur non-accommodation verticals continue to show strong growth, with flight tickets up 44%. And and attraction ticket growth more than doubled year-over-year, although from a modest base. While the direct financial impact from attractions is minimal today, we believe this vertical allows us to offer our travelers compelling in-destination experiences. These data points indicate that more travelers are choosing to book multiple elements of their trips on our platforms, reflecting the increasing value and convenience we offer to travelers and enabling our flights attractions and ground transportation partners, many of whom are small and medium-sized enterprises to obtain incremental business.\nWe always know that the Connected Trip needs exceptional technology at its core. AI in general and not particularly GenAI, is propelling us closer to this vision. We are actively investing in advanced AI capabilities, accelerating our ability to meet the evolving needs of travelers and partners. During the quarter, we continue to see developments that are allowing us to better inform travelers by creating more personalized and responsive experiences.\nFor example, price lines, AI assistant Penny saw multiple enhancements, including expanded voice capabilities, leading to increasing engagement rates and improved conversion metrics. At KAYAK, the teams kayak.ai, which is its tax lab for AI-first features, continues to improve its product to be more personalized and conversational. Another example is open tables AI concierge, which launched earlier this month, embedded directly on restaurant profiles, Concierge draws from OpenTable's extensive restaurant data, including menus, reviews and descriptions to offer more tailored recommendations.\nOn the customer service side, Gen AI has notably reduced live agent contact rates across our brands. It allows us to answer customer questions faster and more conveniently at Agoda, agent and enablement tools such as oil summarization of cases and guided workflows have resulted in more customized and seamless engagement.\nAt Booking.com, voice-enabled Gen AI agents and customer service have improved resolution times and increased customer satisfaction scores continuing to advance these capabilities will yield an easier, more responsive and better served travel experience.\nIn addition to our organic efforts, we continue to collaborate with leading AI companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Amazon and others on their genetic developments, this enables us to stay at the forefront of this rapidly developing field and we believe will expand our potential sources of new customers in the future. Of course, as we've mentioned in the past, we also continue to engage with social media platforms at traveler search patterns and travel discovery methods evolve, particularly at the inspiration state of the travel funnel.\nOn the topic of partnerships, I am thrilled by the traction the OpenTable team continues to gain. They've done tremendous work, creating genuine value for both our restaurant partners and diners. This quarter, we announced our partnership with Chase Sapphire Reserve, giving eligible Chase card members exclusive access to selected comment restaurants on OpenTable. It builds on the great momentum from our recent Uber and Visa announcements.\nLooking forward, while we acknowledge that navigating geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties is simply the norm for a business as global as ours. History as repeatedly shown us the enduring resilience of travel, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for the travel industry and in our ability to adapt and innovate to continue to position us well to deliver attractive growth. I am incredibly excited about what's ahead.\nOur commitment is to strategically drive our business for the long term. focusing on what we can control to seek to deliver unparalleled value to both our travelers and our partners.\nThank you. I will now turn the call over to Ewout for a more detailed financial review and our guidance.\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by thanking all the teams across the company. Their great work is what allows us to share these positive updates today. I will now review our results for the second quarter and provide our current thoughts for the third quarter and full year. All growth rates on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP financials can be found in our earnings release.\nNow let's move to our second quarter results. Our room nights in the second quarter grew 8%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about 2 percentage points. The higher-than-expected room night growth was driven by stronger-than-expected performance in Europe, Asia and the U.S. We observed an impact in our Rest of World region in June from the events in the Middle East, which we estimate impacted global growth by about 1% in June and 1/3 of a percentage point overall in the second quarter.\nLooking at our room night growth by region in the quarter, Europe was up high single digits. Asia was up low double digits. Rest of World was up high single digits and the U.S. was up low single digits. The U.S. continues to be our lowest growing region, but growth in the second quarter was slightly higher than the first quarter, and we believe it outpaces the broader U.S. accommodations industry. However, in the U.S., we observed lower ADRs as well as a shorter length of stay and booking window. This may suggest that U.S. consumers are being more careful with spending in the current economic environment.\nAt a global level, constant currency ADRs were flat, excluding changes in regional mix, the global efforts length of stay was similar to last year and the global booking window expanded year-over-year. We saw consistent trends in certain travel corridors that were noted on our previous call. Inbound travel to the U.S. was down year-over-year in the second quarter, particularly from bookers in Canada and to a lesser extent from bookers in Europe.\nThat said, we also saw strong growth in other travel corridors including Canada to Mexico and Europe to Asia contributing to accelerating room night growth overall. These results once again highlight our global diversification as a core strength of our business. We remain focused on executing on our key strategic initiatives to strengthen our long-term earnings potential, and we're seeing continued momentum across several areas, including alternative accommodations growth, increasing the direct and mobile ad mix of our bookings, expanding our Genius loyalty program and further growing our other travel verticals.\nFor our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our second quarter room night growth was 10%, which continues to outpace the growth of our overall business. The global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was 37%, which was up 1 percentage point from the second quarter of 2024.\nWe also see tangible progress in our efforts to strengthen our direct relationships with our travelers and increase loyalty on our platforms. Over the last 4 quarters, our B2C direct mix was in the mid-60% range, which was up from the low 60% range 1 year ago. The mobile app mix of our room nights was in the mid-50% range over the last 4 quarters, which was up from the low 50% range 1 year ago. We find that the significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel.\nWe continue to provide compelling benefits and value to both our travelers and our partners through our Genius loyalty program. The mix of Booking.com, room nights booked by travelers in the higher genius tiers of Levels 2 and 3 was in the mid-50% range over the last 4 quarters. And this mix continued to increase year-over-year. These Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers have a meaningfully higher direct booking rate than our other travelers.\nWe achieved another quarter of healthy growth across our other travel verticals, as Glenn mentioned, during the second quarter, over 16 million airline tickets were booked across our platforms, representing an increase of 44% year-over-year. driven by the continued growth of our flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda.\nOur attractions vertical is scaling nicely with tickets booked on our platforms more than doubling year-over-year of a modest pace. We're actively investing in driving further growth in these verticals that help strengthen our offering and underpin our long-term connected trip vision.\nSecond quarter gross bookings increased 13% year-over-year or about 9% on a constant currency basis. The constant currency growth rate was approximately 1 percentage point higher than room night growth due to about 2 percentage points from higher flight booking growth, partially offset by a decrease in constant currency accommodation ADRs of about 1%.\nThe decrease in ADRs was impacted by a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix from the U.S. As I noted before, excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were about in line with the second quarter of 2024. The increase in gross bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point, driven by about 2 percentage points of benefit from higher room nights, partially offset by lower accommodation ADRs versus our expectations. The impact from changes in FX was about in line with our expectations.\nSecond quarter revenue of $6.8 billion grew 16% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 4 percentage points. The outperformance was greater than growth bookings, primarily due to higher revenues from facilitating payments and lower merchandising spend. The lower merchandising spend is driven by timing, which we anticipate will impact revenue in the third quarter.\nRevenue as a percentage of gross bookings of 14.5% was up about 40 basis points year-over-year due to the timing impact from the Easter calendar shift and higher revenue from payments partially offset by an increased mix of flight bookings. Constant currency revenue growth was about 12% when normalizing for the year-over-year impact of the Easter calendar shift, constant currency revenue growth was about 10% in the second quarter.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 10% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was a source of leverage compared to the second quarter of 2024, driven by lower Brent marketing expenses as well as higher direct mix partially offset by increased spend in social media channels at attractive incremental ROIs.\nSecond quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with last year despite an increasing merchant mix as higher payment expenses were offset by increased efficiencies in customer service as well as lower transaction taxes and bad debt provisions.\nAdjusted fixed operating expenses increased 11% year-over-year or about 7% on a constant currency basis. and was a source of leverage in the quarter as we continue to be highly focused on managing our fixed expenses. The year-over-year increase was impacted by higher performance-based compensation accruals and increased cloud cost and a legal settlement in the second quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.4 billion grew 28% year-over-year, which was 12 percentage points faster than the high end of our guidance due primarily to stronger revenue growth. Adjusted EPS of $55.40 per share, was up 32% year-over-year, faster than the growth in adjusted EBITDA and held by the benefit of 5% lower average share count.\nDuring the second quarter, we realized approximately $45 million of in-quarter savings from the transformation program primarily in the sales and other expenses line. We expect the actions we have taken so far will enable approximately $350 million in annual run rate savings of which about $150 million is forecast to be realized this year, consistent with our prior expectations.\nIn the second quarter, we incurred $38 million in transformation costs, which were almost entirely excluded from our adjusted results. We continue to estimate the aggregate transformation cost will be about $400 million to $450 million, which is similar to onetime the run rate savings we anticipate from executing the program.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our second quarter ending cash and investments balance of $18.2 billion was up versus our first quarter ending balance of $16.1 billion. This was driven by about $3.1 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter and approximately $700 million from the impact of changes in FX on our cash balance, partially offset by capital return activities, including $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $300 million in dividends.\nIn the second quarter, we issued about $2 billion in debt, which was mostly offset by about $2 billion in payments related to the maturity of debt, including the conversion premium on the convertible notes. Since we avoided the issuance of new shares by settling the note in cash and will realize the benefit in the year-over-year reduction in diluted share count the cash payment of $1.1 billion to settle the conversion has an effect similar and incremental to the regular share repurchases of $1.3 billion just mentioned.\nFree cash flow in the second quarter benefited by over $800 million from changes in working capital, driven primarily by the seasonal increase in our deferred merchant bookings balance.\nMoving to our thoughts for the third quarter. At the global level, we have seen steady travel demand trends in our business so far in the third quarter. However, we recognize that comparables with the prior year will be higher in August and September.\nAdditionally, we remain mindful that the geopolitical dynamics and uncertainty in the broader macroeconomic environment could potentially impact consumer behavior as we have seen in the Middle East most recently.\nWe continue to closely monitor the travel environment for any changes. Our guidance for the third quarter assumes recent FX rates for the remainder of the quarter, including the euro-U.S. dollar at 1.17. We estimate changes in FX will positively impact our third quarter U.S. dollar reported growth rates by about 4 percentage points.\nWe currently expect third quarter room night growth to be between 3.5% and 5.5%. We expect growth to moderate from the second quarter, as the third quarter has a tougher prior year growth comparison. We currently expect third quarter gross bookings to increase between 8% and 10%, including 2 percentage points of positive impact from higher flight ticket growth.\nWe expect constant currency accommodation ADRs will be down slightly year-over-year. We currently expect third quarter revenue growth to be between 7% and 9% lower than the increase in gross bookings due to a higher mix of flight bookings as well as increased merchandise and contract revenue, some of which is related to bookings made in prior quarters.\nWe currently expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between $3.9 billion and $4 billion growing 9% year-over-year at the high end. We currently expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA margins to be similar to last year. This is primarily due to marketing leverage being offset by the timing of merchandising spend and increased sales and other expenses, some of which relate to the timing of payment costs.\nTurning to the full year 2025. While we recognize there is still elevated uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we are pleased to see that global travel demand trends continue to be steady so far in the third quarter. Given these trends and with improved visibility for the third quarter, which historically has been our largest revenue and profit quarter, we are increasing our full year guidance ranges at the midpoint. Assuming recent FX rates for the remainder of the year, we estimate changes in FX will positively impact our full year reported growth rates by about 3 percentage points.\nOn a constant currency basis, our current expectations continue to be aligned with our long-term growth ambition of at least 8% gross bookings and revenue growth and 15% adjusted EPS growth. On a reported basis, for the full year, we currently expect gross bookings and revenue to be up low double digits, adjusted EBITDA to be up mid-teens, adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by about 125 basis points higher than our prior expectation of 50 to 100 basis points. Revenue will grow faster than both marketing and adjusted fixed operating expenses, sales and other expenses to grow similar to revenue and adjusted EPS to be up high teens.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain focused on executing towards our strategic vision of a generative AI-powered Connected Trip while taking actions to drive greater operating leverage.\nThank you to all of my colleagues across the company for their amazing work and dedication toward delivering value for our travelers, partners and shareholders. With that, we will now take your questions.\nOperator, will you please open the lines?",

Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you and welcome to Booking Holdings first quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report a good start to 2025. We saw a healthy growth in room nights and gross bookings as we benefited from our geographical diversification. When travelers choose to alter their destination preferences, our global network of partner suppliers is a valuable asset. Our solid top line results, combined with our continued focus on driving disciplined management of our fixed expenses, helped us deliver strong bottom line outperformance in the quarter.\nAside from our near-term financial results, I'm excited about our team's continued progress in advancing our strategic priorities. I'm also excited about our continued work to incorporate AI technology in multiple ways across our platforms, which will continue to position us well for the long term.\nOur first quarter room nights of 319 million, the first quarter we have ever exceeded 300 million room nights in a single quarter, slightly exceeded the high end of our prior expectations and grew a bit over 7% year-over-year. First quarter revenue of $4.8 billion grew 8% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA of about $1.1 billion increased 21% year-over-year. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high end of our prior guidance ranges. Finally, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 22% year-over-year.\nAt the start of the second quarter, we are currently seeing stable level global leisure travel demand despite rising geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns. Ewout will provide further details on our first quarter results and our thoughts on the second quarter and full year.\nWhile we are encouraged by our first quarter results and the relative stability of trends we have seen so far in the second quarter, we fully recognize the current geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and concerns about the strength of consumer demand. However, we believe our global diversification, substantial liquidity, strong free cash flow and historical record of executing effectively position us well to navigate potential changes in the environment. And regardless of potential changes in the near term, I remain confident in the long-term outlook for the travel industry given the importance of travel to consumers and as we witnessed as we exited the pandemic people's deep desires to experience the world.\nWe will continue to drive our business for the long term while remaining focused on what we can control today to deliver value to our travelers and supplier partners, value from advancing our strategic initiatives such as increasing the alternative accommodations available to our travelers, enhancing our Genius offering, building towards our connected vision and further innovating our AI capabilities. And we will do this while managing our operations with the effective and disciplined approach we have demonstrated throughout our history.\nFocusing on our supplier partners. We remain committed to being a trusted and valuable partner to all of the accommodation properties on our platforms. We do so by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features designed to support the success of these businesses, many of which are small independents. In times of economic uncertainty, we believe the incremental demand that we can deliver to our partners is even more valuable, and this presents an opportunity to work closely with our partners to make sure they are well positioned on our platform.\nFor example, we can share booking pattern data with a property partner and suggest options that may help that property better capture demand. We are also leveraging AI technology to better help our partners, whether it's using GenAI at Booking.com to provide suggested responses to traveler questions that come into a property or through the development of an AI partner assistant to help a new partner navigate the onboarding process. We'll continue to build around opportunities where we can utilize this technology to provide additional value to our partners. We believe these efforts can be particularly helpful for those small and independent businesses with which we are partnering who can now more easily access the data and AI tools we are providing.\nOne of the results of our continued focus on driving value to our partners is the increasing number of partners making their accommodation supply available on Booking.com. With growth across both traditional hotels and alternative accommodations, Booking.com's total accommodation listings reached about 31 million by the end of Q1. For alternative accommodations of Booking.com, listings at the end of the first quarter were about 8.1 million and increased 9% year-over-year with growth in every major region. We believe the increase in accommodation choices for our travelers helped contribute to a solid alternative accommodations room night growth of 12% in the first quarter.\nTurning to our travelers. The breadth of supply choices I just mentioned help us to better deliver a comprehensive planning and booking experience and are one of the important benefits we offer to our travelers. We are laser-focused on driving value to our travelers just as we do for our supplier partners, and I am pleased to see this focus helping Booking.com achieve growth in new travelers as well as repeat travelers in the first quarter. In addition to the growth in travelers, I am encouraged to see that more travelers are choosing to come to our platforms through the direct booking channel, which grew faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels in the first quarter.\nAnother important way that we can deliver benefits to our travelers is through Booking.com's Genius loyalty program, which provides discounted pricing and other mostly supplier-provided benefits to our travelers. This program also helps to connect more elements of travel as we have extended this program beyond accommodations into other travel verticals. We are encouraged to see more of our travelers continuing to move into our higher Genius tiers of Levels 2 and 3, which represent over 30% of our active travelers. These Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers have a meaningful higher direct booking rate and a higher booking frequency than the rest of our travelers.\nWe believe AI technology will also play an important role in improving the traveler experience. For example, at Booking.com, we are continuing to learn from testing high-powered features, including smart filters that help travelers find relevant results faster; property Q&A that answers specific questions that wouldn't be addressed in a static listing; and AI review summaries that allow travelers to more easily sort through thousands of reviews. These are just a few recent examples, but we plan to continue integrating AI across additional consumer-facing use cases over time.\nAI plays a central role in our connected trip vision as we aim to simplify the planning, booking and travel experience, making it all more personalized, seamless and enjoyable. As we've built towards our connected trip vison, we believe we are delivering better value to our travelers as well as our supplier partners. We saw connected trip transaction growth of 35% year-over-year in the first quarter, and these connected transactions continue to represent a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions.\nMuch of the work in recent years in building towards the connected trip vision has been in standing up the other travel verticals outside of accommodations, like flights, for example. With air ticket growth of 45% in the first quarter, we continue to see strong growth from our flight platform, which is an important component in many of our travelers' connected trips.\nOutside flights, we are pleased to have seen strong growth in our attractions vertical in the quarter with attraction tickets increasing 92% year-over-year from a modest base. While the direct financial impact is minimal today, we believe continuing to enhance the attractions vertical allows us to offer our travelers compelling in-destination experiences.\nFinally, in dining, I'm excited by the progress the OpenTable team is continuing to make, including the recent establishment of a strategic partnership with Uber that will include developing integrations of their apps to offer dining reservations access and transportation options.\nWhen we think about an even more seamless and personalized connected trip experience, we believe that compelling AI-powered offerings like a travel vertical-specific agent will play a central role. We are highly focused on the many opportunities with AI, and we'll continue sophisticated work already happening across our company to integrate generative AI into our offerings, some of which I mentioned earlier when describing their capabilities for our partners and travelers. We are seeing some of our AI offerings driving faster search, improvements in conversion and fewer customer support contacts.\nAt KAYAK, the team just launched KAYAK.ai, which is its test lab for AI-first features with the aim to improve KAYAK's product to be even more personalized and conversational over time. Across the company, our teams are testing, learning and innovating around how AI can be better incorporated into our offerings with more to come. In addition to our own offerings, we're working with leading generative AI organizations on their agentic developments.\nWe were excited for several of our brands to be named as partners for OpenAI's Operator Agent, Microsoft's Copilot Actions Tool and Amazon's Alexa Plus. While we are still in the very early days, we believe these collaborations reflect our ambition of being at the forefront of this rapidly developing field and are consistent with our long-standing approach to work with different potential sources of new customer traffic. We will continue to learn how travelers and partners prefer to engage with generative AI across different touch points, and I remain confident in our position and I'm energized by the positive impact this technology is already having.\nIn conclusion, I am pleased with the good start to the year and our team's efforts as they continue to advance our strategic initiatives in connected trip vision. While there is uncertainty around the near-term geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we are confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company as we deploy generative AI technology and aim to deliver an even better offering for our travelers and partners.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen.\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the first quarter and provide our current thinking for the second quarter and full year. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting a summary earnings presentation as well as our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.\nNow let's move to our first quarter results. Our room nights in the first quarter grew a bit above 7%, which was slightly above the high end of our guidance. Looking at our room night growth by region in the first quarter, Europe and Asia were up high single digits, Rest of World was up low double digits, and the U.S. was up low single digits. In the quarter, we observed notable changes in certain travel patterns. For example, we saw a moderation in trends for inbound travel into the U.S., particularly from bookers in Canada, and to a lesser extent, from bookers in Europe.\nHowever, we also saw an improvement in trends in other travel corridors, for example, from Canada to Mexico, resulting in stable growth overall. These results demonstrate how our globally diversified business can help to mitigate country-specific dynamics while capturing growth opportunities elsewhere.\nWhile we saw a year-over-year increase in length of stay on a global basis, we saw a decrease in length of stay in the U.S., which could indicate that U.S. consumers are becoming more careful with their spending. We also saw some evidence of a bifurcated economy in the U.S. as higher-star-rating hotels appear to be more resilient than lower-star-rating hotels. We have not seen either of these dynamics in Europe.\nOn our key strategic initiatives, we continue to see encouraging progress in driving alternative accommodations growth, increasing the direct and mobile app mix of our bookings, expanding our Genius loyalty program and growing our other travel verticals. We continue to expand our alternative accommodations business faster than the overall business. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our first quarter room night growth was 12%, and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was 37%, which was up 1 percentage point from the first quarter of 2024.\nWe continue to strengthen our direct relationships with our travelers and increase loyalty on our platforms through our efforts to deliver value to consumers. Over the last 4 quarters, our B2C direct mix was in the mid-60% range, an increase on the low 60% range 1 year ago.\nThe mobile app mix of our total first quarter room nights was in the mid-50% range, which was up from the low 50% range in 2024. We continue to see that the significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel.\nFor our Genius loyalty program, the mix of Booking.com room nights booked by travelers in the higher Genius tiers of Levels 2 and 3 was in the mid-50% range over the last 4 quarters, and this mix continued to increase year-over-year. These Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers have a meaningfully higher direct booking rate than our other travelers.\nI'm also pleased to share that we delivered another strong quarter of solid growth across our other travel verticals. Over 16 million airline tickets were booked across our platforms in the first quarter, an increase of 45% year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of our flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda. We also saw strong growth in attractions with tickets booked up 92% year-over-year off a modest base.\nFirst quarter growth bookings increased 7% year-over-year or about 10% on a constant currency basis. The constant currency growth rate was approximately 3 percentage points higher than room night growth due to about 2 percentage points from higher flight bookings growth as well as an increase in constant currency accommodation ADRs of about 1%. The year-over-year ADR increase was impacted by a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 2% versus the first quarter of 2024. The increase in gross bookings slightly exceeded the high end of our guidance driven by less than 1 percentage point of benefit from changes relative to our expectations. Constant currency accommodation ADRs and flight ticket growth but in line with our expectations.\nFirst quarter revenue of $4.8 billion grew 8% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 4 percentage points due to higher revenues from facilitating payments as well as less than 1 percentage point of benefit from changes in FX relative to our expectations. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings of 10.2% was slightly higher than expected due to the higher revenues from payments. Constant currency revenue growth was about 10%. But normalizing for the year-over-year impact of Easter timing and the leap year, constant currency revenue growth was about 15% in the first quarter.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 10% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 3.8% and was about in line with our expectations. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024. Social media channel spend continues to scale at attractive incremental ROIs, while successful experimentation has led to improved performance in some of our traditional marketing channels. Those improved marketing channels helped drive increased booker volumes at comparable ROIs.\nFirst quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.5%, slightly lower than last year despite a higher merchant mix as higher payment expenses were offset by lower bad debt provisions and increased efficiencies in customer service. Adjusted fixed operating expenses decreased 3% year-over-year, which was better than our prior expectation primarily due to lower G&A expenses that benefited from a $17 million reduction of an accrual for certain transaction taxes. Personnel expenses came in slightly below our expectations for the quarter due to a $36 million reduction of a pension accrual. We continue to take a disciplined approach toward managing our fixed expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.1 billion grew 21% year-over-year and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by 28% largely due to the higher revenue as well as the better-than-expected adjusted fixed operating expenses. Adjusted EPS of $24.81 per share was up 22% year-over-year, similar to the growth in adjusted EBITDA as the benefit of a 5% lower average share count was offset by an increase in interest expense.\nOn a GAAP basis, net income was $333 million in the first quarter and was impacted by a mark-to-market adjustment to the conversion option premium of our convertible note due May 2025 and an FX remeasurement loss on our euro bonds, partially offset by a reduction in the accruals related to the Netherlands pension fund matter for 2023 and earlier years. All of these items were excluded from our adjusted results.\nFor the first quarter, we realized a very small amount of in-quarter savings from the transformation program. However, we have already taken actions that will enable approximately $300 million in annual run rate savings, of which about $150 million is forecasted to be realized this year, consistent with our prior expectations. In the first quarter, we incurred $32 million in transformation costs, which were excluded from our adjusted results. We continue to estimate the aggregate transformation cost will be about $400 million to $450 million, which is similar to the run rate savings we ultimately expect to achieve from the program.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our first quarter ending and investments balance of $16.1 billion was down versus our fourth quarter ending balance of $16.7 billion due to about $2.1 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends; a pay down of about $1.5 billion for debt that matured in March; as well as about $500 million in additional share repurchases to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations, partially offset by about $3.2 billion in free cash flow generated in the quarter. Free cash flow in the first quarter benefited by about $1.9 billion from changes in working capital driven primarily by the seasonal increase in our deferred merchant bookings balance.\nMoving to our thoughts for the second quarter. We have continued to see stable travel demand trends in our business so far in the second quarter, and our guidance for the quarter assumes a continuation of those trends. However, we recognize the possibility that these trends could be impacted by the increased uncertainty in the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and the subsequent potential effect on consumer spending and behavior, travel patterns or our partners. We'll continue to closely monitor the travel environment for any changes.\nOur guidance also assumes recent FX rates, including the euro-U.S. dollar at $1.14 for the remainder of the quarter. We estimate changes in FX will positively impact our second quarter reported growth rate by about 4 percentage points. We currently expect second quarter room night growth to be between 4% and 6%, which includes a slight headwind from the calendar shift of Easter into April. We currently expect second quarter gross bookings to increase between 10% and 12%, including a couple of percentage points of positive impact from higher flight ticket growth, partially offset by a slight impact from the calendar shift of Easter. We expect constant currency accommodation ADRs will be about flat year-over-year.\nWe currently expect second quarter revenue growth to be between 10% and 12%, including a benefit of about 3 percentage points from the calendar shift of Easter into April. We currently expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion, growing 16% year-over-year at the high end, which includes about 7 percentage points of year-over-year benefit from the Easter shift.\nTurning to the full year 2025. Although we continue to see stable trends globally so far in the second quarter, we recognize that our business could be impacted by the increased uncertainty in the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. Therefore, we are widening the range of our full year expectations for constant currency growth.\nAt this time, we expect constant currency growth of mid- to high single digits for gross bookings and revenue and low to mid-teens for adjusted EPS. The high end of each of these ranges remains in line with our expectations and our long-term growth ambition. We continue to expect leverage in our marketing expenses and adjusted fixed operating expenses due to our disciplined management approach. Additionally, we also continue to expect to make targeted reinvestments across the organization of about $170 million in 2025.\nAt this time, we expect cost currency growth for adjusted EBITDA of high single digits to low double digits, and we expect our adjusted EBITDA margins to expand between 50 and 100 basis points year-over-year. Assuming recent FX rates for the remainder of the year, we estimate changes in FX will positively impact our full year reported growth rates by about 2 percentage points versus the constant currency growth rates I just mentioned.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with our first quarter results and our team's continued execution towards our strategic initiatives. We remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate through the current environment and take advantage of new opportunities based on our low capital intensity, global diversification and strong financial profile of the company. I would like to recognize the success of all our colleagues who are contributing to building a stronger offering for our travelers and partners that will position us well for the long term.\nWith that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines?",

And now, I would like to introduce Booking Holdings' speakers for this afternoon: Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nThank you. Welcome to Booking Holdings' Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report we had a strong finish to 2024, closing out another successful year. I'm even more pleased to report the progress we are making on our long-term strategic plan. In a few days, I will mark my 25th year at this company, a quarter of a century, and I am more excited than ever about our potential. It's an incredible time to be in the travel industry. With the transformative force of AI, particularly generative AI, redefining how people will experience the world. Adapting to and leveraging new technologies has been in our DNA from the start, and generative AI is pushing the pace of technology innovation faster than ever.\nIn this dynamic environment, I am confident that we are well-positioned to deploy this technology to further benefit our travelers and partners, given our legacy of innovation, resources, proprietary data, the global nature of our business, and years of experience with AI. I'll speak more about the AI opportunity shortly, but first, I will briefly cover our financial highlights from the last quarter and the full year. Our fourth quarter room nights exceeded the high end of our prior expectations and grew 13% year-over-year. The improvement in room night growth was seen across all our major regions, each of which grew by double digits in the quarter. The stronger-than-expected room night growth helped drive fourth quarter gross bookings growth of 17% and revenue growth of 14%, both above the high end of our prior guidance ranges.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion was 26% higher than the fourth quarter of 2023 and 12% above the high end of our prior guidance range, driven by revenue outperformance and lower-than-expected adjusted fixed OpEx. Finally, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter grew 30% year-over-year. Looking back at the full year of 2024, I am proud of our achievements, including advancing our Connected Trip vision, further innovating our AI capabilities, expanding our merchant offerings, growing alternative accommodations, and enhancing and expanding our Genius loyalty program. Our achievements in these areas allowed us to deliver even more value to our travelers and supplier partners while also helping to drive our strong financial results for the year. For the full year, gross bookings of $166 billion increased 10% versus 2023, and revenue of $24 billion grew 11% year-over-year.\nWe achieved these strong top-line results while growing our bottom line even faster with adjusted EBITDA of over $8 billion, increasing 17% year-over-year. Finally, adjusted earnings per share was up 23% year-over-year, helped by the 7% reduction in our full year average share count versus last year. I would note that on a constant currency basis, our full year gross bookings revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS all grew about one percentage point faster than the reported growth rates I just mentioned. Our long-term ambition in a normalized travel environment continues to be to grow our annual constant currency gross bookings by at least 8%, to grow our constant currency revenue by at least 8%, and to grow our constant currency adjusted earnings per share by at least 15%. I'm proud to say that we exceeded these growth targets in 2024.\nAt the start of 2025, we continue to see healthy demand for leisure travel globally. Assuming another year of normalized growth for the travel industry, we are targeting full-year constant currency growth rates that would again deliver on our long-term growth ambition for gross bookings, revenue, and adjusted EPS. Given the importance of travel to consumers and the aspirations of people to experience the world, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for the travel industry and believe that we are well-positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. Ewout will provide further details on our fourth quarter results, our expectations for 2025, and our approach to capital returns in his remarks. At Booking Holdings, we have always been driven by innovation.\nFrom the early days of the internet and online travel to being one of the first deployers of large-scale A/B testing, to the advent of the smartphone and consumer adoption of mobile apps, to using sophisticated machine learning models early in our business, we have consistently evolved to meet the needs of travelers and partners. We believe that compelling AI-powered offerings like a travel vertical-specific agent will play a central role in delivering an even more seamless and personalized connected trip experience to travelers. We see the development and use of AI agents and those agents working with other AI agents as a potential way to more quickly bring together the different elements of travel into a truly connected offering on our platform.\nWe are highly focused on the many opportunities with AI and will continue the sophisticated work already happening across our company to integrate generative AI into our offerings, which includes Booking.com's AI Trip Planner and Priceline's AI-powered travel assistant called Penny. In addition, we're pleased to see the work being done at OpenTable with its use of Salesforce's Agentforce platform, while Agoda and KAYAK are making their own generative AI advances. As we continue to incorporate this technology, we are confident that it will enhance our ability to attract and satisfy our travelers as well as our partners who have long relied on our technology advancements to help attract customers and grow their businesses. In addition, we believe generative AI has the potential to drive improvements in operational efficiency, which would contribute to a further deceleration of our fixed expense growth in 2025.\nWhether customer service, partner service, developer productivity, or other areas where we are finding more efficient ways of working, we are already seeing some early benefits, and we plan to continue to build on this. We are also excited to be working with leading generative AI organizations on their agentic developments. These collaborations reflect our commitment to staying at the forefront of this rapidly developing field, and are consistent with our long-standing approach to work with different sources of new customer traffic. With our track record in this area, I am confident in our ability to create value for all participants in this new evolving economic landscape. We expect that agentic models will change the way some bookers discover and use our platforms.\nAnd we believe that working with these models will be another attractive way for us to deliver unique value to our travelers and partners through competitive pricing, loyalty benefits, and rewards, offering of other travel products, high-quality customer service, and an easy and trusted payment process. Given the complexity, expense, and importance of travel to customers, it is critical to deliver value and to continue to be a trusted platform in order to have customers choose to make bookings with us. I'm encouraged to see that we continue to build trust with travelers as evidenced by our growing mix of direct bookings, which was in the mid-60s% of our B2C room nights in 2024. We will continue to learn how customers want to interact with all forms of Gen AI, but I like how we are positioned.\nI'm excited about the changes and benefits that this technology is bringing to us now, and we expect we'll do even more so in the future. Now, focusing a bit more on our Connected Trip vision, we are making steady progress towards simplifying the planning, booking, and travel experience, making it more personalized, seamless, and enjoyable while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We saw Connected Trip transaction growth accelerate to over 45% year-over-year in fourth quarter, and these Connected Trip transactions represented a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions. Flights are an important component in many of the Connected Trips that our travelers book. For the full year, our travelers booked almost 50 million airline tickets across our platforms, which increased 38% year-over-year and had a Gross Bookings value of $13.1 billion.\nWe continue to see this vertical bring new customers to our platforms while delivering a more complete offering to our existing customers, making travel planning and booking easier for them and creating opportunities for us to provide more value to them. We believe that Gen AI, coupled with our data and machine learning capabilities, will enable us to improve our supplier partners' businesses, particularly the small and medium-sized businesses who do not have easy access to these sophisticated technologies. Another foundational component of the Connected Trip vision is our expanding merchant offering at Booking.com. Merchant capabilities offer more flexibility for our travelers and partners while also unlocking the ability to merchandise across verticals.\nThe mix of merchant gross bookings reached 59% of total gross bookings at Booking.com in 2024, an increase of about 9 percentage points year-over-year, which is higher than our expectations at the start of 2024. We are pleased to see that processing transactions through Booking.com's merchant offering generated incremental contribution margin dollars in 2024, though this was still a small percentage of our total adjusted EBITDA. We believe that we are still very early in our fintech journey and expect over the upcoming years to reduce the costs of transactions for our travelers and supplier partners while also contributing to our bottom line. We believe our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com also helps to connect more elements of travel as we extend this program beyond accommodations into other travel verticals. We believe the value this program delivers will promote customer loyalty, frequency, and direct booking behavior.\nWe're encouraged to see more of our travelers moving into our higher Genius tiers of levels two and three, which represent over 30% of our active travelers. These travelers booked a mid-50s % of Booking.com's room nights in 2024. These Genius level two and three travelers have a meaningfully higher direct booking rate and a higher booking frequency than the rest of our travelers. We continue to drive more Genius benefits to our travelers in 2024, and we have seen steady growth in the share of Connected Trip transactions that receive Genius benefits. We believe that all of the Connected Trip elements provide value to our customers, leaving them to choose to book more frequently and directly with us. We are encouraged to see that the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels.\nProviding great supply choices for our travelers is another way we deliver a comprehensive planning and booking experience. In one area we are actively expanding our supply is alternative accommodations. For alternative accommodations at Booking.com, we continue to see year-over-year growth with listings at the end of Q4 reaching 7.9 million, up about 8% from last year. More listings means more accommodation choices for our travelers, which we believe contributed to strong alternative accommodations room night growth of 19% in the fourth quarter, which was an acceleration from 14% growth in the third quarter. We were pleased to see alternative accommodation room night growth accelerate in the quarter across all of our regions.\nWe remain committed to being a trusted and valuable partner to all the accommodation properties on our platforms by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features designed to support the success of these businesses, the majority of which are small independents. Now, I want to briefly discuss our transformation program, and Ewout will provide further details in his commentary. In November 2024, we announced our intention to implement certain organizational changes, including modernizing processes and systems, initiating an expected workforce reduction, optimizing procurement, and seeking real estate savings. We're in the process of reviewing some of these potential workforce reductions with works councils, employee representatives, and other organizations. While workforce reductions in some areas, along with investing in other areas, involve very difficult decisions, we believe that these steps are critical to improve organizational agility and drive greater operating efficiencies.\nReallocating resources across our strategic initiatives in a disciplined manner is a key requirement to maintain global competitiveness. Ultimately, we believe this will help drive stronger and more durable top line and earnings growth over the long term. In conclusion, as I look back over 2024, I am proud of all of the hard work and excellent execution by our teams as they continued to advance our strategic initiatives while delivering strong financial results. These are exciting times for our industry, and I am confident in our company's position and ability to leverage generative AI technology to deliver an even better offering for our travelers and partners. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nCFO, Booking Holdings\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2024 and provide our thoughts for the first quarter and full year of 2025. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting a summary earnings presentation as well as our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the Earnings Call. Now, let's move to our fourth quarter and full year results. Our room nights in the fourth quarter grew 13%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 5 percentage points. The higher-than-expected room night growth was driven by stronger-than-expected performance across all our regions, with the largest impact coming from Europe.\nLooking at our room nights growth by region in the fourth quarter, Europe was up low double digits, Asia was up mid-teens, rest of the world was up about 20%, and the U.S. was up about 10%. We are encouraged by the progress we are making in enhancing the experience for our travelers and partners as we continue to advance our strategic initiatives and build towards our Connected Trip vision. This includes strengthening our offering through alternative accommodations growth, increasing the direct and mobile app mix of our bookings, expanding our Genius loyalty program, and growing our other travel verticals. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our fourth quarter room night growth accelerated to 19% and continued to outpace the overall business. The global mix of alternative accommodation room nights at Booking.com was 33%, which was up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe continue to strengthen our direct relationships with our travelers and increase loyalty on our platforms. For the full year, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range and increased year-over-year. When we exclude our B2B business, our full year B2C direct mix was in the mid-60% range, which is an improvement from the low 60% range in 2023. The mobile app mix of our total fourth quarter room nights was in the mid-50% range, which was up from the low 50% range in 2023. We continue to see that the significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel.\nFor our Genius loyalty program, the mix of Booking.com room nights booked by travelers in the higher Genius tiers of levels two and three was in the mid-50% range in 2024, and this mix increased year-over-year. In our other travel verticals, about 14 million airline tickets were booked across our platforms in the fourth quarter. Airline ticket growth in the fourth quarter was 52%, driven by the continued growth of our flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda, and accelerated from the 39% growth in the third quarter. Fourth quarter gross bookings increased 17% year-over-year and increased about 18% on a constant currency basis, which was approximately 5 percentage points higher than the 13% room night growth due to a few percentage points from higher flight bookings growth and an increase in constant currency accommodation ADRs of about 2%.\nThe year-over-year ADR increase was impacted by a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 3% versus the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in gross bookings exceeded the high end of our guidance by 8 percentage points due to stronger-than-expected room night growth, as well as stronger-than-expected constant currency accommodation ADRs and flight ticket growth, partially offset by about 1 percentage point of impact from changes in FX. Fourth quarter revenue of $5.5 billion grew 14% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 5 percentage points. Constant currency revenue growth was about 15%. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings of 14.7% was lower than expected due to impacts from timing and a higher mix of flight bookings.\nThe timing impact was driven by the acceleration in bookings in fourth quarter, as well as a booking window that was more extended in the quarter than expected. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was also lower than fourth quarter 2023 due to impacts from timing and an increased mix of flight bookings, partially offset by increased revenues associated with payments. We expect the impact from timing in fourth quarter will benefit our revenue in 2025. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 10% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 4.2%, about 30 basis points better than fourth quarter 2023 due to lower brand marketing expense and higher direct mix, partially offset by higher spend in social media channels at attractive incremental ROIs.\nFourth quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 2.0%, in line with last year despite a higher merchant mix, as higher payment expenses were offset by efficiencies in customer service. Adjusted fixed operating expenses were up 9% year-over-year, which was better than expected due primarily to lower IT and G&A expenses. Throughout this year, we have been very focused on carefully managing the growth of our fixed expenses. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion grew 26% year-over-year and was 12% above the high end of our guidance range, largely driven by the higher revenue and also by the better-than-expected adjusted fixed operating expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.8% in the fourth quarter was up versus last year by about 320 basis points due primarily to leverage from adjusted fixed operating expenses and marketing expenses.\nAdjusted EPS of $41.55 per share was up 30% and benefited from a 5% lower average share count than the fourth quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter and was impacted by a mark-to-market adjustment to the conversion option premium of our convertible note due May 2025. This was mostly offset by FX remeasurement gains on our Eurobonds. Both items were excluded from our adjusted results. When looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our 2024 room nights grew 9% year-over-year. On a regional basis, we saw full year room night growth from Europe up high single digits, Asia was up mid-teens, rest of the world was up high single digits, and the U.S. was up mid-single digits.\nEuropean bookers represented about half of the room nights booked in 2024, Asian bookers were about a quarter, and U.S. bookers were a low double-digits percentage. The growth in room nights helped drive increases in gross bookings, revenue, and adjusted EPS that were above our long-term annual growth ambition. Our full-year gross bookings and revenue increased 10% and 11% respectively, and both growth rates were about 1 percentage point higher on the constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.3% in 2024, which was up slightly versus 14.2% in 2023 due to a positive impact from increased revenues associated with payments, mostly offset by an increased mix of flights. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be stable year-over-year.\nMarketing as a percentage of gross bookings in 2024 was 4.4%, down slightly from 4.5% in 2023, driven by higher direct mix, lower brand marketing expenses, and higher performance marketing ROIs, partially offset by higher spend in social media, which became a more significant channel for us in 2024. Our full year Adjusted Fixed Operating Expenses were up 8% versus 2023, which was better than our expectation for low to mid-teens growth at the start of 2024 and was a source of leverage due to many management actions taken throughout the year. Our full year Adjusted EBITDA was more than $8 billion, which was up 17% year-over-year and up about 18% on a Constant Currency basis. We are proud to have generated $1.2 billion more Adjusted EBITDA than in 2023, delivering profitable growth and expanding margins while investing in strategic initiatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 35%, which was 170 basis points higher than our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2023 and ahead of our expectations at the start of the year. Our adjusted EBITDA margins, along with every other profit metric that we report, include the impact of stock-based compensation expense, as this is a very real cost of doing business. Our full year adjusted EPS was over $187 per share, which was up 23% year-over-year and up about 24% on a constant currency basis. Our full year average share count was 7% lower than in 2023 due to the impact of our share repurchase program. Now on to our cash and liquidity position.\nOur fourth quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.7 billion was up versus our third quarter ending balance of $16.3 billion due to about $1.9 billion of debt raised in November and about $650 million in free cash flow generated in the quarter, partially offset by about $1.4 billion of capital return, including share repurchases and dividends. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter was pressured by about $825 million from changes in working capital, driven primarily by the seasonal reduction in our deferred merchant bookings balance. For the full year, we repurchased about $6 billion of stock and paid out $1.2 billion in quarterly cash dividends. Since restarting our repurchase program in early 2022, we have repurchased almost $23 billion of stock, or 21% of our shares outstanding at the start of 2022. We ended 2024 with about $7.7 billion remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization.\nAs we look ahead, we remain focused on strategically investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings. We are pleased to announce today that our Board of Directors approved a new $20 billion share repurchase authorization, along with a 10% increase to our quarterly cash dividends per share. These actions reflect our confidence in our earnings power, strong free cash flow generation, and our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. Moving to our thoughts for first quarter, we expect a comparison to the extra day in February 2024 to be about 1 percentage point headwind to our first quarter growth rates.\nAlso, we expect a calendar shift of Easter from March 2024 to April 2025 to be a small tailwind to room nights and gross bookings growth, and a larger headwind to revenue and profitability growth in first quarter. We expect first quarter room night growth to be between 5% and 7%, which includes a slight benefit from the calendar shift of Easter into April. We expect first quarter gross bookings to increase between 5% and 7%, which includes about 4 percentage points of impact from changes in FX, offset by about 2 percentage points of positive impact from higher flight ticket growth, about 1% higher constant currency accommodation ADRs, and a slight benefit from the calendar shift of Easter.\nWe expect first quarter revenue growth to be between 2% and 4%, which includes a headwind of about 3 percentage points from changes in FX and about 3 percentage points from the calendar shift of Easter into April. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $800 million and $850 million, down 5% year-over-year at the high end, which includes about 14 percentage points of year-over-year impact from the Easter shift and about 2 percentage points of impact from changes in FX. Note that historically, first quarter is our seasonally lowest EBITDA quarter for the year. Normalizing for the impacts of Easter timing, changes in FX, and the leap year, our expectation for our first quarter growth bookings, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA is for low double digits growth at the high end of each of those ranges.\nTurning to the full year 2025, we're targeting full year constant currency growth rates that would reach our long-term growth ambition of at least 8% growth for gross bookings and revenue, and 15% growth for Adjusted Earnings Per Share. We believe we are well positioned to achieve these levels of growth given the investments we have made to build a stronger foundation for our business and a better product offering for our travelers and partners. At recent FX rates, we expect changes in FX will impact our reported growth rates by about 3 percentage points for gross bookings and revenue, and by about 3.5 percentage points for Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS. As a result, we expect full year reported gross bookings and revenue to increase mid-single digits, and on a constant currency basis to both increase high single digits. We expect to drive leverage in our marketing expenses.\nAdditionally, we expect revenue to grow faster than adjusted fixed operating expenses in line with our prior commitment for 2025, which we communicated at the start of last year. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow a couple of percentage points faster than revenue and on a constant currency basis to increase low double digits. We expect to continue to expand our adjusted EBITDA margins in 2025 and deliver margin growth slightly below 100 basis points. We expect our full year adjusted EPS to grow low double digits and on a constant currency basis to grow mid-teens. Finally, we remain focused on managing our capital expenditures, and we expect that CapEx will be about 2% of revenue, similar to 2024.\nTurning to our new transformation program, which we announced in November, our intention is to implement certain organizational changes to reduce complexity and increase agility, which we estimate will ultimately produce annual run rate cost reductions of approximately $400 million to $450 million versus our 2024 expense base, and we expect the majority of these savings to be realized after 2025. By the end of 2024, we have already actioned over $35 million in run rate savings. We estimate the aggregate transformation cost that we will incur over the coming two to three years to be similar to the expected annual run rate savings. In order to provide transparency, we will report these costs separately in a transformation cost expense line, and we expect that certain of these costs will be excluded from our adjusted results.\nEmbedded in our full year 2025 guidance is about $150 million in cost savings related to the transformation program, the majority of which we expect to be in variable cost. Beyond the transformation program, we expect to drive additional efficiencies in our ongoing operations. With the capacity created by these savings and efficiencies, we are reinvesting about $170 million above our baseline investments in 2025 to support our strategic priorities for long-term value creation while still expanding our adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. These investments will be in areas such as progressing our Gen AI capabilities, advancing our Connected Trip vision, and expanding our fintech offering. We see the potential for these investments to contribute incremental revenue growth in future years and deliver attractive returns. In conclusion, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results and our outlook for the first quarter and the full year of 2025.\nWe're excited about our long-term vision for the Connected Trip and enhancing our offering through technological advancements such as generative AI. Thank you to all of my colleagues across the company for their amazing work and dedication to drive new product offerings, tech innovation, speed and agility, and deliver value to our shareholders, travelers, and partners. With that, we'll now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you'd like to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered and you would like to remove yourself from the queue, press star followed by the number one. Your first question is from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank.\n\nLee Horowitz\n\nCo-head of Internet Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question. Maybe starting with Glenn and Ewout there. Hi, thanks for the details on all the products you guys have rolling out there. But I guess, how do you contextualize the risks associated with perhaps greater competition from agentic platforms? We have massive buckets of investment aimed at building functional AI agents that could circumvent listings on Booking and go direct to hotels. Any more thoughts that would be helpful? And then one follow-up, if I could.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nSure. Hi, Lee. Thanks for the question. I'm not surprised by it. I've been here now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, have been here almost 25 years. And it's been a rare time that somebody hasn't brought to me the thought that we were going to be disintermediated, that someone else was going to take away our business. At first, it was the hotels. We're going to build their websites and people go direct there.\nAnd it was Google was going to get rid of us, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So it does not surprise me that new technology comes out and people are asking an appropriate question: How is that going to impact your business? And are you still going to be able to achieve what you've been able to achieve for a quarter of a century? And I would say one of the great things about this company is our ability to evolve, adapt, use all of our resources, our technological knowledge, the tremendous ability of our people, our capital. In terms of Agentic AI, one of the important things is data. It's something that I think about a lot, as do many, many people in the management team, of how can we change so we make sure that we are the winner of these new technologies.\nOne of the things we mentioned about was coming up with a travel vertical-specific agent, having a model that's domain-specific. There are a lot of different things we're working on. I'm not going to spell out all of the playbook and how we will make sure that we maintain this lead in the industry. But I recognize the question, and I say that we will be able to do it not only by ourselves, but we also, as I mentioned, and we've talked about this in the past, that we're working with all of the major players in the Valley and elsewhere, that we are working together to do things that would be better as togetherness instead of trying to do separately.\nI believe that past is a good example of being able to adapt and continue to go forward and create something that is even better than it was in the past. I'm incredibly excited about this new world of AI, generative AI, Agentic AI Models. All of these things are incredible opportunities for someone like us that has the ability to actually turn it into something that is better than it was before. So I hear you, Lee. I hear that question. It's not new, but I believe we will be a winner in this. Anything else?\n\nLee Horowitz\n\nCo-head of Internet Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHelpful Glenn.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nyeah.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nCFO, Booking Holdings\n\nLet me build on the answer that Glenn gave with one other perspective. As we all know, these developers of large language models are spending an incredible amount of capital expenditures. They have choices. One choice could be, are they trying to figure out the complexity of travel themselves? Or what is probably more likely is partnering with us, as they are already doing today, because we are able to give them very clear monetization opportunities, which, of course, is going to be very important in order to prove that there will be very sound returns on these very large CapEx numbers. So really, the economic argument on top of all the arguments that Glenn has mentioned is very important from our perspective as well.\n\nLee Horowitz\n\nCo-head of Internet Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nMakes sense. Thanks. And maybe just to follow up on alternative accommodations, I guess it's fairly clear you guys are a share gainer at this point. I wonder if you can maybe unpack a bit more on a regional basis. Where have you seen the biggest contributions to your sort of consistent teens' growth rate and your alternative accommodations business in 2024? What regions do you perhaps expect to invest most behind in 2025? And what do you think is resonating so strongly with the consumer that allows you guys to really outpace the competitors at this point?\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nCFO, Booking Holdings\n\nYeah. Lee, I think a brief answer on that question. The first part is we see higher growth in alternative accommodations in all the regions in the world compared to the traditional accommodations. And the second part of your question is, why are we growing so fast? I think that has to do with the total proposition that we offer. Really great supply, expansion of the proposition in terms of accommodations that we can offer to travelers, and most importantly, that we have traditional accommodations and alternative accommodations together on the platform, and travelers can compare and ultimately pick the best option in their particular situation. What we're hearing back is that is absolutely something that travelers like, that we have that all combined on our platform. So that was a couple of the reasons why we are growing faster, really the quality of our platform and our product.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nYou know, that's a good opportunity to do a shout-out to the team who has done such wonderful work for so long now. I mean, to 14 out of the last 15 quarters, to be the leader in the space, and it's not because we're small. I mean, our homes area in terms of a room night number, and you compare it to the leader, we're more than 2/3, potentially a lot more than 2/3. You don't really know because the number one puts their experiences and their room nights together, but it's at least 2/3. So it's not like we're tiny. So it's really just wonderful, the incredible ability of us to come from what was something that a lot of people didn't think we'd be able to do, and achieve something that is now a competitive product.\n\nLee Horowitz\n\nCo-head of Internet Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHelpful. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Let's see. I'd like to ask about airlines and then operator. On the airlines, that growth you had, you talked about it a little bit on the call, but that's, I think, the fastest growth you've had in, I don't know, a year and a half or something like that. So maybe just talk about the growth going forward, like how much higher you think the attach rate could be, or how many more markets do you still have the airline offering to roll out in? Just give us a sense of what inning we are in terms of the growth of airline as a product in the booking portfolio. And then could you talk a little bit about the operator experience you have? Anything you'd disclose on the economics? How did that partnership come together, and what do you expect to get out of that going forwards? Thank you very much.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nSure. Hi, Mark. It's Glenn. Yeah, very excited about those flight numbers. 52% growth, and it was an acceleration from the previous quarter, 39%. I looked back, it was even acceleration from the quarter before. So I think it's really nice to see that trend. I do not think anybody should be projecting in a linear way that it's just going to continue to increase and accelerate, accelerate, accelerate. That obviously is not going to happen. But I do believe that we will continue to maintain a strong growth in our flight business, and it's not just by adding more markets. I don't think there's a lot to be done in that area that's going to do a lot. What it is, is providing a better service to the traveler.\nSo the traveler wants to use us versus all the other ways they can do a flight, and that includes bringing it together, part of our Connected Trip, giving them all the other types of value that we can provide. And it's not just giving them a hotel, and it's not just giving them perhaps a discount in terms of ground transportation from the airport, or insurance, or attraction. It's creating something that really is different, something that provides a value that the traveler has always wanted, and that is that travel agent in your pocket. And that travel agent in your pocket lives in the phone. And the idea is that this connected trip, which many people, when they start their travel planning, starts with a flight. So we want to get them in, but once they're in, give them a lot more value.\nThen, of course, they're telling other people that this is something new and actually a much better way to do it. That's the idea, and that's how we maintain a strong growth rate in all of our verticals, not just flights. That's what we're going to do. Now, in terms of Operator, very, very early. I don't think we're going to disclose any economics, and I'll be perfectly honest with you, as you may not be surprised. I don't think there'd be much to talk about in that area right now. This is an area, though, that has just started and just learning how it works. What is the purpose of it? It's working with a very respected partner who knows a lot about AI. We know a lot about the travel industry. How can we do things together that'd be mutually beneficial to both of us?\nAnd we'll learn. Look, you go way back, and again, I'm going back in the past. I look at our site from 1999 and 2000. My God, it was horrible. It's amazing anybody bought anything back then. Now this thing too, it's not the easiest. I've used it. It's a little clunky and stuff, but it will get better and we'll improve and build upon it. Got to start somewhere, and we already started.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nAll right. Thanks, Glenn.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Glenn, I have one on agentic for you. Just want to ask a question. So when you think about partnering with some of these other players like Operator or maybe Gemini or any of the emerging potential next-generation travel players, you give them access to your differentiated supply. How do you sort of think about managing the long-term risk that a larger percentage of people and travelers could start using those products the next three, five, 10 years as opposed to going direct to you, and it potentially has a negative impact on your overall mix between paid and direct traffic?\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nWell, that is obviously something that people think about when you're putting together an agreement of any type with anyone in terms of what you're going to maintain proprietary to yourself, what you're going to be able to share with someone else to use, how the economic powers between the parties is going to work. Lots of things to still work out. That is something that's going to be a negotiation with a lot of the different parties involved in this, and we'll see how it plays out. I will say the obvious, that we are aware of the issues that you bring up. I do believe there are going to be different ways to come together so that different parties in this new world of agentic AI, in that ecosystem, there'll be ways for lots of players to do well.\nI'm just pleased to be in the position we are with all the data we have, with the resources we have, the people we have, the worldwide network of consumers who trust us, which is also a very big deal. People, when they're putting together travel for a lot of people, it's a lot of money to them, and they don't do it often enough that they're just willing to just throw it at anybody. They want to do it with somebody they trust. So we have the advantage of having a brand that is trusted. All those things together help us in terms of the discussions with other players who have other expertise to bring. And I am positive that we are in a very, very good position for this going forward. And Ewout, you may have some more.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nCFO, Booking Holdings\n\nYeah. And Brian, one other perspective to think of is the following. So with multiple agents that are going to be developed, and we will see many, many agents by many developers over time, horizontal agents, vertical agents, very task-specific agents. For us, that actually, from an economics perspective, will create an advantage because think about the cost of acquisition. If there are many parties and many providers working together with them, it will give us some advantage in terms of cost acquisition that will come down from where we are today. So actually, with all the partnerships that we're building, all the relationships, plus our own travel-specific vertical agents that we're developing over time, we believe that actually this could help us very much from an overall economics perspective for the company.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen.\n\nKevin Kopelman\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. Could you give us your updated thoughts on your interest or lack of interest in larger M&A deals given recent activity in the space? Thanks.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nWell, as you know, we don't discuss about M&A except when we have a transaction to discuss. And we'll just keep it the way I've said in every single one of the 33 Conference Calls. This is the same one, same answers. We don't comment on M&A.\n\nKevin Kopelman\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Can I ask about ad costs? You mentioned that you're expecting leverage this year. Could you give us more color there on the trends you're seeing? Is it safe to assume that direct traffic you expect to continue to go up? And if you could touch on what you're doing with your brand spend, you mentioned it was down, and also merchandising. Thanks.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nCFO, Booking Holdings\n\nAbsolutely, Kevin. We expect marketing leverage to continue for the full year 2025, driven by the same trends that you have seen in the more recent past. More direct traffic is clearly a benefit overall. Higher performance marketing ROIs that we are able to achieve based on all the optimization algorithms that we are running, where the company has built so much expertise over time. Then I would very much like to call out also how excited we are about the development of social media channels. This is a big area of investment for us. We have invested a lot of our technology in this space and expertise working together with some of the large social media channels, particularly Meta, where we have built a very close relationship.\nI don't want to say too much about that from a competitive perspective, but this is very much a bespoke model where both teams of both companies have built a very effective way how we can monetize their leads and our leads because this is really based on both remarketing and prospecting that comes from both sides, as well as very personalized creative content in terms of feeds. So incremental ROIs that you can measure with respect to social media channels is something that is new, but we have been able to find out, figure out how to do that. So therefore, we are very confident that this is not ultimately a traveler that would have booked anyhow with us, but is really an incremental traveler that comes to us, and therefore we're spending much more at attractive incremental ROI. So the combination of all of that means that we are very positive and enthusiastic about the outlook with respect to continued marketing leverage for the company.\n\nKevin Kopelman\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Stephen. Your next question is from Stephen Ju with UBS.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, great. Thank you. So Glenn, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on your thoughts on AI. I think I heard in your prepared remarks about products that can help drive more revenue. And on the other side, other products that can help in cost avoidance. So as we talk to other companies, it seems like the cost avoidance part seems easier to deliver, and things that might help revenue may take some more effort. So where do you see yourself positioned in terms of when we can start seeing, I guess, noticeable impact to either the top or bottom line? Thanks.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings",
    "content2": "That's a very good question. I'm going to talk a little bit. I'm going to let Ewout add what he wants to disclose in terms of what we're already seeing in terms of some of the benefits. Let's start with the cost avoidance part. Last call, we talked a little bit about what we were seeing in benefits in customer service. Clearly, an area where there's great opportunity for anybody who has a large customer service operation to achieve significant savings.\nEven something as simple as a CS agent that has to do a summarization at the end of the call. Well, right away you have someone that can do it automatically, thereby making the amount of time the agent is spending not talking to a customer, but summarizing goes away. Simple example, but there's so many about that. And then think not just in terms of the cost there, but this is an important one, is there are a few things that are as frustrating as having to wait on hold to get in touch with a customer service agent. The wonderful thing as we develop AI capabilities and customer services, we won't be waiting for somebody to answer the phone. The agent will be answering the phone.\nIn fact, one of the things that we mentioned in the call, it's not a big thing for our income statement, but I like saying it is OpenTable in the interactions they're doing with Salesforce in their Agentforce and coming up with some things that are very helpful in that area. So that's just one area. Of course, you have the coding efficiencies that everybody talks about. You get hopefully some significant benefits down the road as our developers are able to do a lot more work in the same amount of time. And they're all different areas. So I'm not sure what Ewout is going to want to talk in terms of numbers for that. I'll let him say how much he wants to disclose or not.\nOn the revenue side, yeah, it is going to be a little slower in showing up in terms of increases, but it's great to see what we're already doing. Again, it's the benefit of having the knowledge, the expertise, and the resources to do this. I mean, one of the things when you're not involved in the industry is you're not as knowledgeable about the complexity of travel. It's not just simply you press a button and you get a booking. I mean, even things as simple as the regulatory world that you have to deal with to make sure if you're using AI, it's not like the travel rules you have to worry about. You got to worry about the legal things with AI. For example, in Europe, there's the EU AI Act. You got to make sure anything you're building is going to fit that.\nAnd then it's obviously the context, awareness, and data knowledge of travel. The great thing of having the incredible amount of data we have, really understanding what works, what doesn't work, and being able to put that into a database that can then be used by a generative AI model, that's an advantage. I can go on and on. I won't use it all the time. But I just see, yeah, it's going to be a little slower perhaps than the cost savings, but that revenue opportunity is huge. And Ewout, I don't know what you want to disclose.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nCFO, Booking Holdings\n\nSteve, I would like actually more to point at actual numbers than to speak about some percentage of savings that sometimes is being mentioned. But then, of course, the question is, where does it actually show up in the results? So let me first point you to our sales and other expenses for the fourth quarter. What you see here is that those were flat as a percentage of gross bookings, around 2% of gross bookings compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Underneath, what is happening there is with the growth of our merchant bookings, we have higher payment-related expenses, but that is offset by efficiencies in our customer service.\nSo the fact that we have basically flat S&O expenses as a percentage of gross bookings despite the growing merchant business is a clear point in our results that has already seen the advantage of generative AI in terms of actual efficiencies. The other example that I can give is that in terms of the transformation program savings in year 2025 of $150 million, a meaningful part of that is already coming from efficiencies that we will be able to achieve with generative AI in multiple parts of the company. So it is already clearly showing up in our numbers in the fourth quarter, as well as the savings target that we have for 2025.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question of the day will come from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Glenn, I'd like to comment a little bit more on the merchant mix shift. Obviously, faster growth for merchant bookings. Can you talk a little bit about how that might translate to higher margins or better royalty, better repeat rates, and just how that's kind of transforming your business over time? And then I'd love to ask about room nights. Obviously, some decline in Q1, but you seem very confident on the year. So were some of those nights borrowed in Q4? And then maybe talk about summer booking pacings if you can. Thank you.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nSure, Justin. I'll take the first, and then I'll let Ewout take the second. On the first one, when we first started the merchant program, Booking.com, there was a lot of question of why are we getting out of an agency model that seems so simple, so clean, and why are you doing that? And one of the key things right from the get-go was to achieve the Connected Trip vision. You need to have that foundational platform in payments. Very, very important. We have that now. Obviously, it's the numbers you're just mentioning.\nThey continue to increase in terms of the share of the total amount of our bookings. That's very important in terms of being able to give benefits to our customers. It's also very important for giving them the way they want to pay. Some of them want to pay in one way. Some want to pay in another way. A lot of people who aren't international don't understand that a lot of people don't use Visa. They don't use Mastercard. They have their own way to pay. And the traveler on the other side, the supplier on the other side doesn't really want to take the payment the way the traveler wants to give it. So, for example, the easy example is out of China, somebody's using Alipay. The small hotel in France doesn't take Alipay.\nFortunately, we, as that person in the middle with that merchant payment, we can do that. So it makes it a win-win for everybody. And it can be less expensive given the FX charges, the interchange charges, etc. There's money to be made for all of us. It's cheaper for the traveler. It's cheaper for the supplier, and we can make money in the middle. That's one example. But then you come up with new products, new things that we've talked about. And Ewout, as mentioned, the paying your own currency type thing. There are lots of different things. Here's the thing. So we said we did $166 billion of total transaction value in 2024. Now, not all of that was done on payments. Some of it was agency, but it's continued to grow up as our total volume continues to increase. The question is, what percentage of that?\nHow many basis points? What should we be able to get out of that as profit? And I'll let everybody else make their own guesses and estimates on that. But there's a lot of way. There's a lot of way to make some very good returns at the same time providing better services to both sides of the marketplace. And Ewout, you can follow up on his room nights question.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nCFO, Booking Holdings\n\nJustin, let me first zoom out a little bit for our guidance with respect to first quarter, and then I will give you a more specific answer with respect to room nights. So first, let me point out for forst quarter, normalized, and it means normalized for the impacts of Easter, FX, and leap year, we are having guidance that shows low double-digit growth with respect to gross bookings, revenue, and EBITDA, low double-digit growth. So specifically on room nights, there are a few elements why it's 5%-7%. Looking first back to fourth quarter 2024, the comms were a little bit easier in fourth quarter, particularly due to the effect of the October 7th in 2023 attacks. So that drove a little bit of the higher growth and also the expansion of the booking window.\nThen we have for first quarter of this year a little bit of headwinds from the impact of the leap year compared to a year ago. So those are a couple of specific elements why we are guided to 5%-7%. But as I said, normalized, we think it's going to be a really good quarter. And again, for the full year guidance, what you see is on a constant currency basis, we're hitting our long-term algorithm for the company. So coming out of a, I think, fantastic quarter for the company with a lot of momentum, we're very encouraged about the outlook for the year, and we see a lot of underlying healthy trends for the company.\n\nJustin Post\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now hand today's call back over to Glenn.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO and President, Booking Holdings\n\nThank you. So I just want to say I thank our partners, our customers, our dedicated employees, and our stockholders. We are truly grateful for everyone's support as we work towards realizing our company's long-term vision. Thank you very much, and good night.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

A copy of Booking Holdings earnings press release together with an accompanying financial and statistical supplement is available in the For Investors section of Booking Holdings website www.bookingholdings.com, and now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nThank you and welcome to Booking Holdings second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO Ewout Steenbergen. I am proud to report second quarter results that exceeded the high end of our expectations for room nights and revenue. The upside on revenue combined with lower than expected Fixed OpEx growth help drive Adjusted EBITDA above the high end of our prior guidance range. As expected, the travel market has continued to normalize, and we are pleased with the strength of our underlying business.\nMoving to our key metrics in the second quarter, our travelers booked 287 million room nights across our platforms, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Revenue of $5.9 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion both increased 7% year-over-year. Finally, Adjusted Earnings Per Share grew 11% year-over-year, helped by our strong capital return program which reduced our average share count by 7% year-over-year.\nIn line with our expectations. We saw that the booking window expanded less in the second quarter relative to the first quarter which negatively impacted room nights growth compared to Q1. From a regional perspective, we observed a mild moderation of travel market growth in Europe. However, we believe we are continuing to perform well relative to the market in Europe. Looking at our other regions, we continue to see high growth levels in Asia, and a slight improvement in growth in the U.S.\nAs we look ahead to the third quarter, we believe room night growth will be impacted by a booking window that expands less than it did in second quarter as well as by the more moderate market growth we have seen in Europe where our growth has remained stable from May through July. We expect that this will result in some deceleration in room night growth compared to second quarter. Ewout will provide further details on our second quarter results and our thoughts about the third quarter.\nI remain confident in the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry, our competitive position over the long-term, and our long-term growth and earnings model. We remain focused on what is important for the business for the long-term which means continuing to execute against our strategic initiatives while simultaneously taking actions to drive more cost efficiency in the business.\nWe continue to see progress across several important initiatives which include advancing our Connected Trip vision, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, continuing to develop our AI capabilities, growing Alternative Accommodations, and enhancing our Genius loyalty program. These initiatives all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a better planning, booking, and travel experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners.\nWe believe that continuing to drive benefits to our supplier partners is critical to successfully operating a growing two-sided marketplace. We are encouraged to see healthy second quarter year-over-year growth in the number of supply partners working with us at Booking.com. We are focused on being a trusted and valuable partner by delivering incremental travel demand and developing products and features to help support these accommodation properties, the majority of which are small and independent businesses.\nWe believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners and supporting those partners across macroeconomic cycles contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. Our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com continues to benefit from having more listings available for travelers to choose from. At the end of second quarter our global alternative accommodation listings were about 7.8 million, which is about 11% higher than second quarter last year. We believe this greater selection of listings is contributing to the increasing mix of alternative accommodation room nights booked on our platform.\nWe continue to make incremental enhancements to our alternative accommodation offering for both our travelers and supply partners. For our travelers, we are focused on successfully delivering a better planning, booking, and travel experience over time, which we believe will lead travelers to choose to book directly and more frequently with us. At Booking.com, we are continuing to grow the number of total active travelers, with repeat travelers growing at an even faster rate. In terms of direct booking behavior, we are pleased to see that the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels.\nAs I've stated before, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in paid marketing channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms, so long as we're able to do this at attractive ROIs. In addition, I'm encouraged by the work our team at Booking.com is doing to increase our spend on social media in a disciplined manner, which is an effort that helps to further diversify the channels we utilize while reaching our travelers on platforms they are actively using.\nOur Genius loyalty program. Booking.com plays an important role in helping to drive more travelers to choose to book directly with us over time. We see a meaningfully higher direct booking mix for Genius users versus other users, and that direct mix percentage steps up at each higher level of Genius status. We are encouraged to see continued success in more of our travelers moving into the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3, which now represent nearly 30% of our active travelers. In addition to a higher direct booking rate, we also see higher booking frequencies from our Genius Level 2 and 3 travelers when compared to our overall business.\nIn second quarter we drove more Genius benefits to our travelers with a 15% year-over-year increase in benefits. This is primarily driven by accommodation bookings. However, we are seeing growth in benefits in the other elements of travel as well, with triple-digit growth in Genius discounts for car rental off of a small base last year and continued testing of Genius benefits for flights. In addition to these benefits, bookings in travel verticals outside of accommodations contribute to a traveler's Genius level tier.\nWe will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers, and we know that Genius is a win-win with our supplier partners, enabling them to get incremental demand when they want it, which is one reason more of our supplier partners are electing to participate. On the Connected Trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make the planning, booking, and travel experience easier, more personal, and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners.\nIn order to achieve the easier, more personalized experience of the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of this vision. Our teams of AI experts continue to draw on their valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years as they work to further incorporate this technology into our platforms. We believe our proprietary data along with our resources of scale position us well to build compelling AI-powered offerings over time.\nAnother foundational element of a connected trip is the merchant offering that we continue to expand at Booking.com. Merchant capabilities will help bring the different elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience while also unlocking the ability to merchandise across verticals. The mix of merchant gross bookings reached 58% of total gross bookings at Booking.com in second quarter, which is an increase of 10 percentage points year-over-year and is higher than our prior expectations.\nWe are pleased to see that processing transactions through Booking.com's merchant offering generated incremental contribution margin dollars in the quarter, though this was still a small percentage of our total adjusted EBITDA. We continue to see growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by about 45% year-over-year in second quarter and continue to represent a high single digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions.\nWe believe by providing a better overall booking experience, travelers may choose to book more trips with us with a higher likelihood of booking directly in the future. Flights are an important component for many of the connected trips that our travelers are booking. In second quarter, air tickets booked on our platform increased 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering as well as strong growth in Agoda's flight business.\nWe continue to see a healthy number of new customers coming to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services offered on our platform. In conclusion, we continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry. We are positive about our future and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nThank you Glenn and good afternoon. I will now review our results for the second quarter and provide our thoughts for the third quarter and the full year. All growth rates on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. Now let's move to our second quarter results.\nOur room nights in the second quarter grew 7% which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. As expected, we saw room nights' growth moderate from the first quarter as we saw less year-over-year expansion of the booking window in the second quarter. Looking at our room night growth by region in the second quarter Europe was up mid single digits, Asia was up mid-teens, rest of world was up high single digits, and the U.S. was up mid single digits.\nWe continue to grow our Alternative Accommodations business faster than our overall business. For our Alternative Accommodations at Booking.com, our second quarter room nights growth was 12%, and the global mix of room nights was 36%, which was up 2 percentage points from second quarter 2023. We continue to see encouraging progress in strengthening direct relationships with our travelers and increasing loyalty on our platforms. Over the last four quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range, and when we exclude our B2B business, was in the low-60% range. We've seen both of these mixes continue to increase year-over-year.\nMobile app mix of our total room nights was about 53%, which was up 6 percentage points from second quarter 2023. We continue to see that a significant majority of bookings received from our mobile apps come through the direct channel. For our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com, we continue to see a year-over-year increase in the mix of room nights booked by travelers in the higher Genius tiers of levels 2 and 3. These members booked more than half of the room nights over the past four quarters.\nOutside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in second quarter increase 28%, about in line with our expectations, driven by the continued growth of flight offerings of Booking.com and Agoda. Second quarter gross bookings increased 4%, which was approximately 3 percentage points lower than the 7% room night growth due to about 2 percentage points of negative impact from changes in FX and about 1% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs.\nThe year-over-year ADR decline was negatively impacted by a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were about flat versus 2023. While room night growth was above the high end of our guidance range, gross bookings growth came in at the midpoint of our range due to about 2% lower constant currency accommodation ADRs versus our expectation. In addition, our gross bookings were negatively impacted by lower flight ticket prices, in line with the recent trends we have heard from many airlines.\nSecond quarter revenue of $5.9 billion grew 7% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 1 percentage point. Revenue growth was negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points from the change in Easter timing, and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, revenue would have grown about 11%. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.1%, which was slightly higher than expected due to a timing benefit as we saw gross bookings growth decelerate in the quarter and a less expanded booking window than expected. Additionally, revenue associated with payments was higher than expected.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 8% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 4.7%, about 15 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2023 due primarily to the timing of brand marketing spend as well as increased spend in social media channels. Second quarter adjusted sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.9%, about 15 basis points higher than last year due to a higher merchant mix and higher transaction taxes.\nOur core fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 5% and were below our expectations across all three line items, personnel, G&A, and IT. We're very focused on carefully managing the growth of our core fixed expenses and are taking actions to help improve our operating leverage in future quarters. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion was above our expectations, largely driven by higher revenue and lower than expected fixed expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 7% despite approximately 5 percentage points of pressure from Easter timing and 2 percentage points from changes in FX. Adjusting for these two items, adjusted EBITDA would have grown about 14%. When looking at our adjusted EBITDA margins for the first half of 2024, which neutralizes the impact of the Easter timing shift, we're pleased to see 160 basis points of margin expansion versus the first half of 2023. Adjusted net income of over $1.4 billion was up 3% slower than the growth in adjusted EBITDA due primarily to higher income tax expenses which was impacted by some discrete items.\nAdjusted EPS of $41.90 per share was up 11% and benefited from a 7% lower average share count than second quarter 2023. On a GAAP basis, net income was over $1.5 billion in second quarter. Now, on to our cash and liquidity position. Our second quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.8 billion was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $16.4 billion due to about $2.4 billion of free cash flow generated in the quarter, partially offset by about $1.9 billion of capital return including share repurchases and dividends.\nMoving to our thoughts for third quarter. We expect third quarter room night growth to be between 3% and 5%, a sequential deceleration as we expect the third quarter to benefit less from a year-over-year expansion of the booking window than we saw in the second quarter. For the third quarter we expect the booking window to be more similar to last year. Additionally, we have seen a mild moderation in the market growth in Europe over the last couple of months, though our growth in Europe has remained stable from May through July and we believe we continue to perform well relative to the market.\nWe expect third quarter gross bookings growth to be between 2% and 4%, slightly below room night growth due to about one percentage point of negative impact from changes in FX. We expect constant currency ADRs to be down slightly year-over-year and for this to be offset by a slight benefit from flight bookings growth. While we continue to expect growth in flight bookings, we believe this will be less than previously expected due to lower flight ticket prices.\nWe expect third quarter revenue growth to be between 2% and 4%. We expect third quarter Adjusted EBITDA to be between about $3.25 and 3.35 billion, about flat year-over-year at the midpoint of the range. We expect Adjusted EBITDA to grow slower than revenues due to deleverage from sales and other expenses, and from growth in IT expenses related to higher software license fees and increased cloud cost. We expect third quarter revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth to also be negatively impacted by 1 percentage point from changes in FX.\nIn terms of our outlook for the full year, we're adjusting our growth bookings growth expectation to faster than 6%, which is a bit lower than our prior expectation due to less growth in flight growth bookings as a result of the lower flight ticket prices I previously mentioned. While flight prices have come down, we still expect strong growth in flight tickets for the year as we continue to expand the flight offerings at Booking.com and Agoda. We expect accommodation ADRs will be about flat to down slightly on a constant currency basis.\nFor revenue, we now expect revenue growth of more than 7%, which is a bit higher than our prior guidance. Based on the outperformance in the first half of the year and our expectation for higher revenue associated with payments, revenue is impacted to a much lesser extent than growth bookings from the decline in flight ticket prices. We continue to expect about 1 percentage point of negative impact on changes in FX on our top line growth rates. We're reducing our Fixed OpEx growth expectation to low double digits as we continue to focus on bringing this growth rate down over time.\nWe expect Adjusted EBITDA to grow in the high single digits, which is slightly faster growth than our prior expectation. Given our outlook for increased revenue growth and lower fixed OpEx growth. We continue to expect Adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than a percentage point. Finally, we're increasing our Adjusted EPS growth expectation to above 15%.\nIn conclusion, we continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company. We remain focused on executing against our strategic initiatives while taking actions to drive greater operating leverage. We're excited about our long-term vision for the Connected Trip and enhancing our offering through technology innovation like Generative AI. With that, we will now take your questions. Operator, will you please open the lines?\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. If you would like to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one. Again. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Mark, your line is open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThanks. I was just asking about the European travel conditions, Glenn and Ewout. It sounded like the market may be slowing a little bit, but if I'm capturing it right, your performance there seems to have been pretty steady. That indicates market share shifts market share gains. Any more color on that, why your performance would be relatively unchanged in a slowing European travel market environment? Thank you.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nHi Mark, it's Glenn. I agree with what you say. I'm very pleased with where we're sitting right now. We've talked in the past about normalization, and we're happy with the numbers that we're seeing so far. Your question assumed a softening of the travel business overall. This makes talk about how much and to what extent. Our goal always is to gain share. Whether the market goes up or the market goes down, I can't control demand, I can't control.\nWhat I can't control is how well we can provide value to the travelers and to the suppliers. As long as we continue to do that, as long as we continue to provide a reason that people should come to us as a traveler or use us as a way to distribute somebody's travel suppliers, we'll continue to gain. We've seen this in the long run here, and I expect to continue to see it in the long run going forward. I can't really give more than that right now.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nMark, if I may quickly build on the answer that Glenn just gave, it's also important to point out that actually our growth in Europe has been quite steady and stable in the period from May through July. Yes, we are seeing some mild moderation, but it has been relatively stable over the last couple of months.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Kevin, your line is open.\n\nKevin Kopelman\n\nHotels and Online Travel Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nGreat, thanks. Could you maybe give a little bit more color on some of the moderation you're seeing, other indicators like length of stay or any trading down activity that you might be seeing? Given that things have started to slow, how do you gain confidence that they're not going to continue to slow both end of room nights and rates? Thanks.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nKevin, if you look at the overall conditions of the market, we're not really seeing a trade down on a global basis. Both in terms of the star ratings, as well as in the length of stay, it's relatively stable to what we have seen in previous periods. Maybe with one exception, there is a really mild indication of some trade down in the U.S., but otherwise, globally, we see a very steady picture.\n\nKevin Kopelman\n\nHotels and Online Travel Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. A quick follow up on ad spend dynamics with the deleveraging expected in the third quarter. Is that more of the same in terms of brand and social spend?\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nIf you look at deleverage in third quarter, that mostly relates to S&O and fixed OpEx. Marketing, actually, we expect to see leverage in second half of this year and also from a longer term perspective because we expect to continue to see some benefit from the expansion in the direct mix. I also would like to point out, and we think it's a really positive message for this call, that we are spending more on social media channels.\nThat's a very attractive channel for us where we are expanding now and where we're investing more, and we can do that at very attractive incremental ROI. Really an important point to really highlight with respect to our marketing leverage and the success we're gaining there.\n\nKevin Kopelman\n\nHotels and Online Travel Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nFantastic. Thanks, Ewout.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin, your line is open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Glenn, I'd love to hear your perspective on the travel market bookings growing 3 to 5%. We know Europe has a really tough comp against reopening last year. Is that how you're thinking about longer-term market growth or do you think it's depressed right now on really difficult comps? Love to hear about alternative accommodations, really strong growth there and increasing percentage. Are you featuring that more on your website? Do you really like the economics of alternative accommodations? How do you feel about those economics versus hotel? Thank you.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nHi Justin. Two separate questions. One, just going back to the general sense of the travel market and we talk about this a lot over many, many calls about how much we believe that the travel market is best influenced by GDP and that in the long run GDP goes up, more people travel, more people who couldn't travel get wealthy enough that they can travel, that's a tailwind for us.\nWe talk about other things. You mentioned a 3 to 5% and lots of people can come up with whatever way you want. In terms of global, what's global GDP? What's that going to do to travel? Numbers aren't that different. There's somewhere probably in that neighborhood. How much additional can we get out of increasing share because we provide service and then, of course, the other tailwinds of the offline to the online, another one that's a point in our favor.\nAll these things together believe that, the growth algorithm that we've talked about in the past, totally intact. There's going to be volatility, it's going to be variations. There can be events that are going to happen globally, macro events that happen that can influence a quarter, or a week, or a day, but in the long run, we just continue to build what we've been trying to build for a long time, which is a better service, and that's how we do it. One of the things we've been building and we've been working hard on. I've talked about it for a number of years, how important it is for us to build an alternative accommodations business that will rival anybody's.\nWe admitted that it was taking us time to build it. We started from behind. Another company may have had a bigger head start on us and building it bigger, we think we've done a really good job of catching up. I love the last call we did a few months ago when we came out, we talked about that our homes business, more than 2/3 of the biggest player in the industry. That last quarter we said how we had grown faster 11 of the last 12 quarters, now I don't know if our 12% is going to win or not this time, I don't know. I'm pleased with that growth rate though, given the size of the business and how we are doing it.\nWe're doing it by doing what we do all the things is provide a reason. I said this just to Mark earlier is that continue to build out a product that gives a person a reason to come and use it. I don't really care whether the customer uses a home, a hotel, a villa, or an igloo. I don't care. I care, they get what they want. That's the important thing and then come back in terms of the profitability of one versus the other.\nWe can go into that and talk about it, but it's not really relevant because what's relevant is making sure that they use what they want. We don't try and steer them. We try and just make sure they have the best tools to choose what they need. In the long run, that's the way we'll win and create a great business.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug, your line is open.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking questions. Glenn, just curious first, how you're interpreting the relative tightening of the booking window and what does that tell you about the state of the traveler into the back half. Just curious, in your outlook, how much are you contemplating any impact from the tech issues that we've seen over the last couple weeks and their impact to airlines as well? Thank you.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nSure. The booking window is an interesting thing, and we saw it expanding, expanding, of course, at some point it has to stop, eventually he can't keep getting bigger and bigger. One of the things I always wondered is why, why was it expanding? Was it expanding because of inflation and people trying to book early to get that price locked up, afraid there was going to be more expensive down the road, and then now maybe that they're thinking, 'well, maybe rates aren't going to keep on increasing? I can wait, maybe I'll get a lower price later', I don't know.I haven't done any data to analyze and come up with what the reason is.\nFact is the window gets bigger and the window gets smaller. That of course influences any particular quarter but in the long run, it all averages out. I'm not going to worry too much about that. What we do make sure, though, is make sure that we're spending the right amount of marketing money to try and get the right conversion and do it the right ROI. That's what we continue to do, and we're very, very careful with that. Again, another thing, just like the economies, I can't control what people are going to decide when they want to book.\nIn regard to the tech thing, the tech issues, assume you're talking about the horrific events that disrupted travel throughout the world, but particularly hit some of our supplier partners. Significantly, Delta had a horrific event, and I saw the CEO's interview Squawk Box and I read about what they're planning to do, it's a problem. When you have critical infrastructure breaks down and then disrupts millions and millions of people's lives, that's really unfortunate, and hopefully it won't happen again. Hopefully people test their products before they put them out into the market. Hopefully there are backups.\nThings happen but in travel, we know happens a lot. Certainly weather happens an awful lot. This is something though that wasn't weather, which you can't control. This was making sure that your infrastructure works and it'll be interesting how that lawsuit turns out.\nI will point out it didn't affect us very much, though. We're very pleased about that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric, your line is open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much. Maybe two questions if I could. First, following up on the demand environment. When you think about the shift from goods to services that has played out in the economy more broadly in the last couple years, do you think elements of stability or maybe re-acceleration in terms of demand might be down to price or do you think it's just time and duration that might have to find a new footing for demand and maybe elements of a tailwind potential to return to growth? Will this come down to sort of suppliers and pricing or elements of a new normal and finding a new level? I'd be just curious for your perspective there, Glenn.\nIn terms of the broader marketing messages, you've been on this journey to rejigger the way you're approaching marketing funnel and driving more direct traffic. What do you see as the key investment priorities built on some of the learnings in the last 12 months that you want to share in terms of how the marketing focus for the company might continue to evolve beyond just 2024? Thanks so much, guys.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nThe first more generic question about goods versus services. I think your question, I'm trying to narrow it down, but I think what we're really talking about is we saw a change in people's behavior where they seem to value services significantly more than goods, which of course helps someone like us. I think the question is, is this a permanent change or are people going to go back to a balance that they had a few years ago, maybe pre-pandemic. I think that in the end, again, this is one of those things that I believe but I don't have proof of, is that as people get wealthier, you end up spending more money on services.\nIt ends up a lot because people generally have one home, you got one couch, you don't keep buying more and more, but as your wealth increases, you want to do things, you want to enjoy things, and we see that happen. There's also something of the Instagram effect where this is human nature that you want to show off to your friends, all the great things you're doing. I think that definitely has some impact because we see certain parts of the world that people never used to travel to; now they are being overrun. I think that is the Instagram effect there. That's all good for our business.\nI don't know how much further it'll go, though, because people do need to buy homes, do need to buy couches, etc. I don't see that as a big swing. I'm not concerned that it's going to flip back and we're going to end up with lower, do that's one. In terms of the marketing thing, I'll let Ava talk a couple things. I just want to repeat his point earlier about one of the things that I'm happy to see is seeing us making some progress in using social. We had a long problem getting that to work for us for many, many years. Just didn't seem to work but now we're seeing, okay, starting to work, getting some good ROIs, putting more money into it like that, and I think they will continue doing that.\nAnother thing we saw that we don't talk a lot about. I won't get too specific, but we saw ourselves using money that we thought was producing a good ROI, and it turned out, it really wasn't. We shut some of these things down. I won't go into exactly what they were. We said, \"That's really not hurting us.\" We said, \"Well, that's great.\" That's something that over last year or so that we saw some of the benefit in terms of our marketing leverage was coming from that. Two good things. I'll let Ewout, anything else say about marketing there?\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nYeah, Eric, maybe to give you another perspective. I'm now four and a half months with the company. A lot of joy, a lot of pleasure to be here, and a great honor but I'm also, of course, looking at some of the perceptions of the company. I think it's still very much an outdated perception out there that we are largely dependent in terms of sales and our business on the paid channels. Actually, we're emphasizing a lot, as you have heard in our calls around the direct mix and being now in the low 60% level for B2C, which is really a game changer from my perspective for the company.\nAlso, we're very much diversifying our paid channels, which is very important because this is a very dynamic world. These paid channels are changing all the time. They are changing their algorithms. I'm really impressed about the science that the company has behind its paid channels, the algorithms that we are adjusting to, optimizing all the time the way how we spend our paid marketing dollars, and how we investing that.\nThere is not a silver bullet. It's all the time really the details about the optimization, how to get to the highest number of new customers coming to us through the paid channels in the most optimal way with the most attractive ROIs, and super impressed how the company is doing that. I think that gives us really an edge in terms of how we can deal with paid channels also in the future. Operator, I think we're ready for the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.Our next question is from James Lee with Mizuho. James, your line is open.\n\nJames Lee\n\nCorporate Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question here. Two here. First, on loyalty program, it seems like, one of your major peers is having mixed success with their loyalty program. Maybe, Glenn, you can once again talk about how your program is differentiated and that will allow you to have very high rate of repeat bookings. Secondly, on advertising, I noticed that your ad revenues seem to be under-monetized at only 0.7% of gross bookings. Is that a source of opportunity that you're looking to give to take advantage, to scale your reach, and if so, maybe help us understand what areas are looking to expand. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nGlenn, we're with you.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nHi, yeah, sorry about that. Thinking of the answer. I'm going to let Ewout handle the ad opportunity. I'll talk about our loyalty program Genius, which is the Booking.com program, which we talked a little bit about in our prepared remarks. We really haven't talked about it much in terms of numbers in the past, but I was just really pleased to be able to talk about our level two and level three players. 30% of our active users, active travelers are level two or level three. We talked about that gives us more than half of the Booking.com business, which is really great. We talk about how they come back more frequently and they come back more direct. That's the point that it works.\nOne of the great things about it is for the most part we're not paying for it. Our partners are supplying almost all the benefit right now, though we talk about we are also putting some benefits at a time. We're going to experiment with putting more in ourselves, but it's a great thing. You think why do the suppliers do it? They do it because it gets them incremental demand. It gets them demand when they need it, when they want it. It's very flexible, we work together with them, with these partners so they can get the demand. The reason they get the demand is because our high Genius level people are high spending people and they are going to come and they're going to use those services.\nIt's really a win, win, win, win for our travelers, win for our partners, and win for us. There aren't a lot of people who are already doing a program like that. We think it does differentiate. I'm really happy to see car rental now doing a lot more of it and we're experimenting with flights and part of the whole vision of the Connected Trip, the Genius program fitting right into that, coming all different types of permutations of ways to provide better benefits to travelers and using it in a way, a scientific way, a data-driven way, a way using all of our AI capabilities and all the data we have so that we can come up with the best solutions for both sides of the marketplace.\nThat's what we're driving to. I see it happening now in some of the numbers we said, I think, gives a little indication. Of course, there'll be the other thing which really doesn't have anything. Loyalty is advertising opportunities are great. I'll let Ewout talk a little bit about that.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nJames, thank you for pointing out the advertising revenues because it is indeed a very attractive potential line that gives us an opportunity in terms of growing our revenues in the future. Today this line is mostly coming from Kayak and OpenTable but there are opportunities of course, to think about more advertising income from particularly the apps and the active app use that we're having mostly with Agoda and Booking.com, but as everyone knows, this is a very fine line because if you get too many advertisements as a traveler on an app, while you're interested in something else, that can ultimately also become quite annoying. Finding there the optimal point is really important.\nOverall, you're right, that is an opportunity to help to drive further growth with the company in the future, next to many other opportunities we have. I think that's actually the exciting part for us as a business. We're not just going with the market. We have so many opportunities to grow faster. If it is alternative accommodations we discussed, or the multiple verticals around the connected trip we discussed, or growing geographically in Asia, in the U.S., around payments, around generative AI, and many other opportunities. Definitely I would put this on the same list as well.\n\nJames Lee\n\nCorporate Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS. Stephen, your line is open.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat, thank you. Glenn, I think I heard you talk in the prepared remarks about connected trips bookings up, I think it was 45% and accounting for a high single-digit percentage of the mix. At this point, is there anything you can share about how the basket size of a particular trip could be moving around? Presumably it's up a lot because people are attaching more things, and what the impact to your customer acquisition strategy may be as a result, as customer lifetime values go up? Thanks.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nSure. I won't give specifics, but I'll confirm what you say is true is that if somebody buys two things, it's definitely going to be best. It's going to be bigger than one thing. Also because they bought more things. As we use the science, as we use our data, as we use all the capabilities we have to come up with what is the value for that customer? How much should we spend to attract that person is going to change, obviously. It's also the question is in terms of loyalty.\nWe found, and it does make sense, a more satisfied customer is going to come back more often. People in the Connected Trip, people who use the Connected Trip, we do see a high repeat, a higher repeat rate for a Connected Trip person and we see them coming direct. The great thing about the Connected Trip too is that in the past with just one vertical, which was the hotel business, we were missing on customers who wanted to start with flights. Now with flights, people are starting at flights and they come and they buy something else too. Also it's the convenience factor. That goes into the whole reason why the Connected Trip.\nI've heard from people say, \"Well, what makes you different?\" The truth is right now we're semi different because we don't have the full Connected Trip done yet the way I want it to be. At the end of the day, we all know how frustrating travel is, and we know how much easier it would be if there was just one place, one person who would handle everything for you, put it all together in a way that was the optimal way with all the different things you have to decide upon. If anything went wrong, that it would all get fixed.\nNow, with the benefits of Gen AI coming out and the progress I see being made with it, I talk to our people in customer service and what we're putting together there, I believe we will create something that truly is differentiating and that will create a reason that people want to come to us. The more people come to us, the more opportunities we have to work with our partners to provide them opportunities to help build their businesses. Again, I'll get to use it again. I get to say win, win, win again because that's really what we're trying to achieve here.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Lee, your line is now open.\n\nLee Horowitz\n\nCo-head Internet Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks for the question. The modestly softer travel environment that the industry seems to be expecting in the second half of the year seems to be working through models by way of pricing pressures. Ewout, can you comment some on how you think about flexing your cost structure going forward to the extent that, say, hotel ADR has become a bigger headwind for the industry and by extension, your Adjusted EBITDA margins?\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nLee, thank you so much for asking the question because we are at this point in time really putting much more emphasis on this particular area and looking for more operating leverage for the company in the future. We should particularly be well positioned to do that because we have the scale. We should be able to run much more volume over the same fixed infrastructure that we have as a company in the future and take advantage of that. Take advantage of that in a way that we can reinvest in new growth initiatives, as well as, of course, also benefiting EBITDA margins and return of capital to our shareholders.\nLet me give you a couple of examples, what we're doing at this moment. We have already done a couple of reorganizations in some of our businesses. We have been looking very carefully at headcount in some places, put a headcount pause in place. We're looking at some expense benchmarking in some other brands and businesses, looking at procurement, real estate, and many other areas. More to come on that over the next couple of quarters that I can give you more details.\nDefinitely this has become a really big focus area, and we're pleased that therefore, we can also say to you that for the full year guidance, we are now reducing the outlook in with respect to fixed OpEx from low to mid-teens to now low double digits, as well as we continue to focus on growing our fixed OpEx at a lower level than the top line growth in 2025.\n\nLee Horowitz\n\nCo-head Internet Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nReally helpful, thank you. Glenn, maybe on alternative accommodations, you continue to deliver very healthy supply growth here. Do you feel like you are reaching a point of supply parity relative to your peers in the U.S. specifically where you could perhaps lean in more aggressively investing in marketing and discounting within this vertical to sort of accelerate share gains?\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nI have to admit I don't believe we are at that level at all right now, but that to me is an incredible opportunity. The fact that we are performing as well as we are in terms of our overall number, but we still do not have anywhere near the number or the type of home accommodations in the U.S. to be fully competitive, is while it's a disappointment to me that it's not done yet, it's an opportunity where we have all this upside still to come, and we won't be spending huge amounts of money on a subpar product. Not to fear, we're not going to do that.\nWhat we're going to do instead is spend the money that we're spending now to make sure we get the properties we need, get the things up and running the way we want the product, the way we want it to be. Nobody ever comes to our site and feels disappointed because it wasn't as good as X. That's what we're working on right now. Clearly the numbers show that we're doing a good job in many parts of the world but the U.S. is to me something that is great opportunity.\nFor people who live in the New York area, you know, if you were looking for, I use this example all the time because I live in the New York area. If you were looking for a rental, you wanted a home in the Hamptons this summer, you came to our site, you probably said, gee, there's not a lot here compared to some other people. I don't want that to be. I want us to have as many, if not more, and I want it to be easier for them to come. I want the trust that coming to Booking is a better way to get that summer rental. We're going to work on that and that's good for us and opportunity for us. Your answer is correct, we're not there yet.\n\nOperator\n\nGreat.Thank you.\nYour next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies. John, your line is open.\n\nJohn Colantuoni\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned direct bookings were mid-50% of total, and low-60% excluding B2B, which I think implies your B2B mix decreased from last year, if I'm doing the math correctly. In general, B2B is a smaller offering relative to your biggest competitor, and I imagine this was a strategic decision. I'm curious why you're less excited about the opportunity in the B2B relative to some of the other players in the space.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nJohn, we are not really recognizing that much, and actually we are really encouraged by the growth of our B2B business as well. You're right that overall it's a smaller business than some other players in our industry but we have a couple of propositions that are really strong, and all of our brands are actually active in this space. Booking.com is active in this space, Priceline with Getaroom, Agoda with Rocket Travel, and many other propositions that we have in the market. It is an important part of our commercial strategy, but it is definitely something that is a bit smaller than other players.\n\nJohn Colantuoni\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. A second one on alternative accommodations. I think just broadly speaking, marketing intensity in the alternative space appears to have escalated a bit year-to-date. Talk about bookings, offering, and positioning in the vertical and how that positions you to continue delivering impressive growth if the competitive environment continues to ramp over time.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings",
    "content2": "John, I think actually our proposition is unique with respect to alternative accommodations because we are putting both traditional and alternative accommodations on our same platform. We have the benefit of all our brand marketing spend, all our paid market expense coming together on the same platform and giving the traveler an opportunity to pick and select their best option. Maybe they're coming in and looking for two hotel rooms for their family and ending up by booking an apartment with two bedrooms and they're very happy with that outcome.\nAs Glenn said earlier, we are actually agnostic about which direction this is taking customers because it is important that they are finding the best option for them, ultimately, how to travel. We're agnostic from an economics perspective about this and it is all about making sure we have the most attractive proposition in the market. This is from our perspective, a differentiator because we are able to bring all of those supply opportunities together on our platforms as a company.\n\nJohn Colantuoni\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks so much.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with B. Riley Securities. Naved, your line is open.\n\nNaved Khan\n\nManaging Director, B. Riley Securities\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks a lot. Just on this this commentary on booking window not expanding as much. Can you maybe just talk about if you're seeing any mix in your cross border versus domestic bookings and if that might have anything to do with it. The second question I have is on the U.S. It seems like it picked up a little bit versus the last quarter, and wondering if it has, if it was driven by alternative lodging or if that's not the case. Thank you.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nEwout, why don't you take that first one, and I'll talk a little bit about the U.S. and the increase we saw in second quarter versus first quarter.\n\nEwout Steenbergen\n\nEVP and CFO, Booking Holdings\n\nYeah, Naved, the way how we look at booking window is as Glenn actually commented on a couple of minutes ago, to some extent, it doesn't matter for us. It doesn't matter when a traveler actually books because they will travel at a certain point in time. When they travel, they have the experience and at that point we will recognize the revenues and the economics to the company.\nIf you look at the performance of the business over multiple quarters, this is averaging out if bookers book earlier or later ultimately for the same trip and that can really depend on many factors. It can depend on assumptions, what will pricing do over time, or locking in certain flights, or locking in certain accommodations, or other factors why bookers might come to us earlier or later for the same trip. It is important if any investor looks at us from a medium and long-term perspective, it doesn't matter because over time it's averaging out and we will deliver the same results for our shareholders and continue to build our business over time with all the opportunities we have.\nIn regards to the U.S. and trying to distinguish, is it because we did better in homes or do we better hotels, I really try and stay away from that a little bit. We're trying to provide a traveler with what they need and provide all the different opportunities, whatever. I'm very happy the second quarter accelerated versus the first quarter for our U.S. business. That's very good. I'm pleased by doing better over the long run, but I'm not going to say it's because we did X, Y, or Z. In the end, we have to do well in every single part of this business. That means we've got to provide the homes. Absolutely, I talked about that.\nWe got to be a good partner to the hotels and provide them with the incremental demand they need when they need it. In addition, the Connected Trip, we got to make sure we're getting all the inventory we can in terms of flights and making sure we have that ground transportation. As I always say, nobody goes on a holiday to hang out in the accommodation, they want to do stuff. We got to make sure we get our attractions things working well and that we're putting up the right offers to the person that they want, when they want at the right time.\nOf course, all the other things. Providing the insurance and tying it all together in our merchant platform, which we put in our prepared remarks on the numbers. Very pleased about the increase in that. Glad to see it continuing to go up. Glad it's because it provides a great convenience, it makes it easier to do a lot of things in the Connected Trip.\nAll working together to provide the ultimate thing, which is having a better experience for the traveler and providing more opportunities for our supplier partners. Glad that we're seeing that we did better in America. I'd like to do even better in the long run. I think America, the U.S. is a great opportunity. We continue to under index there, which means for me that's a place that we can do better.\n\nNaved Khan\n\nManaging Director, B. Riley Securities\n\nThat's true. Thank you again. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the Q&A session. Yes, that was our last question. Thank you so much. With that, I will hand the call back over to you, Mr. Fogel, for closing remarks.\n\nGlenn Fogel\n\nCEO, Booking Holdings\n\nThank you. I want to thank our partners, our customers, dedicated employees, our shareholders. We greatly appreciate everyone's support as we continue to build on the long-term vision for our company. Thank you very much, and good night.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

A copy of Booking Holdings' earnings press release, together with an accompanying financial and statistical supplement, is available in the for Investors Section of Booking Holdings' website, www.bookingholdings.com.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon. Glenn Fogel and Ewout Steenbergen. Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen. I am pleased to report a strong start to 2024. Our travelers booked nearly 300 million room nights across our platforms in the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations and grew 9% year-over-year. First quarter revenue of $4.4 billion grew 17% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA of about $900 million increased 53% year-over-year. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA were ahead of our first quarter expectations.\nFinally, adjusted earnings per share in the first quarter grew 76% year-over-year, helped by improved profit levels as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our average share count by 9% versus the first quarter last year. We continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand, including healthy growth for travel on the books that's scheduled to take place during our peak summer travel season, although a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable and what is on the books today represents a modest percentage of the expected total summer bookings. As we look ahead to the second quarter, room night growth compared to last year will benefit from the shift in Easter timing.\nHowever, we expect that this will be offset by a less expansion of the booking window and an increased impact from the geopolitical situation in the Middle East. We believe this will result in some deceleration in room night growth versus Q1. Ewout will provide further details on our first quarter results and our thoughts about the second quarter.\nOver the last few years, we have talked quite a bit about our key strategic priorities, which include building towards our connected trip vision, expanding our merchant offering at Booking.com, developing our AI capabilities and enhancing our genius loyalty program. These initiatives may seem to be distinct efforts, but I'd like to emphasize, they actually all fit together in our ongoing effort to deliver a much better planning, booking and traveling experience for our travelers while also benefiting our supplier partners.\nBy creating a much better experience for our travelers and solving more of the challenges they face when planning, booking and experiencing a trip, we believe travelers will choose to book directly and more frequently with us, resulting in increased loyalty over time. We see encouraging early proof points at Booking.com as we have grown the number of total active travelers while experiencing higher growth in repeat travelers, which speaks to the progress we are making in encouraging customers to book again with us.\nIn addition, we are seeing increases in the average number of trips booked per traveler as well as an increasing mix of our room nights that are booked directly with us. On direct mix, we are pleased to see the direct booking channel continues to grow faster than room nights acquired through paid marketing channels.\nWhile we see paid marketing channels becoming a gradually smaller proportion of our business over time, we think it's important for us to remain proactive in these channels in order to bring new travelers to our platforms, so long as we're able to do so at attractive ROIs. We believe continuing to improve the experience for our travelers by advancing towards our connected trip vision will help to further drive these positive proof points around loyalty, frequency and direct booking behavior.\nI'm encouraged to see strong growth in transactions that are connected to another booking from a different travel vertical in a trip. These connected transactions increased by just over 50% year-over-year in the first quarter, though it's important to note that this growth is off of last year's small base.\nConnected transactions represented a high single-digit percentage of Booking.com's total transactions in Q1. It's great to see more of our travelers choosing to book connected transactions, and we believe by providing more value and a better overall experience to those travelers, they may choose to book more trips with us and have a higher likelihood of booking directly with us in the future.\nFLYHT is the most frequently booked vertical in a connected transaction outside of accommodations. And it is an important component of many of the trips our travelers are booking. In the first quarter, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 33% year-over-year, driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical and are encouraged by the rate that these customers and returning customers see the value of the other services on our platform. Winning in travelers' business is never easy because of the high level of competition in our industry, but we are pleased to see that by providing a better way to do it, less friction, better value, a broader selection and great customer service, we are building a customer base that is more likely to choose us.\nOutside of flights and accommodations, we are seeing strong growth from rental cars and attraction bookings that are part of a connected transaction. We believe continue to enhance and expand the attractions vertical has the ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination and looking for something to do. And we believe that over time, travelers who experience the value we provide for in-destination services like attractions, will choose to use us more in the future.\nBringing all of these elements of travel together in a seamless booking experience and unlocking the ability of merchandise across verticals is a capability we have been building at Booking.com over the last several years. In addition to being a foundational element to our connected trip vision, our merchant offering brings many other benefits to our travelers and partners. For travelers, we provide the ability to pay in many different methods, and we can offer discounts, incentives and other merchandising opportunities for our supplier partners, our merchant offering enables us to take fraud liability from our partners as part of the services we provide reduces cancellation rates versus the agency model. And over time, we believe we can help to lower payment costs for our partners.\nIn order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience with the connected trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. We believe we are well positioned to leverage this technology given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for many years. In addition, we have proprietary data that can be used to train specific use case models or fine-tune large AI models and have the resources and scale required to help build AI-powered offerings.\nAs we have discussed before, our teams continue to work hard to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com's AI trip planner, price-wise generative AI travel assistant named Penny and Kayak's recent release of generative AI-powered features and tools. We will continue to learn from traveler interactions with these tools and enhance our offerings over time.\nIn addition, customer service, which is a critical function that we provide to both our travelers and partners is an area we believe will be meaningfully enhanced by AI advancements. At each of our OTA brands are exploring ways to leverage generative AI technology to improve self-serve tools which we believe will reduce live agent contact rates and enable us to enter traveler questions faster. When customers still need to speak with a live agent, we believe that this technology will improve our live agent efficiency by making it easier to access information and document the conversations. In sum, we believe AI will lower our customer service cost per transaction over time and improve the customer experience.\nOur Genius loyalty program, Booking.com also plays an increasingly important role in the multiple elements of travel that we offer, as we expect our travelers will be able to experience the benefits of Genius in each of our travel verticals over time. In addition, bookings in travel verticals outside of accommodations will contribute to a traveler's genius level tier. We have seen an encouraging number of our rental car supplier partners choosing to adopt the Genius program, and we have just begun to test the program in flights and attractions.\nWe are seeing success in moving more of our travelers into the higher Genius tiers of Level 2 and Level 3, which require 5 and 15 bookings in a 2-year period, respectively. We see encouraging behavior from our genius Level 2 and 3 travelers, including higher frequency and a higher rate of direct booking than what we see for our overall business.\nWe will continue to explore opportunities to enhance our Genius loyalty program and deliver more benefits to our travelers with more of our supplier partners electing to participate. What we have mostly been discussing about our traveler customers, we operate a 2-sided marketplace, and our supplier partners are equally important to us. The success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels, alternative accommodations and other supplier partners around the world. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform. The majority of which are small independent businesses. We believe that improving the competitiveness and profitability of our smaller partners contributes to the long-term economic health of our sector. And we continue to onboard more small independent businesses through our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com, and we are benefiting from having more listings available on our platform for travelers to choose from.\nAt the end of Q1, our global alternative accommodation listings were about $7.4 million, which is about 11% higher than Q1 last year. We are focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong first quarter results and the continued long-term resilience of leisure travel demand. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, we are positive about our future, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, Ewout Steenbergen.\n\nEwout Lucien Steenbergen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, S&P Global Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'm very excited to join the Booking Holdings team. I look forward to continuing to work with you and David in his new role and the rest of the leadership team to help drive continued future success for our investors, employees, traveler customers and supplier partners. I will now review our results for the first quarter and provide our thoughts for the second quarter. All growth rates are on a year-over-year basis. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found on our earnings release. We'll post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call. Now let's move to the first quarter results.\nOur room nights in the first quarter grew 9%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by about 3 percentage points. The higher-than-expected room night growth was driven by a continued extension of the booking window as well as healthy underlying demand with better-than-expected performance in Europe and less of a negative impact from the war in the Middle East than expected.\nLooking at our room night growth by region. In the first quarter, Asia was up mid-teens. Europe and the rest of the world were up high single digits and U.S. was up low single digits. We are encouraged by the continued progress we are making in strengthening the direct relationships with our travelers. Over the last 4 quarters, the mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel was in the mid-50% range. And when we exclude our B2B business was in the low 60% range, we have seen both these mixes increase year-over-year in each of those 4 quarters. We're focused on continuing to increase our direct mix going forward, which we believe will benefit from our efforts to improve the experience for our travelers, including building towards our connected trip vision.\nIncreasing our direct mix benefits our P&L by driving higher efficiency of our marketing spend as a percentage of growth bookings while reducing the mix of bookings resource through paid marketing channels. In our mobile apps, the significant majority of bookings we receive are direct. And we continue to see favorable repeat direct booking behavior from consumers in our mobile apps when compared to direct bookings on desktop or mobile\nThe mobile apps also allow us more opportunities to engage directly with consumers. In the first quarter, mobile app makes of about 51% was 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter of 2023. We continue to offer our travelers a broad selection of places to stay and are seeing an increasing mix of our room nights being booked in alternative accommodation properties. For our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our first quarter room night growth of 13% and the global mix of alternative optimization room nights was 36%, which was up versus 33% in the first quarter of 2023.\nOutside of accommodations, we saw airline tickets booked on our platforms in the first quarter increased 33%, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com's flight offering. First quarter growth bookings increased 10%, which exceeded our expectations. The 10% increase in gross bookings was approximately 2 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth on an unrounded basis due to about a 1% higher accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings, was an immaterial impact from changes in FX on our gross bookings growth rate.\nOur ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, ADRs were up about 2 percentage points. Similar to comments we have made in the past, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely.\nRevenue for the first quarter of $4.4 billion also exceeded our expectations, increasing 17% year-over-year. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 10.1% and improved versus the first quarter of 2023, due mostly to the Easter timing shift as well as the easier year-on-year take rate compare due to changes in the booking window last year, as mentioned on our first quarter 2023 earnings call.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 6% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was 3.7%, about 15 basis points lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.\nFirst quarter sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings was 1.6%, about 20 basis points higher than last year, due in large part to a higher merchant mix. Our more fixed expenses on an adjusted basis were up 11%, which was below our expectation due primarily to lower G&A expense. We recognize that this fixed expense growth is elevated as we invest in the business, but are fully focused on driving operating leverage from our more fixed expenses and targeting a much lower OpEx growth level in 2025. Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $900 million was above our expectations, largely driven by stronger-than-expected bookings as well as better-than-expected marketing efficiency. Adjusted EBITDA was up 53%, including about 20 percentage points of benefit from the shift in Easter timing.\nNote that we expect the first quarter will be our seasonally lowest EBITDA quarter for the year. Adjusted net income of over $700 million resulted in adjusted EPS of $20.39 per share, which was up 76%. Our average share count in the first quarter was 9% below the first quarter of 2023. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $776 million in the quarter.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our first quarter ending cash and investments balance of $16.4 billion was up versus our fourth quarter ending balance of $13.1 billion, due to the $3 billion debt issuance in the first quarter and $2.6 billion in free cash flow generated in the first quarter. This was partially offset by the $1.9 billion in capital return, including share repurchases and the dividend we initiated in the quarter, as well as $315 million in additional share repurchases to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations.\nNow on to our thoughts for the second quarter. We expect second quarter room night growth to be between 4% and 6%, a deceleration from the first quarter as the first quarter benefited more from the year-over-year expansion of the booking window. We expect the booking window to be closer to the prior year in the second quarter. Additionally, the impact from the ongoing war in the Middle East was less negative than we expected in the first quarter. However, we expect a more negative impact in the second quarter given the geopolitical situation in April.\nApril room night growth rate was above the high end of that range and benefited by a couple of points from Easter being in March this year versus April last year. Adjusting for Easter, April room night growth was about in line with the high end of that range. We expect second quarter growth bookings growth to be between 3% and 5%, slightly below room night growth due to about 3 points of negative impact from changes in FX, offset about 1% higher constant currency accommodation ADRs plus about 1 point of positive impact from flight bookings.\nWe expect second quarter revenue growth to be between 4% and 6% and for revenue growth to be impacted by about 2 points of negative impact from changes in FX. Adjusted for the changes in FX, we expect second quarter revenue growth to be in line with second quarter growth bookings growth as the negative impact from the shift in Easter timing is offset by increasing revenues associated with payments.\nWe expect marketing to be a source of slight deleverage in the quarter. But if you adjust for Easter timing, we expect marketing as a percentage of revenue to be neutral year-over-year. We expect our sales and other expenses to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter, driven by a higher merchant mix.\nWe expect our more fixed OpEx to grow faster than revenue in the second quarter due primarily to faster IT expense growth as we have been investing in new tech platforms and in line with the full year guidance we provided last quarter. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA to be between about $1.7 billion and $1.75 billion, down low single digits year-over-year due to about 7 points of pressure from the shift in Easter timing and about 2 points of negative impact -- growth from changes in FX. Normalizing for Easter timing and changes in FX, our expectation for second quarter adjusted EBITDA would be for mid- to high single-digit growth.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the healthy leisure demand environment we are seeing. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we're not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. We want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect 2024 to be a strong year for the company.\nLastly, I would like to thank all my new colleagues across the company for their hard work and dedication to make these strong first quarter results possible. And thank you for your continued commitment towards our shared vision of making it easier for everyone to experience the world.\nWe'll now move to Q&A, and Kathleen will you please open the lines.",

Please go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report a solid finish to 2023 as fourth quarter room nights slightly exceeded our expectations and grew a bit more than 9% year-over-year or 11% when excludes Israel from both periods. When compared to 2019, our room nights grew 21% versus our expectations of 20%. We delivered record fourth quarter revenue of $4.8 billion and record adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion, which were ahead of our expectations. Finally, the GAAP and earnings per share in the quarter grew 29% year-over-year, helped by the reduction in our share count versus last year.\nAt the start of 2024, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. As we look to the year ahead, we see strong growth on the books for travel that's scheduled to take place in 2024, which gives early indications of potentially another record summer travel season. As we've noted previously, a high percentage of these bookings are capable and what is on the books today for the summer period represents a small percentage of the total bookings that we expect to ultimately receive. David will provide further details on fourth quarter results and on our thoughts about the first quarter and full year 2024.\nLooking back at the full year of 2023, I am proud of our efforts to drive more benefits to our travelers and supply partners while also delivering record-setting industry-leading financial results. We reached a significant milestone last year with our customers' booking an all-time high of over 1 billion room nights on our platform, which was an increase of 17% versus 2022. Gross bookings of $151 billion increased 24% versus 2022.\nIn 2023, we reached a new revenue record of over $21 billion, which was 25% higher than 2022. We achieved this strong top line result while improving our profitability with record adjusted EBITDA of $7.1 billion, an increase of 34% versus 2022, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by over 2 percentage points year-over-year.\nOur non-GAAP earnings per share of about $152 increased 52% year-over-year and was 48% higher than our prior full year all-time high back in 2019. Across all of our key metrics in 2023, we were a meaningfully larger and faster-growing business than we were in 2019. Our ambition going forward in a normalized growth in market for the travel industry is to continue to grow our gross bookings, revenue and earnings per share faster than we did in 2019. We are confident we will achieve these objectives because we've invested in building a stronger business and better product offerings for our travelers and partners that we had back then. We can see this in many areas, but I will highlight a few examples of where we have strengthened our offering relative to 2019.\nWe now have a scaled up merchant platform at Booking.com, which processed first half of Booking.com's gross bookings in 2023. Our merchant offering brings many benefits to our travelers and partners as well as new strategic benefits to us, including the ability to merchandise. we have continued to scale up our offering at Booking.com since in 2019, with total company air tickets booked in 2023 up more than 400% over that time frame, primarily driven by Booking.com. We see this vertical bring new customers to our platform while delivering a more complete offering to our existing customers making travel planning and booking easier for them and creating opportunities to provide more value to them.\nAn alternative accommodations. We continue to increase the mix of our alternative accommodations room nights, which treats 33% of Booking.com's room rights in 2023 as we improve our product offering and increase our supply choices with further opportunities ahead, particularly in the U.S. Early, we are pleased that for Booking.com, we have created foundations necessary to offer insurance, attractions and ground transportation options and expect these offerings to add value to our connected trip vision.\nOn marketing, we've improved our abilities in using performance marketing channels even more effectively and are now better focused on our brand spending.\nOn loyalty, we've expanded and enhanced our loyalty program, Booking.com to deliver more benefits to more of our traveler customers with more of our property and rental car partners participating. And lastly, we are continuing to strengthen the direct relationship with our travelers as our mobile app room nights and total direct room nights continue to increase in our mix.\nWe remain confident in our long-term outlook for the travel industry, which we believe will grow faster than GDP growth across our core markets. With that foundation of industry growth and the improvements we've made to strengthen our offerings, we are positive about our future and believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive growth across our key metrics in the coming years.\nWith our long-term positive outlook, solid financial performance and strong balance sheet, we returned over $10 billion to shareholders during 2023 by repurchasing our shares. Returning capital to shareholders will remain a high priority for the company going forward. And today, we are taking another important step in that journey by announcing that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend to complement our existing share repurchase program. David will provide further thoughts on our approach to capital returns in his remarks.\nIn addition to our strong financial results in 2023, we made meaningful progress against our key strategic priorities, which include: advancing our connected trip vision, further integrating AI technology into our offerings, supporting our supply partners and growing alternative accommodations and building more direct relationships with our traveler customers. Let me address the progress we have made in each of these areas.\nOn the connected trip, we continue to take steps towards our long-term vision to make planning, booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our travelers and supplier partners. We believe this is important because we know the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating to travelers than it should be. The contribution aims to greatly improve that experience for consumers which we believe will drive further differentiation of our offerings and lead to improved loyalty, increase direct bookings, higher frequency and a greater share of total travel spend on our platform over time.\nThis is good, not only for our travelers, but also for our partner suppliers who will be able to utilize different elements of the connected trip to obtain additional business in an efficient and lower cost way. As we continue to make progress in developing the connected trip, you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform that moves us closer to this long-term vision. This approach allows us to realize benefits while we are building towards that future state. In fact, some of the key improvements to our platform over the last few years that I spoke about earlier were driven by our work on the connected trip.\nFor example, our emerging platform at Booking.com is a foundational base to the connected trip, and it helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Plus, it enables us to smartly merchandise a variety of partner and self-supply offers when appropriate.\nAnother example would be the development of flights on Booking.com, with flights being one of the most important elements of travel outside of accommodations. In 2023, air tickets booked on our platforms increased 58% year-over-year driven primarily by the growth of Booking.com site offering. We continue to see a healthy number of new customers to Booking.com through the flight vertical, and are encouraged by the right that these customers book other services on our platform.\nOutside of flights and accommodations, we need solid progress in expanding the breadth of our attraction supply that is available to our travelers. While we do not expect attractions to be a major financial contributor on its own, we see benefits from a strong attractions offering given the potential bundling opportunities as we will see ability to increase traveler engagement with the app while travelers are in destination.\nOverall, we believe we have made great progress in building toward our Connected revision, and we are starting to see early signs of the benefits. We continue to see a growing percentage of transactions, which we count as connectors though these are still a small percentage of our total transactions today. Importantly, we see these types of customers returning to us more frequently, and we point to experiment with expanding Genius program to include all travel verticals in 2024, which we expect will drive more value to travelers across the different elements of the connected trip. We plan to continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will result in increased travel and supplier engagement with our platform.\nIn order to achieve the easier and more personalized experience of the Connected Trip, we have always envisioned AI technology playing a central role. Over the last few quarters, I have discussed the hard work our teams have been doing to integrate generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Booking.com's AI trip planner and Priceline's generative AI travels -- named Penny.\nAfter launching Booking.com's AI trip planner in the U.S. last summer, we expanded the rollout to the U.K. market in the fourth quarter. At this early stage, the team remains focused. I learn more about customers who want to interact with the tool and what types of questions they will ask. We see the AI trip planner is getting better answering customers' inquiries and we are excited to start testing other verticals out of accommodations.\nAt Priceline, last week, they announced their weaker product release, which included several enhancements to Penny following 6 months of real-world interaction with users that resulted in valuable learnings from the Priceline team. Priceline's AI travel assisted product can now help travelers be on just the hotel category as it now covers flights, car rentals and vacation packages. While was nicely launched at the end of the booking funnel on the checkout page, it is now available on the Priceline homepage where it can help with travel planning, booking and modifying a trip as we booked. This is a clear example of how our teams iterate and enhance our AI-powered products as we learn more through user interactions.\nWe continue to see encouraging signs that Priceline's Penny product helps lower customer service contact across travel verticals, and we believe, improves the customer experience. Beyond improving customer service contact rates, we believe that, over time, we can leverage generative AI technology to help make our customer service agents more efficient across our entire\nOutside of customer service, we continue to explore areas where we believe we can use generative AI tools to increase productivity. We have early indications that using generative AI enhances the productivity of our software developers and are encouraged by the results so far. We look forward to experimenting with these and other ways Gen AI tools might make our business more efficient in the future.\nTurning to our supply partners. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform. And we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental bookings and developing products and features to help support their businesses. The majority of our partners are small independent businesses, and we are pleased to see many are reporting significantly improved business performance over the last year. We believe that helping our smaller partners thrive contributes to the long-term diversity and sustainability of our sector.\nOne area in which we work with many small independent businesses is through our alternative combination offering comp. This is an area which we have continued to strengthen our business, increasing supply and raising product awareness on many travelers. Also a combination room nights grew 19% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year, which was faster our traditional hotel category. We saw meaningfully higher growth in our U.S. alternative accommodation room nights, though this is all a relatively small\nGlobally, alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights in 2023, which was 3 percentage points higher than in 2022. Our strong trend of accommodation room nights growth is benefiting from having more listings available on our platform were travelers to choose from. We are seeing continued momentum in annual turn combination supply both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about 7.4 million by the end of 2023, which is about 12% higher than the 6.6 million last year. We're focused on continuing to build on this progress by further improving the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.\nFor our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. I am encouraged that in 2023 at Booking.com, we had strong growth in our base of our peak bookers, demonstrating strong retention, while we're also pleased with the increase in the number of new users to our platform versus 2022. We're also strengthening the direct relationship with our travelers as our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year-over-year in the fourth quarter and when measured for the full year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. Our mix overnight through our mobile apps increased year-over-year by about 5 percentage points for the full year to 49%.\nBooking.com remained the #1 downloaded travel app in the world in 2023. In Asia, Booking.com and Agoda are top 5 travel apps. And in the U.S. Booking.com, Priceline and OpenTable are all in the top 10 travel apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here.\nFinally, I want to briefly address a regulatory matter that's impacting the financial results we are reporting today. The Spanish Competition Authority has issued a draft decision alleging infringement by Booking.com of Spanish competition law and then intends to issue a fine of $530 million. We could not disagree more with this draft decision and the arbitrarily large fine that they imposed, which is completely disproportionate to the alleged conduct. If the draft decision were to become fine, we plan to appeal.\nThe success of our business is built on a mutually beneficial and balanced partnership with our millions of hotels and other accommodation partners around the world. We provide exceptional choice, value and service for travelers and we provide a marketplace for hotels and other partners that allows them to attract travelers from around the world at lower cost than many other marketing channels. We have a clear track record of cooperating with many competition and consumer authorities to find amicable and workable solutions to their concerns, including working with the year being commission on the Digital Markets Act.\nAs we have previously disclosed, we plan to file our medication for designation under the DMA suit. And we believe the main concerns raised by the Spanish Authority overlap with the DMA. We will continue to work closely with these regulatory bodies to maintain consistent rules. And most importantly, we will continue to ensure that we are offering the best possible platform to our partners and our customers.\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong fourth quarter results and the continued of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well over the long term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nChief Executive Officer-Information Infrastructure, EMC Corp.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I will review our results for the fourth quarter and provide some color on the trends we see in the first quarter and -- on 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful.\nInformation regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.\nOne housekeeping item before discussing our results. We have reclassified digital services taxes into sales and other expenses and out of G&A expense. Due to the highly variable nature of GSTs, which are tied to the revenue earned in the countries where GST are enacted. We have provided a table with 2 areas of updated quarterly financials in our earnings press release that reflects this chain P&L geography, and all of my comments on this call will also reflect the change.\nNow on to our quarter results. Our room nights in the fourth quarter grew 9% year-over-year and 21% versus 2019, which was slightly better than our expectations of about 9% and 20%. Excluding Israel, Q4 room rights were up 11% versus 2022 and 22% versus 2019.\nLooking at our year-over-year room nights by region in the fourth quarter, Asia was up mid-teens Europe was up low double digits, Rest of World was up low single digits, and the U.S. was flat. All regions improved from October. The average booking window of Booking.com expanded in Q4 versus the same period in both 2022 and 2019, but was a bit less expanded than it was in the third quarter.\nIn Q4, mobile app mix of about 53% was about 5 percentage points higher than the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter relative to the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThe international mix of our room nights in Q4 was 50%, up from about 48% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and reaching about the same level as the pre-pandemic Q4 mix. Our cancellation rate in the fourth quarter was slightly higher than Q4 2022, impacted by the war in the Middle East. As we expected, the higher overall cancellation in October normalized by the end of the quarter.\nFor our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q4 room night growth was 19% year-over-year, and the global mix of alternative body room nights was about 32%, which was up versus about 29% in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nQ4 gross bookings increased 16% year-over-year or about 15% on a constant currency basis, which was ahead of our expectations. The 16% increase in gross bookings was 7 percentage points higher than the 9% room night growth due to about 4% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, plus over 1 percentage point of positive impact from each of FX movements and flight bookings.\nOur year-over-year ADR growth was natively impacted by regional mix due to higher mix of room nights from Asia. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 5 percentage points year-over-year. Despite higher ADRs in the fourth quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star rating levels being booked or changes in the length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch the dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up about 46% year-over-year, driven by the continued growth of Booking.com's flight offering.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 18% year-over-year or about 17% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 15.1%, which was about in line with our expectations.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 9% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q4 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of business. Performance margin ROIs increased year-over-year, helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.\nMarketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 was about 15 basis points lower than last year, which was better than our expectation due to lower merchandising expense, higher direct mix and better performance marketing ROIs.\nQ4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 20 basis points compared with last year and also about 20 basis points above our expectation normalize for the DST reclassification, due in large parts to higher accounts receivable provisions related to our decision to delay some collections during the partner payment issue we discussed last quarter. We do not expect this to be an ongoing issue.\nMore fixed expenses in aggregate were up 21% year-over-year, which was below our expectations primarily due to lower personnel and IT expense as well as due to the DST reclassification. 21% is calculated usually on non-GAAP expenses in both Q4 2023 and Q4 2022. Adjusted EBITDA of almost $1.5 billion was ahead of our expectation and was up 18% year-over-year and would have been about 22% on a constant currency basis. Separately, Q4 adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by a $37 million loss recorded in other income related to the devaluation of the Argentinian peso, which is not factored into our prior guidance. This reduced Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin by almost 1%.\nNon-GAAP net income of $1.1 billion resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $32 a share, which was up 29% year-over-year. Our average share count in the fourth quarter was 9% below Q4 2022. Our non-GAAP results exclude $276 million or expense in personnel related to a ruling in the Netherlands pension fund matter and $530 million of expense in G&A related to a draft decision by a Spanish Competition Authority. I'd like to provide some perspective on each of these.\nAs Glenn mentioned, we strongly disagree with the draft decision and unprecedented fine proposed by Spanish Competition Authority, which we plan to appeal if it becomes final. The appeal process could take a few years. During any appeal process, we would expect to influence some changes to our business practices in Spain, we do not currently undertake that these will have a significant impact on our business.\nTurning to the Dutch pension case. In January, the court of appeal in the ruled the most Booking.com employees in the Netherlands should -- in a travel industry-wide pension fund. The liability we recorded in our Q4 results is for prior periods related to this pension plan. We're working through how we align this travel industry-wide plan with the existing pension plan we offer to our employees in the Netherlands. We expect there will be some increase in our pension plan costs in the Netherlands going forward, but we do not expect these to be material. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $222 million in the quarter.\nWhen looking at the full year, we are pleased to report that our -- 2023 room nights grew 17% year-over-year, and our gross bookings grew 24% and about 25% on a constant currency basis. Our full year revenue was over $21 million, which was up 25% year-over-year and up similarly on a constant currency basis.\nFull year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.2% in 2023, which is up slightly versus 14.1% in 2022. For the full year, there is more than [ 0.5 ] points of positive impact from timing as well the benefit to take rates from increased revenues associated with payments, but this was mostly offset by an increase in the mix of flights, an increase in Asia mix has really recovered and by our increased investments in merchandising. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels.\nFor the full year, our marketing plus merchandising at Booking.com as a percentage of gross bookings was 5.6%, down from 5.9% in 2022, driven by marketing efficiencies and direct mix. The 5.6% in 2023 is still up from 5.5% in 2019 and are leading into a recovered travel market more than offset gains due to increased direct mix.\nFor the full year, the -- as a percentage of our room nights increase in mix. When we exclude our B2B or business-to- business, our direct mix was in the low 60% range for the year.\nOur full year EBITDA was more than $7 million and was up 34% year-over-year and up about 37% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 33%, which was 12 percentage points higher than our adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 and in line with our expectations at the start of the year.\nOur full year non-GAAP earnings per share was about $152 a share, which is up 52% year and up about 58% on a constant currency basis.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $13.1 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $14.3 billion due to the $2.4 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow we generated in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we generated $7 billion in free cash flow. We repurchased over $10 billion worth of shares in 2023, taking our remaining repurchase authorization down to $14 billion and reducing our year-end share count by 9% versus 2022 and by 16% versus 2021, which is just before we restarted our share repurchase program.\nAs we think about our capital structure and allocation framework going forward, we remain focused on appropriately investing in our business and growing returns for our shareholders while maintaining our strong investment-grade credit ratings.\nGiven our confidence in our earnings power, strong free cash flow profile and our ability to consistently shareholders, we are announcing today that our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $8.75 per share to complement our existing share repurchase program. The dividend is payable March 28, 2024 to shareholders record on March 8, 2024. We believe the introduction of a dividend will allow us to enhance our capital return program and further expand our base of investors.\nIn terms of composition of capital returns, we expect the share repurchases will represent the vast majority of our total capital return to shareholders going forward. We continue to expect to complete the $24 billion share repurchase authorization we announced early 2023 within 4 years where we started, which would be before the end of 2026. We reiterate our previously stated gross leverage target 2x, and our goal to move to a 1x net leverage over time. The initiation of a dividend does not change our thinking around these targets.\nNow on to our thoughts for the first quarter of 2024. All growth rates are on a year-on-year basis. Given that we're now beyond the COVID period, when granular short-term information was helpful in assessing the path -- we're returning to our historical guidance approach with outcome range for the full quarter ahead and less detail on monthly trends and individual P&L line items.\nBased on the solid travel demands we've seen so far in the first quarter, we expect Q1 room night growth to be between 4% and 6%. We expect the ongoing war in the Middle East have a negative 1% impact on Q1 room night growth. We're also comparing with a strong start to the year in 2023 when we started to see an expansion of the booking window.\nJanuary room night growth was above the high end of that range. As we move through the quarter, every room bank growth will benefit from an extra day, our March room night growth will be hurt by Easter being in March. We expect these to roughly offset each other.\nWe expect Q1 gross bookings growth to be between 5% and 7%, about 1 percentage point faster than room night growth due to slightly higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and faster growth from flights, partially offset by about 1 percentage point of FX pressure.\nWe expect Q1 revenue growth will be between 11% and 13%, faster than Q1 bookings growth due in part to the Easter shift, which we expect to bear the Q1 revenue by about 3 percentage points. We expect a similar native impact on revenue growth in Q2. We expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be between $680 million and $720 million, which at the midpoint would be 19% year-on-year growth and about a 1 percentage point increase in EBITDA margin. We expect EBITDA margin to bank from market expenses growing slower than revenue and growing similar to gross bookings, which we expect will more than offset our fixed OpEx growth growing slightly faster than revenue.\nAs we set our course to the full year ahead, I want to first address our longer-term ambition for growth in our business. As we've discussed previously, in a more normalized market environment, we're aiming to achieve constant currency growth rates for gross booking revenue and earnings per share that are higher than what we achieved in 2019. This would remain growing above 8% for each of the top line metrics and about 15% for earnings per share. We believe we'll be able to achieve these levels of growth, given the investments we made to build a stronger business and a better offering for our travelers and partners versus what we had 5 years ago.\nAt recent FX rates, we expect changes in FX will negatively impact our reported growth rate by a little more than 1 percentage point. With that framework and with FX in mind, we expect to grow our full year 2024 slightly faster than 7% and including the assumption that the war in the Middle East will negatively impact our full year 2024 growth rate by 1%. We expect revenue for the year to grow at similar rate to our gross earnings growth. We expect a more fixed expense in 2024 to grow in the low to mid-teens. We are planning to leverage from these more fixed expenses in 2025. We expect 2024 adjusted EBITDA will grow slightly faster than revenue, largely due to expectations for an increased direct mix. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand year-over-year by a bit less than a percentage point. Lastly, we expect EPS growth to be above 40%.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our Q4 results, our Q1 outlook and our expectation in 2024 to grow faster than 2019 across gross bookings, revenue, adjusted EBITDA and EPS with exceeding EBITDA margin year-over-year. We expect 2024 to be another strong year for us.\nWe'll now move to Q&A. Sarah, will you please open the lines?",

And now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speaker for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the strong leisure travel demand environment that we continue to see.\nIn the third quarter, our traveler customers booked 276 million or more than 0.25 billion room nights. Which was an increase of 15% year-over-year and we had gross bookings of $40 billion, which was an increase of 24% year-over-year. Room night growth versus 2019 was 24% in Q3. Both room nights and gross bookings were record quarterly amounts for the company and both came in ahead of our previous expectations.\nThird quarter revenue of $7.3 billion grew 21% and adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 million increased 24%, both versus Q3 last year and both exceeded our prior expectations. Finally, our non-GAAP earnings per share in the quarter grew 36% year-over-year and was nearly 60 that 6-0, 60% higher than in the third quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share growth benefited from our improved profit levels, as well as our strong capital return program, which reduced our end-of-quarter share count by 10% versus the third quarter 2022.\nNow turning to October. We estimate that room night growth was about 8% year-over-year and about 20% versus 2019. Excluding Israel, we estimate these growth rates would have been about 9% and 22%, respectively. We saw a significant negative impact on our business in Israel, and there was some impact on travel trends outside of Israel. Nevertheless, we were encouraged to see global room night growth improve towards the end of the month, and David will explain more about October in his remarks. Overall, we continue to see resiliency in global leisure travel demand. And as we take a very early look ahead to 2024, we see strong growth on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year. Though a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable.\nGiven current trends, we expect customers and consumers will continue to prioritize travel over other discretionary spend in 2024. I firmly believe we are well positioned to continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform, while making progress on several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term.\nThese initiatives include: one, advancing our Connected Trip vision; two, further integrating AI technology into our offerings; three, continuing to grow alternative accommodations and four, building more direct relationships with our traveler customers.\nStarting with the Connected Trip. This is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. In the third quarter, we saw an increase in the percentage of transactions, which we count as connected trips, meaning 2 or more travel components within a trip. But still a small percentage of our total transactions today, it is encouraging to see an increasing number of our travelers booking more elements of their travel with us.\nOutside of accommodations, one of the most important elements of travel is Flex, and we continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com. In the third quarter, air tickets booked increased 57% year-over-year, driven by the growth of Booking.com's flight offering. To provide some context on how this has developed over the last few years, the 9 million tickets booked on our platforms during the third quarter, were more than 5x the number of air tickets booked through us in Q3 2019. This significant growth of our flight offering at Booking.com over the last 4 years was achieved through our successful partnership with Etraveli.\nAs previously announced, our proposed acquisition of Etraveli was blocked by the European Commission in September, a decision we will appeal. While we strongly disagree with the EC's decision to block the deal, our commitment to building the flight vertical at Booking.com has not changed. In fact, we have extended our partnership agreement with Etraveli through at least the end of 2028. Which means we anticipate continuing to work with them on improving Booking.com's flight offering over the coming years.\nWe believe offering a compelling flight product alongside our accommodation, ground transportation and attraction offering, helps to create a better, easier and more comprehensive travel booking experience for our travelers and more opportunities for our partners. We will continue to build out our Connected Trip vision, which we believe will ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform.\nAs we discussed last quarter, we have always envisioned AI technology at the center of the Connected Trip. We have a long history of investing in AI technology and incorporating it in our platforms across our company. I previously spoke about the hard work, our team has been doing to integrate Generative AI into our offerings in innovative ways, including Priceline Generative AI travel assistant, named Penny and Booking.com's AI Tripplanner. It is still very early days.\nBut both teams are gaining valuable insights on booker questions, concerns and behavior, as the tools continue to interact with customers. At Priceline, we're seeing some encouraging signs of lower customer service contact rates. And we're exploring other areas across our business, where we believe we can use Generative AI tools to increase productivity. For example, our brands are running projects using Generative AI to enhance the productivity of our software developers with encouraging results so far. And we look forward to using these tools more widely in the future.\nI remain confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI developments by improving our products for our customers and operating more efficiently over time. Turning to our supply partners. We strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform. We look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses.\nDuring the quarter, some of our partners at Booking.com experienced delayed payments due to a planned upgrade to our finance and payment platforms in early July. We've now cleared the backlog of outstanding payment issues related to the system upgrade. We plan to provide compensation to partners who experienced an extended delay, and we recorded this in our Q3 results. We plan to communicate to all partners who were impacted by these payment delays within the next few days.\nWe continue to focus on strengthening our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com by increasing supply and raising awareness among travelers. In the third quarter, alternative combination room nights grew at about 24% year-over-year, which was faster than our traditional hotel category. Alternative accommodations represented about 33% of Booking.com's total [ remix ], which is about 3 percentage points higher than Q3 2020 chip.\nWe are seeing continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodation, supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about 7.2 million by the end of the third quarter. Which is about 9% higher than Q3 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the United States. For our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increasing loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time.\nIn the third quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform, as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. For the first time ever for our company, over 50% of our room nights were booked to our [ absent ] the third quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than in Q3 2022. This is a remarkable achievement considering the mix of our mobile app room nights in the third quarter of 2019, was about 18 percentage points lower than it was in the third quarter of this year.\nWe will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success, we have seen here. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the strong third quarter results and the continued resilience of leisure travel demand. Our teams continue to execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps position our business well for the long term. We continue our work to deliver a better offering and experience for our supply partners and our travelers. We are confident. I am confident in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nChief Executive Officer-Information Infrastructure, EMC Corp.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter, as well as our thoughts for Q4 and the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-on-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. We'll be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019, where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.\nNow on to our third quarter results. We are pleased to report 15% room night growth in Q3, which was a few percentage points better than our expectation. Looking at our year-on-year room night growth by region in the third quarter, Asia was up about 35%, rest of world was up mid-teens. Europe was up low double digits, and the U.S. was up low single digits.\nCompared to 2019, our Q3 global room night growth was 24%. The average booking window of Booking.com expanded in Q3 versus the same period, in both 2022 and 2019. And was a bit more expanded versus the prior period than it was in Q2. In Q3, our mobile apps represented over half of our total room nights for the first time ever. The Q3 mobile app mix of about 51% was 6 percentage points higher than the third quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to see an increasing mix of total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. Direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the third quarter relative to the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix of our room nights was over 50%, up from about 45% in the third quarter of 2022. The Q3 international mix was in line with 2019 levels, similar to the second quarter. Our cancellation rates in the third quarter were slightly higher than Q3 2022. But slightly below Q3 2019. Cancellation rates were the same as in Q2.\nFor our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q3 room night growth was about 24% year-over-year and the global net alternative accomodations was about 33%, which are 2 points higher than Q3 2022. Q3 gross bookings increased 24% year-over-year or 21% on a constant currency basis. The 24% increase in gross bookings was 9 percentage points higher than the 15% room night increase, due to about 4% higher [ corporation ] constant currency ADRs plus about 3 percentage points of positive impact from FX movements and also due to about 2 percentage points from flight bookings.\nOur year-over-year ADR growth was negatively impacted by regional mix, due to a higher mix of room nights from Asia and a lower mix of room nights in the U.S. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 7 percentage points year-on-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these [ diets ] closely.\nAirline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 57% year-on-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter exceeded our expectations, increasing 21% year-over-year or about 18% on a constant currency basis. Although we had stronger-than-expected Q3 from a room night and gross bookings point of view, the outperformance versus our expectations was driven mainly by bookings that offer travel in future quarters. As a result, we do not see all of the revenue benefit in Q3 in these incremental bookings.\nRevenue as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was 18.4%, which was lower than expected due to this timing effect. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 13% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q3 2022, due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business.\nPerformance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year helped by our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend. Marketing and Merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 was about 30 basis points lower than last year, which was a little better than our expectations, driven by the improved performance marketing ROI. Q3 sales no expenses, as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 10 basis points compared with last year, a bit better than our expectations.\nAbout 51% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed to our Payments platform in Q3, up from about 40% in Q3 2022. For the total company, 56% of gross bookings were merchant up from about 45% in Q3 2022. Our more fixed expenses in the aggregate were up 24% year-over-year, which was below our expectation, due to lower personnel and personnel-related expenses.\nWe continue to manage our more fixed cost expenses very carefully. On a GAAP basis, our more fixed expenses were up 33% year-over-year, including a $90 million accrual in G&A expense for the termination fee, related to the acquisition agreement for Etraveli. This accrual was excluded from our non-GAAP results.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $3.3 billion in the quarter, which was up 24% year-over-year and would have been up 22% on a constant currency basis. This was also ahead of our expectations. Non-GAAP net income of $2.6 billion in the third quarter resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $ 72.32 per share, which was up 36% year-over-year. Our average share count in the third quarter was 9% below Q3 2022 and 16% below Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $2.5 billion in the quarter.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash investment balance of $14.3 billion, was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $15.7 million, due to $2.6 billion of share repurchases to be completed in the quarter. Partially offset by the $1.3 billion of free cash flow generated in the third quarter. We repurchased $7.7 billion of our shares through the first 3 quarters, which represents 8% of our year-end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $16 million from a total of $24 billion, we discussed earlier in the year.\nOur buyback program takes into account -- takes our share price into account, and at current share price levels, we expect to spend more on buybacks in Q4 than we did in Q3. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within 4 years from when we started the program, at the beginning of this year, assuming no major downturn in the travel environment.\nNow on to for the fourth quarter of 2023. In October, we estimate year-over-year room night growth was about 8% and down from 15% in Q3, due in part to a tougher year-on-year compare, as well as the war in the Middle East. When comparing versus 2019, October room night growth was about 20%. Excluding Israel, October room nights grew about 9% versus 2022 at about 22% versus 2019. The 22% growth versus October 2019, excluding Israel, is a little lower than the 24% growth we saw in Q3 versus 2019.\nLooking across our major regions, in October, we saw Asia year-on-year growth of room nights with about 15%. Europe up about 10%, and the U.S. and rest of world were down slightly. The impact of the Israeli-Hamas war is seen most in the rest of world growth numbers. Israel on a Booker plus inbound travel basis is about 1% of our global room nights. The Middle East, including Turkey and Egypt, on a booker basis is about 4% of our global room nights.\nGlobally, we saw a slowdown starting the second week of October due to cancellations and a drop in new bookings after the start of the war in the Middle East. The cancellations, we saw, the translation we saw started in the second week of October were concentrated in Israel, but we also saw some impact on travel trends outside the country as people absorb the news. We are pleased to see room night growth recover towards the end of the month.\nOur comments for the fourth quarter make the assumption the room night growth will be up about 9% year-on-year. When comparing versus 2019, this means we expect Q4 room night growth to be about 20%, This outlook assumes there's no further expansion of the war in the Middle East. We expect Q4 gross bookings to grow about 5 percentage points, about 5 points faster than room nights on a year-on-year basis, used a couple of points from higher correlation constant currency ADRs including some pressure from change in regional mix. As well as a couple of points from continued flight bookings growth.\nWe expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 15%, which would be higher than Q4 last year due to benefits from timing. We expect Q4 marketing expenses as a percentage of bookings -- gross bookings to be slightly lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q4 to be slightly higher than last year, as we continue to look for opportunities to lean in.\nWe expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about in line with last year, as the higher merchant gross booking mix is offset by efficiencies in payment costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q4 to grow a couple of points faster year-over-year than it did in the third quarter. Taking all this into account, we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be just over $1.4 billion.\nOur year-to-date results plus our fourth quarter commentary means that for the full year, we expect room night growth to grow in the mid- to high teens year-over-year. We currently expect full year gross bookings growth of over 20% year-on-year. We currently expect revenue, as a percentage of gross bookings increased year-on-year by about 10 basis points, down from our previous expectation for a 20 basis points increase, due to higher bookings growth and a longer booking window. Which will reduce the expected benefit from timing.\nWe continue to expect full year marketing merchandising, as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below 2022 and for our more fixed expenses to grow around 25% year-over-year. We manage our more fixed -- our more fixed cost very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our Q3 results, the trends we're seeing into Q4 and with the bookings we've already received for early 2024. We'll now move to Q&A. So Belly, can you please open the lines.",

Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the second quarter, we continue to see robust leisure travel demand, which helped drive the strong results we are announcing today. The 268 million room nights booked in the second quarter increased by 9% year-over-year, and gross bookings of $39.7 billion grew 15% year-over-year and was the highest quarterly gross bookings ever. Both room nights and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the favorable demand environment.\nRevenue growth of 27% in Q2 also nicely outperformed our expectations. The strong top line results in the quarter, combined with better-than-expected marketing efficiency, helped drive our Q2 adjusted EBITDA to about $1.8 billion, which is an increase of 64% versus Q2 last year and meaningfully exceeded our prior growth expectations of about 35%.\nLooking at the month of July, we have seen an acceleration in year-over-year room night growth relative to the 9% growth we reported for Q2. We estimate July room nights increased by about 20% year-over-year, benefiting from the easier comparison to July 2022.\nOverall, we have been very pleased to see our strong performance in the first half of the year, which has benefited from the continued strength and resiliency of overall travel demand. Our solid start to the year, combined with what we currently believe will be a new all-time high for Q3 summer travel period results and an improved outlook for the full year, which David will discuss in detail in his comments.\nWhile the near-term results and outlook are encouraging, we remain focused on what is important for the business for the long term, which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our enterprise while simultaneously remaining cost conscious. We are seeing progress and momentum across several important initiatives, which will help strengthen our business over the long term. These initiatives include: Advancing our connected trip vision; further integrating AI technology into our offerings; continue to grow alternative accommodations; and building more direct relationships with our travel bookers.\nStarting with the connected trip. This is our long-term vision to make looking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners. To be clear, this is not a discrete product we will introduce at some point in the future. Instead, this is a meaningfully enhanced way for a booker to experience and utilize Booking.com.\nOver time, you will see incremental improvements and enhancements to our platform to move us another step closer to this long-term vision. And importantly, this approach allows us to realize the benefits while we are building towards that future state. We believe that the current travel experience is much more complicated, fragmented and frustrating travelers than it should be. And eventually, our connected trip vision will greatly improve it via technology.\nLooking at the other side of the travel marketplace, we believe that our supplier partners will also benefit greatly from the connected trip as it will provide more opportunities to personalize and merchandise their offerings. We continue to build out our connected vision and have much more work to do, but we're pleased with the progress we have made so far and expect it to ultimately result in increased customer and supplier engagement with our platform.\nWe've always envisioned the connected trip is having AI technology at its center. Across our company, we have a long history with investing in AI technology and incorporating it into our platforms in order to optimize interactions with both our travelers and partners. This is an area where we believe we are well positioned given we have built strong teams of AI experts and gained valuable experience from using AI extensively for years.\nIn addition to the many current applications for AI on our platforms, we believe that we can build an even more compelling and differentiated offering for our bookers. We leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a connected trip that would be more responsible to our bookers' needs and help manage different aspects of their trips.\nGenerative AI may play an important role in delivering the connected trip experience to our bookers and our teams have been hard at work to integrate this exciting technology into our offerings in innovative ways. For example, in early July, Priceline unveiled its 2023 summer release. which delivered over 40 new booking tools and upgrades, including Penny. Penny is Priceline's generative AI travel assistant.\nPriceline has currently positioned Penny at the end of the funnel on the checkout page, where Penny can answer travel-related questions that a customer may have when they reached the checkout page. Penny is built on Priceline's own proprietary technology and data and also leverages large language model technology to power its conversational capabilities. The combination of these technologies allows for innovations like the ability to make a booking directly in the chat interface.\nThe Priceline team is rapidly gaining insights on booker questions, concerns and behavior is Penny continues to interact with customers. The plan is to further enhance penny over time by leveraging these valuable learnings.\nAround the same time, as Priceline summer release, Booking.com launched its own AI trip planner, which began rolling out on the mobile app in the U.S. to Genius customers. In contrast to Penny, the AI trip planner sits towards the top of the funnel, where travelers are in the discovery and planning processes for their trips.\nBuilt upon the foundation of Booking.com's existing machine learning models that recommend accommodation options to millions of travelers on the platform every day, the AI trip planner is also partially powered by large language mall technology to create a conversational experience for people to start their planning processes.\nThe AI trip planner advances planning by providing travelers with a rich visual list of destinations and properties, including Booking.com's live pricing information with deep links to view more details on the options. From the chat interface of the AI trip planner, bookers can tap on any recommended accommodation they're interested in and then complete the reservation.\nAccretive to our approach here is to marry our own proprietary data and machine learning models with degenerative AI technology. This allows us to provide a conversational interface with the traveler while leveraging our own recommendation engine to provide accurate detail and real-time information on the property recommendations. Like Priceline, the Booking.com team is already gaining valuable insights from the interactions with bookers even though the trip planner is in beta and is still currently in a relatively limited rollout.\nWhile we are excited by these new advances at Booking.com and Priceline, it is, of course, still very early days, and we have much more to learn about how customers will ultimately want to interact with this new technology.\nIn addition, we mentioned last quarter that [indiscernible] like Kayak were experian with AI plug-ins. And we will continue to examine all areas of our company to ensure we are taking advantage of AI-created efficiencies. We are confident in our company's ability to benefit from AI development and improve our products for our customers given our many years' experience in AI, our travel-related data and connections to our supply partners and our human and financial capital.\nAcross our businesses, we have 2 equally important customers, our travelers and our supply partners, with each representing one side of our marketplace. For our supply partners, we strive to be a trusted and valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, and we look to add value for our partners by delivering incremental demand in developing products and features to help support their businesses.\nOne area of focus for us on the supply side continues to be our alternative accommodation offering at Booking.com. Alternative accommodation room nights grew faster than our traditional hotel category at about 11% year-over-year for the second quarter and represented about 34% of Booking.com's total room nights, which is 2 percentage points higher than in Q2 2022. This is a new all-time high mix of our total room nights.\nWe are pleased to see continued momentum in terms of alternative accommodation of supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. with global listings reaching about $7 million by the end of the second quarter, which is about 8% higher than Q2 last year. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product for our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.\nFor our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. In the second quarter, our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms continue to increase year-over-year. We see a very high level of direct bookings in the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and we believe will result in increased traveler loyalty.\nAbout 48% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter, which is about 6 percentage points higher than in Q2 2022, an acceleration in the mix shift compared to Q1 and all-time high in terms of mix of bookings coming from our mobile apps. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here.\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength of travel demand so far this year and signs of what we expect to be a record summer travel season. Our teams continue to innovate and execute well against our key strategic priorities, which helps us position our business well for the long term. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and the opportunities ahead for our company.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Gold.\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nChief Executive Officer-Information Infrastructure, EMC Corp.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the second quarter as well as our thoughts for Q3 and for the full year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will post our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.\nNow on to our second quarter results. Again, it's a tough year-over-year comparison in the second quarter due to a strong rebound in travel after Omicron in Q2 last year. We were pleased to have blurred 9% room night growth in Q2, which was a few percentage points better than our expectations.\nLooking at our year-over-year room night growth by region in the second quarter, Asia was up over 40%. Rest of the world was up low double digits. Europe was up a couple of points and the U.S. was down slightly. It's helpful to remember that the U.S. was very strong last Q2 and stronger than Q1 and Q3 versus 2019 due to a rebound from Omicron.\nCompared to 2019, our Q2 global room night growth was 26%, which was in line with Q1. For the second quarter, all our major regions grew at a similar rate versus 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com, expanded further versus 2019 than it did in Q1. The Q2 booking window of Booking.com also expanded versus 2022. As Glenn mentioned, our mobile apps represented about 48% of our total room nights in the quarter, which was about 6 percentage points higher than the second quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increased mix of our room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The down channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the second quarter relative to the second quarter of 2022.\nFor the first time since the onset of the pandemic in Q2, we saw the international mix of our room nights fully recover to 2019 levels. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter were higher than Q2 2022 as the second quarter of 2022 benefited from the strong recovery in new bookings following the relaxation of travel restrictions in many parts of the world post Omicron. Our cancellation rates in the second quarter continue to be below 2019 levels.\nFor our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, our Q2 room night growth was about 11% year-over-year and the global mix of our tag recombination room it was about 34%, which was higher than about 32% in Q2 2022. Versus 2019, alternative combination room night growth was about 38%.\nQ2 gross bookings increased 15% year-over-year or 16% on a constant currency basis. The 15% increase in gross bookings was 6 points higher than the 9% room night increase due to 5% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from flight bookings partially offset by the 1 percentage point of negative impact from FX movements.\nOur accommodation in constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by regional mix due to a higher mix of room nights in Asia and a lower mix of room nights from the U.S. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 9 percentage points year-over-year. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely.\nAirline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 8% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the second quarter came in nicely ahead of our expectations, increasing 27% year-over-year or about 28% on a constant currency basis. Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points above last year, which was in line with our expectations. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, increased 4% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 50 basis points lower than Q2 2022 due to higher ROIs in our pay channels and a higher mix of direct business. Performance marketing ROIs increased year-over-year due in part to our ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of our marketing spend.\nMarketing and Merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 was about 60 basis points lower than last year, which is better than our expectation. Relative to expectations, this is primarily due to better ROI in our pay channels as well as lower-than-expected merchandising spend, which was impacted by the booking window being more expanded than we expected in the quarter, which will push merchandising expense into future periods at the time revenue is recognized.\nSales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 30 basis points compared to last year, a bit better than our expectation. About 48% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from about 38% in Q2 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 20% year-over-year, which is below our expectations due to lower IT expenses in the quarter, including some impact from phasing of IT spend into later in the year. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.8 billion in the second quarter, which was up 64% year-over-year and would have been up 70% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was well above our expectations due to a stronger top line, the efficiencies in marketing and merchandising and lower-than-expected IT expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA margins increased by about 7 percentage points versus Q2 2022.\nNon-GAAP net income of $1.4 billion in the second quarter resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $37.62 per share, which was up 97% year-over-year. Our average share count in the second quarter was 9% below Q2 2022 and 15% below Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had net income of $1.3 billion in the quarter.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash and investment balance of $15.7 million was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $15.3 billion due to the $1.9 billion of debt issuances in May 2023 and the $1.6 billion of free cash flow generated in the second quarter offset by the $3.1 billion in share repurchases we completed in the quarter.\nIn the first half of the year, we repurchased $5.1 billion of our shares, which represented 5% and of our year-end 2022 share count. The repurchases so far this year take our combined authorization down to $19 billion from the $24 billion we discussed earlier in the year. We remain comfortable with our ability to complete the full $24 billion of share repurchases within 4 years from when we started the program at the beginning of this year, assuming no major downturn in the travel environment.\nNow on to our thoughts for the third quarter of 2023. In July, we saw year-over-year room night growth of about 20%, up from 9% in Q2. Looking across our major regions. In July, we saw Asia up about 45%; rest of World, up over 20%; Europe up mid-teens; and the U.S. up mid-single digits. When comparing versus 2019, July room night growth was in a similar range to the 26% growth in Q2. The U.S. was our most recovered region with growth at over 30% versus 2019.\nOur comments for the third quarter made the assumption that room night growth will be up low double digits year-on-year, assuming some moderation in growth from July due in part to harder prior year comparables in August and September. You'll recall from our commentary on the third quarter of 2022, that room night growth versus 2019 was 4% in July 2022 and 10% in August and September 2022.\nIn addition, we expect that due to expanded booking window in the first half of the year stayed in Q3, but there will be fewer last-minute bookings for stays in the rest of Q3. We expect Q3 gross bookings to grow about 7 points faster the room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and a few points of positive impact from FX movements. We expect accommodation constant currency ADRs to be about in line with Q3 2022, including a couple of points of pressure from the changes in regional mix.\nWe expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be around 19%, slightly above last year due to a more positive impact from timing in part due to the expanded booking window in the first half of this year, and from increased revenue from payments. We expect we expect these will be partially offset by a higher mix of flights and increased merchandising spend, some of which is related to bookings we received earlier in the year.\nWe expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q3 to be slightly lower than last year. We expect Q3 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 20 basis points higher last year, primarily due to higher gross bookings mix. We expect our more fixed expenses in Q3 to grow year-over-year about 30% due to higher personnel and related expenses, higher IT expenses, including the impact of phasing from Q2 and higher indirect taxes in G&A.\nThe year-over-year growth in our more fixed expenses includes about 7 percentage points from changes in FX. The difference between the 20% growth in our more fixed expenses in Q2 and a 30% growth in Q3 is driven mainly by FX and major one. Taking all into account, we expect adjusted -- we expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be around 20% higher than last year.\nGiven the strong level of bookings that we've seen, we are updating our commentary for the full year. We currently expect gross bookings to grow slightly over 20%, up from our previous expectation for low teens growth. We expect full year room night growth in the mid-teens and constant currency combination ADRs were up slightly for the year, including a couple of points of pressure from changes in regional mix.\nWe currently expect revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to increase year-over-year by about 20 basis points, down from our previous expectation of 50 basis points increase. The reduction in our full year take rate is driven by less of a benefit from timing, including due to the higher growth rate we expected earlier in this year and also due to expanded booking window. Also from stronger performance, which drove a higher mix of flights than expected earlier in the year.\nWe currently expect marketing merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly below in 2022 as compared to our previous expectation for it to be similar to 2022. The improvements in our expectation is driven primarily by higher ROIs in off paid channels.\nWe currently expect our more fixed expenses to grow about 25%, up from our previous expectation to around 20%. The increase in our expectation is driven primarily by variable components of personnel expense due to the overperformance versus expectations at the start of the year as well as higher indirect taxes, which are generally tied to revenues and some additional FX pressure.\nWe manage our more fixed expenses very carefully and continue to expect our more fixed expenses next year to grow at an appreciably lower rate than this year. We continue to expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022.\nIn closing, we are pleased with our year-to-date results and the momentum in the business that we moved into Q3. We'll now move to Q&A. Adam, can you please open the lines?",

A copy of Booking Holdings' earnings press release, together with an accompanying financial and statistical supplement, is available in the For Investors section of Booking Holdings' website, www.bookingholdings.com.\nAnd now I'd like to introduce Booking Holdings speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and David Goulden. Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nChief Executive Officer, President & Director, Booking Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to report that in the first quarter, we reached all-time quarterly highs for both room nights of $274 million and gross bookings of $39.4 billion and achieved year-over-year growth rates of 38% and 44%, respectively.\nOn a constant currency basis, first quarter gross bookings growth was even stronger at 52% year-over-year. Both room night and gross bookings came in ahead of our previous expectations as a result of the continued strength in leisure travel demand and from a lengthening booking window, particularly in Europe and the U.S.\nThe room night and gross bookings outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future periods, which is when the revenue will be recognized. As a result of this timing difference, revenue was approximately in line with our expectations, while adjusted EBITDA was a bit below given the additional marketing expenses associated with the future states.\nWhen we look at room night growth versus 2019, we have seen a slight increase in April compared with what we saw in the first quarter. Though on a year-over-year basis, growth has decelerated since April last year saw an accelerating travel recovery, making the comparison more difficult.\nOverall, we remain encouraged by the continued strength and resiliency of travel demand so far this year, which speaks to consumers' strong desires to travel. We currently see very strong growth of bookings received for travel during our peak summer period in quarter 3. Though we note, these bookings represent a modest percentage of what will likely be booked for total summer travel and most of these bookings are cancelable.\nWhile travel booking trends have remained robust, we recognize that there is uncertainty regarding the path of the global economy. However, we believe we are well positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty given our highly variable expense structure, solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow. This allows us to remain focused on what's important for the long term, which means making the necessary investments to strengthen and grow our business while remaining cost conscious and implementing initiatives across the business to drive cost efficiency.\nWe continue to make progress on our key strategic priorities, including our long-term Connected Trip vision. The Connected Trip is our long-term vision to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal, more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our traveler customers and supplier partners.\nOur payments platform at Booking.com ties into our Connected Trip vision as payments helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience for our travelers. Those still small today, we are seeing an increase in the mix of transactions that are connected to another book travel component in a trip. We believe continuing to build on this progress will improve the booking experience for more of our customers, which we believe will help drive increasing customer engagement with our platform.\nWe continue to focus on further developing our flight offering on Booking.com, which provides consumers with another place to book an air ticket. Booking.com's [ live ] offering was an important part of our total Q1 73% year-over-year increase in air tickets, which was an acceleration from the year-over-year growth in Q4 of 61%.\nWe will continue this important work to provide travelers with the best possible flight booking experience.\nThough AI has received significant attention recently, we began our investments in AI years ago. We believe then, and we continue to believe now that we can build a more compelling and differentiated offering if we can leverage AI technology to deliver a more personalized booking experience, a connected trip that would be more responsive to a booker's needs and help manage different aspects of their trips.\nWe believe we are well positioned in this area, given that we have been using AI extensively for years in order to optimize interactions with our customers who are both travelers and partners. This goes from personalizing interactions and recommendations to machine translation in over 40 languages and dialects to analyze in the content, the pictures provided by customers and partners, to optimizing value for our customers and many, many more.\nOver the years, we have built a strong team of AI experts across the company, and we keep current with the latest AI research through Booking.com's collaborations with universities. This enables us to quickly react, adapt and learn how our traveler customers and supplier partners can benefit from new developments in the field.\nWe are always looking for new ways to make customer interaction smoother and richer, realizing our ambition to make it easier for everyone to experience the world and to deliver our Connected Trip vision.\nMuch of the recent attention has been on large language models or LLM, which provide a multitude of interesting possibilities for improving all areas of travel searching, booking and experiencing.\nTwo interesting possibilities are interactive itinerary building and answering travelers questions. Though there are current challenges given current LLM sometimes produce inaccurate outputs. Nevertheless, we are excited to be exploring how we can make use of these technologies for the benefit of our customers.\nSome of our brands, like KAYAK and OpenTable, are experimenting regenerative AI plug-ins, while others are building ways to integrate the technology into their own offerings. It is, as we all know, very early days, but I am confident in our company's ability to benefit from these developments and improve our products for our customers given our experience in AI, our travel-related data and our human and financial capital, our strategic priorities, including the Connected Trip vision and to improve the experience for our customers and drive more value and benefits to them.\nBut it's important to note that when we think about customers, we have 2 equally important customer groups to consider, our supply partners and our travelers.\nFor our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform, from traditional hotels to the vacation rental on the beach, to everything in between. We believe we can add value to these partners across the spectrum of accommodation types by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses.\nIn the area of alternative accommodations, we are seeing encouraging progress at Booking.com with alternative combination of room nights in the first quarter, increasing about 45% year-over-year and representing about 33% of Booking.com's total room nights, which is 2 percentage points higher than in Q1 2022.\nIn the U.S., our mix of alternative accommodation room nights, while still low relative to our global mix, has increased meaningfully in the first quarter, reaching highest level ever and was also our absolute highest room nights in U.S. alternative accommodations ever.\nWe are seeing continued momentum in terms of supply growth, both globally and in the U.S. for alternative accommodations, with global listings reaching about 6.7 million by the end of the first quarter, which is about 2% higher than year-end 2022.\nWe have seen great traction with the adoption of our enhanced payment solution for alternative accommodation partners in the U.S. We believe rolling out this solution along with other product enhancements last year, including partner liability insurance and an enhanced damage policy is helping to bring more professional supply online to our platform.\nIn addition, we are seeing our alternative accommodation properties across our major regions, achieving improvements in productivity and our new partners are receiving their first booking on our platform earlier. We aim to build on this progress by continuing to improve the product offering to our supply partners and travelers, particularly in the U.S.\nFor our travelers, we remain focused on building a better experience that leads to increased loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms in the first quarter continued to increase and reached the highest first quarter level ever. We see a very high level of direct bookings from the mobile app, which is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers.\nJust over 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the first quarter, which is a few percentage points higher than in Q1 2022. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we are seeing here.\nAnother way that we build a better experience and deliver value to our travelers is going through our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com. Simplicity is a core principle of Genius where our travelers get the benefits from the program right away. Over time, we've enhanced these benefits, including the creation of a top-tier level of Genius, and we will continue to find ways to deliver incremental value to our travelers through this program.\nFinally, we published our 2022 sustainability report last month, which provides an update on the progress we have made against the goals laid out in our climate action plan. We are proud of the emissions reductions achieved and ambitious targets set out for our business. But as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We're addressing this opportunity through our work with our travel sustainable [ bag ] program, which now includes over 400,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com, and that program has been expanded to Priceline, Agoda and KAYAK.\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by the continued strength of travel demand we are seeing so far this year as well as our team's execution against our key strategic priorities. We remain focused on delivering a better offering and experience for our customers, both our supply partners and our travelers alike. We are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company. I will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nChief Executive Officer-Information Infrastructure, EMC Corp.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter as well as our thoughts for Q2 and for the year. All growth rates for 2023 are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise indicated. We will be making some references to the comparable periods in 2019 where we think these are helpful. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. We will be posting our prepared remarks to the Booking Holdings Investor Relations website after the conclusion of the earnings call.\nBefore getting into details for Q1, I want to remind you that our business is quite seasonal. Q1 is typically a strong booking quarter, and we incur marketing expenses in Q1 for many bookings that will stay in future quarters, which is when the revenue is recognized. Q1 has also historically been our seasonally smaller revenue quarter and adjusted EBITDA quarter. This means that Q1 adjusted EBITDA can be quite sensitive to the level of bookings we get in the quarter.\nWith the increasing mix of payments at Booking.com, Q1 is also becoming a strong cash flow quarter due to high level of bookings. So now let me go on to our numbers for the first quarter.\nWe were encouraged to see strong year-over-year room night growth of 38% in the first quarter, which is better than our expectations. For the first quarter, Asia was up 100%. Europe and rest of world were both up more than 30%. We continue to see growth in the U.S., which was up high single digits versus the prior year.\nOur growth in total room nights versus 2019 increased from 10% in Q4 to 26% in Q1. In the first quarter, U.S. was up more than 30%, and all other regions were up about 25% versus 2019.\nThe booking windows -- our Booking.com expanded versus 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, driven by Europe and the U.S. The booking window in the first quarter was longer than we expected due to strong levels of bookings for travel in the summer period. I note that many of these bookings are cancelable.\nOur mobile apps represented over 45% of our total room nights in the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. The direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the first quarter relative to the first quarter of 2022.\nThe international mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 53%, which was the highest quarterly mix since 2019, but still a couple of percentage points below Q1 2019. Our cancellation rates in the first quarter were below Q1 2022 and Q1 2019. For our alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our Q1 room night growth rate was about 45% year-on-year, and the global mix alternative accommodation room nights was about 33% which was higher than about 31% in Q1 2022.\nWe are pleased with the progress we made in North America alternative accomodations where growth in the first quarter was much stronger than the global average. Q1 gross bookings increased 44% year-over-year or 52% on a constant currency basis. The 44% increase in gross bookings was 6 percentage points higher than the 38% room night increase due to 9% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a couple of points from strong flight booking growth, partially offset by the 8 percentage points of negative impact from FX movements.\nAccommodation in constant currency ADRs were negatively impacted by about 5 percentage points from regional mix due to Asia room nights growing the fastest of all our regions and U.S. growing the slowest. Excluding regional mix, constant currency ADRs were up about 14 percentage points year-on-year due to rate increases in all of our regions. Despite the higher ADRs in the first quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We continue to watch these dynamics closely.\nAirline tickets booked in the first quarter were up about 73% year-over-year, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the first quarter was up 40% year-on-year or about 47% on a constant currency basis. Although we had stronger-than-expected Q1 from a room night and gross booking point of view, the outperformance versus our expectations was driven by bookings that will stay in future quarters.\nAs a result, we did not see revenue benefit in Q1 from these incremental bookings. The lower-than-expected take rate in Q1 was entirely driven by the timing effects. Our underlying accommodation take rates continue to be in line with 2019 levels. Marketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line increased 32% year-over-year. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about 30 basis points lower than Q1 2022 due to higher ROIs in our paid channels and a higher mix of direct business.\nMarketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 was about 20 basis points lower than last year, which is better than our expectations of being slightly higher. Relative to our expectations, this was due to better ROIs in our paid channels as well as phasing of merchandising spend, which is tied to revenues.\nSales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 15 basis points compared with last year, which was better than our expectations. About 45% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from about 34% in Q1 2022. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were up 25% year-on-year, which was higher than our expectations due to a few factors that impacted personnel and indirect taxes. The 25% year-over-year growth excludes $39 million in accruals related to potential settlements of indirect tax [indiscernible] recorded in G&A. We continue to manage our more fixed expenses very carefully.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $586 million in the quarter, which was up 89% year-over-year and would have been up 111% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was lower than our expectations, impacted by marketing expenses incurred for the higher-than-expected gross bookings [ stage ] in future quarters. February and March bookings came in stronger than we expected at the time of our prior guidance. These extra bookings also negatively impacted our take rate more than expected for the quarter.\nIf we look at marketing and merchandising as a percentage of gross bookings in Q1 to eliminate the timing difference, this was lower than our expectations and lower than both Q1 2022 and Q1 2019.\nNon-GAAP net income of $440 million resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $11.60 per share, which was up 197% year-on-year. Our average share count in the first quarter was 8% below Q1 2022 and 16% below Q1 2019.\nOn a GAAP basis, we had net income of $266 million in the quarter. As a reminder, every profit metric we highlighted in these quarterly earnings report includes the negative impact of stock-based compensation expense because we view SBC expense at a very real cost of doing business. We continue to manage SBC very carefully, and it continues to be a very low percentage of our operating cash flow.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash and investment balance of $15.3 billion was up slightly versus our Q4 ending balance of $15.2 billion. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $2.9 billion, up 70% year-on-year. And our free cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 77% year-on-year. The operating and free cash flow generated in the quarter benefited from $2.3 billion in change in working capital due to an increase in our deferred merchant booking balance as well as the $586 million in adjusted EBITDA.\nThe $2.8 billion of free cash flow was mostly offset by about $2 billion in share repurchase in Q1 and the payment of about $500 million for debt to mature in March.\nNow on to our thoughts for the second quarter of 2023. In April, we continued to see strong demand with room night growth versus 2019 that was slightly higher than the 26% growth saw in the first quarter, with all of our major regions growing at similar rates. The booking window in April at Booking.com continues to be long as it was in 2019.\nOn a year-on-year basis, April room night growth was in the mid-teens, which is lower than Q1 due to a more difficult prior year comparison. You will recall that last year, Q1 room nights were 9% below 2019 and April was up 10%. April 2022 was our first month of growth versus 2019 since the onset of the pandemic.\nOur comments on the second quarter make the assumption that room night growth will be up mid-single digits year-over-year. As you'll recall, Q1 last year was impacted by Omicron. And in Q2, we saw a strong recovery, which resulted in Q2 2022 being our highest growth quarter versus 2019, especially May and June, which were our highest growth months last year.\nCompared with 2019, we'd expect future room night growth in 2023 to be just over 20%, assuming some moderation from growth from the first quarter in April when room nights were helped by more bookings we expected for the summer. We expect Q2 gross bookings to grow about 4 points faster room nights on a year-on-year basis due to a few points from continued flight bookings growth and slightly higher constant currency ADRs.\nWe expect Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be approximately 120 basis points above last year due to a less negative impact from timing and increased revenue from payments, partially offset by an increased investment in merchandising and a higher mix of flights.\nWe may see less of an increase in our take rate if booking trends exceed our expectations, especially in the high percentage of these bookings [indiscernible] stays in future quarters. This could also result in higher-than-expected marketing expense in the quarter.\nWe expect Q2 marketing expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be lower than last year due to an increase in direct mix. We expect marketing and merchandising combined as a percentage of gross bookings in Q2 to be about in line with last year. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than last year due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle.\nWe expect our more fixed expenses in Q2 to grow about 25% year-over-year due to higher personnel and related expenses, indirect taxes and IT expenses. Taking all this into account, we'd expect future adjusted EBITDA to be around 35% higher than last year.\nIn terms of our outlook for the year, we are not updating our previous full year commentary at this time. Our strong bookings in the first 4 months of the year created the potential for some upside but we want to see how the next few months develop before considering any updated commentary. We continue to expect that our adjusted EBITDA margin will expand by a couple of percentage points versus 2022.\nIn closing, we're pleased with our Q1 results and the very strong growth in bookings for the summer. We'll now move to Q&A, and Rob, could you please open the lines?",

Please go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' third quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am encouraged by the strong results we are reporting today and by the record level of travel during our peak summer season.\nIn the third quarter, our customers booked 240 million room nights, a little under 0.25 million room nights, which was 8% higher than in Q3 2019. We saw an improvement in room night growth during the third quarter from 4% growth in July to 10% growth in both August and September relative to the comparable months in 2019. We note that sadly, the war in Ukraine continues. And as you know, we suspended our operations in Russia and Belarus shortly after the work we get.\nIf we exclude the suspended areas as well as Ukraine, our room night growth for the quarter would have been 11%. We are pleased that all of our major regions improved in August and September versus July and room nights in Asia surpassed 2019 levels for the first time in September. In the U.S., both our Priceline and Booking.com brands continue to execute well and contributed to room night growth of almost 30% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of 2019.\nWe continue to see very strong accommodation of ADR growth, which helped drive a 27% increase in global gross bookings in the third quarter or 41% on a constant currency basis, both versus Q3 2019. Despite the strong pricing environment, we have not seen evidence of our customers trading down to lower hotel star ratings or reducing the length of their trips.\nWe took another important step in our company's recovery from a profitability perspective with the third quarter being the first time that adjusted EBITDA surpassed pre-pandemic levels. In fact, the third quarter was our highest revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter ever. Our Q3 revenue and adjusted EBITDA were 20% and 7% higher than Q3 2019 and grew 34% and 25% on a constant currency basis.\nMore recently, we have seen resiliency in the level of demand from travelers with room night growth improving slightly from September levels to about 12% growth estimated for the month of October versus October 2019. Gross bookings in October are estimated to be up about 30% or just over 45% on a constant currency basis. The slight improvement in October was primarily driven by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe.\nAs we take an early look at demand into 2023 at Booking.com, we see strong growth in gross bookings on the books for travel that will take place in the first quarter of next year, though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. Interestingly, we have strong numbers on our books for early 2023 despite the booking window being shorter than it was at this point in 2019. David will provide further details on our results and on the recent trends we have been seeing.\nWhile there is a rising concern around the macroeconomic environment and uncertainty around the consumer spending, we believe the sustained level of demand we have seen through October helps demonstrate our consumers' strong desire to travel further. We believe our solid operating results, substantial liquidity and strong free cash flow positions us well to navigate potential near-term economic uncertainty while we continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform and making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision.\nGiven our confidence in the positioning of our business, the positive long-term outlook for travel and our strong balance sheet, we have stepped up the pace of our share repurchases since we reinitiated the program at the start of the year. With $4.2 billion in repurchases for the first 3 quarters of this year, we have reduced our share count by 5% relative to our ending share count last year.\nWe remain focused on building a better experience for our customers and addressing their needs of value, choice and convenience. With continued focus on our customers, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships over time. We are encouraged to see our unique active customers at Booking.com above 2019 levels in the third quarter, which was driven by strong growth in reactivated customers who had not made a booking in over a year as well as growth in repeat customers.\nOur mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest third quarter level ever. Our goal over time is to further increase our direct mix through several initiatives, including continued efforts to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app.\nThe mobile app is an important platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. About 45% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the third quarter, which is just over 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com app remains the number one downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm, and we have seen increasing levels of downloads in the U.S. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here.\nWe're thinking about addressing our customers' need for value, we believe providing attractive prices on accommodations is very important. As has always been the case, our first priority, as we think about providing attractive prices, is to source competitive rates from our supply partners. We do this by working closely with our supply partners to get the best prices possible and increase participation in our targeted rate programs to ensure that compelling prices are available to our customers.\nOur Genius loyalty program at Booking.com is a great example of a program where hundreds of thousands of our property partners are participating to offer lower rates and other benefits to travelers in ways that meet our property partners specific revenue needs. In addition to sourcing competitive rates directly from our partners, we have built up our ability to selectively offer discounts and incentives at Booking.com over the last few years.\nVisibility to merchandise is another lever that we can now pull as we look to deliver value to our customers to more competitive pricing. We believe this competitive tool helps us attract and retain customers and drive improved conversion on our platform. Importantly, we take a disciplined approach to merchandising by very closely monitoring the incremental return on investment on that spend, and we can adjust the level of our spend according to our desired return objectives. We have been pleased with the levels of incremental return we have seen this year for merchandising and we'll continue to selectively utilize this tool going forward.\nFor our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner for all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodations of room night at Booking.com grew about 11% versus 2019 and represented about 30% of Booking.com's total room nights in Q3.\nWe have continued to make progress with our alternative accommodation offering by increasing our supply base of properties which has grown by about 300,000 since the end of 2021 and has increased in each of our major regions around the world over that time period. We aim to build on this growth in our alternative accommodation supply base by improving our product offering to our supply partners globally with a continued focus on the U.S. market.\nLet me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. On payments, 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the third quarter, which, once again, is our highest quarterly level ever. We believe Booking.com payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions.\nFurthermore, we believe that Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected trip vision. On the connected trip, our long-term vision is to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable, while delivering better value to our customers and supplier partners.\nWe are expanding our offering into travel verticals other than the combinations, and then we'll work to link relevant travel components together to provide a more seamless, flexible consumer experience. As a result of this initiative, we believe, over time, we will drive increases in customer engagement, share of spend and loyalty to our platform.\nWe continue to make progress on building foundations so that we connect trip vision, including our work to integrate ground transportation options and further develop our flight offering on Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process. And over 20% of all of our flight bookings globally are new to Booking.com. There is much more work to do as we strive to give our customers the best possible trip experience, but we are pleased with the early results we have seen so far.\nIn conclusion, I'm encouraged by our strong third quarter results and the sustained levels of travel demand we are seeing into the fall and into early next year. We continue to make progress in several key areas, including engagement with our app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offerings, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected trip vision. I believe these initiatives will help us deliver a better offering and experience for our customers and our partners. While there continues to be uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the third quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen supply in the fourth quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.\nNow on to our results for the third quarter. In the third quarter, we were encouraged to see room night growth improved to 10% in both August and September, up from the 4% room night growth we previously reported for the month of July. All regions improved in August and September relative to July. For the full third quarter, global room night growth was 8%, with Europe up high single digits, the U.S. up almost 30% and rest of world up over 10% and Asia down mid-single digits. And September was the first month of room night growth in Asia versus 2019 as the delayed recovery continues in that region.\nOur mobile apps represented about 45% of our Q3 total room nights, an increase of slightly over 40% in the second quarter. Total mobile bookings represented over 60% of our total room nights in the third quarter, also an increase from the second quarter.\nIn the third quarter, we continue to see increasing mix of our total room nights turning to us to our direct channel versus 2019 and also versus Q3 2019 and also versus Q3 2021. The international mix of our total room nights in Q3 was about 45%, in line with Q2. Our Q3 cancellation rates continue to be below 2019 levels as they were in Q2.\nIn Q3, the booking window of Booking.com remain shorter than in 2019, similar to what we saw in the second quarter of 2022. This booking window expanding meaningfully versus the third quarter of 2021, where we saw a higher mix of near-end bookings due to the COVID-19 Delta variant wave.\nFor our alternative accommodation in a Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 11% in Q3 versus 2019 and the goal mix of alternative accommodations was about 30%, which is slightly higher than Q3 2019. Q3 global mix was about in line with 2021.\nQ3 gross bookings increased 27% versus 2019 or 41% on a constant currency basis. The 27% increase in gross bookings was 19 percentage points better than the 8% room night increase due to 28% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to 4 points from strong flight growth bookings across the group, partially offset by the 14% points of negative impact from FX movements.\nOur accommodation constant currency ADRs benefit by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 26 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America. Despite the high ADRs in the third quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel star ratings being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trending down. We'll continue to watch this dynamics closely.\nAirline tickets booked in the third quarter were up about 235% versus a smaller base in 2019 and up 45% versus 2021, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's flight offering. Revenue for the third quarter was over $6 billion, which was up 20% versus 2019 and up about 34% on a constant currency basis.\nRevenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 110 basis points below Q3 2019 due to a number of factors, including investments in merchandising, which is consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lead into a recovering travel market in 2022 and also due to an increase in the mix of flights, the slower recovery of our advertising and other revenues, which have no associated gross bookings and some negative impact from FX rates.\nQ3 take rates were down more than our expectation of being down about 70 basis points, primarily due to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by the improved bookings in Q3, some of which relate to travel in future quarters. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q3 2019 levels.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q3 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings was about in line with Q3 2019, which was better than our expectations, mainly due to higher-than-expected direct mix. As expected, our marketing ROIs were lower than in Q3 2019, which was in line with our strategy to lead into a recurring travel market in the Q3 peak season.\nSales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points compared to Q3 2021, which was in line with our expectations. About 40% of Booking.com's gross bookings are processed through our payments platform in Q3, up from almost 1/3 in Q3 2021. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations of 17% versus Q3 2021, primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp into our IT expenses and lower-than-expected personnel expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, which is better than our expectations and about 7% above 2019 and would have been about 25% above 2019 on a constant currency basis.\nNon-GAAP net income of $2.1 billion results in non-GAAP earnings per share of about $53 per share, which was up 17% versus Q3 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $2.6 billion in Q3. We recorded GAAP net income of $1.7 million in the quarter, which includes a $336 million unrealized loss on our equity investments, primarily related to Meituan as well as $125 million expense related to an ongoing French tax matter.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q3 ending cash and investment balance of $11.8 million was down versus our Q2 ending balance of $14.2 billion, primarily driven by about $2 billion in share repurchases in Q3 as well as the unrealized losses on our equity investments. The $2 billion in share repurchases in Q3 was a step-up from the $1.3 billion in Q2 as we increased the pace of our repurchases given the pullback in our share price. In October, we repurchased another $595 million worth of our shares, which brings our year-to-date repurchase up to about $4.8 billion and our remaining outstanding authorization to about $5.6 billion.\nAs Glenn mentioned, we reduced our share count by 5% since the end of last year. And over the last 5 years, we reduced our share count by 20% despite suspending our share buyback activity for 21 months during COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe have negative $95 million in free cash flow for the third quarter, our earnings for the quarter were offset by about a $2 billion decrease in our deferred merchant booking balance following the peak travel season in Europe and North America.\nNow on to recent trends and out thoughts for fourth quarter. We estimate that October room night increased about 12% versus 2019, a slight improvement from the 10% growth in September, driven primarily by the continued recovery in Asia as well as a slight improvement in Europe. In October, all regions were above 2019 levels. The U.S. was of almost 35%, rest of world was up high teens, and both Asia and Europe were up high single digits.\nADR growth has remained around Q3 levels, and we estimate gross bookings were up about 30% in October, which includes negative impacts from FX pressures. We estimate that constant currency gross bookings were up just over 45% in October.\nWhile there continues to be uncertainty in the near term, our comments for the quarter make the assumption that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be about 10% above 2019, which is in line with levels of growth we've seen over the last 3 months. 10% room night growth in Q4 versus 2019 would also be an acceleration on a year-on-year basis from 31% growth in Q3 2022 versus Q3 2021 to 39% growth in Q4 '22 versus Q4 '21.\nWe expect the strength in ADRs, we've seen in recent months to generally continue for the remainder of the fourth quarter as well as continued growth in flight bookings. We expect about a 15% difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth, less than 19% gap in Q3 due to more FX pressure in Q4. We expect FX to pressure gross bookings growth versus 2019 by about 18% in Q4.\nWe expect Q4 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 120 basis points lower than Q4 2019 due to investments in merchandising, an increase in mix of clients and negative impact from timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. We expect Q4 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be a bit higher than in Q4 2019 as we expect to continue to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness due to the continued global recovery of travel demand.\nWe expect Q4 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than Q4 2021 due to higher merchant gross bookings mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than in Q4 2021, with personnel, G&A and IT each up similar percentage year-on-year.\nTaking all this into account, we expect the Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be over $1.1 billion. If it were not for the impact of FX, we expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA to be above Q4 2019. We are maintaining our full year adjusted EBITDA margin commentary and still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. And if not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year adjusted EBITDA margins would be higher by another few points.\nFor the full year, we expect our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be just over 14%, lower than our prior expectations for mid-14% range, due primarily to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition, driven by stronger bookings than previously expected, some of which are related to travel expected to occur in 2023.\nCompared to the 15.6% take rate in 2019, the expected take rate in 2022 includes almost a full point of noted impact from timing, about 40 basis points from a slower recovery in advertising other revenue, which have no associated gross bookings and about 30 basis points from increased mix of flights.\nThe benefit to take rates in 2022 from increased revenues associated with payments is offset by our increased investments in merchandising, each of which impacts our reported take rates by about 1% in 2022 compared with about 0.5% each in 2019. These changes in payment revenues and merchant costs versus 2019 are mainly at Booking.com.\nLooking forward into winter months, the booking window continues to be shorter than it was in 2019, which means that we would expect lower levels of future stays already on our books. Given this, we are pleased that the gross bookings we've already received at Booking.com for stay in Q1, up about 25% in euros versus the same time in 2019. Of course, we note that high percentage of these bookings are cancelable. While this represents a relatively small percentage of the total revenue we record in Q1, we think it's a helpful early data points to share.\nIn closing, we're pleased with our Q3 results and the trends that we're seeing into Q4 and early into 2023. We remain confident that our strategic priority is the right ones and will enable us to provide better travel services for our customers and partners. We'll now move to Q&A. And Sylvie, can you please open the lines?",

Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' second quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden. I am pleased to announce that we reached another milestone in our company's recovery with room nights for Q2 being the first quarter in which we have surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Our customers booked 246 million room nights in the second quarter, so just shy of 0.25 billion room nights, which represented an increase of 16% versus Q2 2019 and a significant improvement from the 9% decline in Q1.\nWe continue to see very strong accommodation ADR growth, which helped drive an even higher 38% increase in gross bookings in the second quarter or 48% growth on a constant currency basis. Both our room nights and gross bookings in Q2 were our company's highest quarterly amounts ever for these metrics.\nWhile we continue to see bookings growth in July versus 2019, the pace of growth moderated to about 4% for room nights and just over 20% for gross bookings or about 35% growth on a constant currency basis with room night and gross bookings growth slightly improving in the back half of the month versus the comparable weeks in 2019. For the remainder of the summer period through the end of Q3, we see higher gross bookings on the books than at this point in 2019, which we believe will result in a record revenue for the third quarter, which is our seasonally largest revenue quarter.\nLooking towards the rest of the year, Booking.com, we see solid gross bookings for the fourth quarter, which are about 15% higher than at this same point in 2019 on a euro basis. Though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable, and current FX rates will negatively impact that growth rate in dollars by about 10 percentage points. The booking window remains shorter than it was at this point in 2019, which somewhat limits our visibility into how Q4 will continue to develop. And although conditions could change rapidly, we are cautiously optimistic on the data we are seeing so far. David will provide further details on the recent trends we have been seeing.\nNow we recognize that there is uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and questions about the strength of consumer demand through the end of this year and into next year. And while it is extremely difficult to accurately predict the near-term economic environment, I am as confident as ever in consumers' strong desire to travel, the attractive long-term growth profile of the travel industry and our improving longer-term competitive position. With our industry-leading margins, high-quality earnings, strong free cash flow and liquidity position and solid balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to navigate any potential near-term economic uncertainty and continue our work attracting customers and partners to our platform while making progress on our key strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision.\nIn terms of attracting customers to our platform, our unique active customers at Booking.com surpassed 2019 levels in the second quarter, driven by very strong growth in returning customers who have not made a previous booking over a year as well as growth in repeat customers. Our mix of customers booking directly on our platforms reached its highest second quarter level ever. We aim to build on increasing our direct mix through several initiatives, including by continuing to enhance the benefits of our Genius loyalty program, further building out our connected trip vision to increase engagement with our customers and driving more of our customers to download and utilize the mobile app.\nIn our mobile app, we see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior when compared to our other platforms like desktop or mobile web. Consistent with the first quarter, over 40% of our room nights were booked through our apps in the second quarter, which is about 10 percentage points higher than in 2019. Booking.com's app continue to set new records in terms of monthly active users in Q2 and remains the #1 downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm.\nAs I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers, and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip vision. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app experience to build on the recent success we have seen here.\nFor our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform by delivering incremental demand and developing products and features to help support their businesses. Alternative accommodation room nights Booking.com grew about 25% versus 2019 and representing about 1/3 of Booking.com's total room nights in Q2. We continue improving our alternative accommodation product globally with an additional focus on the U.S. market.\nIn the first quarter, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage. In the second quarter, we launched an enhanced payment solution for professional property managers in the U.S. and have made progress increasing adoption by our partners. Finally, we started rolling out the damage policy option for partners in the second quarter and have continued expanding this option to more countries in the third quarter.\nEach of these initiatives helps add important features to our alternative accommodation offering, which we believe strengthens our efforts to attract more properties and partners onto our platform.\nIn the second quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties since 2019, and we now have 6.6 million alternative accommodation listings on Booking.com. We are encouraged by the increase in alternative accommodation supply that we have seen so far this year, and we aim to further build on this growth as we move through the second half of the year.\nLet me now talk about the progress we have made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trip vision. 38% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the second quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. We continue to increase adoption of payments by our property partners with over 60% of our total Q2 gross bookings coming from properties that have adopted payments. So this means that about 2/3 of the bookings at payment-enabled properties are being processed via payments. We believe Booking.com's payment services drive benefits for both our travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flights and attractions.\nFurthermore, we believe that Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected trip vision.\nOn the connected trip, I think it's a helpful reminder to talk to what we are hoping to achieve with this vision. Our vision for the connected trip strives to make booking and experiencing travel easier, more personal and more enjoyable while delivering better value to our customers and a way to provide marketing opportunities to our supplier partners. And as a result, we believe, over time, we will drive increase in customer engagement, share spend and loyalty.\nFirst, we are looking to increase the engagement of customers on our platform by solving more of our customers' travel problems than just finding the right accommodation of Booking.com as we've done in the past. A simple example of solving a problem and driving additional engagement would be we proactively suggesting options for top attractions that can be booked seamlessly in our app while the traveler's destination and looking for something to do.\nAnother example is our testing discounted transportation from the airport to the hotel for, say, a high-value accommodation customer. And the ground transportation supplier might in the future be providing a discounted price that is specific for our customer because we are able to provide incremental business.\nSecond, we see the opportunity to increase our share of customers' travel spend. We estimate that pre-pandemic, our customers' annual spend on Booking.com represented only about 25% of their total travel spend on average. We believe that by making it easier to book multiple elements of the trip in one place, we can make more part of that travel spend onto our platform. Even in core accommodations and even with top customers, we believe there are opportunities to improve our share of spend over time.\nAnd we want to increase customer loyalty and drive a higher direct mix through our app over time. We believe by addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and convenience through our connected trip vision, we will deliver an improved experience and increase the likelihood that our customers come back to us again on a direct basis.\nThis year, we continue to make progress as we work on building the foundation of the connected trip, including developing a flight offering of Booking.com. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to suggest other services to these flight bookers -- continues to be a source for new customers with about 1/4 of all of our flight bookers globally being new to Booking.com with an even higher share of new customers in the U.S.\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by our strong second quarter results and the record level of summer travel we are seeing now. Our teams are working hard to continue making progress in several key areas, including the app, the Genius program, our alternative accommodation offering, payments at Booking.com and building towards our connected trip vision. Through this work, we believe we are building a better offering for our customers and partners while strengthening our long-term competitive position. While there is uncertainty around the near-term macroeconomic environment, we are as confident as ever in the long-term growth of travel and in the opportunities ahead for our company.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the second quarter and provide some color on trends we've seen so far in the third quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.\nNow on to our results for the second quarter. Room nights in the second quarter were up 16%, a 25-point improvement from Q1 and our first full quarter of room night growth versus 2019. On our May earnings call, we discussed how we started off the quarter with a 10% increase in room nights for the month of April, which was a 14-point improvement from March. As we moved into May, we saw further strength in room nights resulting in 22% growth for the month. June room night growth of 14% landed between April and May.\nOn -- for Q2 on a regional basis, room nights in Europe were up over 20%. The U.S. was up about 30%. Rest of World was up in the mid-teens, and Asia was down high single digits with all regions improving from Q1 levels. The improvement from Q1 was helped by all regions with Europe and Asia contributing the most.\nMobile bookings, particularly through our apps, represent about 50% of our total room nights in the second quarter. Our apps were over 2/3 of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights, which was in line with the first quarter.\nIn the second quarter, we continued to see an increasing mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel versus Q2 2019 and versus Q2 2021. The international mix of our room nights in Q2 was about 45%, an increase from about 40% in Q1. Q2 international room nights were up mid-single digits compared to Q2 2019 levels, which was the first quarter of growth versus 2019 for international. And these international room nights drove most of the overall improvements in room night growth from Q1 to Q2.\nThe improvement in international room nights we saw continue to be driven by travel within Europe, and these cross-border room night bookings continue to have on average longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. In Q2, we also saw an encouraging improvement in long-haul international room nights, which almost recovered to 2019 levels. We saw very strong growth in our domestic room nights in the second quarter, also an improvement from Q1.\nWe were pleased to see our cancellation rates below 2019 levels in Q2. You'll recall our Q1 cancellation rates were about in line with 2019. In Q2, the booking window of Booking.com moved closer to 2019 levels than it was in Q1 but remained shorter than 2019 across all major regions. The booking window expanded versus the second quarter of 2021.\nOur alternative accommodations of Booking.com, our room night growth rate was 25% in Q2 versus Q2 2019, and the global mix of alternative accommodation room nights was about 32%, which was about in line with Q2 2021 and a couple of percentage points higher than Q2 2019. Within Europe, our mixed alternative accommodations continues to be meaningfully higher than the global average. In North America, our mix of alternative accommodations remains low relative to global average. However, we did see an encouraging increase in mix versus Q2 2021 in that region.\nQ2 gross bookings of about $35 billion increased 38% versus Q2 2019 or 48% on a constant currency basis. The 38% increase in gross bookings was 22 percentage points better than the 16% room night increase due to 25% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs and also due to a few points from strong flight booking growth across the group, partially offset by the 10 percentage points of negative impact from FX improvement -- from FX movements.\nOur accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 2 percentage points from regional mix and about 23 percentage points from rate increases across all of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America, especially in high-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019 accelerated from 18% in Q1 to 25% in Q2 due primarily to higher rates in Europe. Despite the higher ADRs in the second quarter, we have not seen a change in the mix of hotel start rate levels being booked or changes in length of stay that could indicate that consumers are trading down. We'll continue to watch the dynamics closely. Airline tickets booked in the second quarter were up about 190% versus a small base in 2019 and up 31% versus 2021, driven by the continued expansion of Booking.com's Fly platform.\nConsolidated revenue for the second quarter was $4.3 billion, which was up 13% versus 2019, up about 20% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 275 basis points below Q2 2019, down more than our expectations due primarily to timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition driven by stronger bookings than we expected in Q2. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q2 2019 levels.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense item, increased 27% versus Q2 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased by about 40 basis points versus Q2 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to higher-than-expected marketing ROIs in a high-intent travel environment. Additionally, our direct mix was a little higher than we expected.\nSales and other expenses were up 87% versus Q2 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third-party call center costs. 38% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q2, up from 16% in Q2 2019. Compared with Q2 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were up about 40 basis points, slightly better than our expectations of up 60 basis points. Our more fixed expenses in aggregate were better than our expectations, up 7% versus Q2 2021, primarily due to a slower-than-expected ramp-up in terms of our G&A and IT expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion in the second quarter, which is better than our expectations. If we were to normalize for negative timing impact on revenue in the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA would have been meaningfully higher than in Q2 2019. In addition, the changes in FX rates are negatively impacting the translation of our EBITDA to U.S. dollars. Our Q2 EBITDA would have been about 10% higher if FX were in line with Q2 2019.\nNon-GAAP net income of $776 million results in non-GAAP EPS of about $19 a share, which is down 19% versus Q2 2019. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $1 billion and net income of $857 million in Q2.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q2 ending cash investment balance of $14.2 billion was up versus our Q1 ending balance of $12.8 billion, primarily driven by $2.6 billion of free cash flow, partially offset by about $1.3 billion in share repurchases in Q2. The increase in free cash flow included a $2.1 billion benefit from change in working capital due to the increase in our deferred merchant bookings and other current liabilities, partially offset by the increase in our accounts receivable.\nWe continue to return capital to shareholders and more recently have increased the pace of our repurchase given the pullback in our share price. In addition to the $1.3 billion of share repurchase in Q2, we repurchased another $840 million of our shares in the month of July, which brings our year-to-date repurchases to just over $3 billion and our outstanding authorization to about $7.4 billion. Given our recent increased pace of share repurchases, we now believe we'll complete our current authorization in about 2 years from when we started the repurchasing back in January.\nNow onto recent trends for the third quarter. Joint room nights increased about 4% versus 2019 or about 7%, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth fluctuated a bit in July and were strong in the second half of the month versus the comparable weeks in 2019. ADR growth remained at Q2 levels, and gross bookings were up just over 20% in July, including some help from flights, partly offset by negative impacts of FX pressure. In July, constant currency gross bookings were up about 35%.\nCompared with June, growth rates in July moderated in all regions with North America showing the smallest change. In July, Europe room night growth was up mid-single digits and up low double digits, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the U.S. was up 25%. Rest of World was up low single digits, and Asia was down about 10%, all versus 2019.\nWhen thinking about the rest of Q3, we realized there continues to be volatility in the environment, and our commentary assumes that room night growth for the fourth quarter will be at the same level we saw in July. We do expect the strength in ADRs we saw in July to continue for the remainder of the third quarter as well as continued strength in price and flight bookings. We expect the difference between the level of room night growth and gross booking growth for the full third quarter to be a few percentage points less than the 22% it was in Q2 due to factors, including more FX pressure in Q3. We expect FX pressure gross bookings by about 12% in Q3.\nIn July, the overall booking window Booking.com remained stronger than it was in 2019, similar to Q2. We expect Q3 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 70 basis points lower than in Q3 2019 due to investments in merchandising, consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunity for us to lean into a recovering travel market in 2022 and due to an increase in the mix of flights and some impact from FX rates. We expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable.\nWe expect Q3 marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings will be slightly above Q3 2019 as we expect to invest in capturing demand and increasing awareness during the peak travel season. We expect Q3 sales and other expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 40 basis points higher than it was in Q3 2021 due to higher gross booking mix and higher third-party call center costs, including the impact of our partnership with Majorelle. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 20% higher than Q3 2021 with personnel up about 10% and both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q3 of last year.\nThe year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher deal sales taxes, which are tied to revenue as well as increased personnel-related expenses due to return to a hybrid work environment. We expect IT expenses to increase year-over-year at a similar rate to what we saw in Q2.\nTaking all this into account, we would expect Q3 adjusted EBITDA to be slightly above Q3 2019. As I noted for Q2, the comparison of our Q3 EBITDA expectations to Q3 2019 is negatively impacted by changes in FX rates. At current exchange rates, we expect that our FX-neutral Q3 EBITDA growth versus 2019 will be about 15 percentage points higher than our expectation on a reported basis.\nWe know there's a lot of interest in what will happen beyond the summer. Booking.com's gross bookings for the Q4 travel period are over 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019 but with a high percentage of cancelable bookings. The booking window is still shorter than it was in 2019, which reduces the amount of gross bookings that we expect on the books for Q4 at this time. The shorter booking window limits our visibility into Q4, and we recognize that conditions could change rapidly.\nPlease note these Booking.com gross booking trends for Q4 period are on a euro basis. On a dollar basis, these growth rates would be about 10 percentage points lower.\nWe are maintaining the full year EBITDA margin commentary we provided in February and May, and we still expect EBITDA margin for 2022 to be a few points higher than in 2021. As a reminder, timing mainly impacts adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If it were not for the impact of timing, our expectations for the full year EBITDA margins would be a few points higher than our guidance for the year.\nAs the year has progressed, we revised our allocation of our growth investments between marketing and merchandising. We now expect marketing spend as a percentage to gross bookings to be about the same as it was in 2019 and expect to spend more on merchandising. This higher merchandising, along with a higher-than-anticipated mix of flights and some negative FX impact, means we expect our take rates for the year will now be in the mid-14% range. Our underlying accommodation take rates remain about the same as we were in 2019.\nIn conclusion, we're encouraged by our strong Q2 results and by the continued growth above 2019 levels we have seen in July. We remain confident that our focus on customer acquisition and our strategic priorities is the right approach for 2019 -- sorry, for 2022.\nWe'll now take your questions. Michelle?",

Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, and welcome to Booking Holdings' First Quarter Conference Call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.\nI am pleased to begin by reporting that our first quarter was a record. Our customers booked $27 billion in gross bookings, the highest quarterly amount ever. The continued improvement in our room night trends increased accommodation ADRs, and significant growth in our global flights products all contributed to achieving this gross bookings record.\nIn our accommodations business, we saw a meaningful improvement from last year with first quarter room nights declining only 9% versus Q1 2019, which was an improvement of 12 percentage points from our fourth quarter 2021 results. Our bookings continue to strengthen in April, with room nights increasing 10% and gross bookings up over 30% versus 2019, making April a record month for gross bookings and the first month that global room nights exceeded 2019 levels.\nAt Booking.com, I'm encouraged by the strong gross bookings already recorded for the summer period, which are over 15% higher than at the same point in 2019. In Western Europe and North America, gross bookings for the summer period are now over 30% ahead of where we were at this point in 2019, though I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable.\nOf course, our brands, our other brands, we are seeing the benefits of the global recovery from the pandemic with strong travel demand in the U.S. for Priceline, a rapid recent improvement in trends in Asia for Agoda, an uptick in international flight searches at KAYAK, and the return of diners to restaurants for OpenTable.\nIn many countries, especially across Europe and Asia, travel restrictions were eased in the first quarter, which we believe has contributed to the strengthening of travel demand trends. As we have said before, when leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people book travel. With that being said, there are still restrictions and inconveniences imposed on travelers today by some countries, though we believe that the industry is moving in the right direction and progressing back to normalcy.\nWhile we are pleased with the trends we are seeing right now across our brands, as we look towards the rest of the year, we are cognizant of the potential for macro uncertainty and are aware that inflation or other macro factors may have an impact on consumer demand. Now before providing further updates on our business, I want to address the devastating war in Ukraine. Since first hearing the terrible news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our first priority was the safety of our colleagues and supporting them through this time. We worked closely with our employees and their families in Ukraine to provide them with safe refuge, and we have continued to support humanitarian efforts in the region.\nAs we previously disclosed, in early March, we suspended travel services in Russia and Belarus. By mid-March, Booking.com developed and launched a no-commission initiative that enabled properties in select European countries to offer free or heavily discounted accommodations to refugees fleeing Ukraine. We believe that about 30,000 refugees have been provided with places to stay through this initiative so far. We continue to work closely with our hotel and home partners and expect to expand this program to more properties in the region.\nAs an example, Booking.com has partnered with Hilton and the UN Refugee Agency to make it easy for NGOs to book temporary accommodations on behalf of refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine. These rooms have been made available for free by Hilton at hundreds of their properties across Europe, which we, in turn, are providing through our platform. I am very proud of our team's quick actions to help our employees, customers, partners and the many people impacted by these tragic events. And of course, we all hope this barbaric violence ends soon.\nLet's now turn to the progress we're making in our business. We continue our work strengthening our core combination business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supply partners. For our customers, we are focused on their critical needs of value, choice and convenience. With this high degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and direct relationships with our customers over time. In March, our unique active customers at Booking.com were within 95% of 2019 levels, driven by strong growth in returning customers who had not made a previous booking in over a year. In the first quarter, we saw a higher mix of customers booking directly with us than in any of the last 3 quarters' first quarters -- 3 years' first quarters.\nWe see the strongest direct repeat customer behavior in our mobile app. And when compared to other platforms like desktop or mobile web, we continue to see more of our business shift to the app with over 40% of our room nights booked through our apps in the first quarter. Booking.com's app hit a new record in terms of monthly active users in Q1 and continue to be the #1 downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers, and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience. We will continue our efforts to enhance the app to build on the recent success we have seen here.\nFor our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform, which primarily means bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in the first quarter increased to about 31%, a couple of points higher than in Q1 2021. We continue to work on improving our alternative accommodation product globally, with an additional focus on the U.S. market. We've been working closely with property partners to identify opportunities to improve our platform to better fit their needs. Related to these efforts, we launched partner liability insurance for our alternative accommodation supply partners with global coverage in the first quarter. In addition, we are making progress on an enhanced payment solution for professional property managers that we're rolling out in the U.S.\nIn the first quarter, we saw the largest sequential net increase in alternative accommodation properties on Booking.com since the start of the pandemic. While the net increase in Q1 was still a modest number of properties, we are aiming to build on this growth throughout 2022 by continuing to improve our alternative accommodation offering and attracting more partners to our platform. And this week, we launched a new campaign in the U.S. to promote Booking.com to alternative accommodation owners and managers who want to grow their business with us.\nLet me now talk about the progress we've made in our interrelated strategic priorities of payments and the connected trend. We believe both of these priorities will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments, 34% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payment platform in the first quarter, which is our highest quarterly level ever. This year, we are focused on continuing to increase supplier adoption of payments while introducing new products and features that, over time, will improve the customer and partner experience and bring new revenue streams to our platform.\nWe will continue to position Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment service for both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative combinations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, Booking.com's payment platform helps deliver a more seamless and frictionless booking experience, which are important elements of our larger connected trip vision.\nOn our connected trip vision, we continue to make progress as we work on the foundations, such as developing a flight offering on Booking.com, which is now live in 40 countries. This flight offering gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers.\nWe have seen that in over 70% of our flight bookings on Booking.com, the flight was the first or only product that was booked. This helps confirm the value of flights as the starting point of many people's booking journey, and it is an anchor part that we can utilize to cross-sell accommodations and other products. A meaningful percentage of bookers who first book a flight, then book an accommodation. We will continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity and build on the early positive signals that we are seeing so far. Flights continues to be a source for new customers, with about 1/4 of all flight bookers in Q1 being new customers for Booking.com.\nWe've also seen recent success driving incremental room nights in experiments where discounts were applied to nonaccommodation products that were attached to the transaction. To put it simply, we believe having more products on the shelf increase our merchandising opportunities and helps us sell more room nights.\nFinally, as I previewed on our last earnings call, we published our 2021 sustainability report and our Climate Action Plan in March. In our Climate Action Plan, we highlighted the significant emission reductions we've already achieved, in part driven by sourcing 100% renewable energy for our offices by the end of last year. And we are committed to more than halving our emissions by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2040. We are proud of the emissions reduction achieved and ambitious targets set for our own business.\nBut as I said before, we believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through making it easier for travelers to find and book sustainable options. We are addressing this opportunity through our work with our Travel Sustainable badge program, which now includes over 100,000 properties that can highlight their sustainable practices to customers on Booking.com.\nIn conclusion, I am encouraged by the strength we are seeing in bookings, the level of summer travel on our books and the potential for a very busy travel year ahead. As we discussed last quarter, in this recovery environment, we will continue to lean into performance marketing channels and appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing this returning travel demand, and we will continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I said before, we are focusing on building a larger and faster-growing business with more products that is sustainable and generates more earnings dollars for the long run.\nI'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden.\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the first quarter and provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the second quarter. All growth rates for 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.\nNow on to our results for the first quarter. On our February earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends we've seen so far in 2022, with room nights getting back to about flat versus 2019 in the first half of February after declining 21% in January. Just hours after our earnings call on February 23, the terrible news broke that Russia had invaded Ukraine. As a result, we saw an immediate negative impact on our room night trends, particularly in Eastern Europe.\nDespite this impact towards the end of the month, room nights for the full month of February came in about in line with 2019 levels. In early March, we suspended the booking of travel services in Russia and Belarus. This led to a loss of new bookings as well as significantly elevated levels of cancellations of reservations for these countries. Additionally, we saw some slowdown in booking trends within Europe as travelers took in the news of the invasion. We disclosed that total room nights for the week ending March 6 were down about 10%, and that slowdown was driven by Eastern Europe, primarily Russia, and to a lesser extent, by Western Europe, which remained modestly above 2019 levels.\nI'm pleased to say that compared with the first week in March, we saw our overall trend improved during March driven mainly by Europe, resulting in room nights being down about 4% for the month, which is only a modest pullback from where we were in February. For the first quarter, room nights were down 9%, an improvement from down 21% in Q4 and our best quarter results since the onset of the pandemic. Excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, our room nights were down about 2% in March and down about 6% for the first full quarter.\nFor Q1, on a regional level, room nights in Europe and the rest of the world were both down mid-single digits. Asia was down about 35%, with all 3 improving from Q4 levels. The U.S. has strong growth versus Q1 2019, similar to what we saw in Q4. Mobile bookings, primarily through our apps, represented about 60% of our total room nights in the first quarter. Our apps were over 2/3 of our mobile bookings and over 40% of total room nights. In the first quarter, we continue to see an increased mix of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel versus Q1 2019 and Q1 2022.\nThe international mix of our total room nights in Q1 was about 40%, an encouraging increase from about 33% in Q4. Q1 international room nights were down about 30% compared to Q1 2019 levels, an improvement from the almost 40% -- for the almost 50% decline in Q4. The improvements in international bookings we saw continued to be driven mainly by travel plans within Europe. And these cross-border bookings continue to have, on average, longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019.\nWe saw strong growth in our domestic room nights for the first quarter, also an improvement from Q4. Our cancellation rates were about in line with 2019 levels in Q1 despite the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The booking window in Q1 at Booking.com contrasted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4, and this booking window expanded versus the first quarter of 2021.\nFor our alternative accommodations at Booking.com, the global mix of room nights increased to about 31% in Q1, a couple of points higher than 2021. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodation continues to be meaningfully higher than the global average.\nGross bookings increased 7% in Q1 versus 2019 and were up 10%, excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. This 7% increase in gross bookings was 16 percentage points better than the 9% room nights decline due to 18% higher accommodation constant currency ADRs, and also due to strong flight bookings across the group, partially offset by about 4 percentage points of negative FX movements.\nAs Glenn mentioned in his remarks, the $27 billion of gross bookings in Q1 is a new record for us, higher than the previous record of $25 billion in Q1 2019. March '23 -- 2022 was the first month our gross booking exceeded $10 billion in a single month. This was up 17% versus March 2019 and compares to up 18% in February and down 11% in January. Our accommodation constant currency ADRs benefited by about 3 percentage points from regional mix and about 15 percentage points from rate increases in most of our regions, notably -- most notably Europe and North America and especially in higher-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADR growth versus 2019 accelerated from 13% in Q4 to 18% in Q1, primarily due to higher rates in Europe.\nAirline tickets booked in the first quarter were up 152% versus 2019 and up 69% versus 2021, driven by continued expansion of Booking.com's flight platform as well as continued flight ticket growth at Priceline. Consolidated revenue for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, which was down 7% versus 2019 and down about 2% on a constant currency basis. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 150 basis points below Q1 2019, in line with our expectations, due primarily to differences between gross bookings -- the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. Our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q1 2019 levels.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 4% versus Q1 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings decreased about 50 basis points versus Q1 2019, which is better than our expectations, mainly due to higher-than-expected marketing ROIs. Sales and other expenses were up 58% versus Q1 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher third-party call center costs. About 34% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q1, up from 13% in Q1 2019. Compared to Q1 2021, sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings were about 30 basis points higher.\nOur more fixed expenses in aggregate were about in line with our expectations, up 12% versus Q4 and up 17% versus Q1 2021. Adjusted EBITDA was $310 million for the quarter, which was better than our expectations due to higher-than-expected ADRs and the better-than-expected leverage on our variable expenses. However, sequentially, EBITDA was down 67%, which is significantly more than the seasonal declines you saw pre-COVID and aligns with our commentary in February.\nNon-GAAP net income of $161 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $3.90, which was down 65% versus Q1 2019. Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 16% was lower than 90% in Q1 2019 due to a greater impact from a discrete tax benefit on a lower base of earnings. On a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $174 million in Q1. We recorded a GAAP net loss of $700 million in the quarter, which included an unrealized loss on our strategic investments of about $987 million and a $36 million loss on assets held for sale related to the Majorelle strategic partnership we discussed last quarter.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q1 ending cash investment balance of about $12.8 billion was down versus our Q4 ending balance of $14.3 billion, primarily driven by the payments of $1.1 billion for a margin debt maturity, about $950 million in share repurchases in Q1 and the decline in value of our strategic investments. These factors, which reduced our cash investment balance, were partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $1.6 billion, which is driven almost entirely by change in working capital resulting from an increase in our deferred merchant bookings balance.\nAs we disclosed on last quarter, we started returning capital to shareholders in early January. And in addition to share purchases in Q1, we repurchased about $325 million of our shares in April, which brings our outstanding authorization to just over $9 billion. As we said before, we expect to complete our remaining authorization within the next 3 years.\nNow moving on to our thoughts for the second quarter. April room nights increased about 10% versus 2019, an improvement from the 4% decline in March, driven primarily by Europe. Excluding Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, April room nights increased about 16% versus 2019. All regions showed improving room night growth in April. Europe was up high teens percent in April and up about 30%, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Growth in the U.S. was very strong. Rest of world had double-digit growth, and Asia recovered to down high teens percent all versus 2019.\nThe international mix of our room nights in April was over 45%, an encouraging increase from the 40% in Q1. April international room nights were down slightly compared to 2019 levels, an improvement from down 30% in Q1. International demand, driven mainly by travel plans in Europe, accounted for most of the improvements in room nights in April versus Q1. Domestic room nights also improved in April to very strong growth versus 2019.\nApril gross bookings increased over 30% versus 2019 driven by growth in room nights, continued accommodation ADR strength as well as continued strength in flight bookings. April gross bookings increased to almost $11 billion, which was a new monthly record. April gross bookings typically decline from March pre-COVID.\nWhilst it's encouraging to see continued improvements in trends into April, the environment is still uncertain and difficult to predict with confidence how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While many countries are lifting travel restrictions, COVID is still a factor which can impact travel. And of course, the war in Ukraine continues to create volatility and macro uncertainty. We do expect the recent strength of ADRs to continue for the remainder of the quarter. And as a result, we expect the difference between the level of room night growth and gross bookings growth for the full second quarter to be around 20 points, which is similar to what it was in April.\nIn April, the overall booking window of Booking.com continues to move back closer to 2019 levels. And we continue to see strength in our summer booking trends, and our gross bookings for summer are now more than 15% higher than they were at this time in 2019. And within Western Europe and North America, both up over 30%, albeit with a higher mix of canceled bookings. If the current trends continue, we could see a record summer travel season, and we're gearing up to prepare for that across all parts of our business.\nTurning back to Q2. Given recent booking trends, combined with lengthening booking window, we expect Q2 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 200 basis points lower than it was in Q2 2019. This 200 basis points of difference in revenue as a percentage of gross bookings is mainly timing related, and the impact could be greater if booking transact -- sorry, from April, especially if a high percentage of these bookings will stay in future quarters. The timing impact on take rates in Q2 is driven by a combination of the acceleration in gross bookings from up 7% in Q1 to up over 30% so far in Q2, coupled with the lengthening booking window from Q1 to Q2. We expect our underlying accommodation take rates to remain stable.\nWe expect marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings to be slightly higher than in Q2 2019, which is consistent with our prior commentary about the opportunities for us to lean into a recovering travel market in 2022. We expect Q2 sales and other expenses as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 60 basis points higher than it was in Q2 2021 due to higher merchant gross booking mix and higher third-party call center costs. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate to be about 15% higher than in Q2 2021, with personnel down slightly and both G&A and IT up meaningfully versus Q2 last year. The overall year-on-year increase -- the year-on-year increase in G&A is driven by higher digital sales taxes, which are tied to revenue, as well as increased office expenses due to return to hybrid work environments. We expect IT to increase year-over-year at similar rates to what we saw in Q1.\nIf we were to see similar top line growth rate for the rest of the quarter as we saw in April, we'd expect adjusted EBITDA to be over $900 million for the quarter. The expected timing difference between gross bookings and revenue, which is the primary driver of our expected 200 basis points lower take rate than Q1 2019, will have a significant negative impact on EBITDA in Q2 as our more variable expense lines are linked to bookings. If we normalize the timing impact on our take rates in Q2 2022 to be the same as it was in Q2 2019, adjusted EBITDA in Q2 2022 will be slightly higher than it was in Q2 2019.\nNow turning to the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle we discussed last quarter. As a reminder, Majorelle, one of our most trusted long-term external customer support partners, will begin employing most of the customer service representatives that previously worked for Booking.com outside of the Netherlands and the U.K. We currently anticipate finalizing this partnership around the middle of the year. And following the anticipated closing on a quarterly basis in the second half of 2022, we expect that personnel expenses will be lower by about $25 million a quarter, but G&A expenses will be lower by $6 million a quarter. And our S&O expenses will increase to offset the lower personnel and G&A expenses. As we said last quarter, we do not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative. Beyond 2022, we believe this partnership will help reduce further expense growth and enable a more efficient ramp-up of our customer service function.\nOutside of the P&L geography changes to the personnel G&A and sales and other expense line from Majorelle, we are maintaining the full year P&L commentary we provided last quarter. As a reminder, the expected timing -- we expect timing to negatively impact take rates. The precise impact of timing on our take rates for the year is difficult to predict as it's impacted by the rate of recovery of bookings coming into and during the year and also by the length of booking windows during the year. We do note that relative to 2021, there was a negative impact on our take rates due to timing in Q1 2022. Our current best estimate of take rates in 2022 is just below 15%, which is lower than 2019 primarily due to timing. We expect that our underlying accommodation take rates will remain stable.\nTiming also negatively impacts adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margins for the year. If not for the impact of timing, our expectations for full year EBITDA margins would be a few points higher than our guidance for the year.\nWe're encouraged by our better-than-expected Q1 results and the strengthening trends we've seen in April, and we are confident that our focus on customer acquisition and expanding our product offerings is the right approach for 2022.\nWe'll now take your questions. Charlotte, over to you, please, for Q&A.",

Go ahead, gentlemen.\n\nGlenn D. Fogel\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you and welcome to Booking Holdings' fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined this afternoon by our CFO, David Goulden.\nDespite the appearance of the Omicron variant in late November and its rapid spread throughout Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world, we closed out 2021 by delivering fourth quarter revenue and adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion and $940 million, respectively, which were better than we expected. Room nights decelerated from down 10% in October compared to 2019 to down 35% in December. However, I am pleased to say that since December, we have seen a meaningful improvement in top line trends, with room nights in the first half of February reaching 2019 levels and with gross bookings higher than 2019. At Booking.com, I'm encouraged to see strong gross bookings on our books for the summer period in Western Europe and North America, both of which are now ahead of where we were at this time in 2019. Although I note that a high percentage of these bookings are cancelable.\n2021 was a year in which our hopes for a return to normalcy were set back several times, first with the Delta variant and then Omicron. However, we witnessed proof that people have a deep desire to travel. When leisure travelers believe it is safe to travel and restrictions are lifted, people book travel, and we are currently seeing this starting to happen in many parts of the world.\nWhile this is a potentially favorable backdrop for 2022, we do expect there will still be periods when COVID negatively impacts travel trends as we move through the current year. David will provide additional details on our fourth quarter results and what we are seeing so far in the first quarter in his remarks.\nAs I look back over the last year, I am proud of the work we have done under still difficult times to strengthen our core accommodation business by driving benefits to our traveler customers and to our supplier partners. For our customers, we remain focused on addressing our customers' critical needs of value, choice and convenience.\nOne of the many ways we provide value for our customers and partners on Booking.com is through our Genius loyalty program. For our customers, our Genius loyalty program offers lower prices and other benefits like complimentary breakfast, room upgrades and discounted airport taxis. For our partners, our Genius program delivers incremental room nights to properties from our most loyal customers. Over the last year, we have meaningfully expanded our Genius loyalty program at Booking.com by opening the lowest level of Genius benefits to any customer who creates an account and is logged in on Booking.com.\nAt the beginning of 2022, we fully launched a third tier of Genius for our top customers that made at least 15 bookings in the last 2 years. These Genius Level 3 members have access to even lower prices and priority customer service support in addition to all the benefits available to Genius Levels 1 and 2. These improvements to our Genius program are indicative of our efforts to move beyond just the transaction and increase our focus on value for the customer. With a higher degree of customer focus, we aim to increase loyalty, frequency, spend and our direct relationships with our customers over time.\nOver the last year, we have enhanced Booking.com's mobile app, making it more user-friendly and easier to use. As I said before, the app is a critical platform as it allows us more opportunities to engage directly with travelers. It is also where an increasing number of bookings are happening, and ultimately, we see it as the center of our connected trip experience.\nIn 2021, Booking.com was the #1 downloaded OTA app globally according to a third-party research firm. For 2022, we are increasing our efforts to enhance the app in order to build on the success we saw over the last year. In the fourth quarter and for the full year, we saw a consistently higher mix of our customers booking directly with us than in 2019, and our direct mix improved even as we leaned into performance marketing channels during the year. We will continue to lean into performance marketing channels at appropriate ROIs as we look to bring more customer demand to our platform during the recovery.\nIn addition to performance marketing, we will be utilizing brand marketing, particularly in markets where we are looking to raise consumer awareness of our customer-facing brands. A timely example of that, which I hope all of you saw 2 weeks ago or so, was Booking.com's first Super Bowl ad in which we reintroduced the Booking. yeah slogan to our U.S. audience. We had a great year in the U.S. in 2021 with strong growth in room night and very strong growth in gross bookings versus 2019, even though Booking.com was relatively quiet from a brand marketing perspective. We are looking to accelerate the momentum of last year's performance by layering in brand marketing that extends beyond the Super Bowl ad through the rest of the year in order to introduce Booking.com to an even broader audience.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, we have an ambition to acquire more customers in the medium intent space. We continue to work on strengthening our foundations for digital marketing, including in social channels. However, our spend so far remains relatively small.\nFor our supply partners, we strive to be a valuable partner to all accommodation types on our platform, which means focusing on bringing incremental demand to properties from the broad audience of potential customers on our platform. For alternative accommodations, our global mix of room nights in 2021 of about 29% was in line with 2019 levels. In Europe, where our alternative accommodation offering is more competitive, our mix of room nights increased in 2021 by a few percentage points relative to 2019.\nWe continue to work on improving the competitiveness of our alternative accommodation offering in the U.S. market, where we have added targeted supply over the last year and have plans for more additions and improvements to come in 2022. We closed out the year with 2.4 million hotel and alternative accommodation properties and over 28 million total reported listings on Booking.com, both of which were stable relative to the prior year.\nLet me now talk about the progress we have made over the last year in some of our key strategic priorities around payments and the connected trip. These strategic priorities are interrelated, and we believe both will further enhance the strength of our core accommodations business and support its continued growth. On payments at Booking.com, we saw a further increase in adoption by our property partners in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, now with over half of U.S. gross bookings booked at properties that have adopted payments. Globally, about 60% of gross bookings are booked at properties that have adopted payments. About 30% of Booking.com's total gross bookings in Q4 were processed through our payment platform, which brings the full year 2021 mix to about 27% compared to about 22% for the full year 2020 and about 15% in 2019.\nWe will continue our work on positioning Booking.com as an attractive and trusted payment intermediary by providing payment options favored by both travelers and our supplier partners across hotels, alternative accommodations, cars, flight and attractions. Furthermore, we see Booking.com's payment platform as a key component of our larger connected trip vision. On our connected trip vision, we made progress in 2021 as we work to build a robust flight platform on Booking.com. This flight platform gives us the ability to engage with potential customers who choose their flight options early in their discovery process and allows us an opportunity to cross-sell our accommodation and other services to these flight bookers. Flights also enables us to provide a more complete travel offering to our accommodation of customers. Booking.com's flight platform is now live in 34 countries, which collectively represented about 70% of Booking.com's room nights booked in 2019.\nWe continue to see that over 25% of Bookings flight bookers are entirely new customers to the platform. And of those new customers, an encouraging percentage are attaching an accommodation to their flight booking. These are positive early signals, which help demonstrate that our flight offering can drive incremental new customers to us and we can cross-sell our accommodations product to them. We will continue our work to further optimize the cross-sell opportunity and build on the early positive signals we are seeing in flights.\nIn November, we announced our intention to acquire Etraveli for EUR 1.6 billion, and we expect to close the transaction later this year pending regulatory approvals. Etraveli is one of the largest flight-centric online travel agencies and is a leader in flight booking technology. They've developed a comprehensive technology platform sourcing complex flight content from a variety of supply providers, which is then distributed to consumer-facing sites. Booking.com and Etraveli have been successfully partnering over the last 2 years with Etraveli powering Bookings flight product. Given the strategic importance of flights to our connected trip offering, we believe it is critical to bring Etraveli flight expertise and technology in-house while also unlocking some of the limitations that exist in our current commercial agreement. When the deal closes, Etraveli will continue to operate as an independent company within Booking Holdings while further supporting the development of booking.com's flight platform.\nOutside of flights, Booking.com has significantly improved the coverage of its attractions product over the last year, in part due to the successful integration of third-party supply from Viator and Musement. We now have bookable attractions available in cities that represent about half of Booking.com's accommodation transactions, which is up from about 10% coverage a year ago. While the volume of attractions bookings is still modest, we believe that developing a compelling, easy-to-use attractions product will help keep travelers engaged with our platform through the trip and build loyalty.\nWe had a very busy end to 2021 and start to 2022, so I'd like to address a few other important recent updates. First, I am very excited to welcome the Getaroom team to Booking Holdings. We closed our $1.2 billion acquisition of Getaroom at the end of December, and we are well underway with integrating Getaroom into Priceline, where it will help expand Priceline's current strategic partnerships business. Getaroom is a B2B-focused distributor of hotel rooms, primarily servicing leisure demand through about 150 affiliate partners primarily in the North American market.\nThe B2B business is an important component and channel in our expansion efforts to reach new customers and partners, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. We believe B2B business can generate attractive returns by providing inventory to affiliate partners without the B2B business needing to invest significant dollars in brand marketing or online performance channels to generate customer demand. I am confident that the combined strategic partnership business of Priceline and Getaroom will improve B2B distribution for hotel partners while offering a robust accommodations technology stack for affiliate partners to help further enhance our offerings in North America.\nSecond, some of you may have seen the news 2 weeks ago that Booking.com plans to enter into an expanded strategic partnership with Majorelle, one of our most trusted long-term external customer support partners. As part of this partnership, which is still subject to consultation with works councils and regulatory approvals, Majorelle will begin employing most of the customer service representatives that previously worked for Booking.com outside The Netherlands and the U.K. We have been successfully working with Majorelle for 6 years in order to help meet the evolving seasonal demands of our business, and we believe that this expanded partnership will help increase the flexibility and efficiency of our customer service offering going forward.\nFinally, on our last earnings call in early November, I discussed the urgency of tackling the global climate crisis and the importance of our industry coming together to work towards the goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. Shortly after that earnings call, Booking.com launched its Travel Sustainable Program. This is a first-of-its-kind program that features a travel-sustainable badge for any property on our platform that has implemented a combination of sustainable practices.\nWhen searching for accommodations, travelers can see whether or not a property has been given a travel-sustainable badge and can filter search results based on the badge. We believe our greatest influence on sustainable travel is through enabling our accommodation partners to showcase their sustainable practices to travelers who are looking for ways to travel more sustainably. We are looking forward to talking more about this program and other efforts and commitments related to sustainability when we publish our 2021 sustainability report and our first climate action plan in March.\nIn conclusion, we executed well and produced strong results in 2021. As we look ahead to 2022, I am encouraged by the quick rebound in bookings we have seen so far this year and the level of summer travel on our books. While we expect to see some volatility in trends as a result of the ongoing effects of COVID, I am confident in the continued recovery in travel demand globally as there is clearly a very strong desire to travel among our leisure bookers.\nOf course, we are concerned and are monitoring the situation in Eastern Europe, which we recognize could be disruptive to travelers who may be going to that region. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue capturing travel demand, and we'll continue our work executing against our strategic priorities. As I have said before, we are thinking about our business beyond just getting back to 2019 levels of demand. And we are focused on building a larger and faster-growing business with more products that generate some more earnings after the full recovery and for the long run.\nI will now turn the call over to our CFO, David Goulden. David?\n\nDavid I. Goulden\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Booking Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Glenn, and good afternoon. I'll review our results for the fourth quarter, provide some color on the trends we've seen so far in the first quarter and our thoughts on 2022. All growth rates for 2021 and 2022 are relative to the comparable period in 2019 unless otherwise indicated. Information regarding reconciliation of non-GAAP results to GAAP results can be found in our earnings release.\nNow on to our results for the fourth quarter. On our November earnings call, we discussed the improvement in trends that we saw throughout the third quarter driven by Europe, followed by a further improvement in October driven by Asia. You will recall the trends weakened in Europe towards the end of October driven by a number of countries that have seen recent increases in the Delta variant infections at that time.\nIn November, we saw a slowdown from October in our overall trends driven mainly by Europe, and this slowdown continued to worsen in December across all regions with future Omicron variant concerns. This resulted in Q4 reported room nights declining 21% versus Q4 2019, which was 11% worse than the 10% decline in October but only a few points worse than the 18% decline in Q3. December room nights were 35% below 2019.\nLooking across the full quarter. The slowdown in Q4 versus Q3 was driven primarily by Europe, which declined about 20% versus Q4 2019, while our other regions improved in Q4 versus Q3. Compared with Q4 2019, the U.S. continued to have strong growth in the fourth quarter, while Asia was still down considerably and rest of the world was down modestly. However, as I mentioned, we saw a slowdown across all of our regions in December, most meaningfully in Europe and in the U.S.\nMobile bookings primarily through our apps represented 2/3 of our total room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our apps continue to represent an increasing majority of our mobile bookings. We all continue to see greater than 50% of our total room nights coming to us through the direct channel. Our direct channel increased as a percentage of our room nights in the fourth quarter and for the full year relative to 2020 and 2019.\nThe international mix of our total room nights in Q4 was about 33%, in line with Q3. Q4 international room nights were down almost 50% compared to Q4 2019 levels, a few points worse than the decline in Q3. We continue to see growth in our domestic room nights in the fourth quarter, also a level slightly below Q3. The December slowdown was more severe for international than for domestic.\nOur cancellation rates were up a few percentage points versus 2019 in Q4 and for the full year and increased meaningfully in December due to concerns about the Omicron variant. The booking window in Q4 of Booking.com was much shorter than it was in the fourth quarter of 2019 and contracted further in December as customers focused mainly on short-term travel needs.\nAlternative accommodation of Booking.com, the global mix of room nights is about 27% in Q4 and about 29% for the full year was in line with 2019 levels. The global mix was impacted by the underperformance of Europe relative to North America. Within Europe, our mix of alternative accommodations increased in Q4 by a couple of percentage points and for the full year, by a few percentage points relative to 2019.\nGross fee declined 8% in Q4, which is less than the 21% decline in room nights due to an increase in average daily rates for accommodations on a constant currency basis of about 13% versus 2019 and very strong performance in our flights business. Our accommodation constant currency ADR benefited by about 4 percentage points from an increased mix of business in North America, which is a higher-ADR region; and a decrease of mix in business in Asia, which is a lower-ADR region. Excluding regional mix effects, constant currency ADRs were up about 9% driven by rate increases in most of our regions, most notably in Europe and North America and especially in higher-demand, leisure-oriented destinations. Constant currency ADRs were higher than expected due in part to continued higher rates for flexible bookings plus generally higher pricing in North America and in Europe.\nAirline tickets booked in the fourth quarter were up 116% and for the full year, were up 104% versus 2019 driven by very strong growth of Priceline and by-flight bookings at Booking.com. We're encouraged to see a full year of triple-digit growth from our flights business, which is a key component of our multiproduct connected trip strategy.\nConsolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was almost $3 billion, down sequentially 36% from Q3 2021 and 11% below Q4 2019. Q4 2021 revenue was more than double the $1.2 billion of revenue we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 revenue was stronger than our expectation due to higher ADRs and a shorter booking window. Revenue was less impacted than bookings from Omicron in Q4. Revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 40 basis points below Q4 2019, which was better than our expectations as the deceleration within Q4 more negatively impacted our gross bookings than revenue in the quarter. Excluding timing impacts, our underlying accommodation take rates were about in line with Q4 2019 levels.\nOur full year revenue was almost $11 billion, which is 27% below 2019 but improved 61% versus 2020. Full year revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was 14.3%, which was lower than 15.6% in 2019, primarily due to the timing differences between gross bookings and revenue recognition. The strong revenue results in the fourth quarter helped drive adjusted EBITDA of $940 million, which was 27% below Q4 2019. Sequentially, Q4 EBITDA was down 55%, which is better than we expected. This was driven primarily by the higher-than-expected revenue and lower-than-expected OpEx in our more fixed expense categories.\nMarketing expense, which is a highly variable expense line, decreased 2% versus Q4 2019. Marketing expense as a percentage of gross bookings increased slightly versus 2019, in line with our expectations. The marketing ROIs were a little lower than our expectations due to the negative impact of cancellations late in the quarter, and this was offset by a higher-than-expected mix of direct business.\nSales and other expenses were 21% higher than Q4 2019 due to a higher volume of merchant gross bookings and higher outsourced call center costs. About 30% of Booking.com's gross bookings were processed through our payments platform in Q4 and about 27% for the full year, up from 22% in 2020.\nWe expected our more fixed expense categories in aggregate to be about in line with Q3 due to lower personnel costs offset by higher IT and G&A costs. They came in 10% lower than Q3 due to year-end finalization of our bonus expense accruals as well as lower-than-expected IT costs. This means our Q4 personnel expenses do not reflect our run rates going into 2022.\nNon-GAAP net income of $554 million results in non-GAAP EPS of $15.83, which were down 32% versus Q4 2019. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was higher than 18% in Q4 2019. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate of 20% was 1% higher than in 2019 due to a high proportion of nondeductible tax expenses -- nontax-deductible expenses in relation to a lower pretax income versus 2019.\nOn a GAAP basis, we had operating income of $848 million in Q4. We recorded GAAP net income of $618 million in the quarter, which included income tax expense of $198 million.\nNow on to our cash and liquidity position. Our Q4 ending cash and investment balance of $14.3 billion was down versus our Q3 ending balance of $15.4 billion primarily driven by the $1.2 billion Getaroom acquisition, partially offset by positive free cash flow of about $178 million.\nTwo housekeeping notes about Getaroom. The first is that it closed at the end of Q4 and was not meaningful to Q4 results. The second is that we did not include the incremental room nights from Getaroom in our commentary about January and February. These incremental room nights will be included when we release our Q1 actual results.\nIn early January, we started returning capital to shareholders under our remaining authorization and have to date purchased about $500 million. Assuming that travel recovery continues, we still expect to complete our remaining organization within the next 3 years.\nNow on to our thoughts for the first quarter. And to remind you, we'll make comparisons with 2019 unless otherwise indicated. January room nights declined about 22%, an improvement from the 35% decline in December as concerns around the Omicron variant eased. This improvement was driven primarily by a recovery in cross-border travel within the European region and domestic travel in Europe. We saw room nights trends improving throughout January and continuing into February. Our room nights in the first half of February were about in line with 2019 levels, and gross bookings were higher.\nIn the first half of February, we saw a meaningful improvement across all of our regions compared to January. The U.S. has strong room night growth versus 2019 in the first half of February, while Europe had about 10% growth. Rest of the world was up slightly, and Asia was down about 35%. Our mix of international room night recovered from about 23% in December to over 40% in the first half of February, which is the highest international mix we've seen since the start of COVID. As a reminder, our pre-COVID international mix was just over 50%.\nAs I mentioned, the improvements we see in the first half of February are broad-based with large countries in Europe and international travel routes within Europe driving the largest impact. The new cross-border bookings we're seeing in Q1 in Europe on average have a longer length of stay and a shorter booking window than comparable bookings in 2019. As we've seen throughout the pandemic, when travel restrictions are lifted and traveler confidence increases, bookings improve quite quickly.\nGiven the rapid changes during the first half of Q1, it's difficult to predict how room nights for the remainder of the quarter will develop. While it's encouraging to see the recent improvements, we are still in a potentially volatile environment with high COVID infection rates in some part of the world and geopolitical uncertainty that could impact our business, especially in Europe. So far in Q1, the overall booking window of Booking.com has contracted less versus 2019 than it did in Q4. We've seen recent strength in our summer booking trends, and our gross bookings for the summer are higher than they were at this time in 2019.\nThe summer booking trends are stronger in Western Europe, where gross bookings for the same period are up double digits versus 2019, and gross bookings for the U.S. are also higher for the summer than they were at this time in 2019. Of course, a very high percentage of all bookings for summer are cancelable, so things could change rapidly.\nTurning to the income statements. We expect the change in gross bookings in Q1 versus 2019 to be several percentage points better than the change in room nights due to an increase in ADRs and very strong flight bookings. Constant currency ADRs in Q1 so far have increased versus 2019 at a similar rate to Q4. We expect Q1 revenue as a percentage of gross bookings to be about 1.5 percentage points lower than in Q1 2019 as the booking deceleration in Q4 negatively impacts revenue -- negatively impact on revenue, and the booking recovery in Q1 benefits revenue in future quarters. This 1.5 percentage points of difference in revenue as percentage gross bookings could be higher if booking trends increased meaningfully from the first half of February, especially if a high percentage of these bookings offer stays in future quarters.\nWe expect margin expenses in Q1 will trend about in line with gross bookings compared to Q1 2019. We expect sales and other expense in Q1 as a percentage of gross bookings to be about the same as it was in Q4. We expect our more fixed expenses in aggregate will be about 15% higher in Q1 than in Q4 on a dollar basis due to the impact of seasonal increase in benefit costs, the 2021 year-end personnel-related accrual finalizations and the impact of planned hiring as well as increases in IT expenses, including some deferral from Q4.\nIn my just explained and reminding you that Q1 is our seasonally lowest quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be positive but down sequentially from Q4 significantly more than the sequential declines we saw pre-COVID primarily due to the impact of Omicron on Q1 revenues. As we think about the full year ahead, we're encouraged about the strong summer bookings we're seeing so far, and we're optimistic about the continued recovery of later travel. However, we do expect continued volatility in our top line trends driven by COVID. There are other uncertainties on the horizon, including the current geopolitical situation, which could impact travel.\nIf we look at Russia and Ukraine combined as destination markets, they represent a very low single-digit percentage of our total gross bookings. All this makes it very difficult to predict how the top line will progress during the year and how the full year will turn out. As we think about the recovery of travel in 2022 and the opportunity in front of us, we plan to invest in marketing other incentives and improvements and expansion of our products to attract existing and new customers to our platforms and to drive additional loyalty in the future. This also requires investments in people and technology.\nWe're excited about the opportunity to expand our business, and we believe we can strengthen our position in accommodations and build a much more complete travel solution for our customers and partners. We believe this is the right thing to do for higher longer-term returns from our business.\nWith this in mind, there are a few factors to consider when thinking about shape of the P&L for the full year. These fall into 4 buckets: revenue, marketing, sales and other expenses and our more fixed operating expenses. Starting with revenue as a percentage of gross bookings, we expect this to be higher in 2022 than it was in 2021 but lower than in 2019. In 2021, our revenue as a percentage of gross bookings was about 130 basis points lower than 2019, mainly due to timing differences between the recovery of gross bookings and revenue. In 2022, we expect this timing to be less of an impact than it was in 2021.\nMoving to marketing. There are a number of factors that come into play. We expect the environment to remain competitive, especially as the leisure travel market moves closer towards full recovery. We intend to remain disciplined in our performance marketing ROIs, and we'll continue to invest in developing the medium intent social media channels, and you'll see us active in branding in the U.S. and other major markets. Our goal continues to be to use our marketing strength to gain share in markets where we can with reasonable returns. We expect to run initiatives and programs during the year to attract both existing and new customers to our platforms.\nIt's difficult to know exactly how these factors will play out across the year, but we expect marketing as a percentage of gross bookings to be a little higher than it was in 2019 and also in 2021. Of course, an increasing direct mix helps our marketing efficiency, and we believe the investments we're making will result in a higher direct mix over time.\nTurning to sales not expenses. We expect these to be up 50 basis points higher than in 2021 as a percentage of gross bookings. This is mainly from additional payment processing costs but also impacted by anticipated higher third-party customer service expenses. The additional expenses related to payments are offset by a higher payment-related revenue.\nThe last area is our more fixed operating expenses, which include personnel, G&A and IT. We expect our personnel expenses to be impacted by higher-than-average annual wage increases, especially in the product and technology areas; and by planned headcount increasing in key areas, including product and technology and bond-related functions. We expect personnel expenses to be about 10% higher than in 2021. We expect that G&A and IT will both grow faster than personnel driven by a number of factors, including digital services taxes, returning to a hybrid work environment and the investments to enhance our customer and partner-facing and internal systems.\nThe comments we made for 2022 do not include the anticipated reduction to personnel expense and increases to sale and other expense from the enhanced strategic partnership with Majorelle that Glenn spoke about. We do not anticipate much of an impact on adjusted EBITDA in 2022 from this initiative, and we'll update you again in May. Also, we expect our acquisition of Getaroom to have a small positive impact on our P&L in 2022. As Glenn noted, we expect that the Etraveli acquisition will close later this year, which will result in a minor impact to the P&L in 2022.\nSo when thinking about the shape of the P&L in 2022, these factors mean that revenue recovery will lag the gross bookings recovery and EBITDA recovery will lag revenue recovery. Some of the lag in EBITDA versus revenue is timing, i.e. the marketing we spend on bookings we expect to recover ahead of revenue. On top of this, we plan to make investments in customer acquisition and in expanding our product offerings we mentioned earlier. Taken together, we expect our EBITDA margins in 2022 to be a few points higher than we were in 2021.\nLooking beyond 2022, we continue to remain focused on investing to build a larger and faster-growing business with more products than we had pre-COVID that delivers more EBITDA dollars and more earnings per share with industry-leading EBITDA margins.\nIn closing, we're confident in our ability to capture demand as the global travel market recovers and to execute against our strategic priorities.\nWith that, we'll take your questions. And Chris, I'll turn the call over to you for Q&A.",

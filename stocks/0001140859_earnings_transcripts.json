Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.incr.com. We also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website.\nDuring this conference call, we will discuss forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change.

[Operator Instructions].\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert P. Mauch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Group President, Pharmaceutical Distribution & Strategic Global Sourcin, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, Bennett. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining Cencora's Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I'll begin today by expressing my gratitude to our team members, who power our results, advance our strategy and lead with purpose. In fiscal 2025, Cencora achieved strong financial performance. with adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%, driven by our strategic positioning and specialty, thoughtful investments to enhance our solutions in fast-growing areas of the market and continued strong pharmaceutical utilization trends. The results our team members deliver demonstrate the unique value we provide to our leading customers, both pharma manufacturers and providers as an end-to-end health care services company.\nAs a reflection of our confidence in continued market growth, the strength and positioning of our business, our successful investments in key growth areas like specialty, and conviction in our continued execution, we are pleased to be raising our long-term guidance for adjusted operating income growth to 6% to 9% and our adjusted EPS growth to 9% to 13%. During the year, we made considerable progress in strengthening our role as a leading health care services provider through our disciplined focus, our strategy going forward centers on 3 growth priorities: leading with market leaders, enhancing patient access to pharmaceuticals and strengthening our position in specialty as well as 4 strategic drivers enabling our execution.\nFirst, prioritizing growth-oriented investments. We're committed to advancing our leadership in the health care industry, which requires us to invest significantly, both organically and inorganically, in the areas that will strengthen our strategic positioning and drive long-term value; second, improving the customer experience by leveraging advanced data analytics and technologies. We are enhancing how we utilize technology and analytics to expand our services and solutions while also generating admirable insights to inform our industry parts. Third, driving a best-in-class talent experience. Our people are our most important asset.\nAt Cencora, we are committed to empowering our talent with the skills and experiences they need to build meaningful careers as our industry and work continue to evolve. And fourth, identifying ongoing process and capability improvements. We're focused on enhancing our productivity becoming even more integrated and efficient in serving the dynamic pharmaceutical supply chain. Today, I want to highlight the [indiscernible] of strengthening our position in specialty and how we are strategically prioritizing growth-oriented investments. I'll begin with how Sancor is prioritizing growth-oriented investments to fuel our long-term growth. Cencora is making investments that align with our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and elevate our offering, and we regularly evaluate our portfolio to ensure we are focusing on areas that advance our long-term vision.\nAs announced this morning, we undertook a thorough review of our portfolio as part of our approach to prioritize growth-oriented investments. This review led us to sharpen our focus for the businesses included in both our U.S. and International Healthcare Solutions segments. We identified specific areas of the business that do not align as closely with our strategy going forward, specifically our Animal Health business, MWI, our legacy U.S. hub services, our equity investment in Pro Pharma in Brazil and certain components of PharmaLex. As a result, we're evaluating strategic alternatives for these businesses and are grouping them as other in our financial reporting to provide additional transparency for our investors. By evaluating alternatives for these businesses, we will identify the right long-term partners to help the businesses within other capitalize on the strength of their offerings while we focus on executing against Cencora's strategy and our rating business. We believe this prioritization will allow us to effectively deploy resources against our growth priorities, for example, strengthening our position in specialty. The acquisition of Retina Consultants of America, RCA is a recent investment that reflects our commitment to strengthening our leadership in specialty.\nSince the acquisition closed earlier this year, RCA has continued to demonstrate the unique value the platform provides for physicians while our joint teams have been identifying areas where we can augment the RCA value proposition. The MSO relationship is key for providers. With RCA now part of Cencora and our pathway to full ownership of One Oncology, we are excited about our ability to drive growth while contributing positively to patient outcomes by increasing time physicians can spend with patients, enhancing access to innovative treatments through renowned research capabilities and informing best practices in community-based care.\nWe're also prioritizing internal investments. This morning, we were proud to announce significant investments totaling $1 billion through 2030 to amplify our distribution network, including opening a second national distribution center and expanding our existing specialty distribution capacity. These investments will allow us to better support our customers with additional cold chain storage as the specialty market grows. This commit builds on our track record of successful investments to expand our infrastructure and will enhance the resiliency and efficiency of our supply chain to ensure we are well positioned to handle the rising demand and complexity of pharmaceutical treatments.\nWe're confident we have the right culture and strategy to ensure we continuously strengthen our business to support growth. I'll now turn the call to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 results, fiscal 2026 guidance and Cencora's updated long-term items. Jim?\n\nJames F. Cleary\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to a review of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025 results. As a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. fiscal 2025 was a pivotal year for Syncora as we took decisive steps to advance our strategy, guided by our strategic priorities and growth drivers and delivered impressive results due to our team members who remain committed to our customers and patients.\nTo reflect our strong execution, intentional positioning in and prioritization of growth-oriented areas, and positive core fundamentals, we are pleased to be raising our long-term guidance for adjusted diluted EPS and operating income, which I will discuss in more detail following a review of our results. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. We completed the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.80, an increase of 15%, driven by strong performance in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, Consolidated revenue was $83.7 billion, up 6%, driven by growth in both reportable segments, primarily due to continued volume growth.\nIn the quarter, GLP-1s were a less meaningful contributor to revenue growth than in recent quarters and represented a 40 basis points contribution to our consolidated revenue growth. Moving to gross profit. consolidated gross profit was $2.9 billion, up 18%, largely driven by gross profit growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.47%, an increase of 37 basis points primarily due to the gross profit contribution from our acquisition of Retina Consultants of America. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.9 billion, up 18%, primarily due to the RCA acquisition and in support of our overall revenue growth. Turning now to operating income. Consolidated operating income was $1.0 billion, up 20% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income was driven by continued strong growth in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing segment-level results. Moving now to our net interest expense.\nNet interest expense was $78 million, an increase of $57 million, primarily due to the $3.3 billion in debt raised to finance a portion of the RCA acquisition. In the September quarter, we repaid $500 million of our existing term loan. As a result, we have now already repaid $700 million of the $1.5 billion 3-year term loan, which was issued in January as part of the RCA financing. Moving to effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 20.6% compared to 20.3% in the prior year quarter.\nFinally, our diluted share count was 195.3 million shares, a 1% decrease compared to the prior year fourth quarter, primarily driven by opportunistic share purchases completed earlier this fiscal year. This completes the review of our consolidated results.\nNow I'll review our segment results for the fourth quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $75.8 billion, up approximately 6% versus the prior year quarter as we continued to benefit from strong utilization trends. Sales of GLP-1 products increased $876 million or 10% year-over-year, representing a 50 basis point contribution to segment revenue growth. As a reminder, we indicated on our third quarter earnings call, the moderation in U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth was expected and then was [indiscernible] in Street consensus.\nTurning now to operating income. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased by 25% to $872 million due to growth across our distribution businesses and the contribution from RCA. During the quarter, we continued to see good volumes in specialty across health systems and physician practices as our partnerships with leaders in both channels drove solid growth, more than offsetting the previously disclosed loss of an oncology customer that occurred at the end of June due to its acquisition by a peer.\nTurning now to Internet Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, the National Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $7.9 billion, an increase of 8% on an as-reported basis and an increase of 6% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by revenue growth in our European distribution business. International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income was $151 million, a 2% decrease on an as-reported basis and a 6% decrease on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by continued pressure in our global consulting services businesses partially offset by growth in all other business units in the segment. In our European distribution business, we saw continued strong demand for our 3PL services which includes logistics for specialty products and signed a number of new contracts. Additionally, during the quarter, we were encouraged to see a rebound in our global specialty logistics business where shipment volumes return to growth. Before I turn to our full year fiscal 2025 results, I would like to take a moment to discuss our GAAP operating income results in the fourth quarter. which includes a $724 million goodwill impairment related to PharmaLex, as noted in our press release.\nPharma has continued to experience persistent demand challenges, which resulted in the business falling below our original expectations and declining year-over-year. We have taken steps to better position PharmaLex for long-term success -- as part of the strategic review Bob mentioned in his remarks, we've made the decision to simplify PharmaLex's business and will now only be focused on 3 main areas where we are better positioned. Pharma [indiscernible], market access and regulatory affairs. We are evaluating strategic alternatives for PharmaLex's other service verticals. That concludes the discussion of our fiscal fourth quarter financials. Now I'll turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2025 results compared to the prior year, beginning with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $321.3 billion up 9%. [indiscernible] an increase of 16%.\nWe continued to benefit from volume growth, particularly growth in specialty and 3/4 of contribution from the RCA acquisition. Concluding the discussion of our full year fiscal 2025 results. During the year, we generated $3 billion of adjusted free cash flow and ended the year with a cash balance of $4.4 billion. During the year, in addition to investing in our business through capital expenditures and furthering our strategy through M&A, we continue to prioritize returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases that totaled close to $900 million. This morning, we were pleased to announce our 21st consecutive annual dividend increase with our Board of Directors approving a 9% increase to our quarterly dividend once again, aligning our dividend growth rate to the low end of our long-term guidance or adjusted diluted EPS growth. This completes the review of our full fiscal year results.\nBefore I turn to a discussion of our fiscal 2026 guidance and updates to our long-term guidance I will take a moment to discuss our updated financial reporting structure that Bob mentioned in his remarks. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 in addition to our 2 reportable segments, U.S. health care solutions and international health care solutions, we'll begin reporting certain businesses that we are exploring strategic alternatives for under other. Through this increased transparency, we hope to provide our investors with additional visibility into the strength of our go-forward business performance and trajectory as we prioritize growth-oriented businesses aligned with our strategy.\nAs Bob mentioned Other includes MWI Animal Health, our equity staking held overview of guidance, Slides 11 and 12 of our earnings presentation, including constant currency guidance for our International Healthcare Solutions segment. Starting with EPS. We expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $17.45 to $17.75, representing growth of 9% to 11%. Now I'll provide some details on the items contributing to this EPS growth. Beginning with revenue, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be in the range of 5% to 7%, reflecting U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%.\nInternational Healthcare Solutions revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and other revenue growth in the range of 0% to 4%. Turning to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%, reflecting U.S. Healthcare Solutions operating income growth in the range of 9% to 11%, International Healthcare Solutions operating income growth in the range of 5% to 8% and and other operating income decline in the range of 1% to 4%.\nBefore turning to our additional guidance assumptions given our updated reporting structure, I wanted to provide some additional context on the makeup of other to assist in your modeling. First, MWI Animal Health represents nearly 70% of others revenue based on fiscal 2025 results. In fourth quarter, the business continued its strong performance and ended fiscal 2025 with full year revenue growth of 6%. The Second, Pro Pharma, a stand-alone pharmaceutical distribution business in Brazil represents about 1/4 of revenue and other based on fiscal 2025 results.\nAs a reminder, given the nature of the equity stake we hold in pro Pharma, we consolidate its financials and eliminate a portion of net income not attributable to Syncora through our noncontrolling interest line. Now moving to interest expense. We expect our interest expense to be in the range of $315 million to $335 million. As a reminder, we issued a majority of the debt related to the RCA acquisition in December 2024 with the acquisition closing in January 2025. As a result, our interest expense will be higher in fiscal 2026 due to the incremental quarter of higher interest expense.\nTurning to income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% for fiscal 2026. Moving now to share count. We expect that our full year average share count will be approximately 194 million shares for fiscal 2026. This contemplates approximately $1 billion in share repurchases over the course of the fiscal year. Regarding our capital expenditure expectations in fiscal 2026, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $900 million, while the CapEx dollar spend is elevated relative to recent years as a percentage of gross profit, it aligns with historical periods when we've made significant investments in our infrastructure. In addition to the U.S. supply chain infrastructure investments Bob mentioned, we will be making IT investments to support our digital transformation. As it relates to free cash flow, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion for fiscal 2026.\nBefore I conclude my remarks and provide an update on our long-term guidance, while we do not provide guidance on a quarterly basis, there are a few things to keep in mind on our quarterly operating income cadence as you review your models. First, as we have discussed, at the end of June, we lost an oncology customer following its acquisition by a peer. This impact was fully reflected in our results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. However, we will have a headwind related to this loss for the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2026. As you update your quarterly models to reflect the fiscal 2026 guidance, we would expect growth to pick up in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as we begin to lap this customer loss.\nSecond, completed the RCA acquisition at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and we'll begin to lap the inclusion of RCA and our results. A lot of the oncology customer an incremental quarter of contribution from RCA represent a net headwind of 1% for our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment in fiscal 2026. To conclude, Cencora has clearly delivered strong performance over the years as our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and positioning and specialty have allowed us to capitalize on positive industry trends driven by our team members' focus and execution.\nIn recognition of this performance track record and underlying industry fundamentals, including continued innovation and demographic trends, we are pleased to be raising our long-term adjusted operating income growth guidance to a range of 6% to 9% from our prior range of 5% to 8%. This is driven by our increased expectations for our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, where we are now calling for adjusted operating income growth of 6% to 9% and up from our previous range of 5% to 8%, powered by our strong positioning in specialty and our efforts to augment our solutions offerings to our customers. with our long-term EPS contribution from M&A and share repurchases unchanged at 3% to 4%. We feel we are strongly positioned to grow EPS over the long term in the range of 9% to 13%.\nBefore we open the line for questions, I will turn the call back to Bob for his closing remarks. Bob?\n\nRobert P. Mauch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Group President, Pharmaceutical Distribution & Strategic Global Sourcin, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, Jim. Fiscal '25 was a pivotal year for Cencora as we strengthened our leadership in specialty through the acquisition of RCA and took key steps to sharpen our focus and execution in alignment with our strategy. It is our obligation as a health care company to continue to champion innovation and efficiency. We are focused on driving continued strong growth for our enterprise by leveraging our robust infrastructure, differentiated capabilities and continued investment in specialty, including our MSO platform. Cencora's growth priorities are clear as we are leading with market leaders enhancing patient access to pharmaceuticals and relentlessly strengthening our position in specialty. Once again, I want to thank the Cencora team members. It is due to their disciplined execution and commitment to our purpose that Jim and I are able to report strong results and guidance. As we look ahead, we're positioning ourselves for long-term growth and value creation, informed by our strategic drivers and growth priorities and guided by our purpose.\nWe are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to hand over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasury to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nBennett S. Murphy\n\nHead, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Results.

Mauch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Group President, Pharmaceutical Distribution & Strategic Global Sourcin, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, Bennett. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining Cencora's fiscal 2025 third quarter earnings call. To start, I'd like to thank the over 51,000 Syncora team members for the industry-leading expertise and purpose-driven approach they bring to work each day. Their talent and commitment fuel our growth as we continue to strengthen our position as an end-to-end health care solutions provider. Through the strength of our strategy, services and unwavering standards Cencora's business model is driven by pharmaceutical distribution and complemented by higher margin, high-growth value-added services and solutions for our biopharma and provider customers.\nIn our third quarter, Cencora delivered strong performance with adjusted operating income growth of 21% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 20%. In recognition of our outperformance during the quarter year-to-date both in the U.S. segment and on a consolidated basis, we are pleased to once again raise our fiscal 2025 guidance.\nToday, I will highlight 3 growth priorities: First, enhancing patient care and adherence. Through decades of investment in physical and digital infrastructure, our core pharmaceutical distribution services ensure access to life-saving medications; Second, strengthening our specialty leadership. As we focus on future growth, we are differentiating the services and solutions we offer to pharmaceutical manufacturers to support specialty product innovation. And third, leading with market leaders by prioritizing active learning and active leading, we identify opportunities to create value in collaboration with our leading customer portfolio.\nI'll begin with how Cencora enhanced the patient access to pharmaceuticals through our critical role as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution. Our global reach, coupled with our local expertise, ensures patients have access to the medications they need, when and where they need them in an efficient, reliable and secure manner. We've invested in our distribution capabilities for decades, enhancing our efficiency, security and ability to handle increasingly complex medications, allowing us to meet the needs of innovation and the increased use of pharmaceuticals. We are responsible for delivering millions of pharmaceutical orders overnight or the same day to hundreds of thousands of health care providers we serve, ensuring pharmacists, physicians veterinarians and other health care providers have access to the medications they require to treat patients.\nSpecifically, we believe our investments over the past decade have made Cencora a market leader in ensuring that the supply chain is supported and equipped to comply with the enhanced tracking and visibility requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, DSCSA, which goes into effect later this year in the United States. The significant investments made over the past several years in support of the DSCSA is yet another clear proof point of the vital role Cencora and our industry play to ensure patients efficient, safe and reliable access to medication.\nNext, Cencora is strengthening our leadership in specialty by enhancing capabilities through RCA. RCA's physician-centric approach in retina is enhancing clinical trial access, supporting specialty product innovation and improved outcomes for patients. Recently, physician and business leaders across the RCA organization came together at our offices outside Philadelphia for their business and medical leadership board. The time our team spent together demonstrated collective value as we focused on practice management, value creation and the future of patient care.\nIn addition, retina specialists across RCA had a significant presence at the annual American Society of Retina Specialists Meeting, which was oriented around highlighting the rapid innovation in retina treatments. RCA physicians drove discussions in clinical research with a demonstrated clinical excellence, strong clinical trial patient enrollments and novel therapeutic approaches, including the delivery of an investigational gene therapy. We are proud to support these groundbreaking clinicians.\nAdditionally, Cencora's long-standing leadership in specialty distribution, including deep relationships in the retina market, equips us with specific expertise to support manufacturers product launches. As a result, we look forward to serving as a specialty distributor for several recently approved retina therapies that are beginning to enter both the U.S. and international markets. Through these partnerships, we are facilitating streamlined market entry, secure storage and distribution. Innovation is driving specialty pharmaceutical market growth and Cencora is deepening our leadership in specialty are remaining at the forefront through our portfolio of services and solutions, end-to-end from manufacturers to specialty providers.\nAnd finally, our focus on active learning and active leading is bolstering relationships with our industry-leading portfolio of customers, furthering our leadership with market leaders. Our teams are prioritizing focused engagement with our partners to deeply understand their business challenges and growth opportunity. The intentional time we spend with our customers is helping inform how we invest and expand our business to best create value. Throughout the quarter, we drove meaningful interactions with our customers and partners across the supply chain.\nAs an example, we hosted our annual Good Neighbor Pharmacy ThoughtSpot conference, giving our independent pharmacy customers the opportunity to learn about the latest trends shaping the industry and connect with peers. Our enterprise leadership team recently had the opportunity to visit a good neighbor pharmacy member that is a great representation of a pharmacy that has positioned itself as a differentiated care provider. Community pharmacies are vital, accessible health care destinations, providing care tailored to the community they serve. I'm continually inspired by the creativity and tenacity, these community pharmacists exhibit, and I'm proud of Cencora's partnership with these market leaders.\nIn closing, and before I hand it over to Jim, as I near the end of my first year as CEO, I'll remind you we are focused on 4 drivers that will strengthen our execution, digital transformation, talent and culture, productivity and prioritizing growth-oriented investments. We're focused on Cencora's digital transformation using to accelerate operational excellence and enhance both the customer and team member experience. We're committed to developing our team members, ensuring Cencora is a place where best-in-class talent come to grow their careers and furthering our purpose-driven culture. We've elevated our concentration on productivity, equipping us to identify ongoing capability and process improvements.\nAnd finally, our commitment to leading now and in the future, means we prioritize investments in strategic growth-oriented areas. As evidenced by our continued investment in technology and capabilities for our customers, our acquisition of RCA and our investment with a pathway to full ownership in on oncology. This also means that we continually evaluate the areas which are less strategically aligned where we should deemphasize investment. To close, I want to again thank the Cencora team members. It's due to their expertise, efficient execution of our strategy and dedication to our purpose that Jim and I are able to once again report such strong results.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our third quarter results and our updated fiscal 2025 guidance. Jim?\n\nJames F. Cleary\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, before I turn to my prepared remarks, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results please refer to our earnings press release and presentation.\nCencora delivered strong financial performance in our fiscal third quarter and we're pleased to be raising our full year fiscal 2025 guidance as we move into the fourth quarter. our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and positioning in key markets has allowed us to capitalize on favorable industry trends and our growth-oriented investments to advance our leadership in specialty are driving significant value as evidenced by our adjusted diluted EPS growth of 20%.\nBefore reviewing our updated guidance I'll first turn to a review of our consolidated and segment-level third quarter results, beginning with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $80.7 billion, up 9% and driven by revenue growth in both reporting segments. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which makes up the significant majority of our revenue and operating income we continue to benefit from strong utilization trends and volume growth, including continued growth in GLP-1 products. Excluding sales of GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 8%.\nTurning now to gross profit. Consolidated gross profit was $2.9 billion, up 21%, primarily due to the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.55%, an increase of 36 basis points, primarily driven by the gross profit contribution from our acquisition of Retina Consultants of America.\nMoving now to operating expenses. In the quarter, consolidated operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up 21%, driven primarily by the RCA acquisition and to support our revenue growth. Consolidated operating income was $1.1 billion, an increase of 21% compared to the prior year quarter due to continued strong performance in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail in the segment level results.\nMoving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the third quarter net interest expense was $82 million, an increase of $50 million versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the $3.3 billion in debt raised to finance a portion of the RCA acquisition.\nTurning now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 20.7% compared to 21.0% in the prior year quarter. Finally, our diluted share count was 195.2 million shares, a 2% decrease compared to the prior year quarter driven by approximately $1 billion in opportunistic share repurchases over the past year. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended June with $2.2 billion of cash and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of approximately $100 million. Our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $3 billion remains unchanged. This completes the review of our consolidated results.\nNow I'll turn to our segment results for the third quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $72.9 billion, up 9% as the strong pharmaceutical utilization trends continued, including growth in GLP-1. Across the segment, we saw broad-based revenue growth in all customer classes. As it relates to GLP-1 products in the quarter, GLP-1 sales increased $1.4 billion or 19% year-over-year.\nTurning now to operating income. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased an outstanding 29% to $902 million, driven by growth across our distribution businesses and the contribution from our CA. In the quarter, Specialty remained a key growth driver in both health systems and specialty physician practices where we benefited from strong volumes and saw good biosimilar conversion trends.\nI'll now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.8 billion, up approximately 11% on an as-reported basis and up 9% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by revenue growth in our European distribution business. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $156 million, down 13% on an as-reported basis and down 16% on a constant currency basis. The decline was driven by continued softness for our higher-margin global specialty logistics as well as a decline in our consulting business.\nWhile our global specialty logistics business did have a decline year-over-year, it grew sequentially from the March quarter as our teams have taken steps to optimize the business and drive value for our customers. We expect to see the same type of sequential improvement in operating income from the June quarter to the September quarter for this business. In the third quarter, we also saw solid performance in our 3PL business as our differentiated footprint is resonating with manufacturers. That completes the review of our third quarter results.\nI'll now discuss our updated fiscal 2025 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain metrics on a GAAP basis. So the following information is provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, except with respect to revenue and share count. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will start with adjusted diluted EPS guidance and then provide detail on the income statement items contributing to the increase. We are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2025 EPS guidance and now expect EPS to be in the range of $15.85 to $16, up from the previous range of $15.70 to $15.95 and representing growth of 15% to 16%. The updated guidance reflects the continued strong performance of our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and reflects a lower expected contribution from our International Healthcare Solutions segment.\nMoving to revenue. we are narrowing our consolidated revenue guidance to be growth of approximately 9%. At the segment level, we are updating both our U.S. and International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth outlook. In the U.S., we now expect segment revenue growth to be in the range of 9% to 10%, narrowed from our previous range of 9% to 11%. And given the trends we have seen and foreshadowed last quarter, we will likely finish in the lower part of that revenue range for the U.S. For the International segment, we now expect our segment revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% on an as-reported basis, up from our previous range of 3% to 4% to reflect the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to several key currencies and sales mix for our European distribution business. On a constant currency basis, we now expect International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 8%, up from the previous range of 6% to 8%.\nMoving to operating income. We are raising and narrowing our expected consolidated operating income growth guidance to be in the range of 15% to 16%, up from our previous range of 13.5% to 15.5% growth. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 20% to 21%, up from our prior range of 17.5% to 19.5%. The updated guidance reflects our strong performance and execution and expectation for continued strong pharmaceutical utilization trends in our fourth quarter despite the previously disclosed loss of an oncology customer due to its acquisition.\nTurning now to the International Healthcare Solutions segment. On an as-reported basis, we now expect operating income to be down approximately 6% compared to our prior expectations for operating income to be down 4% to down 1%. The updated guidance range reflects the pressure we have seen in our higher-margin global specialty logistics and consulting businesses. On a constant currency basis, we now expect segment operating income to be down approximately 5%. As we move into the fourth quarter, we have an easier comparison and with continued sequential improvement from our global specialty logistics business, we expect to see the International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income returned to growth exiting the fiscal year. That concludes our full year guidance update.\nAs we near the end of our fiscal year, I remain inspired by our team members' dedication to being a differentiated and solution-oriented partner for our customers. which continues to result in strong financial results. Cencora continues to drive impressive performance powered by our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment as we are positioned to capitalize on positive industry trends and our investments in high-growth specialty are generating value, grounded in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy Cencora is delivering sustainable growth, investing in our strengths and is well positioned to continue driving long-term value for all our stakeholders.\nNow I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.

My name is Lucy, and I will be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nBennett S. Murphy\n\nHead, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2025 2nd quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Bob Mauch, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nOn today's call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website.\nDuring this conference call, we will discuss forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on a current [indiscernible] and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q.\nCencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be broadcast [ without the ] express permission of the company. You'll have the opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask that you limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert P. Mauch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Group President, Pharmaceutical Distribution & Strategic Global Sourcin, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, Bennett. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining Cencora's fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call. To begin, I want to thank our global Cencora team members. It is due to their purpose-driven execution but I have the privilege of reporting our second quarter performance.\nIn our second quarter, Cencora delivered strong results with revenue growth of 10% and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%. We are once again raising our guidance for the fiscal year to reflect our first half results and expectations for continued execution in the second half. Rooted in our pharmaceutical-centric strategy enabled by active learning and powered by the collective strength of our enterprise, Cencora is building on our position as a leading end-to-end health care solutions provider.\nWe continue to expand our capabilities in key markets supporting pharmaceutical innovation and access. Today, I will highlight 3 areas advancing our business to power growth. First, we are creating value by leveraging our expertise and insights to enhance patient care. Second, we are successfully deepening our customer partnerships by actively learning and anticipating their needs. And third, we are strengthening our global leadership in specialty medications by deepening our offering across geographies and customer channels.\nI'll begin with how we are creating value by leveraging our leading expertise and insights from our end-to-end solutions to support our customers, partners and patients. Cencora is uniquely and intentionally positioned to support pharmaceutical commercialization and access across the health care ecosystem from leading pharmaceutical and biopharma innovators to health care providers. The breadth and scale of our services give us access to extensive data that our teams transform into actionable insights, enabling increased efficiency and innovation.\nThere are 2 examples I'd like to mention that demonstrate our progress to engage with industry stakeholders and strengthen our partnerships. First is how we're working to support the resiliency in the independent pharmacy space to ensure patient access to care. Through our advanced analytics capabilities, and leading Good Neighbor Pharmacy network of independent pharmacies, we've been able to provide pharmacies with heightened visibility into their communities, allowing them to identify new business opportunities, address populations that may experience gaps in care and tailor their service offering to specific patient populations.\nOur work has also highlighted that an estimated 30 million people in the United States live in pharmacy deserts, threatening access to medication, vaccines, screenings and other services necessary for healthy communities. By leveraging these insights, we are better able to advocate on behalf of our customers to ensure community providers remain vital sites of care.\nThe second example is using dispensing insights from our relationships with providers to inform biopharma partners on key product trends. One recent initiative provided actionable insights into the treatment of bladder cancer where Cencora combined clinical and market research to show how community oncologists were implementing new treatment paradigms. We are expanding the areas in which we offer these data insights, providing valuable services to our partners as they navigate the ever-changing health care landscape.\nNext, we are deepening our strategic relationship with customers and partners by taking an active approach to learning from them. Through Cencora's industry-leading portfolio, we built a premier customer base, end-to-end throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain dedicated to driving positive pharmaceutical outcomes.\nExecuting on our strategic priority of leading with market leaders, we are committed to deeply understanding our customer strategies and in turn, anticipating their needs and enhancing our capabilities. Just this past week, teams from across Cencora were actively engaged at a number of industry events, ranging from community pharmacies and oncology practices to the largest chain drug stores as well as biopharma companies, allowing our team members to return to our offices equipped with insights to share with colleagues.\nI'm proud of our significant presence at these prominent industry events where the scope of Cencora's capabilities and expansive partnerships were on full display. At a leading conference focused on specialty pharma, our team members spent time actively learning from partners across the health care landscape, while also providing thought leadership through their participation on panels, addressing policy and health care access.\nWe were also highly engaged in the largest gathering of chain pharmacies working to deepen our partnerships. In Washington, D.C., a group of our leaders joined community pharmacists from across the country for meetings with legislators to bring attention to the critical role pharmacists play in their local communities as trusted providers of care.\nThe teams attended over 100 meetings with legislators. Additionally, we gathered with our community oncology partners where the focus was on the continuous evolution of care and need for empowered advocates to ensure the best patient outcomes in the community setting. By engaging in these forums, we develop a deader standing of our partners' needs and gain value perspective to allow us to better serve them and their patients.\nAnd finally, we are strengthening our global leadership in specialty medications by deepening our offering across customer channels. Executing our strategic imperative of expanding leadership in specialty, our internationally scaled 3PL service is differentiated as we serve pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly seeking partners that can support products across multiple geographies.\nWe've integrated our U.S. and European 3PL businesses, creating an internationally unified network. By doing this, we offer manufacturers deep local expertise along with multinational reach for their products, driving successful launches and positioning Cencora as the partner of choice.\nWe are increasing our capabilities in key markets in Europe, enhancing our pharmaceutical logistics offering, which will power our leadership and specialty across the continent. We're also strengthening our leadership in specialty in the United States by deepening our offerings across provider channels.\nOne example is our approach with health systems, paving the way for us to build upon our critical role in distribution and offering an ecosystem of services, health systems increasingly require as the use of specialty medications rise.\nOur teams have developed solutions to address the needs of health systems, large and small. Our solutions design in partnership with leading health systems support comprehensive patient-centric care. By investing in end-to-end solutions across sites of care we strengthen our capabilities to support providers, manufacturers and patients.\nIn closing, and before I hand it over to Jim, the financial strength we are reporting today is powered by the size and organic growth of our U.S. segment, resulting from many years of strategic investments, strong execution and leading partnerships.\nIn our International segment, we are navigating a period of market softness for some of our businesses. However, we are confident we are well positioned and expect to capture opportunities as demand rebounds.\nI hope each of you take away from my prepared remarks today that while we are performing well, there is no complacency at Cencora. While we execute driving performance in the short term, we are laser-focused on building end-to-end capabilities and partnerships that will enable continued growth over the long term, strategically deploying capital, investing in talent, digital capabilities and enterprise productivity.\nI want to end with another thank you to the Cencora team members who guided by our purpose, drive a differentiated customer experience, actively learn and apply insights to drive innovation and deliver value for all of our stakeholders. We are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2025 guidance. Jim?\n\nJames F. Cleary\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, before I turn to my prepared remarks, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation.\nIn our second fiscal quarter, Cencora delivered strong financial performance as our teams capitalized on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. We benefited from our positioning and continued investment in attractive growing areas of the market like specialty, driving adjusted diluted EPS growth of 16%. To reflect our strong U.S. Healthcare Solutions earnings performance to date and expectations for continued growth in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year guidance for adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS.\nBefore reviewing the revised guidance details, I'll first turn to a review of our consolidated second quarter results, starting with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $75.5 billion, up 10%, primarily driven by revenue growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment as we continue to benefit from volume growth, including continued growth in GLP-1 products. Excluding sales of GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 8%.\nTurning now to gross profit. Consolidated gross profit was $2.9 billion, up 15% due to growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.86%, an increase of 16 basis points primarily driven by the gross profit contribution from our acquisition of [ Retina ] Consultants of America.\nMoving now to operating expenses. In the quarter, consolidated operating expenses were $1.7 billion, up 15%, driven primarily by the [ RCA ] acquisition. Excluding RCA, operating expense growth was modest as we continue to focus on identifying and implementing productivity initiatives while also investing in our business and operations to support our customers' growth. Consolidated operating income was $1.2 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year quarter due to excellent performance in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment which I will discuss in more detail in the segment level results.\nMoving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the second quarter. Net interest expense was $104 million an increase of $40 million versus the prior year quarter.\nThis increase primarily reflects the interest expense associated with the $3.3 billion in recently issued senior notes and the term loan to finance a portion of the RCA acquisition on top of our intra-period short-term borrowings associated with typical seasonal factors minus the repayment of senior notes that matured in March, which we have not yet refinanced.\nTurning now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 20.8%. Given our year-to-date effective income tax rate, we would expect our full year tax rate to be slightly below 21%. Finally, our diluted share count was 195.1 million shares, a 3% decrease compared to the prior year quarter driven by approximately $1.0 billion in opportunistic share repurchases over the past year, including $50 million in February and concurrence with Walgreens Boots Alliance's sale of shares. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year, we do not anticipate further share repurchases as we focus on deleveraging following the RCA acquisition.\nRegarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended March with $2 billion of cash and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow slightly below $200 million as a result of strong adjusted free cash flow in our second quarter. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. This completes the review of our consolidated results.\nNow I'll turn to our segment results for the second quarter. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, revenue was $68.3 billion, up 11% as we continue to see strong utilization trends, including growth in GLP-1 and growth in sales of specialty products to specialty physician practices and health systems where we are particularly benefiting from our strategy of partnering with market leaders.\nIn the quarter, sales of GLP-1 products increased $2.2 billion or 36% year-over-year. While this is clearly a significant year-over-year increase, I will note that this represents a 10% sequential decline in GLP-1 sales from the first quarter. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, U.S. segment revenue growth would have been 9% for the quarter.\nSeparately, I will note that as previously contemplated, there is no significant increase in U.S. Healthcare Solutions revenue resulting from the acquisition of RCA as sales from our specialty physician services business to RCA are now being eliminated in consolidation.\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 23% to $1.0 billion, driven by growth across our Human and Animal Health distribution businesses and the contribution from RCA, offset by a smaller-than-expected COVID vaccine headwind.\nIn the quarter, we saw particularly strong performance in specialty as utilization across health systems and specialty physician practices was robust and we benefited from the continued uptake of biosimilars in these customer channels.\nAs it relates to COVID, in the quarter, we saw higher-than-expected sales of COVID-19 vaccines that resulted in our COVID-related headwind being approximately half the size we indicated on our first quarter earnings call.\nI will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.2 billion, up approximately 1% on an as-reported basis and up 6% on a constant currency basis due to our growth at our European distribution business.\nInternational Healthcare Solutions operating income was $159 million, down 17% on an as-reported basis and down 14% on a constant currency basis. The decline was driven by continued softness for our global specialty logistics business as clinical trial activity remains subdued and we had a difficult comparison for our European distribution business due to manufacturers, price adjustments in a developing market country in the prior year which we called out on our second quarter earnings call last year.\nExcluding the impact of the manufacturers price adjustments, we saw solid operational performance within our European distribution business, particularly in 3PL. That completes the review of our segment level results.\nI will now discuss our updated fiscal 2025 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain metrics on a GAAP basis so the following information is provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, except with respect to revenue and share count. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis.\nI will start with adjusted diluted EPS guidance and then provide detail on the income statement items contributing to the increase. We are raising and narrowing our fiscal 2025 EPS guidance and now expect EPS to be in the range of $15.70 to $15.95 up from our previous range of $15.30 to $15.60 and representing growth of 14% to 16%.\nThe updated guidance reflects our strong second quarter operating income performance in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and a lower expected contribution from the International Healthcare Solutions segment. Additionally, in connection with consolidating the operating results of RCA, we made the accounting determination that the approximately 15% of equity that is owned by RCA physicians and management represents a contingent liability to Cencora as opposed to a noncontrolling interest.\nCencora will be consolidating the entirety of RCA with no noncontrolling interest elimination at the net income and EPS level. Our prior guidance assumed a noncontrolling interest reduction in EPS.\nTherefore, this determination will result in a higher-than-expected EPS contribution from RCA for the fiscal year but has no impact on our operating income results or operating income guidance. We are pleased with the integration progress we are making with the RCA team and are excited about the opportunities we have to drive positive patient outcomes by leveraging our collective strengths.\nNow moving to revenue. Our consolidated revenue guidance is unchanged, and we expect growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%. At the segment level, we are updating our International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth outlook and now expect as-reported revenue growth to be in the range of 3% to 4%, down from our previous range of 4% to 5%.\nOn a constant currency basis, we now expect International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 8%, down from the previous range of 7% to 9%. While we are leaving our revenue guidance unchanged at both the consolidated and U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment level, we anticipate our growth will be at the bottom end of the respective ranges.\nIn the second half of the year, we will see revenue growth impacted by a couple of factors, including beginning to lap tougher GLP-1 growth comparisons in the second half when the market saw product supply constraints subside in the prior year and declining sales of high-priced mail order products, which now have biosimilar competition and PBM formularies. These dynamics contribute to the lower revenue growth expected in the second half of the year but are positive for our profit margins.\nMoving to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 13.5% to 15.5% up from our previous guidance of 11.5% to 13.5%. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 17.5% to 19.5%, up from our prior range of 14.5% to 16.5%. The updated guidance reflects our strong business performance to date and continued good pharmaceutical utilization.\nTurning now to International Healthcare Solutions segment. On an as-reported basis, we now expect operating income to be down 4% to down 1% versus our prior expectations for operating income to be flat. The updated guidance range reflects the continued demand softness in the clinical trial and outsourced pharma services markets impacting our full year expectations for our higher-margin businesses in this segment. offset in part by the positive impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. On a constant currency basis, we now expect segment operating income to be down 3% to flat.\nMoving to share count. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 195 million to 195.5 million based on our current share count. That concludes our updated full year guidance assumptions.\nIn closing, the Cencora team has delivered another strong quarter of financial performance as our team members worked collaboratively with our customers and partners to drive a differentiated experience through their expertise and solutions-oriented approach. Our team members and our strategic partnerships are foundational to our success.\nOur continued investment in the team's development, our focus on enhancing capabilities and emphasis on productivity will further enhance our ability to drive value for all our stakeholders. Now I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?"

My name is Becky, and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Head of Investor Relations, Bennett Murphy, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nBennett S. Murphy\n\nHead, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2025 first quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Bob Mauch President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, [indiscernible] Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. .\nWe have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K. Syncora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be rebroadcast without the expressed permission of the company.\n[Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob.\n\nRobert P. Mauch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Group President, Pharmaceutical Distribution & Strategic Global Sourcin, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, Bennett. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining Cencora's fiscal 2025 first quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I want to thank the 40-plus thousand global Cencora team members. It's because of their purpose-driven approach expertise and dedication to meeting the needs of customers and patients worldwide that Jim and I have the pleasure of reporting strong Q1 results and updated guidance today.\nCencora delivered a strong start to our fiscal year. with revenue growth of 13% and adjusted EPS growth of 14%. We are also excited to share that due to the strength in execution in our U.S. business, we are raising guidance for the fiscal year. We benefit from our position as a leading health care solutions provider with a pharmaceutical-centric strategy and a purpose-driven culture, which enables us to capitalize on positive industry trends and innovation.\nToday, I will emphasize 3 areas of progress in executing our strategy and driving performance in the quarter. First, advancing our leadership in specialty where we took important steps forward. Second, driving efficiency and productivity through advanced technology and expert teams across the enterprise. And third, executing with a customer-centric mindset as we continue to collaborate and innovate with our customers throughout the supply chain.\nI'll begin with advancing our leadership in specialty. Our leadership supporting specialty providers is a key differentiator and growth driver for Cencora and we've evolved our service offerings over time. Over decades, we've deepened our relationships with our specialty provider customers with the expansion of specialty GPOs and other capabilities. The logical next step is through managed service organizations. This is in line with our long-term commitment to support community providers and extension of that work. After expanding significant time understanding the MSO business through our investment in One Oncology, we announced the acquisition of RCA, Retina Consultants of America, and we are incredibly happy to have completed that acquisition on January 2.\nRCA is a leading retina MSO and differentiated by its leadership team, clinical excellence, premier physician partner practices and positioning at the forefront of retina innovation through its clinical research capabilities. This acquisition, like our investment in OneOncology fits squarely into our strategy and growth by expanding our leadership in specialty in a high-growth pharmaceutical-centric segment building on our services for our customers and positioning us well in a medical specialty that has seen significant innovation.\nWhile it's early days, we're excited about what we believe our combined organizations will accomplish together. Next is driving efficiency and productivity through advanced technology and expert teams. We are focused on continuously enhancing our capabilities and increasing efficiency through advanced technology and collaboration across our global teams.\nAcross the organization, we are working to streamline operations optimize business processes and unlock enterprise-wide value. In the quarter, we worked throughout our business to upgrade systems to safeguard the resiliency of our infrastructure and ensure we maintain best-in-class standards. This allows us to streamline our operations for enhanced customer satisfaction. All of this aligned with our digital transformation strategy, focuses on enhancing customer experience and accelerating decision-making as we leverage global talent and capabilities to enhance efficiency, scalability and innovation.\nAll while meeting the needs of our partners, both now and in the future. And finally, executing with a customer-centric mindset and innovating with our customers. At Cencora, we lead with market leaders. Our portfolio of customers is second to none, driving innovation through drug development, elevating patient care and access through their patient-first approaches. Cencora team members with world-class expertise are working in cross-functional teams collaborating with customers to meet their evolving needs. In the quarter, we were able to display solutions created as a result of working closely with our customers at our inaugural product showcase.\nOur product showcase enabled us to demonstrate advanced solutions in areas like inventory planning and management, specialty GPO, and as well as cell therapy and gene therapy solutions. Another example is our enterprise leadership team just returned from the United Kingdom, visiting elements of our international operations spending time on the ground with our leaders and engaging with several top biopharma customers.\nOur global footprint and expertise set us apart and gives us the unique ability to combine local expertise with global infrastructure, best meeting the needs of biopharma companies. We are focusing on building on our strengths and value proposition to pharma with our services like market access, regulatory, pharmacovigilance and our unparalleled 3PL and specialty logistics networks. This differentiated approach is strategically important to our biopharma customer relationships over the long term and it's how we capitalize on growth of specialty products in the European market, which has a different structure than in the U.S. but is similar and that our foundation in pharmaceutical distribution and portfolio of services enables us to support pharmaceutical innovation while growing our higher growth, higher-margin services.\nIn closing, and before I hand it over to Jim, Cencora performance is powered by an amazing global workforce who are advancing our leadership in specialty, driving efficiency and productivity through advanced technology and expert teams and executing with a customer-centric mindset as we continue to collaborate and innovate with our customers.\nLooking ahead, we will maintain focus, executing against our strategy and amplifying the areas that are fundamental to our success, driving increased value for all our stakeholders. Thank you once again to all Cencora team members. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our first quarter results and our updated fiscal 2025 guidance.\n\nJames F. Cleary\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, before I turn to my prepared remarks, Unless otherwise stated, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. Cencora delivered strong results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment outperformed expectations due to strong prescription utilization trends and we capitalized on the growth of our industry, the continued momentum of our business and the expertise of our teams.\nAs Bob mentioned, adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% and to $3.73 in the first quarter. And for the second time in fiscal 2025, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the full year. I'll now turn to a review of our consolidated first quarter results, starting with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $81.5 billion, up 13% and primarily due to strong revenue growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment as we continue to benefit from overall market and volume growth, including increased sales of GLP-1 products. Excluding sales of GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 9%.\nTurning now to gross profit. Consolidated gross profit was $2.5 billion, up 6% and with growth in both the U.S. and International Healthcare Solutions segments. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.11%, a decrease of 20 basis points driven by the continued increase in sales of low-margin GLP-1 products combined with lower sales of commercial COVID-19 vaccines and a lack of sales of exclusive COVID-19 therapies all of which negatively impacted our gross profit margin versus the prior year quarter.\nMoving now to operating expenses. In the quarter, consolidated operating expenses were $1.6 billion, up approximately 6% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth. Consolidated operating income was $949 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to 10% growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail in the segment level results.\nMoving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the first quarter Net interest expense was $28 million, down 31% due to higher interest income resulting from higher average investment cash balances and interest rates partially offset by an increase in interest expense.\nTurning now to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 20% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. Finally, our diluted share count was 195.2 million shares, a 3% decline compared to the prior year first quarter driven by approximately $1.5 billion of opportunistic share repurchases during the period of February through October of 2024. As a reminder, as it relates to capital allocation, in the near term, we will prioritize deleveraging given the recent RCA acquisition. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we used $2.7 billion of cash in our operations during the quarter, resulting in negative adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion due to the timing of flows at the end of the calendar year. We continue to expect full year adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion. This completes the review of our consolidated results.\nNow I'll turn to our segment results for the first quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $74 billion, up 14% as we continued to see broad-based strong utilization trends including continued volume growth in GLP-1s and growth in sales to specialty position practices and health systems. In the quarter, sales of GLP-1 products were up $3.2 billion representing a 53% increase year-over-year. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, U.S. segment revenue growth would have been 10% for the quarter.\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 10% to $767 million, driven by growth at our Human Health distribution businesses, including specialty products and across commercial segments, including Animal Health, more than offsetting the significant headwind from lower sales of COVID-19 vaccines and lack of sales of exclusive COVID-19 therapies in the current year quarter. To provide a little more detail on the headwinds in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the contribution from COVID-19 vaccines was about half that of the prior year quarter. and we expect a similar sized operating income headwind in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, meaning no significant expected contribution from COVID vaccines in our second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nAnd as it relates to exclusive therapies, as a reminder, the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was the final quarter of contribution from exclusive COVID-19 therapies which contributed $0.06 to our first quarter of fiscal 2024. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.5 billion, up approximately 6% on an as-reported basis and up almost 9% on a constant currency basis due to increased sales at our European distribution business. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $182 million, down 3% on an as-reported basis and up 3% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the quarter, lower operating income at our global specialty logistics business was partially offset by better results at our European distribution business. Our global specialty logistics business had a strong quarter in the prior year period, and this quarter was more challenging as clinical trial activity remains subdued. The business remains focused on its pipeline and targeted in its regional prioritization of new volume growth we expect to see business performance improve later in fiscal 2025 as demand for our premium service capabilities increases from its current levels.\nThat completes the review of our segment level results I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2025 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance for certain metrics on a GAAP basis. So the following information is provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, except with respect to revenue, I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will start with adjusted diluted EPS guidance and then provide detail on the income statement items contributing to the increase.\nOn January 2, we announced the closing of the RCA acquisition and raised our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to the range of $15.15 to $15.45 to reflect the 9-month contribution from RCA. In addition, to continued momentum in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Today, we are pleased to again raise our full year diluted EPS guidance to a range of $15.25 to $15.55, a $0.10 increase to both the top and bottom end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range to better reflect the strength and momentum exhibited by the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment. Now moving to revenue.\nWe expect consolidated revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%, up from the previous expectations of 7% to 9% and the updated guidance range primarily reflects an increase in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth, where we now expect growth of 9% to 11% and up from our previous expectations of 7% to 9% growth due primarily to continued strong organic revenue growth and to a lesser extent, RCA, which was already a distribution customer.\nIn the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect revenue growth in the range of 4% to 5%, down from the previous range of 7% to 9% to reflect updated foreign currency translation rates. On a constant currency basis, International Healthcare Solutions segment revenue guidance remains unchanged at 7% to 9% growth.\nMoving to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 11.5% to 13.5%, up from our previous guidance of 5% to 6.5% and in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 14.5% to 16.5%, up from our prior range of 5% to 6.5%. And once again, segment-level guidance reflects expected contributions from our acquisition of RCA and continued strong broad-based growth in the segment, more than offsetting previously discussed COVID-related headwinds.\nTurning now to the International Healthcare Solutions segment. On an as-reported basis, we now expect operating income growth to be flat year-over-year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, and lowering the top end of our expectations for the segment. On a constant currency basis, we now expect segment operating income growth to be approximately 5%, narrowed from the previous range of 5% to 6.5% and as a result of the slower start for the International segment in the first half of fiscal year 2025.\nMoving to interest expense. We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million, up from our previous range of $150 million to $170 million due to the financing of our acquisition of RCA offset in part by lower net interest expense associated with foreign subsidiaries. From a quarterly cadence perspective, we would expect interest expense to step up meaningfully in the second quarter, similar to the prior year quarter given typical seasonality and cash use as well.\nFinally, we expect that our full year average share count will be under 196 million shares in fiscal 2025, given where our share count sits today. That concludes our updated full year guidance assumptions. As it relates to quarterly cadence, I would point out that we expect the second quarter to be the lowest growth quarter in fiscal 2025 with adjusted diluted EPS growth in the mid-single digits.\nThis is driven by a few factors. First, as I mentioned earlier, the second quarter is expected to have the highest net interest expense for the fiscal year due to typical seasonality of cash use in addition to the financing costs associated with the RCA acquisition. Second, in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we have the COVID-19 vaccine headwind and in the second quarter, which I referenced earlier and as it relates to RCA, accretion is expected to ramp over the course of the fiscal year. And finally, the slower start for the International segment in the first half of the fiscal year and the income translation impact from the strength of the U.S. dollar.\nIn closing, Cencora has achieved another strong quarter demonstrating the efforts of our purpose-driven team members as we continue to execute on our purpose of creating healthier futures. Their dedication and drive to the advancement of our enterprise has a proven track record of success which we see continuing in fiscal 2025 and creating value for all our customers, partners and stakeholders in the quarters to come. Now I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?"

Welcome to the Cencora Q3 Earnings Call. My name is Jackie. I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Bennett, please go ahead.\n\nBennett S. Murphy\n\nHead, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Results. I am Ben Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. .\nJoining me today are Steven Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Bob Mauch, Executive Vice President and COO.\nOn today's call, we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com. We've also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website.\nDuring this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q. Cencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be broadcast without the express permission of the company. If you have an opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask you to limit your questions to one per participant in order for us to get to as many participants as possible within the hour.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven H. Collis\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bennett. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As I prepared for this, my 53rd and last earnings call as Cencora's CEO, I look back at my prepared remarks from my first ever earnings call as CEO. On that call, 13 years ago, I highlighted that it was the first time the company had eclipsed the $20 billion revenue mark for a quarter, and the company reported $0.66 in diluted earnings per share. Fast forward to today, and Cencora is proudly reporting quarterly revenue of over $74 billion and adjusted diluted EPS of $3.34, representing year-over-year growth of 11% and 14%, respectively. Further, we are pleased to be raising our full year outlook as Cencora continues to execute well against our pharmaceutical-centric strategy.\nThe health care landscape continues to rapidly evolve, and our strategic position as a global leader in health care coupled with the agility and expertise of our teams, places us at the forefront of innovation. We continue to leverage our commercial strength to capitalize on the opportunities presented by positive pharmaceutical trends and innovation to drive increased value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Cencora's differentiated footprint and robust suite of services makes us a partner of choice, providing integrated solutions to support pharmaceutical commercialization and access.\nOur teams collaborate cross-functionally, creating a seamless process to efficiently bring new products to market. We remain differentiated in the market by our comprehensive approach which leverages expertise developed from our position at the center of health care and our deep collaboration. As an example, Cencora is serving as an integrated launch partner to a biopharma company launching their products outside the U.S. Cencora is supporting both market access and efficient distribution to ensure providers and ultimately, the patients have reliable access to the novel therapy. Partnerships like this exemplify how our holistic pharmaceutical solutions are providing value to our pharma partners and serve as a testament to how our diverse capabilities allow us to capture opportunity to drive innovation and access throughout the industry.\nMany of these innovations are increasingly complex, which creates challenges to access and opportunities for Cencora to differentiate ourselves as a partner. This quarter, we continued our ThinkLive trade show series by hosting a 2-day Cell and Gene Therapy conference, with leaders across the biopharmaceutical and health care industry came together to share a range of perspectives on the developments and challenges throughout the developing market. By hosting events like this, we foster collaborative relationships and effective strategies that enable the launch of groundbreaking therapies and reduce barriers to patient access.\nOn the provider side, just last week, we also hosted our annual ThoughtSpot Pharmacy trade show and conference in collaboration with our -- Good Neighbor Pharmacy network of independent customers. Our ThoughtSpot conference provides thousands of community pharmacists with the opportunity to connect with peers, attend educational sessions on the latest development and technologies and celebrate the positive impact community pharmacies have as trusted health care providers. We truly believe that by bringing our customers together, we help advance the health care landscape and promote a deeper collaboration across our teams.\nIndependent pharmacies play a vital role in promoting access to health care in their local communities, and we are proud that Good Neighbor Pharmacy ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among chain drugstore pharmacies in J.D. Power's U.S. Pharmacy study for the eighth consecutive year in a row. The Good Neighbor Pharmacy network is clearly made up of leaders providing differentiated services for patients across the country. Forging deep strategic partnerships with market-leading customers is a strategic imperative and key differentiator for Cencora. Through these relationships, we better understand the challenges our customers are facing, which allows us to strengthen our services and solutions, driving mutual value and growing better together. As we work to enhance our customer experience, one area of particular focus has been evolving how we leverage innovative technology and analytics to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness. This is important for continuing to improve our day-to-day operations and also finding new and creative ways to analyze and grow their business actionable data Cencora can harness. These strategic relationships with customers also allow us to capture areas of opportunity in rapidly advancing sectors of the market. I am particularly proud of our specialty distribution and services offering.\nFor close to 3 decades, we have been a leader and innovator in this space. Importantly, we continue to make forward-thinking investments that position us to capitalize on addressing the complexities these products pose in handling and distribution and connect us with downstream providers where we are positioned to equip practices with offerings that advance the strength of their business.\nAs specialty continues to grow across all therapeutic areas, we are able to expand and develop the partnerships we have with customers, furthering our leading market position. Our leadership in specialty remains a key tenant of our long-term growth and strategy. We make forward-thinking investments in our infrastructure and emerging technologies to position Cencora as the best partner to address our customers' current and future needs.\nThe value we create throughout the supply chain and for our shareholders is driven by our global team members and their commitment to our purpose. Our team members execute at the impressive level they do because of our purpose-driven culture, which promotes different perspectives and points of view. In June, we celebrated our team members that identify as a part of the LGBTQ+ community by hosting a global pride celebration and events throughout the month, in recognition of our commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive workplace for all our team members. We are also proud to have been recognized as the Best Place to Work for Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability:IN for a second consecutive year. Our leaders are dedicated to fostering a working community and culture that celebrates and embraces our team members as the authentic self, which includes providing a safe and inclusive working environment for all as our talent's engagement and commitment to our purpose drives our business resiliency and long-term strategic growth.\nCencora continues to efficiently adapt to industry changes, operate and draw on our business synergies and execute across the geographies we serve, which results in our continued growth and resiliency. Our team members' diligence and passion for our purpose is inspiring and is fundamental to our success.\nWith that, I will now hand the call over to Bob, our incoming CEO effective October 1. Bob?\n\nRobert P. Mauch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Group President, Pharmaceutical Distribution & Strategic Global Sourcin, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. As I continue to prepare to transition to CEO in October, I'm focused on speaking to and learning from our team members and our customers. In my conversations with customers, I reinforced the value of Cencora's strategy, leadership and expertise, and how we are investing and innovating to be the partner that they need now and into the future. And working closely with leaders in health care across every channel, prioritizing customer-centric solutions, maintaining a learning mindset and embracing our enterprise-powered capabilities, we differentiate ourselves as partners, grow together and anticipate advancements throughout health care.\nOur team members are motivated by the important work we do, the collective strength of our business and the collaboration we enjoy across our company. The culture and pride of our team members having their work drive our purpose as we create healthier futures, and our success is a direct reflection of our team's pursuit of operational excellence. We championed the diverse perspectives and backgrounds that our team members bring to the table, which enables us to take a thoughtful and creative approach to addressing industry challenges, enhancing the value we provide to customers, partners, shareholders and the broader health care industry.\nLooking forward, we will continue to execute against our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, driving efficiency through the supply chain and supporting the growth of innovative products through our higher-growth, higher-margin services.\nIn closing, I'm incredibly honored to have the opportunity to succeed Steve as Cencora's next CEO. Cencora's position in health care is a direct result of Steve's vision and next-minded approach in growing and advancing the depth and breadth of our services. And I want to take a moment to congratulate Steve by his incredible tenure and the mark he made on this company as well as our industry.\nUnder Steve's leadership, Cencora has delivered tremendous growth and demonstrated our crucial role to stakeholders. Steve has led the company through major strategic decisions that position Cencora for long-term value creation, including customer partnerships with leading health care organizations, expanding our geographic footprint and the various services and solutions we provide, as well as successfully navigating significant national and global challenges, all while we remain committed to our purpose and supporting our team members. Thank you, Steve, for your service to Cencora and your unwavering commitment. I'm working closely with Steve to ensure a seamless transition, and I look forward to his continued leadership, partnership and guidance as he transitions to the role of Executive Chair. It's a privilege to work alongside Cencora's inspiring and passionate team members, and I look forward to building on our momentum as we are optimistic and excited about the future of Cencora and intend to keep up the track record of execution and performance.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim for a review of our fiscal 2024 third quarter financial performance. Jim?\n\nJames F. Cleary\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Bob. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to a review of our consolidated third quarter results, as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation.\nCencora delivered another strong performance in the third quarter as we continue to benefit from positive utilization trends, our leadership in specialty and the strong free cash flow generation of our business. As Steve mentioned, adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% and to $3.34 as we benefited from strong results in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, lower net interest expense and a lower share count due in part to approximately $550 million in opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter as we continue to thoughtfully deploy capital and return value to shareholders.\nBeginning with our consolidated revenue in the quarter, we had $74.2 billion in revenue, up 11%, with continued growth in our distribution businesses, including increased sales of GLP-1 products, increased sales of specialty products to physician practices and health systems and growth in sales to some of our largest customers. Our strong revenue growth was offset in part by the January 1 manufacturer price reductions in certain product classes. Sales of GLP-1 products in the quarter increased by $2.1 billion or 38% compared to prior year and increased 30% sequentially from the March quarter when there was a notable slowdown in growth due to supply constraints, which have clearly now subsided. Excluding GLP-1's consolidated revenue growth would have been approximately 8%.\nTurning now to gross profit. Consolidated gross profit was $2.4 billion, up 6% compared to the prior year quarter. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.19%, a decrease of 14 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as the reacceleration of low-margin GLP-1 product sales negatively impacts our gross profit margin.\nMoving now to operating expenses. In the quarter, consolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion, up 6% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth and lapping the efficiency actions we called out last year on our May earnings call. Consolidated operating income was $878 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year quarter with strong growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing the segment level results.\nMoving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the third quarter. Net interest expense was $31 million, a decrease of 46% year-over-year as interest income increased as a result of particularly strong cash flow in the quarter, in part due to our successful unwinding of the extended payments program we launched in the March quarter to support our customers during the change health care outage. The combination of strong cash flow early in the quarter and higher investment rates compared to the prior year drove the significant decline in net interest expense year-over-year.\nTurning to income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 21.0% compared to 21.5% in the prior year quarter. Finally, our diluted share count was 200 million shares, a 2% decrease compared to the prior year third quarter, primarily driven by opportunistic share repurchases. In fiscal 2024, we have repurchased almost $1 billion of our shares, including $700 million directly from Walgreens Boots Alliance. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.3 billion and $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow as the $600 million impact from the changed health care outage that I just spoke about for first early in the third quarter.\nThis completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results for the third quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $67.2 billion, up 12%, reflecting strong script utilization trends including increased sales of GLP-1 products and specialty products to physicians and health systems. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, segment revenue growth would have been approximately 10%. And U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 10% to $698 million as our specialty distribution business saw strong growth in both oncology and ophthalmology in addition to strong overall prescription volumes and biosimilar conversions.\nI will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.1 billion, flat compared to prior year on an as-reported basis or up 6% on a constant currency basis. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $179 million, a decrease of 4% on an as-reported basis due to continuation of higher information technology expenses for our European distribution business and lower operating income at our global specialty logistics business as there were less international shipments and lower weight per shipment, all of which was partially offset by positive results at our Canadian business. On a constant currency basis, International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 1%. Our global specialty logistics business is starting to see some good early signs on the demand side and the business continues to invest to further differentiate its global strength in its complex high-touch market.\nThat completes a review of our segment level results. I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2024 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will start with updated adjusted diluted EPS guidance and then provide greater detail on the income statement items driving our improved earnings expectations.\nToday, we are pleased to raise our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance for the fourth time this fiscal year. We now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.55 to $13.65, representing growth of 13% to 14%, up from our intra-period provided EPS guidance range of $13.35 to $13.55. Our updated guidance range reflects our expectation for continued growth in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, taper expectations in the International Healthcare Solutions segment and lower net interest expense expectations for the fiscal year.\nBeginning with revenue, we now expect both our as-reported and constant currency consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 12% from our previous guidance range of 10% to 12%, given our increased guidance in the U.S. segment. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect segment level revenue growth of 12% to 13% from the previous range of 11% to 13%. In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect as-reported segment level revenue growth of 4% to 6% from the previous range of 4% to 7% and constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 9% from the previous range of 7% to 10%.\nMoving to adjusted operating income. We now expect our as-reported consolidated adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 11% as we narrow our guidance from the previous range of 9% to 11%, and constant currency growth to be in the range of 11% to 12%, narrowed from the previous guidance range of 10% to 12%. Updated guidance reflects expected continued growth toward the upper end of our previous guidance range in the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment and growth towards the lower end of our previous guidance ranges in the International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect our segment-level adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 11% to 12% from our previous range of 10% to 12% due to our continued strong growth expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we will lap the prior year contribution of $0.08 from exclusive COVID therapy distribution and will also begin comparing to prior year quarters that had contributions from commercial COVID vaccines, which we expect to be comparable year-over-year.\nIn the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect our segment level adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 5% to 7% from our previous range of 5% to 8%. On a constant currency basis, we now expect adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 12% from our previous range of 10% to 13%. We are modestly narrowing our international operating income guidance range, bringing down the top end of the range due to our third quarter results in the segment and some softness in demand at PharmaLex.\nMoving now to net interest expense and share count. We now expect our net interest expense to be in the range of $170 million to $190 million, down from our previous range of $185 million to $215 million driven by our better-than-expected free cash flow. For weighted average shares outstanding, we now expect our full year count to be under 201 million shares as a result of our opportunistic share repurchases in the quarter. As you will recall, on May 22, we announced that we had completed $550 million in share repurchases in the month, including $400 million repurchased from Walgreens Boots Alliance, decreasing our weighted average diluted share count.\nFinally, turning to adjusted free cash flow, we now expect to generate $2.5 billion to $3 billion, up from our previous expectation of approximately $2.5 billion and adjusted free cash flow in the fiscal year given our strong free cash flow generation in the third quarter.\nThat completes the review of our updated guidance for fiscal 2024. As we near the end of the fiscal year, I am proud of the strong results our purpose-driven team members have produced. The dedication and execution by our team members continue to drive our growth and enable us to deliver on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. Cencora continues to demonstrate our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth and create value for our customers, partners and all our stakeholders.\nBefore handing the call back over to Steve, I want to extend my congratulations once again to both him and Bob as our company is well positioned to continue creating value in the short and long term with the company's thoughtful leadership transition plan. Cencora has benefited from having such a purpose-driven leader in Steve for well over a decade, and his vision for the company has created a strong foundation for value creation for our customers, partners and shareholders. Under Bob's leadership, we will continue to build on Cencora's momentum and commercial strengths and drive further value for our stakeholders on our path towards our purpose of creating healthier futures. Congratulations to both once again.\nBefore turning the call back to Steve, I'm going to go through a little bit of historical data, which will take Steve by surprise. And during the 13 years that Steve has been CEO of Cencora, the revenue compound annual growth rate has been 11%, and the adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate has been 14%. And it's a little bit of a coincidence that those were actually the same growth rates we had this most recent quarter, 11% revenue growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth. And then also during the 13 years that Steve has been CEO, the company has had a TSR, total shareholder return CAGR of between 15% and 16%. So Steve, I thought I'd just go through that historical data, and now I'll turn it back over to you.\n\nSteven H. Collis\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Jim. You did take me by surprise. But with this being my final earnings call, I want to take a moment to thank our team members, our Board and our stakeholders for the opportunity to serve as Cencora's CEO these last 13 years. In my first call as CEO, I highlighted that we would pursue opportunities to increase our value offering to existing customers, add to our strengths in core competencies and increase shareholder value. Throughout my tenure, we have delivered on that framework and grown significantly, operationally, geographically and financially. As we built upon our scale and expertise as a pharmaceutical distributor and leader in specialty by deepening and broadening our relationships upstream with pharma and advancing our solutions downstream with our provider customers.\nWe have advanced our core distribution capabilities through organic and inorganic growth opportunities, in turn, expanding our reach and providing more patients with the life-saving medications they need. Our leadership and capabilities in specialty makes Cencora a driving force in supporting access and intelligence for cutting-edge therapies. Cencora's demonstrated growth over the past decade plus speaks to the strength of our execution against our pharmaceutical-centric strategy. Our team's relentless focus has allowed us to continually capitalize on growth across health care and to be the partner of choice for both upstream biopharma and downstream providers. Cencora is strategically positioned at the center of health care, and as Bob steps into the role as CEO on October 1, the company will continue to build on our momentum, relationships and capabilities guided by his leadership to drive results and create value for all of our stakeholders. I have had the pleasure of working alongside Bob for almost 20 years, and I'm excited to see the future as we watch him lead Cencora.\nBob's deep understanding of all facets of pharmaceutical distribution, logistics and commercialization, experience leading all of our businesses during his tenure and his integral role in helping to shape our strategy over the years, makes him incredibly well equipped to be the company's third ever CEO. It has been an honor and a pleasure to be a part of the company's evolution, and I look forward to seeing how Cencora advances into the future.\nThe numbers that I talked about at the opening of the call would not have been possible without the enormous contribution of so many of my colleagues throughout my 30-year career with the company, and I'm sincerely grateful and humbled by their achievements and dedication to being united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.\nWith that, we will now move to Q&A.

Collis\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bennett. Good morning, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before turning to discuss our second quarter results, I want to take a moment to introduce Bob Mauch, our current COO, who we announced in March will be succeeding me as CEO on October 1. For nearly 2 decades, Bob has been an integral partner in shaping and implementing our strategy. In Bob's time leading operations across our businesses, he has developed deep relationship with our partners and team members and his knowledge of our business and considerable expertise will significantly benefit the company as he leads Cencora into our next chapter.\nI want to extend my sincere congratulations to Bob and will now turn the call to him to make some brief comments. Bob?\n\nRobert P. Mauch\n\nExecutive Vice President and Group President, Pharmaceutical Distribution & Strategic Global Sourcin, AmerisourceBergen Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve. I'm excited to be joining today's call and look forward to deepening my relationships with our investor and analyst stakeholders in the quarters to come. It's an honor to succeed you to become Cencora's third CEO on October 1. Cencora is positioned as a leading health care solutions organization is rooted in our purpose pharmaceutical-centric strategy and growth mindset. Our purpose capabilities and the critical role that pharmaceuticals have in health care and patient outcomes motivate me personally and professionally.\nMy parents owned independent community and long-term care pharmacies, so I grew up appreciating firsthand the critical role that pharmaceuticals play and positive patient outcomes. That experience helped shape my 30-plus year career in pharmaceutical care leading me to found [ Xcenda ], the health outcomes consulting firm for pharmaceutical manufacturers and setting me on the path that eventually brought me to Cencora. Since then, I've had the pleasure of leading businesses across our company, building and fostering our strong relationships with market-leading customers and partners and developing strong teams that are differentiated by their unique backgrounds and expertise.\nThroughout my 17 years at Cencora, have worked closely with Steve and our teams to help shape our strategy. During that time, I've had the opportunity to benefit from Steve's leadership and mentorship and is fierce devotion to our people and purpose. I'm grateful that I will be able to continue to work closely with Steve throughout this transition over the next several months, and I look forward to benefiting from his continued leadership, partnership and guidance in his new role of Executive Chair later this year. Thank you to our Board of Directors and our team members for the trust and opportunity as I move into this new role. Together, we will continue to drive value for all our stakeholders, both now and in the years to come. I'm pleased to have had the opportunity to join today's call and share how excited I am for my future role.\nWith that said, I'll leave it to Steve and Jim to answer your questions as usual. I'll look forward to speaking with you all more in the weeks and months ahead. I'll now turn the call back to Steve to discuss our fiscal second quarter.\n\nSteven H. Collis\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bob. I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge Gina Clark, our EVP and Chief Communications and Administration Officer, who announced this morning will be retiring at the end of our fiscal year. Gina has had a distinguished career and made an enduring impact, leading large-scale initiatives across the organization, including uniting our company and our new globally inclusive identity, Cencora. Congratulations, and thank you, Gina, for your significant contributions. Now turning to our second quarter.\nOur ongoing focus on operational excellence and our team members' execution on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy drove another quarter of strong financial performance with revenue growth of 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 9%. Our role at the center of health care is core to our strategy and our positioning allows us to serve as a trusted partner while capturing opportunities presented by innovation leveraging and investing in our infrastructure and extensive capabilities, we support access and efficiency across health care. Our multinational distribution footprint and global platform of commercialization services makes us a natural partner for manufacturers bringing their products to market.\nWith our increasing presence in pharma services, we are able to cultivate relationships with pharma early in the development process and position ourselves as not only a provider of logistics and distribution services but also as an integrated partner able to support the successful commercialization of their products. Connecting with our manufacturer partners is key to better understanding and anticipating their ever-evolving needs and challenges. In early April, we hosted our first [ think large ] series of the fiscal year, in which representatives from over 30 manufacturer partners and the Cencora team came together to share their insights or new ways we can collaborate and work to support ongoing innovation in the pharmaceutical space. Over the course of the year, we will host a number of these events focused on the different needs of our manufacturer partners from biopharmas and cell and gene therapy developers to the largest established manufacturers.\nThe discussions we are having with pharma innovators provides us with a deep understanding of their pipelines for life-altering innovations, giving us a direct line of sight to development opportunities for our commercialization services portfolio. Additionally, for products that have been launched, our role at the center of the supply chain and our global footprint allow us to capitalize on valuable insights and shared commercial opportunities, including for launches in additional geographies. Cencora has always endeavored to be a trusted industry partner and our integrated approach to commercialization is increasingly sought out and appreciated by our pharma partners. To this end, we were pleased to win another integrated services and distribution contract with an emerging biotech this quarter, while small in the context of the Syncora Enterprise, wins like this are important proof points that demonstrate our integrated model and global capabilities are differentiated and resonating with manufacturers.\nAs we continue to advance our commercialization capabilities, we further strengthen our ability to contribute to pharmaceutical outcomes and support innovation. As the entire health care ecosystem continues to advance, we are embracing the latest technology to support our customers' growth and providing actionable insights to our partners, leveraging data and analytics. We continue to develop solutions for our provider customers, allowing them to focus on patient care and efficiently run their practices. Recently, we introduced an enhanced application that combines clinical, pharmacy and financial information in one place for specialty physicians.\nWith this integrated platform, our customers can seamlessly aggregate data about their practices across our solution set to analyze their performance and drive success through customizable, easy-to-use dashboards. Similarly, given investments we have made in our infrastructure to enhance the security of the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain, we are now able to provide actionable insights to manufacturers leveraging our scale and rich data sets. As we continue to invest in our technology and capabilities, we increasingly see opportunities to create value-added data informed solutions that drive innovation and differentiation. Minority investment in OneOncology is another example of our approach to adding solutions that will deepen and expand our relationship with our partners, allowing us to support better health care outcomes in critical areas.\nSince completing our investment in OneOncology last June, the platform has continued to grow as oncologists increasingly recognize the value of joining a physician-led network of like-minded community-based practitioners, to enhance its value proposition to physicians, OneOncology has advanced key IT and practice management technologies while investing in important clinical research and real-world evidence solutions to make community provider participation in clinical trials more seamless. We are taking our learnings from our investment in OneOncology to unlock new growth opportunities for all our community oncology customers while allowing them to maintain their independence and treat cancer patients with high quality and cost-effective care in their local communities.\nOur continued partnership with OneOncology oncology leadership team and TPG brings together our collective strength as we work jointly to advance accessible quality cancer care. Our commitment to and investment in community oncology has been well received as we are clearly focused on supporting the long-term vitality of community providers across the U.S. Our extensive capabilities, scaled platform and deep expertise enable us to collaborate with customers to overcome evolving challenges across the health care landscape. During the quarter, the health care industry faced an impactful disruption that prevented providers across the U.S. from receiving the claims payments they rely on to run their practices and ultimately care for patients.\nOur customers, particularly community providers found themselves in a difficult position, uncertain if they could make payroll for their employees or cover expenses for critical medications needed for patient care. Much like we did during the COVID-19 pandemic, our cross-functional teams were nimble in developing solutions, including offering flexible payment terms to allow our customers to keep their businesses running without jeopardizing care until claims processing was restored. By providing solutions and working to address our customers' needs, we deepened our relationships while supporting continuity and access to care. The work we do would not be possible without our purpose-driven team members who diligently work to support our customers and their patients.\nAt Cencora, we are focused on fostering a globally united culture that promotes the well-being of our 46,000 team members across our footprint. A recent example of the strength of our culture was in Lithuania where we operate both the distribution business and a Cencora business services center. We were proud to be recognized by the Lithuanian Ministry of Social Security and Labor with the safest emotional environment award for our shared services center, adding to the accolades the office has received in the past several years. This award is just one example of the strong culture Cencora has built and recognize key elements of our people and culture strategy, including our leading benefits offering. I'm proud our teams have embraced our multinational presence which better allows us to serve our customers' needs across geographies and time zones, while maintaining our purpose-driven culture.\nAs we continue to grow as a globally United enterprise, we prioritize building a culture that celebrates the unique backgrounds and experiences of our team members and will provide diverse differentiated perspective, enhancing our business. As a crucial link in the pharmaceutical supply chain, it is imperative that Cencora has robust business resiliency plans to ensure the delivery of crucial pharmaceuticals, including in the face of a changing climate. As we further our business resiliency efforts, we are mindful of the impact our operations have on the environment and work closely with our partners to drive sustainability initiatives, help them understand their emission footprint and ultimately report on our joint progress in partnering with stakeholders across the supply chain on these important topics we amplify our impact across our footprint.\nWhile we continue to advance our work in our own operations and in partnership with other stakeholders, we were pleased that our efforts were acknowledged by Newsweek on its inaugural list of America's greenest companies that recognizes the top 300 companies in the United States who are making progress to positively change their sustainability footprint. Running an environmentally responsible business will continue to be an important aspect of our business resiliency planning and aligns closely with our purpose of creating healthier futures.\nIn closing, the ever-changing health care environment necessitates that we remain agile and adaptive alongside our partners, both up and downstream. I am incredibly proud of our purpose-driven team members who exemplified their customer-centric approach and intellectual confidence to help providers maintain access to care during a challenging time. As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on creating a best-in-class customer experience embracing innovation and investing in our infrastructure to drive our pharmaceutical-centric strategy forward, creating value for all our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our second quarter results and updated guidance. Jim?\n\nJames F. Cleary\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to my prepared remarks, I want to extend my congratulations to both Steve and Bob on our recently announced leadership succession plan. Since joining Cencora in 2015, I've had the pleasure of working closely with both Steve and Bob as we have executed on our pharmaceutical-centric strategy and focused on creating long-term value. Steve's purpose-driven leadership and strategic vision have shaped Cencora into the company it is today, characterized by our foundation in pharmaceutical distribution, complementary solutions up and downstream and long-standing leadership in specialty. I look forward to continuing to benefit from Steve's expertise as he steps into the Executive Chair role in October. Like Steve, Bob has deep knowledge in and passion for supporting positive patient outcomes through pharmaceutical-centric care. Bob's experience leading our commercial operations and building talented customer-focused teams will benefit our company and all its stakeholders in the years to come. Now turning to our results.\nCencora delivered strong performance in our second quarter, and we are pleased to raise our adjusted operating income guidance for the full fiscal year. Our teams continue to execute and stay focused on providing customer-centric services and solutions as evidenced in the quarter when we leveraged the strength of our balance sheet to support our customers during a time of industry-wide need. The important role we play at the center of health care, powered by our people and the long-term partnerships we have forged positions us well to continue to innovate solve problems for customers and create significant value across the pharmaceutical supply chain. I'll now turn to a review of our consolidated second quarter results. And as a reminder, my remarks will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. Starting with revenue.\nOur consolidated revenue was $68.4 billion, up 8%, with solid growth in both segments. In the quarter, we saw continued strong trends in sales of specialty products to physicians and health systems and growth in sales to some of our larger customers, offsetting the manufacturer price reductions in certain product classes which were known well in advance. While we've continued to see growth in sales of GLP-1 products, this quarter, the growth rate moderated as we lapped the rapid adoption of the products in the second quarter of our fiscal 2023 and due to GLP-1 supply constraints in the quarter.\nConsolidated gross profit was $2.5 billion, up 7%. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.70%, a decrease of 1 basis point. Consolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion, up 5% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth offset in part by the efficiency actions we called out last year on our May earnings call. Consolidated operating income was $1.0 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year quarter with good growth in both segments, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing the segment level results. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the second quarter.\nNet interest expense was $64 million, flat year-over-year. As you will recall, we called out an expected sequential step-up in interest expense on our first quarter earnings call, given the typical seasonal intra-period short-term borrowings and cash use. Higher interest expense in the second quarter compared to the prior year was offset by higher interest income and the September 2023 divestiture of our less than wholly owned subsidiary in Egypt. During the quarter, we issued $500 million in senior notes due 2034 at a coupon of 5.125%. We intend to use the proceeds from the notes issuance to repay our 2024 notes due this month. Regarding income taxes, our effective income tax rate was 20.9% compared to 19.0% in the prior year quarter. Turning now to diluted share count.\nOur diluted share count was 201.2 million shares, a 2% decrease compared to the prior year second quarter. This was primarily driven by opportunistic share repurchases during the second half of fiscal 2023 and continued share repurchases in fiscal 2024, including $50 million in repurchases in the second quarter in conjunction with Walgreens Boots Alliance block sale in February. Regarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash and year-to-date adjusted free cash flow of approximately $0.5 million. During the quarter, many of our customers were impacted by the changed health care outage that severely limited customers' cash flows as claims payments were delayed.\nTo help our partners, we provided customers in need with extended payment terms giving them the financial flexibility to maintain their operations and focus on caring for their patients. The support we provided to our customers created a cash flow headwind in the second quarter of approximately $600 million, which we fully expect will reverse in our third fiscal quarter. The strength of our balance sheet and execution by our team members has allowed us to play a pivotal role in supporting our customers during this challenging time. And I am appreciative of our team members who work diligently and collaboratively to understand our customers' needs and be agile in the face of uncertainty while being prudent to ensure we also protect Cencora and its shareholders. This completes the review of our consolidated results. Now I'll turn to our segment results for the second quarter.\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $61.3 billion, up 8%, with solid growth in our distribution businesses including continued growth in sales to specialty physician practices and health systems and volume growth in GLP-1. Excluding sales of GLP-1 products, which increased by $1.3 billion, segment revenue growth would have been nearly 6.5%. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 11% to $841 million as we continue to benefit from our leadership in specialty, both oncology and non-oncology and solid utilization trends. In the quarter, we also saw a benefit from our focus on managing operating expense growth as we compare to a period with elevated expenses prior to the efficiency actions we took last spring.\nAs it relates to COVID contributions, in the quarter, we saw a decline in demand for commercial COVID-19 vaccines and contributions related to exclusive COVID treatment distribution were not meaningful as expected. As we no longer expect contribution from exclusive COVID treatment distribution, we no longer plan to provide guidance for ex-COVID growth rates. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we recognized $0.06 of exclusive treatment contribution which is the only contribution expected in the segment this fiscal year compared to $0.31 in the U.S. of the total $0.38 consolidated contribution for exclusive treatments in fiscal 2023. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment.\nIn the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.1 billion, up 5% on a reported basis or up 10% on a constant currency basis. International Healthcare Solutions operating income was $193 million, up 10% on a reported basis due primarily to growth for our less than wholly owned distribution business in Brazil and our Canadian business. In the quarter, our European distribution business delivered growth and benefited from manufacturer price adjustments in a developing market country, which offsets the decline in value of local currency. On a constant currency basis, International Healthcare Solutions segment operating income growth was 22%. That completes the review of our segment level results. I'll now discuss our updated fiscal 2024 guidance expectations.\nAs a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will start with EPS and then provide detail on the income statement items driving our updated EPS guidance. We are raising the lower end of our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance and now expect EPS to be in the range of $13.30 to $13.50 from our previous range of $13.25 to $13.50, representing growth of 11% to 13%. The updated range reflects our expectation for continued growth and execution [ in ] the balance of our fiscal year and also updated expectations on a few items below the operating income line. Moving now to revenue.\nOur guidance for consolidated revenue growth is unchanged at 10% to 12%. In the International Healthcare Solutions segment, we are narrowing our guidance range for segment level revenue growth and now expect as-reported revenue growth of 4% to 7% from the previous range of 4% to 8% and constant currency revenue growth of 7% to 10% from the previous range of 7% to 11%. Turning now to adjusted operating income. We expect consolidated adjusted operating income growth to be in the range of 9% to 11%, up from our previous guidance of 8% to 10% due to our updated expectations for the U.S. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%, up from our prior range of 9% to 11%.\nOur increased guidance reflects our strong performance to date and continued growth in the second half, though at a more moderate rate, primarily due to COVID-19 vaccine seasonality and comparing to the prior year fourth quarter, which was the initial quarter that had a meaningful commercial COVID vaccine contribution. As context, in the first half, we saw segment level operating income growth of 16%, well above our initial expectations when excluding commercial COVID-19 vaccine contributions, our growth was 8% in the first half. Switching now to exclusive COVID therapies. As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters, we will have headwinds of $0.05 and $0.08, respectively, as we lap prior year contributions from exclusive COVID therapy distribution. Turning now to our International Healthcare Solutions segment.\nOur as-reported operating income growth guidance remains unchanged and reflects the strengthening of the dollar in recent weeks. On a constant currency basis, we now expect segment-level operating income growth to be in the range of 10% to 13%, up from our previous range of 9% to 12%. Regarding our adjusted effective tax rate, we now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 21% from our previous range of 20% to 21%. Moving now to share count. We now expect our weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 201 million to 202 million shares from our previous range of 200 million to 202 million shares. Finally, turning to adjusted free cash flow. Our guidance remains unchanged, and we expect to generate approximately $2.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow.\nIn closing, our teams across Syncora have continued to execute, allowing us to deliver strong financial results. As I reflect on the second quarter, I am impressed by the way our talented team members came together to support our customers, exemplifying customer centricity and agility and responding to challenges. As we look to the second half of our fiscal year, our pharmaceutical-centric strategy investments to enhance our infrastructure and drive innovation and our commitment to our purpose will continue to drive differentiated value creation for all our stakeholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions.

My name is Luisa and I'll be the [indiscernible] [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Bennett Murphy, SVP, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. The floor is yours, please.\n\nBennett S. Murphy\n\nHead, Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us for this conference call to discuss Cencora's fiscal 2024 1st quarter results. I am Bennett Murphy, Senior Vice President, Head of Investor Relations and Treasury. Joining me today are Steve Collis, Chairman, President and CEO; and Jim Cleary, Executive Vice President and CFO. On today's call, we'll be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to GAAP are provided in today's press release, which is available on our website at investor.cencora.com.\nWe have also posted a slide presentation to accompany today's press release on our investor website. During this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements about our business and financial expectations on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, including, but not limited to, EPS, operating income and income taxes. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and change. For a discussion of key risks and assumptions, we refer you to today's press release and our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K.\nCencora assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, and this call cannot be viewed broadcast without the express proportion of the company. You have the opportunity to ask questions after today's remarks by management. We ask that you limit your questions to 1 per participant in order for us to get to as many as possible within the hour. With that, I will turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven H. Collis\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bennett. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Cencora delivered an exceptional start to fiscal 2024, with revenue up 15% year-over-year to over $72 billion in the quarter and adjusted earnings per share up 21% year-over-year. Given our continued performance and execution, including our strong first quarter results, I am pleased that we are able to raise our fiscal 2024 full year guidance.\nThe strength of our business is bolstered by the execution of our teams and powered by our commercial partnerships and strategic positioning. Teams across Cencora continue to prioritize customer centricity and enhance the services we provide. We are capitalizing on the positive trends across our business creating value for our customers and stakeholders and building on the pivotal role we play in the global health care system. Our core in pharmaceutical distribution and breadth of higher-margin high-growth businesses linked with our scale has provided us with a unique expertise, which positions us to support both upstream and downstream partners to achieve the best outcomes for patients.\nOur leadership in specialty has spanned 20-plus years, and over that time, we have built an unparalleled suite of services that connects, manufacturers and providers. Strategically positioning ourselves in the center of the specialty market. We have created opportunities to partner with leading innovators early in the drug development process through scientific development and consulting, safety and quality compliance and clinical trial support and logistics. Our downstream services enhance provider efficiency allowing physicians to spend more time with patients and includes patient experience insights as well as operational and financial solutions.\nSpecialty medicines and services will continue to be a key area of focus for Cencora as ongoing innovation and increasingly complex therapies drive opportunities for growth and allow us to demonstrate the differentiated value we can provide to our partners. We partner with biopharma players who are developing innovative, life-changing medications to help improve the lives of patients and advance the standard of care. To support their clinical and commercial success, it is imperative that we invest in all the capabilities we offer and position ourselves to meet their evolving needs.\nOne example is our global specialty logistics business, which offers solutions to transport complex products across our extensive footprint and provides key logistics for clinical trials. We continue to invest to support the growing demand for specialty logistics by enhancing the solutions offered across our footprint and implementing new technologies to drive further efficiency. This quarter, we announced 3 new transport stations strategically located across the United States that will improve our ability to handle products in trial and complex products coming to market commercially, since many of these products require specialized temperature control, we have expanded cryogenic storage and capabilities globally.\nThis ensures we are providing partners with the complex logistics they need for their clinical trial and specialty shipment needs while investing to remain the best-in-class partner with these promising therapies across geographies and categories as innovation in cell and gene therapies continues to excite and advance. Innovation in life sciences motivates us at Cencora, and we invest in our operational technical and logistics capabilities to ensure we are also innovating to support their tremendous potential for improving patients' lives.\nGrowing our capabilities and solutions in higher-margin, high-growth services positions us to be the partner of choice with market-leading innovators and to capitalize on opportunities presented by scientific advancement and the corresponding growing needs for commercialization, services and solutions. On the consulting side, Cencora Global Pharma Services group helps our partners to accelerate the speed at which their products go to market by helping them navigate the complexity of clinical, regulatory and access challenges.\nAs we continue to integrate PharmaLex, biopharma innovators are increasingly seeing the value we offer as a partner providing global pharma consulting alongside our ability to support their logistics needs from clinical trials to 3PL and specialty and wholesale distribution with expertise and significant presence in key markets in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Our expertise enables us to work with revolutionary medicines and products early in the development process and help support their commercial launches, giving Cencora a key role in health care innovation.\nOur expanded and unified enterprise is advancing Cencora presence as we continue to make investments and better leverage our infrastructure. Our legacy of investing in technology and enhancing operations -- to increase our efficiency, continues to be front as we pursue ways to enhance our services and customer experience. The sophistication, scale and flexibility of our infrastructure was on full display as we handle the significant volume of newly commercial and temperature-sensitive covered vaccines in the U.S. in the December quarter without negatively impacting our ability to distribute a normal pharmaceutical volume.\nThis is yet another proof point of the value we provide to the health care system and validates our continued focus on advancing our capabilities to further Cencora's strength at the center of health care globally. As we continue to grow in United as Cencora, we look for ways to capitalize on our range of services across our global enterprise and invest in platforms to improve the speed, precision and processes in which we serve customers. Cencora leads with market leaders and we must continually progress and adapt to help our customers navigate the complexity of the health care landscape.\nAs a global pharmaceutical distributor, we are focused on investing to support the growth and needs of our market-leading customers. We are able to use our scale, reach and expertise to build and advocate for programs aimed at mitigating drug shortages supporting our customers' ultimate ability to better serve their patients. To that end, we are proud to collaborate with the drug supply chain resilience and advanced manufacturing consortium whose mission is to work towards a resilient supply chain.\nOur work with the group involves partnering with stakeholders across the supply chain to identify effective policy solutions aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of drug shortages. These types of initiatives reflect our intellectual confidence and our organization's next minded approach to addressing challenges and allow us to advance our purpose to create healthier futures for patients around the world. Our position at the center of health care uniquely equips our team with knowledge to overcome the obstacles the supply chain faces and plan for future challenges, making us a trusted partner for organizations focusing on pharmaceutical supply chain resiliency.\nOur ESG and DEI goals are meaningful to the success of our company and our ability to deliver on our purpose. We recognize the importance of operating in a responsible manner and set ESG goals aligned with our business that ensures we are maintaining resilient operations, prioritizing our people's growth and well-being in the workplace and supporting Cencora long-term sustainable growth.\nWe recently published our eighth annual ESG report, which highlights our progress on our ESG program and how these initiatives contribute to our overall success. One of the key pillars of our ESG strategy is our team members who remain at the center of our company. At Cencora, we prioritized creating a working environment that fosters growth and support for all our employees. We believe that having a diverse and inclusive team underpins our culture and strengthens our operations as we benefit from the insights that come from having a broader set of view and experiences.\nAs we seek to advance our culture, we have been focused on measuring inclusion and engagement in our workplace. We were pleased in our second annual global inclusion survey, a majority of our team members indicated we have a highly inclusive culture. As a part of the survey, our team members provided leaders with valuable feedback and opportunities for improvement that will inform our efforts to strengthen our employee experience and working environment. Being purpose-driven to create healthier futures, we offer comprehensive benefits and apply policies and practices in our corporate culture that ensure all employees are able to perform to the best availability.\nAs an example of this, I am proud that Cencora was a recipient of the quality 100 award by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for our work in providing equitable benefits, policies and practices. This award recognizes companies that receive 100 on the Foundation's Corporate Equality Index that measure policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. These achievements reflect the dedication by our team members who have taken an active role in creating an inclusive environment and delivering on our critical role in health care each day.\nAs we look ahead to the rest of our fiscal year, we are focused on continuing to capitalize on the strength of our business and the opportunities provided by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy in order to deliver value for our customers and other stakeholders. I remain inspired by our team members' execution and drive to deliver on our purpose by demonstrating passion and adaptability as we work through an ever-changing health care environment to improve lives every day.\nI will now turn the call over to Jim for an in-depth review of our first quarter results and updated guidance. Jim?\n\nJames F. Cleary\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Steve. Good morning and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to my prepared remarks, as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated. For a detailed discussion of our GAAP results, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation. Cencora delivered remarkably strong results in our first quarter of fiscal 2024 as our team capitalized on the opportunities provided by our pharmaceutical-centric strategy, commercial partnerships, robust infrastructure and team member execution.\nIn the quarter, this drove over 20% growth for Cencora adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted EPS. Our strong performance in the quarter and expectation for continued execution and growth in the balance of year leads us to meaningfully raise our full year fiscal 2024 guidance. I'll now turn to a review of our consolidated first quarter results, starting with revenue. Our consolidated revenue was $72.3 billion, up 15% on with strong revenue growth in both segments. We continue to see good utilization trends broadly across our business in addition to continued growth in sales of GLP-1 products, particularly in the U.S. Excluding the increase in sales of GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 12%.\nConsolidated gross profit was $2.4 billion, up nearly 13% and with double-digit gross profit growth in each segment. Consolidated gross profit margin was 3.31%, a decrease of 7 basis points. Similar to the past several quarters, our gross profit margin comparison continues to be impacted by sales growth for low-margin GLP-1s and less volume of government-owned COVID treatments. The impact of these 2 items was partially offset by the full quarter contribution from the distribution of commercial COVID-19 vaccines which have higher gross profit margins given the complexity associated with the products.\nConsolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion, up 8% due to higher distribution, selling and administrative expenses to support revenue growth and incremental operating expenses in the International segment related to the acquisition of PharmaLex, which we closed in January of 2023. We Consolidated operating income was $886 million, an increase of 21% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income also included double-digit growth in both segments, which I will discuss in more detail in the segment level results. Moving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the first quarter Net interest expense was $41 million, down 12% primarily due to higher interest income resulting from higher interest rates on investments and lower interest expense due to the September 2023 divestiture of our less than wholly owned subsidiary and [ Egypt. ]\nRegarding income taxes, our effective income tax rate was 21% compared to 19.1% in the prior year quarter. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%. Turning now to diluted share count. Our diluted share count was 201.8 million shares, a 2% decrease compared to the prior year first quarter. This was primarily driven by opportunistic share repurchases over the course of fiscal 2023 and also repurchases in the quarter, including $135 million in open market repurchases and $250 million in repurchases in November concurrent with a transaction completed by Walgreens Boots Alliance.\nRegarding our cash balance and adjusted free cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and generated $763 million in adjusted free cash flow. In December, we made a commitment to exercise the prepayment option permitted under our opioid settlement agreements. This prepayment of approximately $238 million was made in January and represents the net present value of a future obligation of approximately $345 million. Since this prepayment was unplanned and nonrecurring, it will not be included in our adjusted free cash flow consistent with our practices for unplanned and nonrecurring payments or receipts relating to legal settlements.\nWe will continue to include the annual planned cash payments associated with our settlement agreements and our adjusted free cash flow and continue to expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2.5 billion for the fiscal year. This completes the review of our consolidated results, now I'll turn to our segment results for the first quarter. U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue was $65.2 million, up approximately 16% as we continue to see broad-based growth in our distribution businesses, which benefited from strong utilization trends, including continued volume growth in GLP-1s, growth in sales to specialty position practices and health systems and commercial COVID-19 vaccine sales.\nU.S. Healthcare Solutions segment operating income increased 22% to $698 million driven by strong performance across our distribution businesses, including commercial COVID-19 vaccine sales and operating leverage as a result of strong volumes and the expense management actions we called out on our May earnings call last year. Similar to last quarter, we saw broad-based strength across our human health distribution businesses with good volumes and trends in both specialty and full-line distribution.\nCencora continues to benefit from leading with market leaders and as a result, we continue to see good growth across customer segments and broad pharmaceutical utilization trends. We also had particularly strong growth in our Animal Health business, which delivered good performance in the quarter and benefited from an easier comparison given industry-wide pressures in the prior year December quarter that we called out last year.\nBefore turning to a review of our International Healthcare Solutions segment performance, I would like to provide an update on COVID-19 related contributions in the U.S. segment for both exclusive therapies and the commercial COVID-19 vaccines. First, regarding exclusive product distribution. In the quarter, we had $0.06 of contribution related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution in the U.S., a $0.03 headwind from the $0.09 of segment level contribution in the prior year quarter. This contribution was in line with the $0.02 to $0.10 of contribution we guided on our November earnings call related to our first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the balance of the year, we expect a $0.21 headwind from exclusive COVID treatments in the segment, in line with our previous expectations and guidance.\nWe do not expect a material contribution from these COVID treatments in the balance of the year. Second, regarding COVID-19 vaccines, this quarter, we saw an incremental and higher-than-expected benefit from distributing commercial COVID-19 vaccines. And as we said on our November earnings call, this was comparing to a prior year period where vaccines were distributed by other parties prior to their movement to a traditional commercial distribution model in September. The contribution to our operating income from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the December quarter was highly concentrated in the October and November months and in total was more than double the contribution in the September quarter.\nExcluding both the commercial COVID-19 vaccine and exclusive COVID-19 treatment distribution contributions, segment-level operating income growth would have been 12% as our team's strong execution and our pharmaceutical-centric strategy have allowed us to capitalize on good underlying prescription utilization trends and deliver significant growth. I will now turn to our International Healthcare Solutions segment. In the quarter, International Healthcare Solutions revenue was $7.1 billion, up 7% on a reported basis or up 9% on a constant currency basis.\nInternational Healthcare Solutions operating income was $188 million, up 16% on a reported basis or up 20% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the quarter, we benefited from higher shipment weights and improvements in air freight costs in our global specialty logistics business incremental operating income from the PharmaLex acquisition and excellent performance in our Canadian business, offsetting foreign currency pressure and the September 2023 divestiture of the non-wholly owned subsidiary in Egypt, which was profitable in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThat completes the review of our segment level results I will now discuss our updated fiscal 2024 guidance expectations. As a reminder, we do not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis. I will begin with EPS and then provide detail on the income statement items contributing to the increase. We are raising our full year diluted EPS guidance to a range of $13.25 to $13.50, up from our prior range of $12.70 to $13. Representing growth of 11% to 13%. The increase reflects our expectation for continued strong performance throughout our fiscal year and the incremental benefit from COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the first quarter. Now moving to revenue. We expect consolidated revenue growth to be in the range of 10% to 12% and on both an as-reported and constant currency basis, up from previous expectations of 7% to 10%. The updated guidance reflects an increase in our U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment revenue growth where we now expect growth of 11% to 13%, up from our previous expectations of 7% to 10% growth.\nThe new guidance range reflects the strong revenue growth we saw in the first quarter including the year-over-year growth of GLP-1s and continued good growth for the remainder of the year, driven by expected broad-based prescription utilization trends. Moving to operating income. We expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 8% to 10%, up from our previous guidance of 4% to 6%. On an ex COVID basis, which, as a reminder, excludes the benefit from exclusive COVID-19 contributions in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we now expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 11% to 13%, up from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. In the U.S. Healthcare Solutions segment, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 9% to 11%, up from our prior range of 4% to 7%. For our COVID guidance in the U.S. I will remind you that we only exclude the contributions from exclusive COVID-19 therapies in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 and do not exclude COVID-19 vaccine contributions since they are traditional commercially distributed products.\nOn this ex-COVID basis, we expect U.S. segment operating income growth to be in the range of 12% to 14% and up from our prior range of 7% to 10%. The increase in our U.S. segment guidance reflects our strong first quarter and continued momentum across our business as we continue to benefit from our leadership in specialty and alignment with market-leading customers, allowing us to capitalize on broad pharmaceutical utilization trends. Turning now to the International Healthcare Solutions segment.\nOn an as-reported basis, we now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 5% to 8%, up from our previous range of 1% to 4% on an ex-COVID basis. We now expect operating income growth to be in the range of 7% to 10%, up from our previous range of 3% to 6%. The updated as reported guidance reflects solid underlying performance trends and a slight benefit from current foreign exchange rates versus rates at the time of our initial guidance. Year-over-year currency translation continues to be a moderate full year headwind to our business and on a constant currency basis, we expect segment operating income growth to be in the range of 9% to 12% or 10% to 13% when excluding COVID contributions.\nFinally, turning to interest expense. We now expect interest expense to be in the range of $185 million to $215 million from our previous range of $210 million to $230 million, as our cash flow generation in the first quarter was stronger than expected. From a quarterly cadence perspective, we would expect interest expense to step up meaningfully in the second quarter similar to the prior year quarter, given typical seasonality and cash use. That concludes our updated guidance assumptions.\nBefore I turn to my closing remarks, I would like to briefly comment on our recently published ESG report. This week, as Steve mentioned, we published our eighth annual ESG report that details initiatives we are taking to ensure our business is equipped to operate resiliently, support our team members and create healthier communities where we live and work. We are proud of the business aligned approach we take to our ESG strategy, and I would encourage those interested to visit our microsite at esg.Cencora.com. The report aligns with a number of reporting standards and describe some exciting new initiatives launched over the past year, including our Cencora Healthier Futures Ram program that aims to support nonprofits and charities around the world doing work to advance access to care.\nWe remain committed to fostering transparency and reporting on progress on our ESG strategy. In recognition of these efforts, we were pleased to be named to sustainalytics 2024 ESG top-rated companies list on both their region, top-rated and industry top-rated lists. In closing, Cencora clearly delivered outstanding results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. I'm incredibly proud of our team's dedication and ability to consistently drive strong performance quarter after quarter.\nLeveraging the breadth and depth of our pharmaceutical-centric solutions, we continue to find opportunities to capitalize on commercial strengths and build upon the momentum in our business to drive value for our stakeholders. Now I will turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?"

Today my remarks will focus on the continued execution and success of our business in fiscal 2023, and how our strategy and capabilities as a global healthcare services company position us to further drive value for stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.\n\nFiscal 2023 was a seminal year for Cencora, as we're United together under a new globally inclusive identity and took key steps to advance our position at the center of health care, I am proud of how we continue to deliver strong results through execution by our team members as we capitalized on the strength of our business, while strategically deploying our capital by both returning capital to our shareholders and making meaningful internal and external investments.\n\nPharmaLex and OneOncology, were important investments made this year, that extended the services and opportunities we have to continue to differentiate the solutions we provide our core customers, our evolution to Cencora unites our team members under a name that better reflects our impact on healthcare as we continue to bolt on our commercial strengths.\n\nWe entered 2023 from a position of strength and have continued to bolt on the momentum throughout the year, delivering full year adjusted EPS growth of 9%, guided by our purpose, powered by our foundation in pharmaceutical distribution and differentiated by the breadth of solutions we provide our partners, we continue to execute on our strategic imperatives to advance our core business and enhance our capabilities to drive value in the years to come.\n\nThis year, we expanded our leadership in specialty by enhancing our suite of services for pharmaceutical partners and adding to the solutions we offer providers, in January we closed on our acquisition of PharmaLex, which broadened our suite of end to end commercialization service offerings.\n\nPharmaLex complements our capabilities in market access strategy, patients access and adherence and especially logistics, the business provides us a global platform of solutions to drive our long term growth and supporting pharma partners across the development and commercialization journey.\n\nOn the provider side, we made a minority investment in OneOncology, allowing us to deepen our relationships with community oncologists and which represents the next evolution of our long standing leadership in specialty, over the past 20 years, we have been proud to bolt this leadership in specialty through strategic partnerships and investments to continuously expand the breadth and depth of solutions we provide to both downstream providers and upstream innovators.\n\nThe acquisition and investments we completed during fiscal 2023 complement our core business and are a testament to our commitment to advancing our leadership in specialty, we also consistently invest in innovation to strengthen our ability to efficiently and effectively serve our customers.\n\nTeams across Cencora from our sales teams to distribution center operations, to consultants in the field, actively embrace innovative technology to drive our business forward and support our pharma partners, one example is our premier global specialty logistics business, which continues to drive innovation by adding services to support clinical trial logistics and commercial time and temperature sensitive products through to enhance cryogenic shipping capabilities and expanded use of real time tracking for shipments.\n\nTechnologies like these are vital, allowing us to transport highly specialized products, while giving our customers 24/7 visibility to their critical shipments, enabling them to better serve patients, innovation and the rapidly evolving health care landscape necessitate that we remain agile and adaptive to support our customers' needs.\n\nAs pharmaceutical innovation continues to advance, so too must our capabilities in supporting it, earlier this year we opened a new state of the art specialty distribution facility in California, as a specialty space continues its rapid growth the new distribution center increases our scale and allows us to better support our customers and partners by providing efficient and reliable distribution for these complex products.\n\nCencora's customer centric approach prioritizes, understanding the challenges our partners face and exploring how we can provide them the solutions and services they need to reach and better serve patients, as pharmacists continue to be recognized for their role as accessible care providers, who can bridge care gaps, particularly in underserved populations, we aim to provide tools and technology to enable them to spend more time with patients.\n\nIn August we hosted our annual ThoughtSpot conference in partnership with our Good Neighbor Pharmacy network, the conference brought together thousands of independent community pharmacists and gave them the opportunity to obtain education sessions on the evolving health care environment and latest technology solutions, connect and learn from industry peers and celebrate the impact community pharmacies have in health care.\n\nOur recently launching Cora marketplace, which was showcased at the conference, allows independent pharmacies to streamline the ordering process for consumer products in one centralized location, the solutions, we provide our pharmacy customers allow them to spend more time caring for their patients and understanding their needs.\n\nAn important role that has been recognized for the seventh year in a row by JD Powell with Good Neighbor Pharmacy ranking number one in customer satisfaction among chain drugstore pharmacies in it's 2022 US pharmacy study. Pharmacists also play a critical role in hospitals by working in alignment with physicians and nurses to treat patients and one way in which they do this is in keeping medications stocked and up to date for immediate use.\n\nRecognizing the time hospitals spend on inventory management, our teams look for ways to leverage technology to provide a solution to make this process more seamless, through RFID tagging hospital pharmacists can quickly identify out of stock or soon to be expired medications, ensuring that patients have access to the medication they need, when they need it This tagging is conveniently done at our distribution hubs before medications are delivered to our health system customers.\n\nBy understanding our customer's needs our team is able to leverage innovation and create solutions to promote efficiency and address their challenges, advancing our shared goal of improving patient's quality of care, each day we are enhancing reach and efficiency in the pharmaceutical supply chain and leveraging the breadth of our global health care services to help our customers navigate increasingly complex environments they face.\n\nDriven by customer and patient needs and our focus on contributing to prescription outcomes, we have forged innovative partnerships aimed at ensuring a stable supply of essential medications, earlier this year, we announced a relationship with a nonprofit entity that partners with healthcare systems to reduce and prevent drug shortages, as the exclusive distributor of their contracted products, we provide supply chain support and ensure that their crucial products reach their members in a timely and safe manner.\n\nWe have also cemented our role at the center of healthcare by building long term relationships with market leading customers, we provide our customers with valuable services, ranging from distribution and logistics to consulting to grow their businesses, which in turn supports our own growth, we are creatively resourceful and next-minded as we assess our talents and strengths and plan for future opportunities to create value for all of our stakeholders.\n\nSince the beginning of fiscal 2023, we have welcomed four new independent directors with valuable experience and backgrounds that adds to the strength of our board, these new directors add complementary expertise and diverse perspectives to support advancement, both internally and externally as a global health care services leader.\n\nOur commitment to elevating talent and advancing Cencora's capabilities is pivotal in delivering on our strategic growth initiatives, this year I am proud to announce we have reached 100%, dollar for dollar, pay equity in the United States and set three ESG goals that we believe are relevant to and aligned with our business.\n\nOur first goal involved business impact assessments across our footprint, to inform our business resiliency planning, our second goal was focused on female representation in global leadership roles ad our third goal targeted our team member experience in elevating our culture of inclusion.\n\nCoupled with the importance of achieving pay equity in our workplace, we know we must be conscious about culture and footprint to ensure we have the highest caliber talent, engage team members and resilient businesses, the sustainability of our operations and collective power of our team members, drives our ability to live our purpose, strengthens our business and culture and enables our leadership in health care.\n\nCencora's long term growth and commitment to creating differentiated value, drives our investments internally and our people, our team members are the core of everything we do, power our purpose and drive our execution with a diverse backgrounds and experiences.\n\nWe are motivating all leaders to foster an environment of inclusion that embraces diversity across the organization, leveraging unique global views across our enterprise and enhancing ways of working cross efficiency and differentiated customer experience for our partners.\n\nWe are very proud of our team members, whose dedication and execution, powered the successful year we had in fiscal 2023, as we move into fiscal 2024, we are inspired by our ability to unlock new opportunities united as Cencora and support the continued evolution of healthcare.\n\nAs a global organization, united under our new name, we are even better positioned to execute our growth strategy as a leader in pharmaceutical distribution, complemented by our higher margin, high growth commercialization solutions, while our purpose and who we are as an organization remain the same, I as well as our 46,000 team members are tremendously proud to now be a part of Cencora.\n\nWe are confident in our strategy and by building on our foundation and establish services, we are expanding, diversifying and enhancing our position as a partner of choice for our customers and partners, both now and into the future, now I will turn the call over to Jim for a more in depth review of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 results and to discuss our expectations for fiscal 2024, Jim.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nThanks Steve, good morning and good afternoon everyone, fiscal 2023 was a milestone year as we became Cencora, uniting under a name and stock ticker that are more meaningful and reflective of the important role that we play at the center of healthcare.\n\nSolid underlying business fundamentals, broad based utilization trends and execution by our team members, allowed us to deliver strong results in the quarter and the year, in fiscal 2023 we continue to do what we do best, now with Cencora, driving strong execution, deepening relationships with our partners and continuing to invest in our strengths to advance our pharmaceutica-centric strategy and help drive long term growth.\n\nNow turning to our results and as a reminder, my remarks today will focus on our adjusted non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise stated, growth rates and comparisons are made against the prior year September quarter and fiscal year, for a detailed discussion of our GAAP results please refer to our earnings press release.\n\nBeginning with our fourth quarter results, we finished the quarter with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.86 and increase of 10%, which was driven by operating income growth in both segments and a lower share count, as a result of opportunistic share repurchases.\n\nOur consolidated revenue was $68.9 billion dollars, up nearly 13% with strong revenue growth in the US Healthcare solutions segment and also in the International Healthcare solutions segment, in the quarter, our US Healthcare solutions segment continued to see significant growth in sales of low margin GLP-1 products and excluding GLP-1s, our consolidated revenue growth would have been 10%.\n\nConsolidated gross profit was $2.3 billion dollars up 9%, due to gross profit growth in both segments, particularly in the international Healthcare Solutions segment, which also benefited from the addition of PharmaLex, consolidated gross profit margin was 3.34%, a decrease of 10 basis points, similar to last quarter and as expected, the gross profit margin comparison is negatively impacted by 2 US healthcare solutions segment items, first, continued volume growth in low gross profit margin GLP-1 products and second decreased volumes of government owned COVID treatments, which have higher margins.\n\nConsolidated operating expenses were $1.5 billion dollars up 10%, this growth was largely driven by higher operating expenses in the international Health care solutions segment, including the addition of PharmaLex, consolidated operating income was $801 million dollars up 8%, compared to the prior year quarter, the increase in operating income was driven by growth in both segments, which I will discuss in more detail when reviewing segment level results.\n\nMoving now to our net interest expense and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter, net interest expense was $61 million dollars, an increase of 18%, due to an increase in intra period borrowings and related interest rates, our effective income tax rate was 21.6% compared to 19.8% in the prior year quarter.\n\nOur diluted share count was 203.4 million shares at a 3% decrease compared to the prior year fourth quarter, driven by $1.2 billion dollars of opportunistic share repurchases, completed over the course of fiscal 2023, including $250 million dollars in August concurrent with the underwritten transaction completed by Walgreens Boots Alliance.\n\nThis completes the review of our consolidated results, now I'll turn to our segment results for the fourth quarter.\n\nUS Health care solutions segment revenue was $61.9 billion dollars up 13% versus the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter, this was driven by sales growth across our distribution businesses and the continued volume growth we have seen in low margin GLP-1 products.\n\nU.S. Healthcare solutions segment operating income increased by 9% to $633 million dollars, in the quarter we continued to benefit from our leadership in specialty distribution to both physician practices and health systems, broad based strong prescription utilization trends and human health distribution and a great fourth quarter for our animal health business.\n\nAs we said last quarter, we expected one to two cents of contribution related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution, we ended the quarter with eight cents of contribution in the quarter due to the late summer uptick in COVID-19 cases, additionally, in the month of September we began distributing commercial COVID-19 vaccines, which was an incremental benefit in the quarter.\n\nThis contribution is comparing to a period where vaccines were government managed and being distributed by other parties, given the complexities, temperature requirements and customer channels associated with COVID-19 vaccines, we captured a larger market share in COVID vaccine distribution, than we would have previously expected, having used flu vaccine distribution market share as an initial proxy.\n\nThat completes my review of the US Health care solutions segment, I will now turn to our international Health care solutions segment.\n\nIn the quarter International Health care solutions revenue was $7.0 billion dollars, an increase of 10% on both in as reported and constant currency basis, International Health care solutions segment operating income was $168 million dollars up 3% on an as reported basis and up 4% on a constant currency basis.\n\nIn the quarter, we saw good performance from our global specialty logistics business, which offset a continued degradation of results at Alliance Healthcare's less than wholly owned subsidiary in Egypt, we recently completed the divestiture of the stake in the Egyptian subsidiary and the results of that business will no longer be consolidated beginning in fiscal 2024.\n\nEgypt was a headwind for the international segment throughout the year, including generating an operating loss in the fourth quarter and we are pleased to have divested our stake in this non-core business, in the quarter we also had higher bad debt expense in international, driven primarily by a reserve established related to a specific pharmacy customer in Europe, that concludes our fiscal, fourth quarter discussion, now I will turn to a discussion of our full year fiscal 2023 results.\n\nOur consolidated revenue was $262 billion dollars up 10%, driven by growth in both segments, on a constant currency basis consolidated revenue grew 11%, consolidated operating income was $3.3 billion dollars, an increase of 4% due to the strong performance in our US Healthcare solutions segment, offset in part by the International Health Care solutions segment, which was negatively impacted by the results of the Egyptian business that I, just mentioned and the effects of Foreign currency translation for much of the year.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, consolidated operating income grew 6%, from a segment perspective, US healthcare solutions had operating income growth of 6%, driven by strong prescription utilization trends, including continued growth in specialty and good execution in our businesses,\n\nInternational Health care solutions operating income fell 2%, on an as reported basis, due to the now divested Egyptian business, excluding Egypt International Health care solutions operating income would have been up over 3% on a constant currency basis this segment delivered 7% operating income growth.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we had 38 cents of contribution of adjusted EPS, related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution on a consolidated basis, compared to 72 cents in fiscal 2022, at the segment level, we had 31 cents of contribution to adjusted EPS in the US Health care solutions segment and 7 cents in the International Health care solutions segment in fiscal 2023.\n\nTurning now to interest expense, in fiscal 2023, net interest expense was $229 million dollars, an increase of 9% as a result of higher intra period borrowings for parts of the year due to timing of capital deployment, debt repayment and cash flows, as well as higher average interest rates on intra period borrowings, regarding taxes, our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 20.3% compared to 20.6% in fiscal 2022.\n\nTurning now to EPS, our full year adjusted diluted EPS was $11.99, an increase of 9%, driven by our strong operating income growth and strategic capital deployment, finally in fiscal 2023, we generated $3.1 billion dollars of adjusted free cash flow and ended the year with a cash balance of $2.6 billion dollars, we continue to be a strong free cash flow generator and have a balanced approach to capital deployment.\n\nIn addition to our internal capital expenditures, our acquisition of PharmaLex and our investment in OneOncology in fiscal 2023, this year, we also repurchased $1.2 billion dollars of our shares, opportunistically and just this morning announced that our board of directors has approved a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, the dividend increase demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a reasonable growing dividend and this is our 19th consecutive year of increasing our dividend.\n\nTurning now to discuss our fiscal 2024 guidance expectations, as a reminder, we do not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis so the following metrics are provided on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, I will also provide certain guidance metrics on a constant currency basis, we have also provided a detailed overview of guidance metrics on slides 11, and 12 of our earnings presentation.\n\nFirst, starting with EPS, in fiscal 2024, we are guiding for adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $12.70 to $13 dollars, representing growth of 6% to 8%, driven by growth in each segment and contributions from capital deployment, before I detailed the building blocks of our solid EPS growth for fiscal 2024, I want to spend some time discussing our approach to COVID-19 contributions in the coming year.\n\nOver the past several years, we've recognized benefits related to our role as the exclusive distributor of a number of COVID-19 products, which we have normalized for, by providing ex-COVID numbers, as we've indicated from the onset, we fully expected the exclusive distribution products to move to a normal commercial distribution model in the US and, as we all now know ,that will now occur during the first quarter of our fiscal 2024.\n\nThe key products driving our exclusive COVID-19 contribution are moving to our commercial model this month, in fiscal 2024, we are anticipating the remaining benefit from exclusivity to be as low as 2 cents, or as high as 10 cents, we do not anticipate that there'll be a meaningful contribution from any remaining exclusive COVID products beyond our first quarter.\n\nAs we've been doing for some time, we will plan to provide an update on the contribution we recognized from the exclusive distribution of these COVID products, excluding the benefit from exclusive COVID-19 contributions in fiscal 2023, our fiscal 2024 EPS guidance, represents growth in the range of 9% to 12%, with a small 2 cents to 10 cents contribution from exclusive COVID products in fiscal 2024.\n\nOn page 13 in our earnings presentation, we have provided a bridge, showing the components of our adjusted diluted EPS growth from the adjusted baseline in fiscal 2023, as I mentioned when discussing our fourth quarter results, we began distributing COVID-19 vaccines in the US in September and recognize the benefit from gaining access to these products now that they are commercially available.\n\nAs I also mentioned, we have seen better than expected share in the products, given the complex handling requirements of these temperature-sensitive vaccines and the customer channels, since these products are normal commercial arrangements, We will include contributions related to these products in our as reported results and will not provide a category level contribution on them, consistent with our approach to the other pharmaceuticals that we distribute commercially.\n\nWe continue to monitor trends for these vaccines, which have generally experienced, higher than expected, presumably seasonal demand alongside flu vaccines. Now I will discuss the key income statement items that drive our adjusted EPS guidance.\n\nStarting with revenue, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 10% on both, in as reported and constant currency basis, at the segment level we also expect US healthcare solutions revenue growth to be in the range of 7% to 10% as we continue to see strong prescription utilization trends, including continued growth in products IN the GLP-1 class.\n\nFor the international Health care solutions segment, on an as reported basis, using October foreign exchange rates, we expect revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 8%, on a constant currency basis, we expect revenue growth for the international segment to be in the range of 7% to 11%.\n\nMoving to operating income, we expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 4% to 6% or 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis, excluding the COVID-19 contributions I detailed, we expect consolidated operating income growth to be in the range of 7% to 9% or 8% to 10% on a constant currency basis.\n\nIn the US Health care solutions segment, we expect operating income growth to be in the range of 4% to 7% in fiscal 2024, on an ex-COVID basis, we expect US segment operating income growth to be in the range of 7% to 10% as we benefited from continued strong fundamentals in our core pharmaceutical distribution business, our leadership in specialty and good contributions from our animal health and upstream pharma services businesses in the US.\n\nFor our international Health Care Solutions segment, we expect operating income growth to be in the range of 1% to 4% on an as reported basis or 5% to 8% on a constant currency basis, on an ex COVID basis, we expect segment operating income growth to be in the range of 3% to 6% on an as reported basis or 7% to 10% on a constant currency basis.\n\nThe international Healthcare solutions segment has seen strong performance from our global specialty logistics business and good execution in our European distribution business, which we expect to continue in fiscal 2024, now turning to interest expense, we expect our interest expense to be between $210 and $230 million dollars.\n\nMoving on to tax rate, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 20% to 21% for fiscal 2024, similar to the prior two years, turning now to share count, we expect that our full year average share count will be between 200 and 202 million shares in fiscal 2024.\n\nMoving now to our adjusted free cash flow and capital expenditure expectations, in fiscal 2024, we expect adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $2.5 billion dollars, our continued generation of strong free cash flow supports our ability to grow our dividend and opportunistically return capital to shareholders through share repurchases, while also making important investments to advance our business, both externally and internally.\n\nWith regards to internal investments, we again expect capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million dollars for the year, we remain focused on ensuring our business is well positioned by investing in our systems and infrastructure to support our current and future growth.\n\nIn closing fiscal 2023 was a successful year for Cencora, as we delivered strong financial performance and took key steps to advance our strategy, we made investments to support our people and culture and united together as Cencora, as we have demonstrated, our business is well positioned to capture opportunities, driven by the strength of our infrastructure breadth of our capabilities across the supply chain and tough leadership of our team members to proactively navigate complexities,\n\nWe move into fiscal 2024 with strong momentum as we continue to capitalize on the opportunities. Presented by our pharmaceutical centric strategy and capabilities and remain focused on delivering on our purpose as we create value for our upstream and downstream customers, our team members, shareholders and the communities where we live and work with that I'll turn the call over to the operator to open the line for questions operator.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question today, please do so now by pressing star, followed by the number one on your telephone keypad, if you change your mind and would like to be removed from queue, press star followed by 2, on preparing to ask a question, please be sure that your device and your microphone are unmuted.\n\nOur first question today comes from the line of Lisa Gill with J P. Morgan Lisa. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nSteven Collis\n\nYeah, Hi Lisa good morning and thank you, so of course our relationship with Walgreens and Boots in the UK is very significant, we also have the WBAD purchasing alliance, so it's by far the most scaled and material relationship we have, so having said that, we're very pleased that someone who we've known literally for decades like Tim has assumed the mantle, and he has a proven track record.\n\nI first met Tim when I was running the specialty business at the former Bergen Brunswig and he was running the Accredo division at Medco, so we go back a long long time but our partnership is very strategic, we believe that there is always room to do more because of the scale that we have and also the challenges that we are going to have so you in the past we've worked together on purchasing and sourcing initiatives, I think we worked effectively very well together through this COVID season, where we both had our respective roles and there's been of course, much more patient direct in front of the patient, but we think that this relationship will continue to prosper and we look forward to Tim being very successfully in the new role, Jim you want to take the second part.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nSure, thanks for that question Lisa and I'll talk about the capital deployment portion, we've successfully collaborated with Walgreens on their latest transactions, repurchasing about $250 million dollars in shares from Walgreens in the most recent quarter and over a $1 billion dollars in shares from Walgreens over the past year.\n\nAnd if they were to continue to sell our shares, which wouldn't surprise us, and we'd view it as an opportunity to continue to collaborate with them and repurchase some of the shares and the amount that we repurchase would be dependent on managing our capital needs and opportunities and, I am pleased to say that this fiscal year that recently ended, we generated $3.1 billion dollars of free cash flow, so we feel very good about our cash flow generation and our balance sheet and our ability to deploy capital. Thanks, a lot for the question.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nOur next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead Elizabeth, your line is now open.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nGreat well I'll start out by saying that we feel very good about our guidance for fiscal year '24, on our consolidated level, our adjusted operating income, we're expecting it to grow in the 8% to 10% range, so that's constant currency ex-COVID and so some of the things that move us within that range, from a big picture standpoint, it's of course, you know the growth rate of our higher margin higher growth businesses. In particular specialty distribution, but also our commercialization services businesses, including World Courier.\n\nThe continued strength in utilization trends, which we've certainly seen in fiscal year '23, the extent of the strength of those utilization trends in fiscal year '24 certainly are one of the things that will drive our business, of course drug pricing always plays a role, including branded inflation and generic deflation rates.\n\nSales of Covid products, and I talked quite a quite a bit about that during the prepared remarks, and then of course also FX, but typically we look at this on a constant currency basis, and I can get into a little bit more detailed commentary on some of these things, on some of the kind of the moving pieces, as I said during the prepared remarks, we're expecting 2 to 10 cents of EPS contribution related to exclusive COVID-19 product distribution with the vast majority of that in the first quarter.\n\nWe divested of course, the Egyptian business during the fourth quarter of the year, which we were pretty very pleased with and that business didn't have a meaningful operating income contribution in fiscal '23 so the divestiture will not create a meaningful headwind to fiscal '24.\n\nYou asked about the GLP-1 products there, you know a key driver of our revenue growth, but they're minimally profitable for us so not a major driver of bar, operating income growth, but and so those are some of the things that are, from a big picture standpoint and a detailed standpoint, that are driving our business in fiscal year '24 and I will just finish up by saying we have very good confidence in our guidance, given our strong momentum and the strength we've seen broadly across our businesses as we've finished fiscal year '23.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nOur next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron research, Eric. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nSo let me address those things Eric, first of all, with regard to insulin pricing, there's nothing that I'll call out, the anticipated impact is reflected within our guidance range and I'll say that you know, as always, when there are changes that could impact our economics, we engaged in discussions with manufacturers and other stakeholders to ensure that we continue to be adequately compensated for the value we provide.\n\nYou'd asked about drug pricing and how that impacts guidance and what I will say as you know, we don't put out specific guidance metrics on drug pricing, but our guidance contemplates brand and generic pricing changes being in line with what we've seen over the past couple of years, with regard to brand inflation, it's really less important for Cencora because well over 95% of our brand by side dollars are fee for service,\n\nWith regard to generic deflation, generic deflation has moderated in recent months in certain pockets of the market, so it was less of a headwind for Cencora in fiscal year '23 versus prior years and so that was of course positive for us, if deflation were to continue to moderate more broadly across generics and it would be continue, it would continue to be less of a headwind for our business.\n\nI'll say that from a supply and demand dynamic standpoint, it remains generally imbalanced and we work closely with manufacturers to understand their supply and availability of product given shortened, shortages in certain areas, but as you know our business model is not reliant on generic pricing as it once was in the past.\n\nSeveral years ago, our leadership recognized the need to have more balanced profitability across the portfolio of pharmaceuticals, and so we've rebalanced some contracts to make sure that Cencora receive fair compensation for the value we provide across brand generics and specialty, which has been key especially as the market continues to shift to include more specialty products. And Steve did you have a follow up there?\n\nYeah, just a couple of things, I just wanted to say, in terms of anticipating any reforms as we know, the base of our knowledge most of the pricing concessions would take place below the WAC lines so that's what we anticipate at the moment, just in Jim on GLP-1s I'd say they are clearly most impactful on the top line and an incredible example of innovation in our industry and the patient impacts.\n\nWe expect continued growth in this category, but again there are much more meaningful revenue growth rather than operating income driving but an important part of our portfolio, and the last thing I'd say is that we continue to add advocates and help our community pharmacies to obtain adequate reimbursement on these products so, thanks for the question.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nOur next question comes from Daniel Grosslight with Citibank Daniel. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nYeah, So let me start off and I'll talk about our long term guidance and as you know our long term guidance it contemplates operating income growth of 5% to 8% and EPS growth of 8% to 12% normalizing for exclusive government owned COVID products and foreign exchange.\n\nThis we are assuming will be able to grow 5% to 8% in each of our segments and capital deployment contribution will be 3% to 4% our guidance is higher than that, as you know in fiscal year '24 as we called out as you've mentioned on a consolidated adjusted operating income growth basis, it's 8% to 10% constant currency ex-COVID.\n\nAnd there are a number of things that are driving our rug guidance in fiscal year '24 and a number of things that drive our long term guidance and one thing I think to keep in mind is that, kind of that the second half of our fiscal year '24 it compares to two quarters of particularly strong ex-COVID growth, including 15% growth that we had in the third quarter of fiscal year '23 and then the 14% growth we had in the most recent quarter,\n\nBut we have really good confidence in our long term growth capability and it will be driven by the things that's been driving our recent growth, with the growth of our higher margin, higher growth businesses, including specialty distribution in our commercialization services business that's continued strong utilization trends at some drug pricing and those sorts of things and so, we have good confidence in our fiscal year '24 guidance and you know very good confidence in our long term guidance.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz with Bank of America, Allen please go ahead, Your line is now open.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, our community pharmacies always differentiate themselves with their resilience and broadly speaking, they held up, they hold up well, around 20-21% of market share and they've been in that place for several years now, I think with product innovations like GLP-1s and more and more people doing the vaccine and COVID shots at the pharmacy, it does given opportunity.\n\nThe labor in excess to pharmacist is probably be easier on a more macro level or a smaller basis and you know often some of those pharmacies on smaller communities are very active in those communities and also some of them play a key role in access to under served communities as a leading health care provider in those communities\n\nSo we are proud of our partnership with them, you mentioned growing and I would say that we do that through our relationships with some buying groups that we are, I believe are leaders in this space, and you know it's a fascinating space for us and one that we'll continue to invest in, thanks for the question.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nOur next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. George. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nWe look at growth opportunities, as you called out, specialty is at a key driver of growth for us and after I talk I'll let, I'll ask Steve to talk about it also because of course he was the founder of all those businesses and we're seeing very good growth and with, in the specialty market, with regard to specialty physician services and physician practices, we're seeing good growth with health systems also and there's so much innovation that's going on in the market it's really a long, it has been and we think it will continue to be a long term tailwind for our business the innovation in that market and the capabilities we have, including all of our wrap around services that we offer.\n\nAnd then just in one example of our belief there is the investment that we've made in OneOncology, and then with regard to our commercialization services business, our manufacturer services businesses that are higher margin, we are continuing to make investments there and continue to see very good opportunities and in addition to specialty and it will really continue to be a focus area for us driving our growth over fiscal year '24 and the longer term, Steve are there any things you'd like to add?\n\nSteve Collis\n\nNo no, thanks Jim, Well said, certainly I think if you look at where manufacturer based in dollars of course, there's been a very robust sector with the GLP-1 category in the diabetes and weight loss category, but you know, oncology is one where so many manufacturers are focus, we still feel that we have significant opportunities with biosimilars and with some of the other new categories of drugs in this area.\n\nOur cell and gene therapy are going to be important business drivers for us, Cencora plays an important role in those products, and then on the practice management side, the data, value based care side, you know it's so robust this sector and our role in it is so in so integral to those practices, but it's just still a very exciting place to be and in one way Cencora will continue to be the leader so and hopefully, we also look to do more oncology in Europe over time as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Kevin. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nWe feel very good about our growth opportunity this year in international, you know one of the things that's driving the growth rate, that I want to make sure you know is we do have an extra quarter of PharmaLex in fiscal year '24 we had three quarters in fiscal year. 23, and we'll have four quarters in 24, also we'll really benefit for the fact that we've recently divested the Egyptian business and that was a headwind in our fiscal year 2023 and it will no longer be a headwind in our fiscal year '24.\n\nBut overall, where you also continue to benefit just from the very strong global specialty logistics business, the world Courier business, which has been an excellent performer and then also solid execution from the Alliance health care team in the Alliance business and so those are some of the things that drive our growth rate international in fiscal year '24.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Charles Rhyee with TD Cohen. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nSteve Collis\n\nYeah, you know PharmaLex is a is a strategic asset that's very complementary to our existing services, they as you know provide a platform of services in the US as well as a high level of service for a differentiated level of service than we've historically been providing in Europe.\n\nWe already had a commercialization service category top businesses with companies like other well known like Lash and Xcenda, World Courier in a way has many aspects of it that are more like a commercial, or are commercialization services, but also a strong distribution and supply chain expertise in our ultra niche market.\n\nSo these are areas that are very intriguing to us, we've always had a view that our customers are both up and down the supply chain and we want to carry on providing those best in class services and we have opportunities also for geographic expansion, so where else does it make sense for us to be and PharmaLex has been very adept at getting into new markets and it is present in many many countries.\n\nSo some of these compendium works we're doing, we've been talking about them and business reviews are already truly global in nature to the extent of very few projects that we worked on in the past so, exciting opportunities for us, a strong management team, we focus on the integration and I think you'll see a potential add on investments too , including geographic potentially but at the moment, we just focused on rolling it to the extent that we would want with key integration goals, so, but thank you for the question.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nOur next question comes from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead your line is open.\n\nJim Cleary\n\nOkay yeah sure, I'll start off with the animal health business there Erin and thanks, a lot for the question and I'll really focus my answer on our business and as I mentioned during my prepared remarks, our animal health business had a great quarter, both our companion and production animal businesses grew very nicely during the quarter and despite the companion market having some headline issues with vet visits,\n\nwe've continued to see good sales growth and in the production market the herd count remains near record lows, but you know given the high price of cattle producers want to make sure they keep their cattle healthy and so we have seen very good results there and it's probably been driven by, I think just really good execution by our animal health team the last few quarters, and then with regard to your other question on major contracts coming up for renewal, we don't have any large upcoming renewals in the near term.\n\nSteve Collis\n\nThank you, that concludes our questions I'll, just make a closing statement, Cencora is proud to finish our first quarter as Cencora and we move into fiscal year '24 with strong momentum, we are executing, as we always have to deliver results, we are investing in our business to differentiate our capabilities and deliver long term growth,\n\nwe are at the center of health care, and the care of the supply chain, the core of the supply chain, including very closely tied to these innovative products that we so proud to represent in the marketplace, our fundamentals are strong and our strategy is sound as we are well positioned to continue delivering value for all stakeholders in fiscal year '24 and beyond, thanks for your time and attention today.\n\nOperator Emily\n\nThank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call and you may now disconnect your lines."

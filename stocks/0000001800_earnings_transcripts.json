Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVice President of Investor Relations.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2025. We Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nEconomic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the related GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis for the non-GAAP financial measures for which it is providing guidance because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the timing and impact of certain items, which could significantly impact Abbott's results in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of 7.5% excluded COVID test sales. Our growth was led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices where several high-growth segments showed an acceleration in growth in the third quarter compared to growth in the first half of this year and also high single-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals led by double-digit growth in our key 50 markets. Earnings per share rose to $1.30, up high single digits compared to last year and up double digits when excluding the impact of the expected large year-over-year decline in COVID test sales that occurred in the third quarter.\nOur performance continues to be driven by innovation, positioning Abbott to consistently deliver high-quality results and durable long-term value to our shareholders. Recently launched new products generated nearly $0.5 billion in sales this quarter, and added more than 100 basis points to organic sales growth. Looking ahead, we expect increasing contributions from new products across the portfolio with a balanced mix of iterative and transformative innovation.\nI'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 4% in the quarter, led by adult nutrition business. Ensure remains the cornerstone of our adult nutrition portfolio trusted by millions of consumers seeking to maintain or improve their health, strong brand recognition, combined with favorable demographic and dietary trends, including an increased focus of protein intake and immune system health continues to fuel our growth.\nGrowth in Adult Nutrition was driven by 10% growth in international markets where we continue to see strong demand for both Ensure and Glucerna and to support future growth, we continue to invest in these well-known brands to ensure they evolve along with changing consumer preferences. We recently launched a new version of Glucerna that contains only 1 gram of sugar, and later this month, we'll launch a new version of Ensure that contains 42 grams of protein.\nMoving to Diagnostics where we saw modest sales growth in the quarter excluded COVID testing sales. As expected, challenging market conditions in China impacting both price and volume remain a headwind for our core lab diagnostic business. Excluding China, Core Lab Diagnostics grew 7% with markets such as the U.S., showing an acceleration in growth in the third quarter compared to growth in the first half of this year. Our strong consistent performance outside of China reflects durable underlying demand in markets around the world. And growth of 8% in point-of-care diagnostics was driven by growing adoption of 2 first-of-a-kind tests, our point-of-care concussion test and a high-sensitivity troponin test, which allows for earlier and more accurate detection of a heart attack.\nTurning to EPD. Sales increased 7%, led by double-digit growth in our key 50 markets, highlighting broad-based demand and strong commercial execution. From a product portfolio perspective, several therapeutic areas delivered strong contributions, including gastroenterology, cardiometabolic and pain management. These areas continue to benefit from favorable demographic trends and growing demand for high-quality, affordable medicines. We continue to make good progress as it pertains to our biosimilar strategy, a key growth pillar for EPD. During the quarter, we advanced the regulatory approval process for several biosimilars and remain on track with our planned cadence of product and geographic launches that began this year.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5% and driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, in electrophysiology, in cardiac rhythm management, in heart failure and in structural heart. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $2 billion in the quarter and grew 17%. In Electrophysiology, sales grew double digits in the U.S. and internationally. The launch of our new Volt PFA catheter in Europe continues to go very well and helped deliver double-digit growth in ablation catheters and international markets this quarter. Feedback from European physicians who have used Volt continues to be very positive, and we look forward to bringing bulk to the U.S. market next year.\nIn Structural Heart, growth of 11% was led by share gains in TAVR and growing adoption of TriClip. During the quarter, we achieved important milestones in our Structural Heart business. In July, we received regulatory approval for TriClip in Japan. TriClip is the first and only minimally invasive treatment option available to patients in Japan to treat tricuspid regurgitation. And in August, we received CE Mark for an expanded indication for our TAVR valve Navitor to treat people who are at low or intermediate risk for open heart surgery. This expanded indication is supported by data from our VANTAGE study which was presented as a late breaker at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.\nIn Cardiac Rhythm Management, growth of 13% was led by strong uptake of our lives pacemaker over, which is expanding the market and capturing share in both the single and dual chamber pacing segments. Our vision for over was to help change the standard of care for cardiac pacing and that vision is now becoming a reality with our Cardiac Rhythm Management business outperforming the market for 10 consecutive quarters and driving an acceleration in growth from high single digits last year to double digits this quarter.\nIn heart failure growth of 12% was driven by growth across our portfolio of ventricular assist devices and growth of CardioMEMS or implantable sensor used for the early detection of heart failure. -- and vascular growth of 5% was led by continued strong performance in our market-leading portfolio of vessel closure products and increasing contributions from a spree are below the knee, resorbable spent. In August, we received CE Mark for spree and we look forward to offering this innovative technology to people outside the United States who suffer from peripheral artery disease.\nLastly, Neuromodulation growth of 7% was led by strong performance of our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device in international markets, reflecting both continued uptake in existing markets and launches in new markets. So in summary, we delivered another very good quarter. Our pipeline has been highly productive and continues to fuel growth and we remain on track to deliver high single-digit organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth.\nI'll now turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhilip P. Boudreau\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Finance\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. sales increased 5.5% or 7.5% when excluding COVID testing-related sales. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 was in line with the consensus estimate. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on third quarter sales, which was less favorable than what we forecasted at the time of our earnings call in July.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin profile was 55.8% of sales, which, as expected, reflects a decrease compared to the prior year due to the impact of tariffs. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales. Adjusted operating margin was 23% of sales, which reflects an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. And based on current rates, we expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 1.5% on our fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we will now open the call for questions.",

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nAt the halfway point of the year, we are on track with our key priorities and objectives. In the first half, we delivered high single-digit sales growth over 100 basis points of margin expansion in both gross margin and operating margin, double-digit earnings per share, and we achieved a number of important milestones related to advancing key programs in our new product pipeline.\nOur sales growth excluded COVID testing sales, was 7.5% in the second quarter and 8% in the first half of the year. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 and exceeded the consensus estimate and reflects 11% growth versus the prior year and 16% growth on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter.\nI'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before I turn the call over to Phil, and I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by 6.5% growth. In Adult Nutrition, where Abbott is the global market leader, we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands in the markets around the world, and this growing demand is driven by consumers seeking a source of complete and balanced nutrition, especially for those focused on protein-rich diets and meeting the dietary requirements for managing diabetes.\nMoving to Diagnostics. Sales declined 1.5% in the quarter, predominantly due to the year-over-year decline in COVID testing sales and the impact of volume-based procurement programs in China. Together, these represent a projected headwind of around $700 million or 750 basis points on the full year 2025 sales growth in Diagnostics. Excluding China, Core Lab Diagnostics grew 8%, reflecting strong underlying demand in the markets around the world.\nTurning to EPD. Our sales in nearly 8% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in our key 15 markets, which surpassed $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. Key 15 markets include India, China and other markets across Asia, Latin America and Middle East. These markets represent the most attractive areas of growth for branded generic medicines.\nThe growth in these markets is supported by favorable long-term health care economic and demographic trends, including higher birth rates, and expanding middle class aging populations and growing demand for access to high-quality health care solutions. We serve this growing demand by offering a broad portfolio of branded generic medicines tailored to local conditions with a focus on key therapeutic areas. And additionally, we continue to make good progress towards building a best-in-class portfolio of biosimilars having completed 10 regulatory approval submissions across a range of emerging markets with launches projected to begin in 2026.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12%, driven by double-digit growth in diabetes care, heart failure, structural heart, electrophysiology and cardiac rhythm management. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose motors were $1.9 billion in the quarter and grew 19.5%.\nIn April, we announced a first of its kind collaboration with Epic, enabling direct integration of Libre sensor data into the leading electronic health record system. This seamless integration allows health care providers to easily view their patient's glucose data before during and after meeting with patients, supporting our goal of simplifying care to help deliver better outcomes for both health care providers and patients.\nIn electrophysiology, we had several key accomplishments in the quarter, including delivering a number -- delivering another quarter of double-digit sales growth initiating the launch of our new Volt PFA catheter and completing enrollment ahead of schedule in our [ PACTAFLEX-DUo ] U.S. pivotal trial.\nIn Structural Heart, growth of 12% was led by a combination of continued share gains in TAVR, strong adoption of TriClip and contributions from Amulet and MitraClip. During the quarter, we achieved several important milestones that demonstrate our commitment and progress toward expanding our portfolio of solutions to treat mitral valve disease.\nAs the leader -- as the market leader in mitral valve repair, we continue to invest in the success of MitraClip. So in addition to currently pursuing a label expansion to increase the addressable market, we recently launched a next-generation version of MitraClip, that further enhances the procedure with improved deployment and deliverability.\nAnd to accompany our leading position in mitral valve repair, we expanded our focus several years ago to include the development of mitral valve replacement technologies. And in May, we announced FDA approval of our Tendyne mitral replacement valve, which offers a new treatment option for those who are not candidates for open heart surgery or mitral valve repair procedure.\nAnd at New York [ Valves ] conference a few weeks ago, we provided an encouraging update on the development of our new [ transfemoral ] mitral valve replacement product. We acquired this innovative technology as part of our venture investments program, which led to the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies in 2019.\nAnd following that acquisition, we continue to iterate and enhance the technology and the FDA recently granted breakthrough designation. We plan to start the pivotal trial next year and look forward to creating a new solution to help treat the world's most common heart valve disease, which impacts the lives of millions of people around the world.\nIn Rhythm Management, our strong performance is a result of our strategy to build a comprehensive portfolio capable of significantly outperforming the market on our own historical growth rates. Our growth this quarter of 10% was led by strong uptake of AVEIR, our innovative leadless pacemaker, which is driving growing adoption of leadless pacemakers in both the single and dual chamber pacing segments of the market.\nIn April, we announced late-breaking data from the AVEIR conduction system pacing feasibility study. This was the first study to evaluate using a leadless pacemaker to deliver a conduction system pacing which is a novel approach to pacing that closely mimics the heart's natural electrical rhythm. And following the successful outcome of this study, we are targeting to start the pivotal trial next year.\nIn our heart failure business, often overshadowed by other high-growth businesses in our Medical Device portfolio, sales grew 14% in the quarter. This was driven by balanced growth across the portfolio, which included double-digit growth in ventricular assist devices used to treat both chronic and acute conditions, and double-digit growth in CardioMEMS, our implantable sensor for the early detection of heart failure, and vascular growth of 3.5% and was led by double-digit growth in vascular imaging and vessel closure products and increasing contributions from [ sprit ] are below the [indiscernible] and lastly, in neuromodulation, growth of 4%, was led by strong performance of our alternate rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device in international markets, reflecting both continued uptake in existing markets and launches in new markets.\nSo in summary, our diversified model continues to provide a strong foundation that is both resilient and designed to sustainably deliver top-tier results now and in the future. And that's evident in our performance in the first half of the year, which, along with our outlook for the remainder of the year and the momentum heading into next year aligns with our long-term sustainable growth objectives of delivering high single-digit growth, healthy margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. I'll now turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhilip P. Boudreau\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Finance\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\nTurning to our second quarter results. Sales increased 6.9% or 7.5% when excluding the COVID testing-related sales. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 increased 11% compared to the prior year and was above the consensus estimate.\nForeign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 0.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weakened, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin profile was 57% of sales, which reflects an increase of 100 basis points compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 27.7% of sales. Adjusted operating margin was 22.9% of sales, which also reflects an increased 100 basis points compared to prior year.\nBased on current rates, we now expect exchange to have a relatively neutral impact on our full year sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 2% on our third quarter sales. And lastly, for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.32. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.",

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we progress through 2025, it is clear that we are operating in an increasingly dynamic environment. Abbott was built not just to operate, but to succeed in rapidly evolving environments like this. We have consistently demonstrated our ability to navigate the complexities arising from a range of global circumstances, including the repercussions of the global pandemic, global financial crisis, numerous geopolitical events, just to name a few. In the current evolving economic environment influenced by new tariff policies, represents another global development that we are prepared to adeptly manage.\nThe proven benefits of our diversified business model are evident now, a result of the strategic framework that drives our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. While tariffs will have a financial impact with 90 manufacturing sites around the world and decades of experience executing our global network strategy, we're well positioned to implement mitigations to help manage the impact of the tariffs.\nI'll now shift our focus to discussing our results for the quarter. Overall, we achieved our target growth objective, delivering high single-digit sales growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. First quarter sales grew 7% or more than 8% when excluded COVID testing sales. First quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 grew 11% versus the prior year and finished at the high end of our guidance range.\nI'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil, and I'll start with Nutrition. There sales increased 7% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in Adult Nutrition and double-digit growth in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, our relentless focus on research, innovation and product quality continues to make our Similac family of products, the #1 choice for parents in the United States. In Adult Nutrition, growth of 8.5% was driven by growing demand for Abbott's Ensure family of products that serve as a source of complete and balanced nutrition for people with a wide range of nutritional needs.\nMoving to Diagnostics. Sales declined 5% in the quarter due to the year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing sales, resulting from a much weaker COVID season, which primarily impacted growth in our Rapid Diagnostics business. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, low single-digit growth in the quarter reflects the impact of volume-based procurement programs in China. Excluding China, Core Laboratory sales grew 6.5%. And wrapping up in Diagnostics, we remain on track to go live by the end of the year with two new manufacturing and R&D investments in Illinois and Texas, totaling $0.5 billion related to expanding our U.S. transfusion diagnostic business. Our diagnostic business, our transfusion business is responsible for screening the U.S. blood supply. Our current blood screening system, Alinity s runs diagnostic tests to identify various antibodies and antigens that may be present in donated blood. We have developed a new system called Alinity m that will allow Abbott to enter the molecular nucleic acid testing segment of the blood screening market. This advanced technology is capable of detecting DNA and RNA of several diseases that could potentially contaminate blood donations. The nucleic acid testing market opportunity is estimated to be around $1 billion and represents an attractive new growth opportunity for our business.\nTurning to EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Growth was broad-based across the markets we serve, led by double-digit growth in more than half of our key 15 markets. We continue to make great progress on building a best-in-class portfolio of biosimilars that spans across several large and attractive therapeutic areas. In January, we entered into an agreement that provides Abbott commercialization rights to four additional biosimilars across emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Through the various collaboration agreements we have executed, we have now added a total of 15 biosimilar products, projected to contribute to sales over the next 3 years.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5%. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $1.7 billion in the quarter and grew more than 20%, including growth of 30% in the United States. In Electrophysiology sales grew 10%, which included double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth in international markets. In March, we announced that Abbott obtained CE Mark earlier than expected for our Volt PFA system to help treat patients battling atrial fibrillation. We have already initiated the launch of Volt and we'll further expand the roll-up across European markets over the course of the year.\nIn Structural Heart, growth of 15% was driven by strong performance across our market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. Growth in the quarter was led by continued share gains in TAVR and growing adoption of TriClip. In March, new 2-year data from the TRILUMINATE clinical trial was presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference. The data showed that patients receiving TriClip had a statistically significant reduction in the occurrence of heart failure-related hospitalizations along with sustained reductions in tricuspid regurgitation and life-changing improvements in quality of life.\nIn Ribbon management, growth of 6% was led by consistent and sustained market penetration of Avere or innovative leadless pacemaker and Assert our newest implantable cardiac monitor. In heart failure, growth of 12% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offers treatment for chronic and temporary conditions. In January, CMS issued national coverage decision to cover CardioMEMS, a small implantable sensor that provides early warning indications that help doctors treat heart failure. This expanded coverage will broaden access to CardioMEMS for those with Medicare Advantage plans and help further expand coverage to those with commercial insurance plans.\nIn Vascular, growth of 6% was led by double-digit growth in vascular imaging and vessel closure products and growth in Esprit, our below the knee resorbable stent. In March, we announced the start of our U.S. pivotal trial to evaluate our coronary intravascular lithotripsy system in treating severe calcification in the coronary arteries prior to implanting a stent. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial next year and file for FDA approval shortly thereafter. We look forward to entering this large and fast-growing segment of the coronary intervention market and expect this to become a meaningful growth driver for our Vascular business. And lastly, in Neuromodulation. We began treating patients in our TRANSCEND clinical trial a first of its kind trial designed to evaluate using deep brain stimulation to address treatment-resistant depression, which represents a market opportunity exceeding $1 billion.\nSo in summary, we delivered another quarter of top-tier performance. Sales grew high single digits and earnings per share grew double digits. We expanded gross margin by 140 basis points and operating margin by 130 basis points compared to the prior year. The pipeline continues to provide a steady cadence of new growth opportunities with more than 25 key new products forecasted to launch over the next 3 years, and we remain on track to deliver on the financial commitments we set at the beginning of the year.\nI'll now turn the call to Phil. Phil?\n\nPhilip P. Boudreau\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Finance\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales increased 6.9% or 8.3% when excluding COVID testing-related sales. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 increased 11% compared to the prior year and finished at the high end of our guidance range and above the consensus estimate. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.8% on the first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weakened, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin profile was 57.1% of sales, which increased 140 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by delivering on the underlying organic margin expansion we forecasted and also included an added benefit of more favorable fall-through from foreign exchange.\nGross margin expansion has always been a significant element of Abbott's company culture. At any point in time, a substantial number of margin improvement initiatives are underway that span across our businesses as well as our functional areas, including supply chain, marketing and other administrative groups. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the valuable contributions from our Abbott employees around the world who are driving these exceptional margin expansion results.\nTurning our focus back to the first quarter results. Adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 29.5% of sales in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 21% of sales, which reflects an increase of 130 basis points compared to prior year. Based on current rates, we now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 1% on the full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact around 0.5% on the second quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the second quarter, forecast adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.27.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions.",

Welcome to Abbott's Q4 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. During the question-and-answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star 11 keys on your touch-tone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2025. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the related GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis for the non-GAAP financial measures for which the company is providing guidance because the company is unable to predict, with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the timing and impact of certain items which could significantly impact Abbott's results in accordance with GAAP.\nUnless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I want to express gratitude to my Abbott colleagues around the world whose hard work and passion are the driving forces of Abbott's continued success. Abbott's commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and serving the needs of our customers resulted in another year of exceptional performance, which included achieving sales growth of 9.5% excluding COVID testing, delivering 70 basis points of gross margin profile improvement, driving acceleration in the growth of our earnings per share throughout the year, and developing and advancing new products through our rich pipeline. The strong performance resulted in generating $8.5 billion of operating cash flow, which was used to reinvest in the business, fund capacity expansions, repay debt, and return $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nThese accomplishments played a key role in continuing our well-established track record for delivering on our financial commitments, which included achieving results that finished at the high end of our initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024. These results included exiting the year with a very strong momentum as Q4 sales grew 10% excluding COVID testing sales, and adjusted earnings per share increased 13% versus the prior year. For 2025, we're well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5%-8.5%, and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05-$5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint. I'll now summarize our Q4 results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition. Our sales increased 7% in the quarter.\nGrowth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in adult nutrition, led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. We achieved a significant milestone last year, with annual sales of Ensure surpassing $3 billion. This achievement helped deliver another year of strong performance in adult nutrition, with annual sales of adult nutrition products growing 9% last year. This strong performance is a continuation of a well-established trend. The five-year compound annual growth rate in adult nutrition is 9%, which reflects the impact of our well-known and respected brands, favorable demographic trends, and the significant investments we've made to expand manufacturing capacity to serve the growing global demand for our products. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased 6% excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics, where excluding COVID testing sales increased 16% in the quarter.\nThis was driven by strong demand for our portfolio of respiratory disease tests used to help diagnose influenza, strep throat, and RSV. In core laboratory diagnostics, growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for our market-leading immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and blood screening testing panels. Excluding the impact of challenging market dynamics in China, the combined growth in all other markets was double digits in the quarter. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 8.5% in the quarter, growth was well-balanced across markets and therapeutic areas that we participate in, including gastroenterology, women's health, CNS, and pain management. EPD also delivered broad-based growth across the markets we serve, including double-digit growth in several countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.\nBy focusing on the therapies most needed in these fast-growing markets, we continue to sustain our long track record of delivering strong growth, which includes a five-year compound annual growth rate for EPD of 8%. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14%. In diabetes care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $1.8 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. For the full year 2024, sales of continuous glucose monitors were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22%. This included growth of 27% in the US, where our market share on a revenue basis has increased by more than 10 share points over the last three years. In electrophysiology, growth of 9% was well-balanced across the US and international markets.\nAs expected, growth in the quarter was impacted by a challenging comparison versus the prior year, where we saw a sharp increase in demand for our EnSite cardiac mapping systems as customers prepared for the launch of PFA catheters. Excluding the impact of this prior-year comparison dynamic, growth would have been double digits globally in the US and internationally. In structural heart, growth of 23% was driven by strong performance across our market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions, and transcatheter repair and replacement products. Structural heart represents one of the most attractive areas in the field of medical technologies. It is an area that we have invested in heavily, and we're seeing those investments yield outstanding results. Our comprehensive portfolio of products drove an acceleration in sales growth in structural heart throughout the year.\nIn rhythm management, growth of 7% was led by Aveir, our innovative leadless pacemaker, and Assert-IQ, our newest implantable cardiac monitor, which we launched in the US last year. With growth of 7% for the full year, our rhythm management business delivered another year of performance that far exceeded the market, and we expect that to continue this year. Last month, we announced that we completed the first-in-human implants of a new version of Aveir specifically designed to deliver pacing to the left bundle branch area of the heart, activating the heart's natural conduction system. This highly innovative device, currently in development, was granted breakthrough designation by the FDA. In heart failure, growth of 9.5% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offer treatment for chronic and temporary conditions.\nIn vascular, growth of 7% was led by double-digit growth in vessel closure products and growth from Esprit, our below-the-knee resorbable stent. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 8%, driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device. So, in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales growing 10% and earnings per share growing 13%. For the year, we achieved the upper end of the initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024. We made great progress expanding our gross margin profile, and we expect that progress to continue into 2025. The pipeline continues to provide a steady cadence of new growth opportunities, and we're well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth in 2025. And I'll turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our Q4 results, sales increased 8.8% on an organic basis and increased 10.1% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on Q4 sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen against most currencies, which resulted in an unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in October. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the Q4. Lastly, our Q4 adjusted tax rate was 15%.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025, today we issued guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share of $5.05-$5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range and contemplates an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $1.05-$1.09 for the first quarter. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5%-8.5%. Please note that we are no longer providing separate guidance for the sales growth excluding COVID testing sales, as COVID testing sales represents less than 2% of total company sales in 2024. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 2.5% on full-year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our Q4 reported sales.\nWe expect our full-year 2025 adjusted gross margin profile to be around 57% of sales, which reflects an improvement of around 80 basis points versus the prior year. We forecast our full-year 2025 adjusted operating margin profile to be in the range of 23.5%-24% of sales, which reflects an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year at the midpoint of the range. This improvement is driven by a combination of strong gross margin expansion and operating margin leverage. We forecast our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16%-17%, which reflects an increase compared to last year related to the adoption of the Pillar II tax framework. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star 11 on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising you that your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star 11 again. For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. And again, that's star 11 to ask a question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from Robert Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Marcus\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice quarter and guide. And maybe, Robert, I could start with the 2025 guide. Once again, guiding to high single-digit organic sales growth, healthy operating margin expansion, and nice to see 10% EPS growth back in the algorithm again. Maybe you could just speak to some of the key growth drivers and how we should think about the different business segments on the top line, and some of the components of the operating margin expansion down the P&L. Thanks a lot.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure, Robert. Yeah, it's nice to see kind of the headline print now back to double-digit EPS growth. I think that's probably one of the things that you'll, it's one of the things you'll see now, Robbie, as we go into 2025. I mean, you've got a lot of growth drivers there, but I think one of the big things is that you don't have the COVID sales decline cloud that's kind of overshadowing all these real strong growth drivers that we've got in the business. And you saw that in Q3 as we showed 13% EPS, sorry, in Q4 as we showed 13% EPS growth. So I think that's one big aspect is just not having those sales decline. I mean, we've got COVID sales in 2025, but it's, as Phil said in his comments, significantly less from our total revenue perspective.\nI think it starts with the top line always, Robert. The markets that we compete in remain attractive. We're seeing acceleration in several of them. I mean, we're a very diversified healthcare company, so we get to benefit from all the different dynamics that are going on in healthcare, whether it's increased health and wellness focus from consumers. We get to benefit from that on our nutrition business. Every treatment requires a diagnostic test. About 70% of them require a diagnostic test. So we're seeing continued growth over there. We've got two areas where we focus on treatments, whether it's pharmaceuticals or med tech. All of those markets are accelerating. Within them, we've got strong product portfolios that are either keeping up with these very high-growth markets or we're outperforming the markets and taking shares.\nIf you look at the contributions, we've got your current drivers, whether it's Libre, TriClip, Aveir, Navitor, Amulet, all of those products in the cardiovascular space. So the bases are loaded, I would call that. Then you've got nice our next circle and a lineup of catalysts that are coming up right after that, whether it's biosimilars, Volt, innovations in the Libre portfolio, some clinical trial readouts. So I think we feel very good about all of the businesses. You saw all of the businesses improve their growth from Q3-Q4. I think it starts with the top line, and I think we're well positioned in them. To your question on the margin drivers, I'd say we've done a lot of work on gross margin expansion. We've talked about that, committing to a 70 basis point improvement in 2024. We achieved that.\nWe believe that we can achieve another 80 basis points of improvement in 2025. And that's what's embedded in that guide is continuous improvement on the gross margin to the tune of 80 basis points, really driven by continued focus on gross margin improvement programs and then mix as some of the higher gross margin products continue to grow ahead of the company average. You get that mix effect. And then down the P&L, I think you've got an opportunity, as we've talked about in the past, to be able to leverage the business and obtain spending leverage across the business. And again, I think that was another challenge we had during COVID or as the COVID was coming down. We really only relied on one lever of margin expansion, which was gross margin improvement. I'd say now you've got two.\nWe actually have two, which is our original formula of gross margin expansion and then spending leverage. So you put all that together, you've got about 16% actually underlying growth in the EPS coming from the top line, the gross margin improvement, and the spending leverage. And then we've got, obviously, some friction on FX. I think every company is going to face that as we've seen the strengthening dollar and increased tax rates, which also aren't a surprise. We've known about that. And so that brings us down to that 10%. So I kind of look at this and say, \"Okay, what you see now for 2025 is the Abbott that we know, the Abbott identity that we've built, which is high single-digit top line, double-digit bottom line, gross margin improvement, spending, leverage, and productivity, strong operating cash flow.\nWe know how to deal with FX, so we deal with it every year, and we're dealing with it again this year and still being able to deliver double-digit EPS, dealing with the higher tax rates. I think I saw some notes about calendarization, about maybe Q1 not coming in. I could tell you we looked at our Q1 and all of our gating. All of our gating on EPS is very much aligned to what it was in 2024. It's very much aligned to what it was pre-COVID. So again, all the elements of Abbott and the Abbott identity that we know are there, and we're looking forward to 2025.\n\nRobert Marcus\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Robert, I guess you talked about it starts with the top line. You had another really strong year for CGM with over 20% constant currency growth on $6.5 billion in sales. So I'd love to hear you talk about your expectations for growth in 2025, the status of the Libre 3 supply issues, and any color you have on the Lingo launch. Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. So let me talk about Libre 3 supply. As we spoke about during the last call, Larry, there was a little bit of a mismatch between our manufacturing coming up online and the demand that we were seeing, especially here in the U.S. That caused a little bit of friction there. But as I said, we were in process of getting our new manufacturing site up and running. I was there in November and seeing the team, and that's going now at full force. So Libre 3 supply with two manufacturing sites up and running. And I think you'll start to see throughout the next one or two quarters a change here and a little bit on the MBRXs, on the TRXs. I know you guys like to look at those quite often, I guess.\nThose are an important metric to look at, Larry, but they're not the only metric to see how the businesses are doing. I mean, I think you saw that in our Q4, we were able to grow the U.S. 24%. So there are other elements that aren't measured. I think you guys also saw the impact of relying exclusively on those data in Q3 as competitors had challenges also. So it's an important metric to look at, but I would say it's not the only ones, and I think we've kind of shown that here. So Libre 3 is doing pretty well, and it's just going to get better. As I look at 2025, I'd say there's some pretty interesting kind of growth drivers here for us. I'd say first, as a base case, I still think there's under-penetration in the intensive insulin-using segment.\nI mean, if you look at the U.S., there's still 25% of that segment that are not on CGMs. And if you think about that internationally, it's more like 50%. So I still think, as a base case to driving all this growth, there's all this opportunity in this segment. But I think there are three areas in 2025 that I believe accelerate that opportunity for us. One of them is obviously basal coverage. And we continue to see, with the publication of more clinical evidence, you see more and more markets move towards expanding basal coverage, reimbursement coverage. Now, we have a couple of markets where we're the only ones that do have that coverage, whether it's Japan or Canada. These are large markets. So these are great opportunities for us where we've got this head start, and we'll keep on driving that.\nSo I think basal is a big bucket of growth. I think the other area that I've talked about as being an area of growth for us is more kind of share ability to take share. And that's through connectivity strategies with insulin delivery systems. We've been talking about all the things that we've been doing in regards to partnership with insulin pump companies. And I think you'll see throughout this year several announcements on connectivities and different geographies. And that gives us the opportunity to penetrate, albeit a smaller segment, but be able to penetrate that segment and take share. And I think the third area of growth for us of acceleration is just the whole OTC non-diabetes application with the launch of Lingo. Continue to see very nice trends. We've launched it in a restricted number of U.S. cities.\nBut I think now that we understand what it takes to be able to drive adoption with this completely different consumer segment, that will probably be expanding this and expanding this more nationally here in the U.S. and potentially looking at other areas internationally to bring this. So I think the Lingo launch is going very well in several areas. I think it surpassed some of my expectations, especially regarding reorder rates. And I think those continue. And I think that's going to be another kind of leg of the stool, so to say, on this growth. So I think those are really the kind of growth drivers that we've got planned for Libre. I think the intensive insulin segment is still an opportunity, a pretty significant opportunity. And then you've got these three accelerators on top of that.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about EP growth. Still strong high single digits in the quarter, and I think it was even faster than that, excluding the tough mapping comp. There's a lot of things moving around in that market right now. One competitor had a big setback in PFA, and your progress is moving forward with Volt. So just thinking about how you're thinking about EP growth in 2025 as you bridge to PFA in 2026 and your ability to kind of regain market share once Volt launches.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Yeah. I mean, I think this wasn't a surprise for us. And it wasn't really driven by any kind of adoption of PFA regarding our Q4 growth rate. In fact, as I've said in previous calls, I think the net effect for us, the net effect for us has actually been very positive. What we did have was an execution of that strategy, Travis, where we said, \"Okay, we're going to bridge ourselves.\" And one of the ways to do that is through our mapping. And that's what really drove our success in 2024, is what we did in Q4 of 2023, really taking advantage of our ability to offer the only real open, truly open mapping system. So that created that comp issue. It was double digits in Q4, 12% in the US, 12% internationally. So still seeing very good.\nI think, again, I would say these results. I think we outperformed a lot of the expectations that many of you guys had about our EP business. And I think the driver of that has been the team. The team in the field has just been spectacular, I think. And I've been close to them last year, and I think what they did was really strong. So I guess I answer your question in 2025, really looking at what we did in 2024. I expect to continue to benefit in 2025 from just the general increasing procedure trends. We've got opportunities to grow with some recently launched products, whether it's our GridX, our next-generation mapping catheter, our new Agilis introducer sheath. I mean, that's a great opportunity for us also. So yeah, it's going to be a little bit more competitive. It's been pretty competitive in 2024.\nI expect that intensity to increase when it comes to the ablation catheters. But I'm confident that we can maintain a strong position in the mapping segment and everything that comes with all the consumables that come with that. On top of that, our pipeline is very strong. We'll continue to engage KOLs and our customers. We've got an ongoing trial right now with a dual energy source catheter internationally and in the U.S. We've got integration with ICE. We've got kind of new sheaths to launch. So I think the pipeline allows us to continue that interaction with the KOLs and with the users. So we should expect. I think you mentioned bridging to PFA in 2026. It's more like 2025 on PFA, at least internationally. So I feel good about it.\nAnd maybe you've got a tale of two halves where the second half is going to grow faster than the first half as Volt comes on board. But I'd say for the full year, high single digits seems like a good place to start. Call that our base case. And then to the point that you made about competition and some of the dynamics that have occurred the last couple of weeks, it's still a bit too early to tell, but that could be an opportunity for us also. So I feel good about the business, not only the pipeline, but more importantly, the team that we've got. They're doing an incredible, real strong job.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research, Evercore\n\nHi, Robert. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong finish to the year. I guess I had a two-part question, if you don't mind. Really strong operating margins driven both by gross margins and operating leverage, but your gross margins are still below pre-pandemic levels. I'm curious, when you look at the margins, how sustainable are these trends? Perhaps not at triple digits, but should we be thinking about trend margin framework as gross margins normalize? And my second part is on balance sheet. I'm curious. There's been some M&A activity picking up in MedTech. How are you thinking about devices versus diagnostics? I'm curious. Any thoughts on cancer screening, MRD, etc.?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nI'll let Phil talk to the gross margin, the sustainability of that margin improvement, and then I'll take your balance sheet question.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nYeah. Thanks, Robert and Vijay here. On the gross margin front, I think we spoke to this the last few calls, and nothing here has really changed relative to an underlying focus of the business and of the organization, as Robert touched on here. I think the difference in recent years causing that erosion was the significant inflation in commodity prices, which has really sort of resorted back to, I'd call it, normalized inflationary pressures that we're very much accustomed to managing through with our organizations and focus on gross margin expansion. And so what you saw in 2024 was exactly that, the recipe we're accustomed to and the commitment in 2025 to do much of the same. So from an expansion standpoint, we expect this to continue, and it's not a matter of if, but when we get back to kind of the legacy and historical gross margin profiles.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I guess on your question on balance sheet, I've always talked about this, Vijay. I mean, we do take this kind of balanced approach. I'm not going to give you a formula of how much goes to here, how much goes to there. We do take a balanced approach. And on your M&A question, yeah, there's been an uptick of activity, no doubt. There are some good opportunities out there. And I don't think you're going to see a change in kind of rate environment, but maybe on the regulatory environment, I think that creates opportunity. I've said that we've got a strong organic pipeline. It allows us to be selective, allows us to look at opportunities that make sense strategically, but also generate an attractive return. I talked about how ROIC is important for us also. So not just top line, but return on that capital.\nSo we do take a position here of being stewards of that capital. So I'd say, yeah, we're in a great position. We do have some debt to pay down this year, which we will. I don't anticipate rates coming down to the point that we might want to look at refinancing that. So we'll pay off that debt. It's about $1.5 billion this year. But even with that, we're in a great position with our balance sheet to be able to leverage opportunities that we'll see. Talked about them. There's opportunities in MedTech. There's opportunities in diagnostics. And we're in a great position. It allows us to be selective.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nJoshua Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and echo Vijay's congrats on a strong finish to the year. Another margin question, just because the operating margin guidance for 2025 was stronger than expected. I think you talked about a lot of the drivers, Robert and Phil, but just continued positive mixture from strong medical device contributions and the strong top-line growth. But I was hoping you may just help us think through just the margin expansion opportunities in EPD, nutrition, and diagnostics, and just with the outsized expansion in 2025. And how should we be thinking about sustained operating margin expansion in 2026 and beyond? And should we be thinking about 50-100 basis points a year? Appreciate you taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, I'd like to get to that pre-pandemic gross margin. I mean, I know we talk a lot about this being behind where we were from a pre-pandemic, but our op margin profile, especially after our guidance for 2025, is actually ahead of that. So we've been able to achieve that through our spending and spending efficiencies. But I think that's the right range to have. I mean, I think we've always had this notion. I mean, I talked about being able to offset FX and things like that and not provide any surprises. That's part of the algorithm there, which is we're just constantly having to address gross margin. It's not like this initiative, either because of inflation, or because of tariffs, or anything like that. It's just we're constantly working to improve gross margins.\nI'd say on the nutrition side, those gross margins, given what we encountered over the last two years, those came down. But if you look at them, they have been improving sequentially, almost like every quarter. We've got a ways to go to get back to where we were in 2022, Josh. That's a little bit more dependent on commodities, freight, and distribution, things like that. But I think the teams have got a really good strategy here of kind of working on cost to serve and even, quite frankly, using some pricing where we felt we had to because of some of the increase in those commodities. So I think the nutrition gross margin is definitely an opportunity that we've got over the next couple of years. The pharmaceutical teams have done an incredible job at maintaining a gross margin under pretty significant FX.\nI mean, they do a fantastic job at offsetting FX. If you look at the margin profile in that business, it's actually increased several couple hundred basis points over the last couple of years. So they've been able to do that also through gross margin. And I think the other element is just ensuring that we keep on driving the MedTech business that have accretive gross margins, quite frankly, across all of those different business units. And if we can continue to do that, then that's how you get to that model of maybe 50 to 100 basis points every single year. That's our target. We committed to 70, and we delivered to 70. We're now committing to 80 for 2025 and getting us closer to where we were pre-pandemic.\nSo, I feel good about what we're doing, the strategy we got in place, the discipline that we have as a management team to review these programs and dedicate time. They don't just happen. We got to make decisions. There's oversight. So, I feel good about it.\n\nJoshua Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nExcellent. Thanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping, Robert, you could go into a little bit more detail on the Structural Heart business. As you kind of break down the pieces of that portfolio, you have a balance of drivers, some more legacy like MitraClip and some that are more emerging categories like TriClip in the tricuspid repair segment. But maybe you could help us think about the evolution of that business, which did very nicely through 2024, and how we should think about that into 2025. And maybe that could just contextualize the broader outlook here. And I appreciate your comments about getting back to the habit of high single-digit top line and double-digit bottom line. But it looks like 2025 does carry some headwinds that may prove to be one-time in nature, like VBP dynamics in China on the diagnostic side, the transient competition in EP.\nSo maybe you could kind of give us some color on Structural Heart, but also help contextualize the growth rate in 2025 as we think about the long term as well?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. It's interesting. The sixth question comes on Structural Heart after we posted a 23% growth. So thank you, David. As I said in my opening comments, I think this is one of the most attractive areas in MedTech. And it's one that we looked at several years ago and said, \"We're going to build truly a market-leading portfolio of products.\" And we're not going to just kind of rely on one platform to kind of drive growth. We're really going to assemble a full area here and look across the entire area. And even in surgical, I mean, I think I look at our Epic valve. The feedback I keep getting on the surgical side of it is it's just doing incredibly well. And it's really a preferred go-to on the mitral side for surgical repair, but replacement.\nBut yeah, I think in the past, David, I think our Structural Heart portfolio was just viewed as MitraClip. And quite frankly, the sales would say, \"Yeah, that's probably the case.\" But as we've been building out the portfolio, building out our stroke prevention with PFO approval, with Amulet approval, and driving growth there, Amulet did very well in Q4 also, grew 25%. Getting into the aortic segment, right, and really being a player there that has established now clinical credibility, whether it's through clinical trials, but also actual real-world usage of the product. I've been seeing some of Navitor cases here in the U.S., and just the feedback has been very, very positive. So building our aortic portfolio there, we're making big investments, whether it's in our clinical trials to build out our indications.\nWe recently talked about, shared that we are developing a balloon expandable TAVR valve, and we want to have a full aortic portfolio. On the tricuspid side, we were one of the leaders there to say, \"Hey, there's no real good transcatheter opportunity here to treat PR.\" TriClip has done very well. It's done extremely well, quite frankly, throughout this year. I think the team has done an incredible job getting approved behind the competitor. I would say right now, our data says that the ratio of repaired to replaced is about 2 to 1, and we're leveraging all of that built-in kind of infrastructure and scale that we already built with MitraClip. So what you see now is a structural heart portfolio, $2.5 billion grown in, let's call it mid-teens, because it is much more diversified and, quite frankly, very competitive products in these high-growth areas.\nSo I think that's going to continue, and we're committed to making these investments. We've got new versions of Amulet to launch. We just got an approval for an updated version of TriClip that ease even more the implant. You're going to see clinical trials read out in this area for labeled expansion indications in TAVR and LAA. So this is an area that I think what you're seeing now, that kind of growth rate coming from the investments and just great execution from the team. So your question was about growth rate and.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. I was trying to take a second one in there with just to contextualize the 25% growth rate given some one-time-ish headwinds like VBP in China, diagnostics, and the dynamics in EP being potentially kind of transient as well.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, listen, every quarter, every year, there's always going to be some headwind. What we're trying to do here is assemble, David, more tailwinds than headwinds, right? But yeah, I mean, you mentioned one, which is a little bit of a headwind for us in our diagnostic business regarding VBP. That's going to be with us in 2025 as they're rolling out new panels of testing. That's going to go through that. But outside of that, I'd say the diagnostic business is doing very well. Q4 growth rates in most areas were actually higher than the full-year growth rate in those same areas. U.S., Latin America, Europe, even Japan was faster in Q4. So yeah, we do have a challenge, but most companies are going to do. And you know what? We've gone through these, David.\nEvery company goes through a VBP, and what we're trying to do is, okay, we're not going to define the company by having this one kind of headwind. We've got a lot more tailwinds to leverage. We still have to deal with it. We're still managing it. It's still an important part of the business. But the company is more than just VBP in diagnostics in one important market, but just one market. So I think the growth rate is very robust. I mean, 8% of the midpoint on a base of $40-plus billion, I think is pretty strong and pretty good.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nTerrific. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is open.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the question. Nice quarter. I'm curious if you could just sort of step back and talk about the overall health of the MedTech market. I feel like I'm constantly answering questions on things such as volume and price and looking at you delivering mid-teens revenue growth. I think you're seeing something that maybe not everybody is seeing. I'd love to get your view on that. Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, I think it does put us. I mean, the way our portfolio is structured, Joanne, is that it does give us a little bit of a perch, a little bit of a bird's-eye view into the entire healthcare system and the spectrum, right? I think if you're getting questions on MedTech and MedTech growth, I think all you got to do is continue to look at what companies are reporting. And what they're reporting is ultimately what we're seeing in the market, which is it's not a post-COVID pent-up demand. You are seeing a greater focus from, whether consumers or the technologies that are being developed, that are attracting more people into these procedures. So I think what we're seeing here is continued utilization growth, really driven by, whether it's demographics combined with the innovation.\nI mean, what the industry is doing in terms of the innovation that we're bringing to the market, it's pretty spectacular. And the procedures are getting faster. They're getting less invasive. And that's attracting more people to look at these procedures as a real viable first-line option versus guided medical therapy. So I think that's going to continue as long as we continue to see this innovation where we are obviously positioning ourselves pretty strongly in this. And you've seen sequential improvement in the growth rate across, quite frankly, a lot of our businesses in MedTech. So I think the utilization is definitely increasing. I think there's maybe some questions of, okay, what's going to happen with pricing? We've historically seen some price erosion in the past. I'd say over the last couple of years, it's actually been pretty stable. So I don't know how that's going to play out.\nWe've got a scenario here where we believe that with our portfolio, we'll see some pretty stable pricing. But I think utilization combined with stable pricing is what's driving this MedTech growth. And we're seeing it in diagnostics too. A lot of our diagnostic business is actual hospital-based diagnostics. So we're seeing those diagnostic tests and those routine diagnostic tests continue to increase high single, double-digit, low double-digit growth rates in terms of utilization. So I think that MedTech is benefiting from just this increased utilization and focus of consumers wanting to take care of themselves and looking at these technologies as a viable option for treatment.\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for, excuse me, taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter, strong end to the year. Robert, we've talked in the past. I mean, obviously, we talk a lot about MedTech and the high-growth areas, but some areas where you've excelled are the legacy sort of slower growth businesses. I'm obviously thinking CRM being one of those mid- to high-single-digits growth. Can you talk about the approach that you applied in CRM and other legacy businesses? I'm thinking like heart failure, peripheral, and maybe how you're thinking about elevating those growth profiles in 2025, but then also longer term. Thanks so much for taking the question.\nYeah. So one of our strategies that we looked at a couple of years ago, Danielle, was if you looked at our MedTech business, it was growing like 8%, 9%. And that was a combination of probably high-growth areas like EP, structural heart, diabetes, even heart failure. And 40% of the portfolio was relatively flat. And that was mostly our vascular business and our CRM business. And the way we looked at it is to get our MedTech to be best in class, to be able to grow 12%, 13%, 14%, we need to continue the strong growth rate of structural heart, EP, diabetes, etc. But we had to find a way to accelerate the growth rate of our vascular and CRM businesses. And we said, \"If we can get them, these are historically been flat growth markets.\nIf we can get them to grow 5%, the way that would then work out is that we'd be able to elevate our MedTech portfolio to the mid-teens.\" So that's what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and the team has been executing on that. I think on the vascular space, what you've seen us do is kind of use a little bit of a combination of organic and inorganic to accelerate and increase our participation in higher growth areas, specifically in the peripheral side. So I think you started to see that. We've been growing. This quarter was a good quarter. Our target was around 5% for our vascular business by having stronger pipelines and portfolios in that more peripheral space. And you're seeing that now start to happen.\nOn the CRM side, our big strategy here was organic and getting to launch a very comprehensive and be the leaders in leadless. So we launched a single chamber a couple of years ago, launched a dual chamber last year, going to get into conduction and pacing leadless also. And I think that you've seen that over the last two years, our CRM business has grown 7%. And I think we can continue to extend that with the strategy that we're doing, which is to really lead in this area. I actually think that Aveir is probably the most underappreciated opportunity that we have in our portfolio. Look at it right now. You're asking a question towards the end of the call.\nBut I think really what you're seeing is these businesses, the focus, the innovation, the execution, and now you're seeing those start to deliver on that strategy to bring these flat businesses up to at least mid-single-digit growth. I think the team doesn't like that. I characterize them like that. So that's good. I'm glad that they think that they can do better than that. But we've got a lot of opportunity in those big areas, and we think there's innovation to be had in those. So we feel good about it.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nEquity Research Associate, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nOperator, we'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just maybe a follow-up here, given the tech guide that you gave for this year and some of the dynamics in U.S. and overseas sort of tax policy. It'd be great to get your perspective on maybe the direction of where those things are going and how we should think about them for having. Thanks so much.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Matt. There's a lot of narrative at the moment going on. But to your point and to kind of the guide that we referenced in our opening comments here, what we've reflected is all kind of current tax laws, guidance, and geographic mix of where our business growth is coming from, which is about a 150 basis point increase at the midpoint of this guide. That increase in the guide is driven by the increased adoption or the rollout here of Pillar 2 as it's currently enacted in these countries. And so that's what we reflect. We continue to be a good taxpayer, compliant taxpayer, and we'll see how more of this narrative unfolds here. But currently, we're running the operations and reflecting kind of what's known. And as Robert highlighted, absorbing this still within kind of the way we run the business.\nLet me add in on that one, Matt. I think you'll hear this topic come up quite a bit. And if I just take a bigger picture here, I mean, corporate tax rates tend to get hyper-politicized, especially during election years. And it's really not a political debate. In the business world, it's just an expense. It's just another form of expense. And in our world, when one expense goes up, you got to manage, and other expenses have got to come down or maybe not increase at the same rate that they were increasing. And I think what you'll find, what you find sometimes is you get a small handful of companies that maybe have a really low tax rate, and then that viewpoint then gets unfairly applied to everyone in a large company.\nThen you get these predictable narratives of companies that got to pay their fair share, etc. The reality is most companies pay their fair share and then some. I mean, I could talk about Abbott. Our cash taxes are over 20%. And that's one thing that people never talk about, is we use these kind of GAAP rates. But what really matters is cash taxes. That's the money that's going to be paid. But more importantly, U.S. companies, companies like Abbott, we play a key role in making the U.S. economy so successful. We're conducting a significant portion of the R&D in the U.S. We invest billions of dollars in capital projects, which then drive this drive job growth. Our CapEx spend has increased over 60% over the last couple of years. We increased our workforce by 20%.\nWhen you increase that workforce, you're investing $hundreds of millions in employee healthcare and employee benefits. This Pillar II legislation, this Pillar II rule here that got adopted, that's added. I think this rate that Phil's kind of quoted, that's an additional $200 million of expense. That's all it is, is $200 million of expense that is not going to investing in other areas. What's even more challenging is of those $200 million, 2/3 of it is actually going to be paid taxes to overseas countries. That's not really good policy for the U.S. We're absorbing this. We're managing it. I think, as Phil said, there are a couple still some new policies or new issues that we have to kind of work on.\nBut I think the overall goal here has got to be to ensure the competitiveness of U.S. companies and U.S. multinationals. I'm hoping we can get to that during the next 12 months or so. Let me just kind of close then on the call. I think we had a really strong finish to 2024. We exited our Q4 organic sales growth with over 10% top line, 13% EPS, as I said, finished at the higher end of our range, expanded our gross margin, delivered what we said we were going to do. The pipeline continues to be highly, highly attractive, steady cadence of great new growth opportunities. I think to VJ's question, we've got a balance sheet that's going to provide us a lot of strategic flexibility. So I think we're really well positioned to 2025.\nSo with that, I want to thank you for joining us today. Thank you, Operator. Thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott's investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you all for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."

Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star one one keys on your touchtone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott with the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question and answer session. The entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott.\nIt cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMike Comilla\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood Morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks following their comments. We'll take your questions before we get started. Some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024.\nAbbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law on today's conference call.\nAs in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at Abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth.\nUnless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we reported organic sales growth of more than 9% excluding COVID testing sales. We also reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 which exceeded analyst consensus estimates and represents a 16% sequential increase from the first quarter. Based on our performance in the quarter and confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we raised our guidance and now forecast full year organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing sales, to be 9.5% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4.61 to $4.71.\nOur performance continues to be driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio, with growth this quarter led by double-digit growth in medical devices and high single-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition. In addition to benefiting from outperforming expectations on the top line, we are also seeing positive contribution from gross margin expansion coming from continued execution from our supply chain teams, lower commodity costs, and favorable sales mix. I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil Boudreau.\nI'll start with nutrition where sales increased 7.5% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in International Adult Nutrition, and US Pediatric nutrition. International Adult Nutrition continues to perform at a very high level. The five-year compound annual growth rate of this business is more than 10%, which in addition to our market-leading position and commercial execution reflects the impact from positive demographic trends that drive increasing demand for our Ensure, and Glucerna brands.\nThrough the investments we've made to expand capacity, we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on these secular demand trends. On the topic of litigation regarding preterm infant formula and human milk fortifier, Abbott stands by our products and the information provided to the neonatologist specialists who have used them for decades. Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is a terrible gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants and it is devastating to families. However, plaintiff lawyers are advancing a theory that is without merit or scientific support.\nThese products, which are sold for hospital use, are incorporated into a feeding regimen along with human milk by experienced specialists and are an important part of the standard of care for the majority of preterm infants. Their use is supported by medical associations in the United States and other countries around the world. The products and their ingredients have been reviewed and are deemed safe for use by regulators who have also reviewed their labels. There has been no increase in the rate of NEC, meaning these cases have not emerged in response to a trend or any new information yet.\nWe're seeing plaintiffs' lawyers investing millions of dollars in misleading TV advertising in an attempt to move physician decisions from the hospital to the courtroom. Total revenues for these products are about $9 million annually and have remained at that level for the past several years. If these products were no longer available, physicians would be deprived of the vital food that is needed in the NICU. This would create a public health crisis affecting every state across this country. We believe it's important for all who have an interest in health of preterm infants to recognize the need for these products and to take action accordingly.\nMoving to diagnostics, where sales increased 6%, excluded COVID testing. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in core laboratory diagnostics and double-digit growth in point of care diagnostics. In core lab diagnostics, we continue to drive growth through increased adoption and utilization of our market leading systems and global demand for our extensive testing menus across the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and blood screening.\nWhile our Alinity family of diagnostic systems first launched more than six years ago, given the long contract cycles common in the diagnostics industry, we continue to see a benefit in our contract renewal and competitive win rates with several recent large account wins expected to increasingly contribute to growth in the second half of the year.\nTurning to EPD where sales increased 8% in the quarter, EPD continues to deliver at a high level as this business executes its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets where growth is supported by favorable demographic trends including increasing populations, growing middle classes, and an increasing focus on expanding access to health care. As you recall, we identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for this business. With our extensive presence in emerging markets, we have a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to millions of people in emerging markets.\nWe began implementing this strategy last year when we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in the areas of oncology and women's health, with the first of these expected to launch in 2025. We recently completed additional agreements that provide added access to biosimilar versions of market-leading autoimmune disease and GLP-1 medications. Biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market, and we look forward to continue to build one of the most complete portfolios in the industry.\nI'll wrap up with Medical Devices where sales grew 12%. In Diabetes Care FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 20%, and we announced in June that we received FDA approval for two new over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring systems called Lingo and Libre Rio, which are based on Libre's glucose technology that is now used by more than 6 million people around the world. While over-the-counter availability is a new option in the United States, we've been selling over-the-counter in international markets since Libre launched 10 years ago.\nGiven our clear leadership position in these markets, we have demonstrated our ability to tailor solutions, approach, and communication to the various types of users who compose the CGM customer base. Lingo is designed for consumers who are willing to improve their overall health and wellness. The Lingo wearable sensor and app will track glucose, provide personalized data, insights, and coaching to help create and maintain healthy habits. Libre Rio is designed for adults with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin and typically manage their diabetes through lifestyle modifications.\nIn electrophysiology, growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions, including 17% growth in the US, which represents an acceleration compared to the growth in Q1. Growth was broad-based across the portfolio and included 20% growth in ablation catheters. In structural heart, growth of more than 15% reflects an acceleration in growth compared to the first quarter and was led by several recently launched products that are driving new adoption and share capture in attractive high growth areas including TAVR, LAA, and tricuspid repair.\nThis quarter we launched our tricuspid repair device TriClip in the United States and continued our trend of capturing market share in the global TAVR market. In rhythm management, growth of 6% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and in June we announced that we received CE Mark in Europe for Aveir to be used in dual chamber pacing procedures, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. In heart failure, growth of 9% was driven by our market leading portfolio of heart assist devices that offer treatment for both chronic and temporary conditions.\nIn neuromodulation, growth of 8% was driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device, which obtained CE Mark in Europe last year. In vascular, we received FDA approval in late April for our Esprit dissolvable stent, a breakthrough innovation for people who suffer from blocked arteries located below the knee. Esprit is designed to keep the arteries open, deliver a drug to support vessel healing prior to completely dissolving over time.\nNew products like Esprit, combined with the investments that we made in our vascular business both organically and inorganically, have expanded our presence in faster growing areas and increased the future growth outlook for this business. So in summary, we exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines, and, as a result, we raised our financial outlook for the year. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin initiatives and, more importantly, our pipeline continues to be highly productive and thus we're well positioned to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I'll now turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nThanks Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results, sales increased 7.4% on an organic basis and increased 9.3% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter we saw the US dollar strengthen versus several currencies which resulted in more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates. At the time of our earnings call in April.\nRegarding other aspects of the P and L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SGA was 27.7% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.61 to $4.71, which represents an increase compared to the guidance range we provided in April. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of more than 2.5% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on Q3 reported sales. Lastly, for the Q3 we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to 1.22. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising you that your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. Again, that's star one one to ask a question. Please stand by. We compile the Q&A roster.\nOur first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, congratulations on a nice quarter and thanks for your comments on the NEC litigation. I'm wondering if you have anything to add on that, Robert. I had one follow-up question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nNo, Larry, I think I said everything I said during my prepared comments. I guess the only thing is I think this is way overblown in terms of its impact, and we're working to obviously defend our position and, you know, working with all the different stakeholders so that they're aware of the situation, the gravity of the situation as it progresses. I've said all I have to say right now in my prepared comments, and if there's a need to kind of get further updates, we will.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thanks. Separately, Robert, your EP business grew nicely in the second quarter, 17% in both the US and international. What drove that? What are you seeing with PFA and the different geographies? How are you thinking about the sustainability of that growth before Vault launches? Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Well, I'm seeing what I thought I was going to see. It might be a little different from what some of you thought you were going to see. What we've been seeing is obviously an increase in the market. Right now the market has accelerated, seems to be growing above 20%. So when you look at our 17%. It's lower than the market, but it's actually growing faster than what it was growing pre-pandemic or just after we had done the acquisition. We'll see, I mean, that growth is obviously in value. We'll see if the growth in procedures actually translates.\nWe are actually in more procedures than what we were in the past given our mapping and our teams. I think it's a little bit too early to say if the actual number of procedures is going to significantly increase. The market has accelerated. It's predominantly, I think, price right now with introduction of this new product. It's predominantly being used in de novo procedures, atrial procedures. We think that's about 1/3 of all ablation procedures, Larry. The other 2/3 we continue to see, whether it's redos, VT, SVT ablations.\nIn that case, we continue to see RF really being viewed as the better option for those procedures. We'll see how that's going to translate over time. The penetration is, you know, is around 10% to 15%. It's been pretty stable from the point of view of mapping. You know, I think we haven't seen a real big change of what we saw, you know, during those first couple of months of launch in the last call. So over 90% of cases here in the US are still being used as mapping. We've got a 50% share of those mapping cases. I don't try and look at different types of denominators to get to that market share. I make sure my team just basically has the best access.\nFrom what we're seeing, it's about 50%. RF catheters, similar to what we saw in the last call, still being used in about 20% of the PFA cases. We continue to see that. I think the net effect of all of this is the market's growing, it's accelerating, we've got a strong position. Everything that we talked about in the past about. Our opportunity with the mapping and all the other consumables is there. RF still plays a role. It's still an important role. Our business is actually growing faster than what it was growing before. If you look at 2019, we're about 12%. 2018 was about 14%.\nWe're actually doing better now. So I think that this is positive for the market, which is why we've invested heavily in our PFA portfolio, which you'll start to see hit the market. I'd say next year. I'm not going to try and kind of time the quarter here, but definitely next year. I think this is good. The teams have done an incredible job at executing the strategy that we laid out. So kudos to them.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks so much. Thanks for the comprehensive answer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BofA Securities\n\nHey, congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to ask about Structural heart. It really stood out this quarter, accelerated from last quarter. Just curious how much of that's on MitraClip recovery? You got TriClip approved early. How much you're seeing from the TriClip site and how much is coming in from some of the other newer products like Amulet and Navitor.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure.\nObviously Triclip.\nWas an important launch and helped accelerate the growth rate. Travis. I think it's pretty broad-based here. I mean, if you look at TriClip, we were ready to go because we had certain built-in advantages in this area. Right. We had the scale, we had the sales force, the manufacturing capacity, so we were ready to go. I think from our estimates here, even though we launched a quarter after our competitor with their system, I think the repair device is already in twice as many accounts as the replacement system. We had a natural kind of built-in advantage here as we went to the market, and the cases are doing very well.\nThe feedback's been very positive, but I think it's really broad-based here. Navitor has done very well both in international markets and in the US. The value proposition is starting to gain more traction. Great clinical profile, excellent hemodynamics, and that's, that's driving a lot of opportunity for us in international and US markets. We shared some data from our registry, from our Japan registry, and great safety also. That's doing very well. Amulet, we saw really nice growth in the US for Amulet this quarter with about 45%. That product is doing very well. We're focusing here on.\nContinued what I would call penetration in same store sales. So we're about close to 20% in the accounts that we're in. We're in about 1/2 of the market here in the US. So our opportunity here is to continue to expand the sales force. Go to newer accounts. That's done very well too. MitraClip, I think we continue to see some continued growth internationally in the US with competitive activity that's kind of slowed down a little bit of the growth. I think with TriClip now coming into the market and gaining traction, we'll be able to provide a value proposition across both repair systems and drive there.\nStructural heart, the growth rate has accelerated from Q1 doing very well. I'd say it's really across a full portfolio approach versus just really trying to sing it out one product or one technology. There's work we have to do in MitraClip, that's clear. In the US, internationally, it's done very well. All the other products that I talked about are doing very well and gaining market share and gaining adoption. That's why you saw structural heart growth rate actually accelerate. I continue to see that that's going to be definitely for the rest of this year and going into next year.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BofA Securities\n\nThat's super helpful.\nThen on your sensor business, how are you thinking about segmenting the market with Lingo versus Libre Rio, and how do you think those markets are going to kind of develop over time, and when you look at your core Libre business, anything to call out, any changes in kind of US versus international market dynamics?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, you're trying to cover a lot of ground there with that question. You could probably spend a whole call going through all of that. I think at its highest level, Libre continues to do very well. There's still a lot of growth opportunity. Obviously the basal opportunity is the biggest one and we're having great progress over there. Even in the MDI segment there's still a lot of penetration to occur. In the MDI segment, I think in the US there's still about a third of multiple daily injectors that aren't using CGM. International developed markets it's around 50%. There's plenty of growth in Libre.\nOur strategy here with Lingo and Libre Rio is just really to have a full portfolio and look at this as a platform where we can expand the user of the sensor technology across different types of diabetes populations. What is probably the larger market, which is people that don't have diabetes. I think if you take right now, I would say we're going to launch it here in the US and we're going to start expanding globally and we'll see how it looks like and what it takes to win there.\nWhat I do know based on the UK experience is that it takes some time to educate and communicate with a patient population that while excited about having new tools to drive healthier habits, they do need some time to understand its use. I think it's a pretty big opportunity for us and one that we've disproportionately invested to be able to get into this position. I think if you take Lingo and you look at US and Western Europe, the adult population there, you got about 400 million people in those markets. If you take a single-digit penetration rate, a few sensors a year, you're looking at a multibillion opportunity there and we're not there yet.\nI think once we've got better understanding of how this is going to work, we'll be better at forecasting it. Just at a high level and looking at it from a total adult population and relatively, I'd say modest penetration rate, that's a pretty big opportunity. Like I said in my comments, we've done this for a while since we've launched internationally and we've learned a lot and we're going to bring that learning experience here to the US so it's an exciting, exciting opportunity for us.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BofA Securities\n\nThanks, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOh, great, thanks. I'll add my congratulations on a good quarter.\nTwo for me, two product questions, maybe just to follow up on the FreeStyle Libre question, Robert, how are you thinking about sort of a holistic drive of advertising and word of mouth for these new products, especially as we move into the OTC versus generating data and how much will be necessary because I just, I think back five years ago and you know, where we are today was probably not in most people's forecasts. With the amount of data we have showing in non-diabetics how beneficial CGM is.\nHow are you thinking about data versus not data, insurance coverage versus not insurance coverage, and how do the markets look one way or the other?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, I don't think so from an insurance coverage perspective. I mean, if you're referring to Lingo specifically for non-diabetes, I think, I think it's going to be, I don't think that that's going to be something that we're building a forecast assuming reimbursement coverage over it. Even though I agree with you, there's nice data that shows. That people that don't have diabetes can benefit from this, Robbie, and it helps sustain behavior modification. Ultimately this is what it is. It's using data to be able to kind of help people that want to stay healthy, give them more information, and ensure that they can refine their habits or change habits.\nI think that that is at the core there. It's really communicating directly with consumers. If you think about the diabetes space and how CGM uptake, you needed both a communication with the patient, and you needed obviously a communication with the physician. I think that that's still important for the non diabetes. I think that some people will want to have some sort of recognition from the healthcare professional that this might be a good investment to do in. The key thing here is just the utilization. I don't think you're going to see people that don't have diabetes use this as a sensor 365 days a year.\nI said, if they're using it a couple times a year, there's still a benefit and we'll be generating data on this over time. I think it's going to be important to generate data even if it's not to communicate to payers to get reimbursement. Even if it's to communicate to the physicians, the primary care, and the direct consumers that there's a value here of doing that. I think the key thing here is personalization and how do you personalize information and the data and the coaching?\nThe strategy here is, yeah, you're going to have to use TV to be able to communicate, but I don't think, given our experience here, that you can just go on TV and blast TV advertising and you'll get this big uptake, and you're going to have to do some on-the-ground kind of guerrilla marketing, let's call it like that, together with TV advertising, to really be able to open up the market and then sustain it, sustain its use.\nThat's how we're thinking about it, and that's why we have a separate team, completely removed from the Libre and the diabetes team, that they're focusing on how to execute this strategy. I think it's more of a kind of S-curve growth versus kind of an out of the gate. I know that everybody's focused on what the sales are in the second half and whether it's me or the competitor. I think the bigger picture here is like, hey, there's a really big opportunity here, and if we do it right, it's an opportunity that will be more than a flash in the pan. It'll sustain itself, and it could become standard.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat color. One more for me, Aveir and the leadless pacing, particularly the dual chamber now with coverage, I think, is an underappreciated opportunity. Maybe if you don't mind, spend a minute there. How you see this market evolving and what's the early feedback on the launch so far? Thanks.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nUltimately, I think this whole leadless is going to change the growth trajectory of our CRM business. If you look at CRM, it grew 7% last year. It's grown 7% the first half of this year. As previously a flat business. We've been doing that, you know, I would say with good success on dual, but I wouldn't say that it's, at full cycle yet. Because one of the things that we're working on is ensuring that, you know, we're doing the training and we're getting physicians comfortable with the procedure. It's a completely different procedure versus what, the entire industry has been accustomed to.\nWe're using mapping, we're going into the groin vs doing pockets above the chest. It is a little different and we're focusing on that. That being said, we've been able to accelerate the growth rate just with a single chamber. I think right now, after two years, we probably capture about 50 share. But to your point, the bigger opportunities in dual and the procedures are going great. And once physicians get several under their experience with several of them, they're talking about, okay, how do we accelerate this?\nAn opportunity to drive more patients into it. We want to make sure we've got a pretty large base of well-trained and great-outcomes physicians across the United States.\nListen, this is a $3 billion global segment, and there really hasn't been much innovation in it. Here you have something that's truly unique and differentiated. I'd say once we feel that we've gotten to a point where we feel good about the capabilities, the training, and the amount of physician coverage that exists, this is definitely a product that I can see going a little bit more mainstream, having more direct consumer communications.\nBecause of the value proposition it affords them. I think this is a great opportunity for us. It might be underappreciated.\nWith the market, but it is definitely appreciated amongst me, the device team, and the CRM team, and we're working hard to get to that point where we can really let it go strong.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for taking the questions, Robert. I wanted to just start asking about just kind of this multi-year trajectory for Abbott. You've been delivering top-tier organic revenue growth performances over the last two years and potentially have a two-year double-digit stack comp year. I think the team has been publicly stating that potentially the business could outpace pre-pandemic levels, which in that 7% to 8% range. I think during this call you've put forward a lot that supports that type of trajectory. But maybe just to reiterate your confidence level there, and is this kind of outpacing of pre-pandemic levels over the medium term dependent on M&A, or is this the core business with internal development programs that's really going to drive this top-tier growth out over the next couple of years?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nIs that the attempt to get to the 2025 kind of question?\nI'd say. Listen, we've been saying that we made investments during COVID to accelerate the company, make it stronger, build our portfolio so we could accelerate the growth. If you look at the last six quarters, we've been delivering top tier.\nHigh single-digit, double-digit growth. And this is on a company that's doing $40+ billion of revenue. So I think that's pretty impressive. If you look at our MedTech portfolio, it was the fastest growing MedTech portfolio last year, fastest growing in the first quarter of this year. We'll see what happens this second quarter. We positioned the company to be able to deliver this. Do I think that we can continue to deliver this top-tier performance.\nThroughout this year and into next year? Yeah, I absolutely do. Because of what we built and then just the evidence and the proof points that we've been able to reliably and sustainably deliver that. We feel good about our ability. The markets that we're participating in are attractive. So there are markets that we lead, and when those markets grow, like our leadership benefits. There are markets that are attractive that we're entering, and there's plenty of opportunity for market share gain.\nThere are markets that are attractive that we're building, and there's no real clinical opportunity, or there's a clinical opportunity for our products that we're developing to come in there. So as we build those markets, that, they become attractive, and our position gets solidified, and I think that framework applies to all of all four of our business units have opportunities across those three frameworks. On the M&A front, yeah, if we're able to find an asset that makes sense strategically to us, makes sense financially, that could add even further to that growth, and we've got the balance sheet to be able to do that.\nIt's not dependent, as I told you, it's really focused on the organic side to be able to deliver this top-tier growth.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nUnderstood, and thanks for that answer. Another kind of high level question you probably receive regularly, but just wanted: it's our understanding as well that your team, the board, every year, at least once a year, maybe multiple times a year, is just considering the strategic fit of the four major business units for Abbott. Maybe just to get an update on your thoughts on the business combinations and the potential for spins down the line. Thanks a lot.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. I don't think there's like this one moment in the year that we do it. We're doing it on an ongoing basis. The company has a history of ensuring that the portfolio that is assembled is not only delivering value to patients, governments, and health care systems, but it's also delivering value to our shareholders. We historically haven't shied away from asking ourselves questions and answering those questions. If there's an opportunity to create value through addition or through subtraction, then the company has shown that it's ready to do that.\nI think the two fundamental questions about that is, is there an opportunity to create value for shareholders, and is there somebody that could do better with our businesses?\nRight now you look at what we're doing with our businesses; we're performing at the highest level across all of the four segments. We'll see what happens during this earnings season here. But I feel very good about the team and what they're doing. Obviously there are areas that we could always do better, and we focus on that. At the highest level, all four of our sectors have been delivering outstanding growth, market-leading growth, and quite frankly innovating and fulfilling our purpose and our mission, which is to help people live healthier lives. I like the diversity.\nThe diversity provides both defense and offense capabilities, and as long as you're managing them within each one of their segments, allocating capital that is proportionate to their growth and their industry, and we spend a lot of time managing all four segments, then I think we're doing a good job at running them.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you and good morning, everybody. I was hoping to ask one question on the P&L side and one on the capital allocation side. Maybe I'll start with the P&L here. Kind of look at the guidance here for the back half of the year. Our math implies it's something like 100 basis points plus of year-over-year operating margin expansion and about 9% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. Can you maybe talk through some of the drivers that underpin that margin expansion on a year-over-year basis? Obviously we, obviously we saw a turn here in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1, but maybe walk us through some of the drivers that get to that improved margin and earnings growth performance.\nIn the back half of the year. Sure, I'll let Phil take that.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nYeah.\nGood morning, David. You know, Robert touched on opening comments here on some of that expansion already this year. We're in a pretty unique position relative to some of our peers in terms of our op margin profile that we're already back to pre-pandemic levels, and we did that strategically through managing spend through the ups and downs of COVID testing. As we talked earlier this year, Q1 was really the last big comp on sort of COVID testing impacts on sales and profiles with respect to margin expansion and gross margin in particular.\nThe guidance for the year is around 75 basis points as you highlight some progress here and more to go. The trajectory is there. We're focused on the things that we can control and execute on. In particular, some of this great portfolio contribution from our sales top-line performance, particularly in accretive businesses, is a contributor here, and one that we anticipate will continue to expand here throughout the year. We have dedicated teams in each one of our businesses focused solely on gross margin improvement, productivity yield improvements, cost reductions, and innovation that brings accretion to the portfolio.\nAll of those elements are contributors here, quarter in and quarter out, and continue to contribute through the rest of the year. Then we also have elements we've talked about, some of the cycles that we go through, be it in commodities markets and the like, some of the inflation the last few years that are starting to sort of stabilize and normalize. We're seeing freight and distribution profiles normalize and start to be more tailwinds as opposed to headwinds. We've also seen in commodity markets as well things not only stabilizing but coming down, and also contributing to tailwinds to gross margin, and anticipate that to persist here as well.\nThe combination of all of those contribute to the confidence here and continuing to drive the top tier sales performance but also expand margins throughout the year.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSuper helpful, thank you. Then maybe just on the capital allocation side, maybe thinking about the other side of Josh's question, if you look across the sector here, we've seen M&A pick up a little bit in the second quarter. I think there were $2 billion plus transactions announced with sort of transaction multiple starting to trend toward the lower end of historical levels. But could you maybe give us your latest perspective on the M&A environment and how you're thinking about capital allocation as your cash balance continues to build nicely here?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, on the capital allocation more broadly, listen, I've been pretty clear every call about we have a balanced approach, right? I know you guys cover a lot of companies that have different approaches. Our approach is balanced, and we believe that that balanced approach benefits the long-term shareholder.\nOne of the metrics that I believe, David, is a good measure of evaluating capital deployment effectiveness is ROIC. If you look at ROIC over the last three years.\nWe've averaged around high teens, and that's on the higher end of kind of the medtech peers that we often get compared to. We believe that ROIC is a good measure of how effectively we're deploying the capital, and we look at a balanced approach. Right. So are there internal capital investments that drive future growth? We've been talking about all these great opportunities we have, and we're funding them, and they're great returns. Debt pay down, we don't have much this year, but we took care of some towers last year because we obviously didn't want to refinance them.\nDividend and buybacks are. The dividend is definitely core to our investment identity. We intend to continue to grow our dividend. So that is a balanced approach.\nEven with all of that, we also, as you probably see, we have opportunity from a balance sheet perspective to deploy that from an M&A perspective. We've been spending time talking about our strong top line and the pipeline that we've developed, and that allows us to be a little bit more selective. You look at other transactions that happened, and you have to ask, okay, what's the strategy behind that? A lot of the times you can see you're having to sustain your growth rate. If you're in the business of driving top line through acquisitions, then you got to, that's part of your model.\nYou, you're going to have to keep doing that whether the valuations are right or wrong or not right. But we look at these strategic fit, can they generate an attractive return?\nCan we make the business better that we're acquiring? We don't want to be just a holding. I think that we've shown that when we do directly our acquisitions, that's the framework, fits in strategically, generates a nice return and we tend to operate them or add value to them than when they were standalone.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAppreciate all the perspective and thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter here. Robert, one of the things that struck me when we spoke, I have two product questions, product specific questions when we last spoke is how you're looking at the sustainability of historically slower growing businesses and areas exposed to historically slower growing markets. Obviously I'm thinking CRM.\nCan you talk a little bit about the strategy there? Obviously there is a big part of that and just lead spacing in general and how sustainable, I mean it's like been multiple quarters now of organic growth in the mid plus single digit range. Then just one follow up, another product question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, well that was part of our strategy as we looked at our MedTech portfolio. You've obviously got high growth drivers there with EP, structural heart, diabetes, cancer care, neuro, heart failure. We looked at CRM and vascular, and those are more flat businesses. So the combination of that is you had a MedTech portfolio that was growing 7%, 8%, maybe 9% a quarter. To get to double-digits we needed those two businesses to get at least to mid single-digits. Right. I'd say on the CRM side, our strategy there is to really focus on Aveir leadless pacemaking. Leadless pacemakers.\nThere's a pipeline of products there. I don't want to tip my hand here, but we do Aveir dual chamber and stop there.\nThe teams have gotten R&D programs to continue to advance those and even to look at the ICD market also. What are the opportunities that we can do to innovate? There is space to innovate in that market, and that, for me, is important: the diabetes market. Fifteen years ago, people would say, well, gee, that's a slow growth market. Well, now look at it. If you focus on the innovation, on meeting needs, unmet needs, you can turn a market around from a business perspective. As I said in my comments, we've been repositioning the portfolio to more higher growth areas, peripheral areas, endovascular areas, but we started that a little bit later than what we did in CRM.\nI expect to start to see our vascular business start to also contribute to a higher growth rate the same way that CRM is. That just kind of bolsters our entire medtech portfolio and gets us into that 12%, 13% kind of growth rate. At least that's our target.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Then the follow-up question is on the structural heart side of things. I know Amulet's been on the market for a little bit here, but my impression is that now it's kind of like Abbott's no longer fighting with one hand tied behind their back. Can you talk a little bit about that? Your 45% growth, I think you said in the quarter, where to from here for Amulet. Thanks so much for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYes, it was a great quarter. I think the team's kind of hitting its stride right now. As I said, our focus here was really to kind of drive adoption in the centers that we were at versus expansion. The competitor has expanded the market. There's probably about 800 centers that are doing these implants and we're probably in about half of it now. That's good, right? That provides a market expansion dynamic here in the US.\nI think, I mean I'm really encouraged by some of the data that I'm seeing. I think it starts with the data, right? We had patient registry data come out where it showed that 95% closure rates were achieved post implant and sustained after 45 days. 90% of closure success rate using Amulet.\nFor patients that actually fail to achieve proper closure rate with a competitive product. So I think that there's an opportunity here for our value proposition, and then we've got to continue to invest. You know, we are already investing on our, you know, next generation Amulet, you know, focusing on ease of use, focusing, and we'll maintain our superiority here that we believe we have regarding the sealing of the LAA. We're investing in clinical trials. Obviously we've been public about Catalyst, which is a trial that will compare Amulet to NOAC.\nAntiarrhythmia treatment. So this is an exciting market for us and we're going to continue to invest in it. And ultimately it comes down to really looking at surrounding the electrophysiologist with the most comprehensive portfolio, whether it's on pacemakers and ICDs, structural heart interventions with, stroke preventions, and then obviously, you know, ablations and AF treatment. At its highest level, you know, that's the important side here is Amulet fits an important role. Even though we reported a structural heart, it's really playing a role here to surround the physician, the EP with the tools that they need to advance care.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Comilla\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nOperator. We'll take one more question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nHi Robert, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice sprint here. I want to touch on biosimilars. You know, you brought this up on the call.\nCan you elaborate on your strategy there? Are you planning to manufacture these products? Is Abbott going to be a CDMO in that space or do you plan to launch your own biosimilars? Or is this more of Abbott being a distributor in taking advantage of your brand presence in emerging markets? What is Abbott's role in that place and how do you size that market opportunity for Abbott? When should that start contributing to Abbott?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. This is one where I'd say there's a couple phases to the strategy.\nThe core premise of this BJ is if you look at the emerging markets and the disease prevalence that exists in these emerging markets, they're no different than the disease prevalence in the US or Europe. I mean, you could look at some of them are higher, et cetera. In general, there's an opportunity to bring these biologics into the emerging markets. For a variety of reasons, those markets have not been a priority for the originators. Their main focus has obviously been.\nIn the international developed markets, US, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, et cetera. This provides just a patient need opportunity that we want to size up. What we've seen we have done some more regional biosimilar deals that we've launched. What we've seen is that the growth of the molecule grows significantly.\nOnce a biosimilar enters in terms of penetration into a patient population. It's a different dynamic in developed markets, as we know, but in emerging markets, the category really expands. What we wanted to do is to say, okay, before we start to think about manufacturing, before we start to think about that, we want to be able to understand.\nWhat is the uptake of these products once you go ahead and?\nPutting a concerted effort to developing these types of products in emerging markets. It fits right into our wheelhouse where we've got relationships with governments, we have relationships with physicians, and we've got relationships with the distribution area. The question is, how can you do it, and how can you execute that strategy, with that's capital efficient, and doesn't erode kind of gross margin of that business? I give a lot of kudos to the team because they've really been able to position our presence in these markets.\nAs an advantage to these players that really aren't focusing on emerging markets. They're focusing more on the opportunity that exists in developed markets. Now they can partner with one single company, reputable company, to be able to use that capacity in other markets. I'd say we're in the phase right now of okay, is there sustainability to this? The deals that we've done give us access. Our gross margin is not dilutive, and we're going to see how it goes. As you think about the ramp up of what we've got in the pipeline, we'll start launching in 2025. But you look at some of the big molecules that will come up.\nFor us, 2026, 2027, that's, I think, when some of these very large oncology opportunities that we have will play a huge role for us and accelerate the growth.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI",
    "content2": "There. That's helpful. Maybe one last one on capital deployment. I know it's been asked. I'm curious on share repurchases, you know. You guys have done phenomenal growth. Street doesn't seem to be giving credit. Why not? Didn't see any share repurchase in first half. Why is Abbott being conservative on share repurchases?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYes, well, we've done a lot of share repurchases over the last couple of years, let's say, catching up a little bit to maybe not doing as much repurchasing after the two, the two acquisitions we did in 2017 and 2018.\nIf you look at our repurchases and dividends, it's been about $20 billion that we've returned over the last four years. $20 billion in dividends and buybacks, and that accounts for a good amount of our free cash flow over the last couple of years to our shareholders. So we're not. The year's not over.\nAgain we'll see opportunities. We've got plenty of opportunities to be able to do that. I'd say I think we've done a pretty good job here at returning cash.\nBack to our shareholders over the last couple of years and that commitment will maintain. So I'll just close here. This was a great quarter for us and quite frankly a great quarter in connection with five quarters before that where we delivered above-market growth. I'm really pleased with our continued strong performance. We've raised our sales outlook, our EPS ranges for the second time this year. The toughest COVID test comps are now behind us. I look forward to not having to. We'll obviously report our COVID testing sales, but you'll still start to see those comps start to dwindle away now, which means then that our EPS is back to growth.\nI think one of the questions there about showing our EPS exiting the year in high single digits, double-digit kind of range, and getting back to our formula; that's what we're interested in, and we've got a lot of positive momentum here heading into the second half of the year. With that, we'll wrap up and thank you for joining us.\n\nMike Comilla\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's Conference Call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott's investor relations website at AbbottInvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect everyone. Have a wonderful day,"

Welcome to Abbott's Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. During the question-and-answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star one one keys on your touch-tone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott.\nWith the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Funk, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, which was above analysts' consensus estimates. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance ranges for both earnings per share and sales growth. We now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to 4.70, and organic sales growth excluded COVID testing-related sales of 8.5% to 10%. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, was 10.8% in the quarter, which represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\nThe strong start to the year was driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio, including growth of 14% in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals. In addition to exceeding expectations of both top and bottom lines this quarter, we accomplished a number of objectives across the pipeline, including obtaining several new product approvals and achieving important clinical trial-related milestones.\nI'll now summarize our Q1 results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in pediatric nutrition, driven by continued market share gains in the US infant formula business and growth across our international portfolio of infant formula, toddler, and adult nutrition brands. In January, we launched a new nutrition shake called Protality, which provides nutritional support for adults pursuing weight loss.\nAs people eat less and lose weight from taking GLP-1 medications, undergoing a weight loss surgery, or following a calorie-restricted diet, a portion of what is lost is lean muscle mass, which plays an important role in overall health. The combination of high protein and essential vitamins and minerals that Protality offers can help people preserve muscle while pursuing their personal weight loss goals. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. This quarter was a continuation of EPD's impressive trend of strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of the last five quarters.\nIn addition to a strong track record of top-line growth, this business has delivered equally impressive gains on the bottom line, with an operating margin profile last year that reflected more than 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2019. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased more than 5%, excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in diagnostics continues to be led by the adoption of our market-leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies, and blood screening facilities.\nOur development efforts in diagnostics focus on developing new systems and creating new tests that play an important role in making healthcare decisions, expand the accessibility of testing, and deliver a result as fast as possible. In April, we received FDA approval for a point-of-care diagnostic test that can help determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes. The test is run on our portable i-STAT Alinity instrument, which allows concussion testing to move beyond the traditional hospital setting and into urgent care centers, physician offices, and other locations that are closer to the patient.\nWith nearly five million people in the US going to the emergency room to be checked for suspected concussion each year, we believe this test has the potential to transform the standard of care for concussion testing. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14%. In diabetes care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. As I previously mentioned, Libre has several new growth opportunities that will help continue to fuel the strong sales trajectory we have forecasted.\nOne of those growth opportunities relates to the continued expansion of reimbursement coverage for Libre for individuals who use basal insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Last year, we announced that Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France to include all people who use basal insulin as part of their diabetes management. During Q1, Libre obtained reimbursement from a select number of institutional payers in Germany for basal insulin users who also use oral diabetes medication to manage their condition.\nThese select public and private payers cover a limited number of the approximately one million basal insulin users in Germany, but this is an encouraging sign of the potential for further coverage expansion not only in Germany but across other European markets. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10.5% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart, and continued acceleration in our cardiac rhythm management and vascular portfolios.\nIn electrophysiology, sales grew 18%, driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions and across all major product categories, including double-digit growth in ablation catheters and cardiac mapping-related products. We continue to make great progress toward bringing our innovative PFA catheter, Volt, to market. In March, we completed enrollment in our CE marked clinical study, putting us on track to file for international approval before the end of the year.\nWe also recently began enrolling patients in our US clinical trial called Volt PFA, which will generate the data needed to support an FDA approval filing. In structural heart, growth of 13% was led by strong performance in several high-growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, mitral, and tricuspid repair. Structural heart is an area that we have invested in over the past years in order to create a diversified portfolio that can sustainably deliver double-digit growth.\nIn the past, we relied almost exclusively on MitraClip to drive the growth, but today, the portfolio and growth are more balanced and reflect increasing contributions from newer products like Navitor, Amulet, and TriClip. In April, we received FDA approval for TriClip, a first-of-its-kind heart valve repair device designed for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation or a leaky tricuspid valve.\nData from the clinical trial supporting this approval demonstrated that patients who received TriClip experienced a significant improvement in the severity of their symptoms and quality of life. We're excited to now offer this life-changing treatment option to people in the United States that suffer from this condition. In rhythm management, growth of 7.5% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. Aveir has rapidly captured market share in the single-chamber pacing segment of the market and is now being used for dual-chamber pacing, which is the largest segment of the pacing market.\nThis revolutionary technology is helping to deliver growth rates in our rhythm management business that significantly exceed the overall growth in this market. Lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 17%, driven by Eterna, a rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. In January, we announced the launch of Liberta, the world's smallest rechargeable deep brain stimulation device, which is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. So in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom lines.\nAnd as a result, we raised the midpoint of our sales and EPS guidance ranges. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives, and we're seeing strong returns from the investments we're making across our growth platforms. Our pipeline has continued to be highly productive, delivering several recently new product approvals, and we're very well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I'll turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our Q1 results, sales increased 4.7% on an organic basis, which, as expected, includes the impact of year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.9% on Q1 sales.\nDuring the quarter, we saw the US dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in exchange having a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.7% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 29.4% of sales in Q1. Lastly, our Q1 adjusted tax rate was 15%.\nTurning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to 4.70, which represents an increase at the midpoint of the range compared to the guidance range we provided in January. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8.5% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2.5% on full-year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on second-quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the Q2, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 to 1.12. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising you that your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. Again, that's star one one to ask a question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice Q1 here. Two for me. I'll just ask them both upfront. First, Robert, we almost never see Abbott raise guidance, particularly on the top line in Q1. Looking back over the past, I don't know, five, 10 years, it's very rare. So first part is, what gave you the confidence to raise the midpoint of the guidance this early on in the year?\nThen second, obviously, there's been a lot of concern during the quarter with competitors' loss in a case for NEC as it relates to infant nutrition. I was hoping you could address that. What's your stance on the ongoing litigation? I think there's about 1,000 cases that have been filed. Any upcoming data points or timelines we should be looking for? Thanks a lot.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure, Robbie. So let's go first to your question on the guidance. Yeah, you're right. I guess I had to go back and take a look at that. I think the last time we did raise in Q1 was in 2016. I'd say the framework here, Robbie, as we've always done, is we set a guidance at the beginning of the year, which we believe is top-tier. Then throughout the year, we want to beat that guidance, right?\nWe consider top-tier to be high single-digit, double-digit EPS growth. That's obviously excluding the COVID testing portion, which is what investors are really more focused on. So that was the guidance that we set a couple of months ago back in January. We'll target always have that top-tier guidance and find the appropriate balance between the opportunities and obviously the challenges that bracket that range.\nIf you remember, in January, I said I thought that there was more opportunities than risks. I think that some of the risks that we saw in January, I still think they haven't gone away. They're still there, whether it's geopolitics or whether it's FX, those are still there. Clearly, the performance of the business continues to be very, very strong. In some of our businesses, a lot of our businesses are actually accelerating in performance. So as I said in my comments, five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here.\nSo you look at each of the businesses: EPD, three consecutive years of double-digit growth, great margin expansion. The teams are now working to be able to introduce biosimilars in all the markets that we're participating in. Nutrition has done an incredible job at recovering share and growing our adult business.\nWe've grown a lot over $1 billion versus 2019. Diagnostics continues to have a great track record here of outperforming the market. We've got some great large account wins both in the US and internationally that we're rolling out into this year. Medical devices, I mean, what can I tell you? It's just been a real strong performer. The teams have done an incredible job there.\nLast year, we were the fastest-growing med tech company, at least from what I've seen from our guidance and from the other guidances in the market. That's what it seems to be again this year. So you put all that together, plus the pipeline that's been contributing to an accelerated level, great new product approvals. I put all that together, and I just feel that this type of performance that we deliver just gives us the confidence for the remainder of the outlook of the year. So we felt comfortable raising the guidance again in Q1, which is, as you pointed out, something that we don't usually do.\nI continue to believe going into Q2, as we move through, that there's probably more opportunities than risks here as we move forward. So I guess that's the framework of raising our guidance in Q1, which is something that we usually don't do. Just great performance and great momentum. Then your other question was regarding the net cases. I'd say from a date, yeah, we have some court cases that will happen in July. So that's maybe a milestone that we want to look at.\nBut if you were asking me about kind of our framework of how we look at this, I'd say for decades, we've provided specialized nutrition products that help doctors. I think that's a key thing here. It helps doctors provide the lifesaving nutrition to the premature infants. How you feed a premature infant, it's a medical decision, Robbie. Healthcare providers, they're going to use a range of options to meet the unique needs of each baby.\nThat includes mother's milk. That includes pasteurized donor's milk. That also includes pre-term infant formula. Because where mother's milk is not available, there is not a sufficient supply of donor milk to satisfy the nutritional needs of all of these premature infants that are born in the US. Quite frankly, even when they're available for some premature infants, human milk may lack some of the calories, the proteins, the vitamins, etc., that are necessary to support the nutritional needs of the premature infants. That mother's milk needs to be fortified in order to boost the nutritional output.\nThe medical community considers these products to be a critical part of the standard of care for feeding premature infants. Most of the societies, when you read their positions, consider it a standard of care to use these products. The doctors who work in the NICUs have used our products for decades, and they continue to do so today. Countless babies, Robbie, have benefited from these products, life-saving experiences over many, many years. There are clinical studies that have repeatedly established that these products are safe.\nSo these litigation cases, they're really seeking to advance a theory promoted by plaintiff lawyers that distorts the science and it distorts everything that we know. It's not supported by the medical community. So we're preparing for our cases to be able to kind of lay out the facts, the science, and the data. We stand behind our products.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAppreciate it, Robert. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Managing Director and Medical-Device and Healthcare Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. I'll echo Robbie's congratulations on the strong start to the year here. So Robert, I just wanted to focus on EP. So multi-part question here, but just one. So the EP business grew nicely in the Q1 in the US and outside the US. Can you talk about what drove that, what you're seeing with PFA and the different geographies, your expectations for your EP business going forward before the Vault launch? Just lastly, so it sounds like we should expect Vault approval in Europe sometime next year based on the filing date. Just want to confirm that. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Yeah. Like I said in my opening comments, we completed the trial. There's a six-month follow-up, Larry. So that means that we will be on target here to file for CE mark by the end of this year. Then it's just going to depend on that process. So I think that's probably our anchor point here is getting the filing in before the end of the year. Yeah. I mean, I'm not surprised by our EP growth.\nI know many on the call might be, but I'm not surprised. First of all, it's an important therapy. It's an under-penetrated disease. So we know there's plenty of growth in this segment. As a result of that, it's highly competitive, right? But we haven't been surprised by the growth. If you look at PFA, it's been in Europe for three years.\nIf you average our growth rate over the last three years in Europe, we've been growing mid-teens. The growth remains broad-based. It was broad-based in Europe again this quarter where we saw double-digit growth in ablation catheters. So not just on the mapping side, on the ablation catheter side also, but then also great growth on the mapping side. Yeah, this technology has now come to the US.\nI think we probably had maybe two months of seeing the technology be rolled out here in the US. I think the competitors have been very aggressive here in terms of bringing the technology to the accounts in the US. I can say we've mapped a lot of those cases, Larry. I'm not going to say we've been in every single case, but I'd say a vast majority of the cases we've been in there.\nThere are some similarities to Europe, but there are some differences to Europe. I think one of the things that we saw in Europe was that there was this inclination to use the technology starting off as kind of a one-shot. That had an impact more on the cryo business than I would say on the RF side. That's what we saw in our mapping cases. We saw here, at least in the first couple of months, that's where a large portion of those cases occurred. At least the ones that we mapped were in places where they were traditionally using cryo.\nI think the difference that we saw a little bit in Europe is that at least 90% of the cases that we were part of, directly or indirectly, were using mapping. That number was lower in Europe. So that's probably a little bit of the difference I saw here in the US. That bodes well for us, right? Our EnSite system, our mapping system, our mapping catheters are widely viewed as an excellent option here for mapping these PFA cases. We have a large installed base. Customers are familiar with it. Don't need to make room. Don't need to fight for capital. We've got best-in-class clinical support. The architecture here is open, as I've said in previous calls.\nSo it integrates well with these PFA catheters. We actually recently released a software upgrade last month that provides even better visualization to these catheters and potential for faster procedures and less fluoro time. So I think this is a perfect combination, quite frankly, in a time where there's going to be a market transition. There's a lot of new products. There's a lot of choices.\nWhen you have a situation like that, I think flexibility is key. That's what we heard from our customers. One data point that I thought was also interesting to your question of what helped drive that. In the cases that we were part of and we saw, we also observed that an RF catheter was pulled in about a quarter of the cases that we saw. So on top of the PFA catheter, an RF catheter was pulled to do touch-ups, etc. So I'd say right now, everything that we've seen in Europe on the positive side is happening. Then I think there's some interesting dynamics here in the US that could be favorable for us also. It's still very early.\nIf I look at March, we had probably one of our most, when we look at cases per day, that was probably one of our highest months. So so far, so good. We're excited about the technology. We're excited about our program. We released data on our program in some recent medical meetings that occurred. The feedback from those that have been using our product are very positive. The integration with EnSite, including the tissue contact force algorithm and the visualization, all of that is seen as a real promise and a differentiator versus what's being used today, so.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Managing Director and Medical-Device and Healthcare Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cowen\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Great to see the strong start here. A few more results. Robert, I was hoping to just ask first on Libre. Just internationally, any other payment or coverage decisions that we should have on our radar in various countries? Sounds like you've made some nice progress already in Germany. Then in the US, I was hoping you could just help or share your thoughts on the share gain opportunity in the integrated pump segment of the CGM market versus the share loss risk in the type 2 non-insulin cash pay segment with a competitive launch here early in 2024. I just have one follow-up.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. On your international question, I mean, it's always difficult to forecast exactly by month or quarter coverage kind of payment decisions. I can tell you, though, that the team has a full global map of all the work that's being done regarding clinical information and negotiations, etc. So it's difficult to kind of forecast it. What I have said is on previous calls and in some of my prepared remarks that I think you're going to see this just this build that will be occurring globally in the market as the data proves and shows the clinical, medical, and health economic benefit by reimbursing for this patient population.\nI think we're well positioned there. Internationally, I think we got some pretty large markets already: Canada, Japan, France, Italy, Germany. Those are markets that are either fully reimbursed or starting their process. Like I said, I think you'll see as the year progresses, whether it's in medical events or just as the year progresses, I think you'll see more coverage decisions. Maybe they don't get splashy big PR news, but we are seeing continuous increasing there on that. On the US side, I guess I disagree with your premise that I'm going to be trading share gains on the pump side for share losses on the non-insulin side.\nI mean, right now, I'm looking at the data, third-party audited data, seven out of every 10 new prescriptions for this basal population, which is primarily served by the primary care channel. Seven out of 10 are going to Libre. I think our product's going to get even more competitive and compelling. So I think this is a great opportunity.\nOur objective here is to maintain kind of our shared dominance and our shared leadership as it results in this patient segment. We do have an opportunity here to participate a little bit more actively in what is a little bit more of a smaller segment of the population, but nonetheless a very important one, which is the AID and the market system. So there's 150 to 200 thousand new starts a year.\nThere's an opportunity for shared gain also of existing users. I think that the opportunity to bring a dual analyte sensor with ketones. We showed some data at ATTD this year that showed the safety benefit or the value proposition of a dual analyte sensor for AID system. So I think that's going to be a compelling value proposition. Then we're working with all the pump companies here.\nI think as the year progresses, we'll see connectivity occur, whether it's with Libre 2 Plus, our streaming product, or whether it's with Libre 3. So this is an area that we're focusing on. It's a new segment for us to compete in. I don't think that we're going to be taking our eye off the ball as it relates to the basal opportunity that exists, so.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cowen\n\nUnderstood. Thanks. I just wanted to ask on the transcatheter tricuspid market. Congratulations on the TriClip approval. There's been some questions around the patient opportunity breakdown between TEER, TriClip, and replacement with Evoque. Maybe just any internal team thoughts on that patient opportunity breakdown. Then anything you could share on the pricing strategy for TriClip in the setting of competitor pricing. It's a replacement device at a significant premium. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, I'm not going to comment on our pricing strategy here just for competitive reasons. It is a differentiated and novel technology. So there is an opportunity. We'll have to see how this all plays out. You've got 510(k) submissions and all this stuff going on right now. What we're focused on here is launching a product and getting cases ramped up.\nThat's what's happening. I got some feedback yesterday from the team after a couple of weeks. Real nice cadence of growth. We're obviously focusing our initial cases on most of the accounts that were part of our pivotal trial. Just real nice cadence growth there and great feedback from physicians and patients post-surgery. I mean, if you're trying to poke at what's the breakdown going to be about replace and repairless, I think it's good to have options.\nI guess my view here is that I believe that probably safety is a key driver here to start off with. I think TriClip has shown a very strong, excellent safety record, both in clinical trials and real-world use. So I think that's going to play a key role here in determining repair versus replace. I expect repair or TriClip at least to be the preferred option unless the valves are too damaged.\nThen obviously, replacement is the only remaining option. There's a large pool of patients here. You've got 5 million people globally, two million people here in the US. It's going to be an opportunity here that we'll be generating more data, expand the indication of the product. So I think this is easily a billion-dollar opportunity for us here as we build the capabilities and as we build more clinical data.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cowen\n\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nHey, congrats on the good quarter. Maybe just while we're on the pipeline, talk a little bit about Aveir. It sounds like that product's going really well. Then I had a question on gross margins as well. Trying to think about, is this the right pace to kind of get back to pre-COVID levels? Is that still the opportunity longer term for gross margins?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, I think Aveir has done very well. I mean, we all know the advantages it has over the competitive system, whether it's single and dual chamber, the longer-lasting battery, the ability for replacement, retrievability, and upgradability. So I think it's done very well. From a single chamber perspective, I think we're now at about 50 share of the US market.\nSo that's been doing very well. We started doing our dual chamber procedures towards the end of last year and seeing a nice kind of ramp-up over this Q1 here. Focus here really is really about it's a completely different procedure, right? I mean, if you think about how these devices have been implanted, this is probably the first time in like 30 years that you have a real meaningful change on how this is done.\nSo our focus here is really getting great clinical results, a real thoughtful approach here about opening new centers and training. That's been working very well for us. You could see the impact on our growth rate. I mean, historically, our CRM business has been relatively flat with some platforms going up, some platforms going down. So our goal here with this program was to get our CRM portfolio to at least be a contributor to growth, mid-single digits, 6, 7%. So these last couple of quarters, we've done 7.5%.\nAveir has been doing well. It's going to continue to get better as more and more physicians get trained and we increase the amount of accounts. So I really like the cadence of how we're forecasting this business and the impact that it's going to have on our CRM portfolio. What was your other question?\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nJust on gross margins, kind of thinking about the path back to pre-COVID levels over the long term. Is this the right kind of cadence that you're this year's cadence, the right way to think about that?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that's a good cadence. I think we're forecasting here about 70 basis points of improvement this year. Feel good about that. I've talked about this not being a question of if, just a question of when. So I think that's not a bad cadence. We're going to focus on the things that we can control. The things that we can control are obviously our cost, our cost teams, and the teams that are working on improving gross margin.\nThey're delivering great results here while at the same time maintaining high service levels, not running into back orders, etc. Probably the biggest opportunity we have here, Travis, is just to expand the gross margin through portfolio mix, right?So when you have our medical device businesses growing at mid-teens consistently over the last, whatever, four or five quarters, that has a real strong impact on our gross margin. So a lot of focus on what we can control, our gross margin, the cadence. That's what we're targeting. So it's not really a question of if. It's just a question of when.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. Congrats again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, Robert. I had a two-part question. A lot of questions on pipeline, but I'm curious. When people ask us on sustainability of growth, if you could elaborate on pipeline, what else is there when you look at the future that gives us the confidence of sustaining its premium growth within the med tech industry?\nMy second part was on the financial modeling side. Looks like FX headwinds came in a little bit higher. Prior guidance had assumed $0.20 headwind to EPS from FX. Did that increase? I'm just curious because some questions on why the high end of the guidance was not raised. I suspect FX headwinds increased. Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. As I said, there are certain challenges that still remain with us from January. FX is one of them. I'll let Phil answer that one. On your question on pipeline, listen, I could spend a whole hour on this just going through the pipeline. I guess I would bucket them into three categories. Vijay, I'd say you got your current contributors. FreeStyle Libre and Alinity, they still operate like pipeline projects and products, right? We still got multiple innovations going through them. MitraClip, great familiarity Aveir, Navitor, TriClip, Amulet, Protality or CardioMEMS, I think has got great opportunity in CardioMEMS.\nI mean, these are all products that I would still characterize them as early innings. Yeah, they're established, but they're still early innings and they got a lot of growth rate there. The second group of products I would call probably near-term future contributors. So think about it in the next 12 to 18 months, these products coming to market and starting to kind of generate revenue there. Our Lingo product, I'm very excited about that and bringing that to the US and expanding that globally.\nOur dual analyte sensor, our Volt system, Esprit, which is our drug-eluting bioresorbable stent for below the knee. It'll be the first of its kind. We're developing a whole new Alinity system that will target a segment of the market that we currently don't participate in. There'll be more to come on that. Then just the great opportunity we have with biosimilars into the emerging markets and doing it in a very capital-efficient way and bringing that and leveraging our position there. That's our next 12 to 18-month kind of catalyst there.\nAnd then thinking about beyond 2026, I mean, we're working on a PFA RF catheter. You got leadless, another kind of leadless pacing system that we'll be launching. We have a second-generation Amulet. Excited about entering to the IVL market sometime in 2027. Coronary DCB. We're working on kind of new TAVR systems also that allow us to branch out into other segments. We've got a whole plethora of new analytes in our biowearables market that will start to come out and have different applications in 2026.\nThen on top of that, all the clinical work that we're doing to expand indications, expand market, whether it's in TAVR, whether it's in LAA, whether it's in Mitral. So we've got, I'd say, a real nice cadence here of products and pipeline beyond, I'd say, the next 12, 18 months. We're looking at this 2026, 2027, 2028. I feel really excited about that. There's obviously more that we need to do and add. I think the base here looks really good in terms of the pipeline. Then I think your question on FX, Phil, you want to take that?\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nYeah. So I mentioned at the onset here, Vijay, in Q1, we saw about a 2.9% headwind on sales growth. We kind of at current rates anticipate something similar here in Q2. From a full-year perspective, at the current rates, it's about a 2.5% headwind on the top line. That said, kind of the earnings guide that we have here is in line with the organic sales performance and drop through to earnings on the increased midpoint on the EPS guide.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning. May I add my compliments and congratulations to the quarter? I have two questions, put them right up front. The first one is on the concussion testing. I'd love to understand the go-to-market strategy for that, how you think about the financial benefit, impact, and all that kind of good stuff. I think my second question is a little bit more big picture.\nAs you step back in a post-pandemic environment a couple of years into the CEO seat, how do you think about taking Abbott sort of to the next level? I mean, we all sit here and take a look at an incredibly strong balance sheet. How do you put that cash to work? And are these segments, divisions, ones you want to keep, or how do you think about adding to it? Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. On the point of care, concussion test, I guess I'd summarize the opportunity here in twofold. I think there's a market conversion component to this, Joanne. I mentioned there are 5 million visits to diagnose a concussion. The number one method there to use that is on a CT scan. I think there's an opportunity here to transform that and allow one to get a faster response in that kind of emergency room visit, which is where the i-STAT and the point of care team already have a good position with some of our other blood gas and other assays that we provide to that segment.\nSo I think this will just slide right into that team. Then the value proposition here is going to be, okay, what's the cost of the system? Can we bend that cost curve? I think we've shown a little bit how we think about things, Joanne. If you look at Libre, if you look at Binax, if you look at how we think about pricing our products when it comes to market conversion and the opportunities that we have there. We'll be able to do it at a nice return for our shareholders. So I think that's an important part.\nThe market expansion opportunity that we have, I think, is going to still require some work on the product. Right now, the product's approved whole blood, but it's a venous draw. We're going to be working on a capillary draw. If you can then run this assay, taking a sample from a fingerstick, from a finger prick, then you can look at bringing that technology even closer to where the need for a rapid concussion test would be.\nYou could just look at how many universities exist in this country, how many high schools exist in this country. You can do some multiplications there and say, okay, this is a great market creation, market expansion opportunity. So I think that that's how we're thinking about it commercially, conversion and creation/expansion. There's some more work to be done in terms of the product and the claims and the trials there.\nSo this will be a multi-year kind of program over here where we'll start to see kind of nice growth in that segment. Then your other question was about the portfolio and balance sheet. Do we like the four segments? The answer to that is, yes, we like all the four segments. We feel that it gives us a real unique view into the healthcare system as a whole, starting with nutrition.\nThat's obviously the bedrock of good health. Then things happen and you need to get a diagnosis. We've got a great diagnostic portfolio that we've been expanding on and building on to make sure that we can capitalize on all the different types of modalities and locations where people can get tested. Then once we know, once a physician knows what the problem is, then they got to run through treatment, right?\nWe do that either through our medicines business or through our medical device business. So I think all four segments are super well aligned to the global demographics and trends in healthcare. We like that. There's always opportunities to add. We've shown that if there are areas that we feel that we can bring value in a combination, then as you mentioned, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet and strategic flexibility to do that as long as we feel that we can add value to that asset.\nWe felt like that about CSI. We felt like that about St. Jude. We felt like that about Alere. Those deals, they obviously help kind of reshape the company and accelerate our growth rates. I think that's predicated on us really believing that we can kind of bring value. We're not trying to fill some top line gap or some issues. So ROIC for us matters. Profitability matters. So we've got opportunities and we could be a little bit more selective to be able to add. I like the four segments that we're in. They've been well to shareholders, especially long-term shareholders.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for putting me in. Congrats on the really strong quarter, particularly med devices. So I had one follow-up on the—sorry, you're good. Background. One question on structural heart. Robert, you talked a little bit about the portfolio and the combination of the leading peer device and MitraClip being a little bit more mature in the category of structural heart, but being kind of augmented by some of these new products, like most recently, obviously, TriClip. If you could talk a little bit about sort of the momentum in the portfolio, as well as how much of the build-out of this portfolio is still coming organically or under review kind of strategically, I appreciate it.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, I didn't want my comments on MitraClip to be construed like, \"Oh, that one there is slowing down and we're relying on others to drive the growth.\" I mean, that wasn't the intent. If you look at MitraClip this quarter, it's growing at high single digits. If you look at the last five quarters, that's what it's been doing between high single digits, low double digits. That's good.\nWe always had a view here that this was an attractive area of growth, an attractive area of medical need. We wanted to be a leader here. So yeah, MitraClip, I guess we can call MitraClip the founding father of our structural heart portfolio. I think the team here has done an incredible job at bringing organic innovation into the portfolio.\nSo if you look at our structural heart, I mean, we grew 13% today. MitraClip grew high single digits, but it accounted for 3% of that growth. The other 10% came from all the rest of the portfolio that's being built. So I think that you'll continue to see that. We'll continue to make investments in this business, continue to make investments in the pipeline.\nI'd say right now, most of it is organic, whether it's innovating on LAA, innovating on our TAVR side, and all the clinical trial work that we're doing there. If there's an opportunity organically, I just put that in the same bucket that I think I answered kind of Joanne's question here, if it makes sense, and we can add it, we've got the flexibility to do it.\nBut the whole strategy here was to say, \"Listen, we're going to build a multi-billion-dollar structural heart business that can sustainably grow double digits.\" The way to do that is you can't be a—you can't be a division of only one product. I think the teams over the last four or five years have done a really good job at building that. There's more opportunity. I'd say probably the one that we're looking at and is very exciting for us is mitral replacement.\nWe launched a Tendyne product, which was more a transapical system. Our Cephea system is a transfemoral, transseptal. Feedback that we've seen from early implanters, early first-in-man is that this is a great, great valve. So there's an opportunity there also. So I'd say mostly organic, but got the capacity for inorganic if it makes sense.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThanks so much. Operator, we'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Yes, congrats on a strong start to the year. Robert, we spent a lot of time talking about the durability of growth in the med tech business. So I don't want to get too greedy, but just following up on Joanne's question regarding you guys do have a strong balance sheet.\nAre there any areas, I guess sort of how do you feel about the state of the med tech business today? Do you feel there are growth areas within med tech that maybe Abbott isn't participating in today, that Abbott could or should participate in today? Where are you looking beyond your current markets, if at all? Thanks so much. I'll just leave it to one.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott",
    "content2": "Sure. Yeah, I get the attempt for triangulation here and the multiple different ways. I guess I'll sound a little bit boring here in terms of how I talk about this. I've been public that, yeah, we are interested. We look at areas that we can add value to. I'd say probably the ones that have jumped out more at us in terms of us studying and looking are probably more in the medical device side and on the diagnostic side.\nWe did look at a strategy for biosimilars for a medicines business, and that was a pretty capital-efficient way to do it. So yeah, we're looking. We continue to study. I'm not going to sit here and telegraph exactly, it's this, it's that. I think the key thing here is just we - I mean, look at our med tech business did this quarter. Look what it did previous four quarters. That allows me to be a little bit more selective. Yeah, over the last couple of months, we've seen some fairly large transactions in the med tech space.\nThose seem to be attractive growth areas. I talked about us getting access to some early IVL technology with the CSI acquisition. So that's an important area for us to focus on. I don't feel that with our strong organic growth that we need to go out and not pay attention to other key financial metrics that for us are important, right, in terms of ROICs and others because we've got that strong growth rate in med tech. So you won't get me telegraphing here exactly, Danielle, what specific segments we're looking at. What I can tell you is we have an active team. They study a lot. We look a lot.\nWe follow a lot. If there's a moment that makes sense for us, and those segments continue to be interesting, we've got the balance sheet and the track record to show that we can drive value out of these acquisitions. So I'll just leave it like that. Yes, we've got flexibility. That doesn't mean that we don't pay attention to other key financial kind of returns as we're looking at it.\nI feel that I can do that because we've got such a strong top-line growth and great pipeline and prospects. So with that, I'll leave it like that. I'll just close by saying, listen, we're very pleased with a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of double-digit organic sales growth on the base business. The investments that we've made during all those years of COVID are generating real strong returns.\nThe pipeline continues to be highly productive, as I've outlined. We've got clear visibility to a pipeline all the way out to 2027, 2028. Obtained several new product approvals that are going to help us accelerate our growth in certain areas. Typically, don't raise guidance in the Q1, but given the strong performance, the outlook, and the remainder of the year, we felt comfortable doing that. We're very well positioned to continue to sustainably deliver top-tier results. With that, I'll wrap up and thank all of you for joining us today.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThank you, Operator. Thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott's investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day. Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Q1 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your questions by pressing the star one one keys on your touch-tone phone.\nThis call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question and answer session, the entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us.With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Funk, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024.\nAbbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, which was above analysts' consensus estimates. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance ranges for both earnings per share and sales growth. We now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70, and organic sales growth excluded COVID testing-related sales of 8.5% to 10%. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, was 10.8% in the quarter, which represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\nThe strong start to the year was driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio, including growth of 14% in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals. In addition to exceeding expectations of both top and bottom lines this quarter, we accomplished a number of objectives across the pipeline, including obtaining several new product approvals and achieving important clinical trial-related milestones. I'll now summarize our Q1 results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil.\nI'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in pediatric nutrition, driven by continued market share gains in the US infant formula business and growth across our international portfolio of infant formula, toddler, and adult nutrition brands. In January, we launched a new nutrition shake called Protality, which provides nutritional support for adults pursuing weight loss. As people eat less and lose weight from taking GLP-1 medications, undergoing a weight loss surgery, or following a calorie-restricted diet, a portion of what is lost is lean muscle mass, which plays an important role in overall health.\nThe combination of high protein and essential vitamins and minerals that Protality offers can help people preserve muscle while pursuing their personal weight loss goals. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. This quarter was a continuation of EPD's impressive trend of strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of the last five quarters. In addition to a strong track record of top-line growth, this business has delivered equally impressive gains on the bottom line, with an operating margin profile last year that reflected more than 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2019.\nMoving to diagnostics, where sales increased more than 5%, excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in diagnostics continues to be led by the adoption of our market-leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies, and blood screening facilities.\nOur development efforts in diagnostics focus on developing new systems and creating new tests that play an important role in making healthcare decisions, expand the accessibility of testing, and deliver a result as fast as possible. In April, we received FDA approval for a point-of-care diagnostic test that can help determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes. The test is run on our portable i-STAT Alinity instrument, which allows concussion testing to move beyond the traditional hospital setting and into urgent care centers, physician offices, and other locations that are closer to the patient.\nWith nearly five million people in the US going to the emergency room to be checked for suspected concussion each year, we believe this test has the potential to transform the standard of care for concussion testing. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14%. In diabetes care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. As I previously mentioned, Libre has several new growth opportunities that will help continue to fuel the strong sales trajectory we have forecasted.\nOne of those growth opportunities relates to the continued expansion of reimbursement coverage for Libre for individuals who use basal insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Last year, we announced that Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France to include all people who use basal insulin as part of their diabetes management. During this Q1, Libre obtained reimbursement from a select number of institutional payers in Germany for basal insulin users who also use oral diabetes medication to manage their condition.\nThese select public and private payers cover a limited number of the approximately one million basal insulin users in Germany, but this is an encouraging sign of the potential for further coverage expansion not only in Germany but across other European markets. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10.5% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart, and continued acceleration in our cardiac rhythm management and vascular portfolios.\nIn electrophysiology, sales grew 18%, driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions and across all major product categories, including double-digit growth in ablation catheters and cardiac mapping-related products. We continue to make great progress toward bringing our innovative PFA catheter Volt to market. In March, we completed enrollment in our CE mark clinical study, putting us on track to file for international approval before the end of the year.\nWe also recently began enrolling patients in our US clinical trial called Volt AF, which will generate the data needed to support an FDA approval filing. In structural heart, growth of 13% was led by strong performance in several high-growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, mitral, and tricuspid repair. Structural heart is an area that we have invested in over the past years in order to create a diversified portfolio that can sustainably deliver double-digit growth.\nIn the past, we relied almost exclusively on MitraClip to drive the growth, but today, the portfolio and growth are more balanced and reflect increasing contributions from newer products like Navitor, Amulet, and TriClip. In April, we received FDA approval for TriClip, a first-of-its-kind heart valve repair device designed for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation or a leaky tricuspid valve.\nData from the clinical trial supporting this approval demonstrated that patients who received TriClip experienced a significant improvement in the severity of their symptoms and quality of life. We're excited to now offer this life-changing treatment option to people in the United States that suffer from this condition. In rhythm management, growth of 7.5% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker.\nAveir has rapidly captured market share in the single-chamber pacing segment of the market and is now being used for dual-chamber pacing, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. This revolutionary technology is helping to deliver growth rates in our rhythm management business that significantly exceed the overall growth in this market. Lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 17%, driven by Eterna, a rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.\nIn January, we announced the launch of Liberta, the world's smallest rechargeable deep brain stimulation device, which is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. So in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom lines. As a result, we raised the midpoint of our sales and EPS guidance ranges.\nWe continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives, and we're seeing strong returns from the investments we're making across our growth platforms. Our pipeline has continued to be highly productive, delivering several recently new product approvals, and we're very well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I'll turn over the call to Phil. Thanks, Robert.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our Q1 results, sales increased 4.7% on an organic basis, which, as expected, includes the impact of year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.9% on Q1 sales.\nDuring the quarter, we saw the US dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in exchange having a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.7% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 29.4% of sales in the Q1. Lastly, our Q1 adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share."

Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our 2023 results as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time have positioned the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier, given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range. But then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. While our procedures-driven businesses, such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing, experienced a slowdown due to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world place a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffer during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient. It was also during this time that we created a multi-billion-dollar COVID testing business.\nIn just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world, COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. Given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders.\nBut we knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead. We pulled forward or accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels.\nKnowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. The experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale up and subsequent scale down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company.\nOur R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions. And this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD, for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs, with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announce approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution. And in medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals along with several new opportunities to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio.\nThese new opportunities are well balanced with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year. Sales excluded COVID testing grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11% higher than our original guidance of high single digit growth.\nAdjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range, despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. This is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecast sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business.\nI'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil.\nI'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 14% in the quarter.\nIn pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the US was driven by continued market share capture in the US infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader.\nInternational growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\nTurning to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results.\nMoving to diagnostics growth, rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing. The flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in Q4 compared to that of the prior year, but in core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems. Paired with our broad test menu offering, Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations. The system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the US.\nI'll wrap up with medical devices where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion.\nIn terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe.\nIn rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products including Amplatzer, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis. In heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. Lastly in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19% driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.\nSo in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year. We outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil.\nThanks Robert.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\nTurning to our Q4 results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which, as expected, reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year over year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales.\nRegarding other aspects of the P and L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales and adjusted SGA was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, today we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024. For the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our Q1 reported sales. We forecast non-operating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. And again, that's star 11. To ask a question, please stand by. We compile the Q and A roster.\nOur first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOn a nice end to the year here.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nRobert, you know, pre-COVID Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAs you mentioned, you're guiding to eight.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nTo 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base. What has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high?\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nTo start the year?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nMaybe talk about the key assumptions, and I'll leave it there for my one question. Thank you. Thanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and quite frankly, as we talked about.\nThroughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take.\nSome of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business. I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean we operate in these four business segments.\nTheir underlying attractiveness still is very sustainable. Strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these four segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in. So I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. You look at EPD. As I said in my comments, I mean these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging geography and different markets, and they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line.\nI think even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their op margin profile by 300 basis points.\nSo it's a pretty strong position, strong team. Then we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which historically hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets. It's probably been more of a developed markets play. So I think that's going to provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think, did an incredible job here, as we said at the beginning of last year, at regaining our leadership position here in the US. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product. But even adult, our adult business, our adult business has increased $1 billion since pre-pandemic, and it's just strengthening, getting stronger. It's $4 billion growing high single digits.\nThere's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes, and we're making investments in that channel. Also, Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well. Talked about our Alinity and, and infant formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio, and quite frankly the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute, and our Rapid Diagnostics portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing. And we've been making investments on new assays to be able to put through those instruments. And then medical devices historically was in that high single digit growth.\nI think what's changed there to become now.\nA double digit grower for us on a very large size business is that you have historically double digit growth businesses like HF, EP, Structural Heart, DC. I mean those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices, our CRM and Vascular businesses that were showing very little growth historically, and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4 with CRM. I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology. On Vascular, it's been a combination of adding in organically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio for higher growth segments. So I think that's really.\nIn a nutshell across all these very four attractive segments. We've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting. You saw that last year, every year double-digit growth, and they've gotten stronger, and they've gotten better, and they've gotten more growth opportunities with them. So, I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you. I've gotten some of the headlines here about accelerating sales but not seeing maybe that come through on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. Our core business grew EPS last year, 40-plus%. We're forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth.\nAt the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So I'd say yeah, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics, but we've proven to be pretty resilient there, and I think the range captures the opportunity that we have. On the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range, but it's only January, so I think this is a good starting point. Super helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. Was hoping to just follow up on your comments there, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. I know Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally, but was hoping that just thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business in that 30 to 50 basis point range. So if you could just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in 2024 and into the out years. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here too.\nRecover to their operating margin and try to get back to their margin pre-pandemic.\nIn a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre-pandemic level, and I think what you saw us do there, Josh and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we manage very well strategically the spending piece of it. We accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID. Sales were at their peak levels a few years ago, and then we held that spending flat these last couple of years.\nEven though our top line was growing pretty significantly here, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line. That is, I think about our big five activities this year, the company, and we can do all five of them at the same time. I'd say gross margin is pretty, pretty high up there in our priority. We're forecasting a pretty nice step up in our gross margin profile this year, roughly around 75 basis points. There's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement programs. Every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis, and they all get reported out. There's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs.\nSome of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. Whether it's commodity costs, freight, and distribution, all those elements seem to be, let's say right now and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, turning into tailwind. That helps. The other part here is just, I'd say, portfolio mix. As.\nSome of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher margin businesses, and they provide that mix element in that gross margin expansion. I think this provides a nice, you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year, but I expect over time we'll get back to our pre-pandemic, you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. For me, it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. You know, we could target, you know, 50, 75, you know, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want. That kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. I'd say that's our biggest opportunity.\nI think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. Our big opportunity here is gross margin, and we're all over it.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open. Good morning.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches. I would love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the US EP business as we see some PFA launches this year. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Well, I think we've showed pretty strong, robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual in-market competition.\nIt's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story. US has been strong, China has been very strong for us, US this year, especially in VBP. I mean, there was some price challenges throughout the year with VBP, but the volume we picked up, the market share we pick up more than offset that. It's really been across the board here, and I think it really is about strength of the portfolio. You know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think is at the core.\nGood mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. I think launching TactiFlex, which is the flexible tip combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's outcomes to the patient or.\nTime of procedure, we've seen that consistently around the world. Then on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers. Yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth as we look to.\nMore PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the US. Listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology. I think there are some challenges with some of these first generation products. I do expect there to be uptake and usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first, at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment.\nFrom there, kind of moving past that, you know, right now I think, I guess that's my assumption in the US until I see something differently, that it will follow a similar pattern, and then the question will just be kind of the speed.\nI think the team has done a really good job here on the ground with the technology.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOh, great.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks for taking the question, Robert. Maybe I could ask on Libre, you know, this is the most successful medical device. At the conference just a few weeks ago in San Francisco, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward, and targets.\nYou know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in 2024 and beyond. One question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data. It's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales, or at least prescriptions, are flattening out, yet the sales keep growing. How do we think about the discrepancy there? How big is the Medicare DME business?\nThe growth we're getting there from?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nBasil, thanks a lot.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSure.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nStrong growth in Q4 under $1.5 billion. US was up 32%.\nI'd say still haven't. Team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. You know, being able to put those kind of growth rates in the US without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\nYou know, the growth is going to come from. I've been pretty consistent about this, Robby, I mean there was a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here, but I'd say, okay, the basal is a big opportunity, it's a large opportunity for us. I also think it's multi year, so I don't think it's just a 2024, 2025. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely two plus years easily. Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you referenced IQVIA, Robby. Seven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre, and I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. It's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the US.\nIn Japan and in France, where that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution on growth. I think right now in the US most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private. Private commercial Medicare represents about 1/3 of the market. I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the awareness.\nBuild the trialing experience with primary care and that's what we're doing. That's what we have been doing, quite frankly, for some time. It's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. Like I said, easily two plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have, Robby, is.\nLooking at a segment that really hasn't been, we haven't been able to access, which is that of pump connectivity. I think this represents a great opportunity for us. If you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year and that patient segment has, you know, we haven't been able to target it, but now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us, you know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nRight.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nRecently there was an independent third party study. I think it's the first time we've seen an independent head to head study that was published a few weeks ago.\nShowing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's MARD. So I look at that and I say, okay, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the best.\nSolution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment. So I look at the basal, I look at the pump. It's probably good drivers for us in 2024, 2025, but we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform. Like I've said to your question on IQVIA.\nI think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market. The pharmacy channel in the US gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that drive, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. Maybe that's what you're seeing. Great.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nAppreciate the thoughts.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year and strong guidance. Just Robert, since this story seems to be very much about line growth. I haven't heard you reference the Fab Five, one of my favorite analogies in a long time. So just wanted to, and maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab Five and where, you know, how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024. Thanks so much.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say yes, they are great products, and we didn't think about calling them that because they were going to be a flash in the pan for one or two years. We look at these as really long term, great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company.\nOver the next few years, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year and they'll accelerate. I think this year, sorry, in 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about a point of growth, total Abbott contribution. They're definitely stepping up. I'd say some of them I would call market creating opportunities. Tricuspid, I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement.\nGenerating referral pathways. We know how to do this, and we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? With products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do. Regarding clinical work as it relates to market expansion, development, and market development, I'd say some of the other products on that list are probably more market conversion. These are already large, attractive growth segments that, you know, we're targeting with our technologies.\nNavitor in the TAVR space, Aveir in the CRM side. I mean, these are large, large segments that we're coming in and will have different value propositions. I think Aveir has got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market, and the value proposition for Aveir, I think, is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implanter, to the patient. That.\nI expect a lot from Aveir in terms of growth. I expect a lot from Navitor. We're going to be expanding. We'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision.\nWe're investing in those areas. Yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it, and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50% at least. We're forecasting 50% growth next year, and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company. That being said, I will say.\nThose are great products, and they take a lot of focus. We still have, you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here, too. Whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test, we're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users this year. Also, you know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution. We put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre.\nWe're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostic market that we're currently not competing in. Yeah, five, five. A lot of great contributions, but there's a lot in the chamber here, and I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025, just having a robust pipeline.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Very thorough, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year or nice end to last year too? Here's a question I have in nutrition. You've done a great job of, sounds like, returning to normalcy. I'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single-digit segment growth category. Thanks.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, yeah, I think kudos to the team here. You know we set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year to get to market leadership. In our October call we had already confirmed that, and I'd say over the last couple of months that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the number two.\nYeah, I mean I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share.\nI'd say given the strength of the portfolio, of the team, and what we went through, and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share.\nI don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio.\nI'd say we're probably above that 4 to 6 range that we used to have pre pandemic at least into 2024.\nAs I've said, I think that we can be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down. I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. This position with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on health care and on nutrition. I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher end 6 range going forward. You know, I think right now you'll see the impact of the share in the US, some partial year impact of the price.\nAllow us to be above that 6% range, and then as we move into next year, you know, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the adult segment, and what is that going to do for us?\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nHi guys.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks for taking my question.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nRobert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M and M, looking at the balance sheet, phenomenal position, you at least have a minimum of $20 billion of firepower. Abbott hasn't done any large deals in.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThe last few years.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHow do you see the opportunity for larger size deals?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWhat is Abbott's appetite for a larger.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSized, more meaningful transaction?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet and provides us a lot of flexibility on our, on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with we've got great pipeline, we have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top tier, sustainable growth.\nThat ends up putting, allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk, bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top line gaps that might be there. So that.\nAllows us to be more selective. If there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then.\nLike you said, you've done the math. We've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good.\nProfitability matters, earnings matter when you get into these larger size deals.\nYou have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top line play. I think they're harder nowadays. You look at what we did with St. Jude.\nWe have looked back at the deal model that we put together.\nSpot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought this business would impact the company.\nI'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work. If you want to look beyond just top line, and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital.\nI don't feel that we need to do anything like that.\nTo cover a top line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term, not trying to fill a top line gap.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks guys.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nI'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Travis Steed from Bank of America Securities, your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nHi everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some med tech companies are kind of calling out above normal growth. Curious, Robert, if you look at your med device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated catch up still coming through, or do you think this is more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious on some of your thoughts on the overall market. Yeah, I don't think that we're seeing any kind of catch up or pent up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more, at least I can speak for our portfolio. I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies. Right. I think there was some disruption.\nWe've talked about it in some parts of some procedures that require a little bit more pre-op planning or imaging before, and imaging after. I mean, I think those.\nThat combined with the labor shortages that occurred in 2022. 2022, I think that probably slowed a few of them down. I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that. I just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in, in.\nYou know, in CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the US but around the world too. Seeing that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis, a lot of our, a good portion of the diagnostic business, our core lab business, is actually in the hospital. We also get to see that too. You know, didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. We try and triangulate this. I just see this as, you know, procedures are returning back to normal, and because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients, I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve. Some are faster than others just given, I think, the market.\nMarket positions, et cetera. I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent up piece over here. Great, thanks a lot. Okay, well I'll wrap up here. Like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023. In many ways it sort of represented this transition year.\nRegarding the coming down of COVID, I think we did a really good job at managing the scale up and the scale down. A lot of healthcare companies actually participated in trying to solve the COVID problem, and I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now transitioned from being driven by COVID-19 testing to once again being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company. We delivered double-digit organic sales growth on every base business on every quarter, and we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum.\nThe pipeline, we talked a bit about it, continues to be highly productive and, you know, I'm forecasting here top tier growth in 2024. As you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. We're in January, so we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nOkay, thank you, operator, and thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nAll for your questions.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThis now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star 11 keys on your touchtone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott, with the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question and answer session. The entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks following their comments.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWe'll take your questions before we get started.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nSome statements made today may be forward looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024.\nAbbott cautions that these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1. A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended 31 December 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law on today's conference call. As in the past, non GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at Abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott",
    "content2": "Call over to Robert. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our 2023 results as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time have positioned the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier. Given the large size of our company, we expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. While our procedures-driven businesses, such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing, experienced a slowdown due to healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world placed a greater emphasis on protecting their health.\nWhile some companies saw their entire portfolio suffer during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient. It was also during this time that we created a multibillion dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. Given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders.\nWe knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead. We pulled forward or accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred, and the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale up and subsequent scale down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company.\nOur R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions, and this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD, for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs, with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution. In medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals, along with several new opportunities to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio.\nThese new opportunities are well balanced, with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year. Sales, excluding COVID testing, grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11%, higher than our original guidance of high single-digit growth.\nAdjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range, despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. This is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio, and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecast sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business.\nI'll provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil.\nI'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the US was driven by continued market share capture in the US infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader.\nInternational growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\nTurning to established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results.\nMoving to Diagnostics, growth in rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing. The flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. In core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems. Paired with our broad test menu offering, Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations. The system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the US.\nI'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion.\nIn terms of sales dollars, FreeStyle Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe.\nIn rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products including Amplatzer, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis. In heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. Lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.\nIn summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year. We outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil.\nThanks Robert.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which, as expected, reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, today we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024.\nFor the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast non operating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press Star 11 on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising you that your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press Star 11 again. For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. Again, that's Star 11 to ask a question. Please stand by while we compile the Q and A roster.\nOur first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a nice end to the year here.\nRobert, you know, pre Covid Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically as you mentioned. You're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base. What has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions, and I'll leave it there for my one question.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and, quite frankly, as we talked about.\nThroughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the, some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business, I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these four business segments, and their underlying attractiveness still is, you know, is very sustainable. Strengthening our positions that we're already pretty strong in each of these four strategies segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of health care to be in. I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range.\nYou look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging geography and different markets, and they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their op margin profile by 300 basis points. It's a pretty strong position, strong team. We layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which historically hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets. It's probably been more of a developed markets place. I think that's going to provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think did an incredible job here.\nAs we said at the beginning of last year, regaining our leadership position here in the US speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product. Even our adult business has increased a billion dollars since pre-pandemic, and it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean, it's $4 billion, growing high single digits. There are a lot of med tech businesses like Larry that command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kinds of growth rates and sizes. We're making investments in that channel also. Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well. We talked about our algorithm, formula, and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here.\nI think that's the result of our portfolio and, quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. Our Rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing. We've been making investments on new assays to be able to put through those instruments, and then medical devices historically was in that high single digit growth. I think what's changed there to become now.\nA double-digit grower for us on a very large size business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like Heartfelt or EP Structural, Heart adc. I mean, those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices. Our CRM and vascular businesses that were showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4 with CRM. I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology on vascular. It's been a combination of adding inorganically to the business and organically plays to reposition some of the portfolio for higher growth segments. I think that's really.\nIn a nutshell, across all these very four attractive segments, we've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. I think you're starting, you saw that last year, every year double-digit growth, and they've gotten stronger, and they've gotten better, and they've gotten more growth opportunities with them. I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you, I've gotten some of the headlines here about accelerating sales but not seeing maybe that come through on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that Covid had on us and the clouding of it. Our core business grew EPS last year, 40+%. We're forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth, you know, this at the midpoint, double-digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry.\nI'd say yeah, you know, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics, but you know, we've proven to be pretty resilient there. I think the range captures the opportunity that we have.\nOn the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range. It's only January, so I think this is a good starting point. Super helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. Was hoping to just follow up on your comments there, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. I know Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you did not have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally. Was hoping that, just thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business in that 30 to 50 basis point range, if you could just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in 2024 and into the out years. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here too.\nRecover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position. Position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre pandemic level, and I think what you saw us do there, Josh and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we manage very well strategically. The spending piece of it. We accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago, and then we held that spending flat these last couple of years.\nEven though our top line was growing pretty significantly here, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line. That is, think about our Big 5 activities this year at the company. We can do all five of them at the same time. I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. We're forecasting a pretty nice step up in our gross margin profile this year, roughly around 75 basis points. There's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. You know, every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis. They all get reported out, so there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs.\nSome of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. You know, whether it's commodity costs, freight, and distribution, all those elements seem to be, say right now and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, turning into tailwind. That helps. The other part here is just, I'd say, portfolio mix. As.\nSome of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher margin businesses, and they provide that, you know, that mix element in that gross margin expansion. I think this provides a nice, you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year. I expect over time we'll get back to our pre-pandemic, you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. For me, it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when.\nIf we could target 50, 75, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want.\nThat kind of expansion for us I think really provides a good opportunity to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. Our big opportunity here is gross margin, and we're all over it.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open. Good morning.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches. We'd love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the US EP business as we see some PFA launches this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks for taking the questions.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Well, I think we've showed pretty strong, robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual in-market competition.\nIt's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story. US has been strong, China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean, there was some price challenges throughout the year with VBP, but the volume we picked up, the market share we pick up more than, more than off. It's really been across the board here, and I think it really is about strength of the portfolio. You know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think is at the core, you know, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. I think launching TactiFlex.\nWhich is the flexible tip, combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's outcomes for the patient or.\nTime of procedure, we've seen that consistently around the world. I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers. Yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth as we look to.\nMore PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the US. Listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology. I think there are some challenges with some of these first generation products. I do expect there to be uptake and usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first, at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment.\nFrom there, kind of moving past that, you know, right now, I think, I guess that's my assumption in the US until I see something differently, is that, you know, it will follow a similar pattern, and then the question will just be kind of the speed.\nI think the team has done a really good job here on the ground, you know, with the technology.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOh great. Thanks for taking the question, Robert. Maybe I could ask on Libre. You know, this is the most successful medical device. At the conference just a few weeks ago in San Francisco, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward, and targets.\nYou know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in 2024 and beyond. One question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data, it's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales or at least prescriptions are flattening out, yet the sales keep growing. How do we think about the discrepancy there? How big is the Medicare DME business? You know, the growth we're getting there from basal.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nSure.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nStrong growth in Q4 under $1.5 billion. US was up 32%.\nI'd say the team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. Being able to put those kind of growth rates in the US without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\nThe growth is going to come from. I've been pretty consistent about this, Robby. There was a lot of opportunity, opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here, but I'd say okay, the basal is a big opportunity, it's a large opportunity for us. I also think it's multi year. I don't think it's just a 2024, 2025. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely two plus years easily. Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you referenced IQVIA, Robby. Seven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. It's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the US.\nIn Japan and in France where that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution on growth. I think right now in the US most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private. Private commercial Medicare represents about 1/3 of the market.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSo.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nI think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the awareness.\nBuild the trialing experience with primary care, and that's what we're doing. That's what we have been doing, quite frankly, for some time. It's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. Like I said, easily two plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have, Robby, is.\nLooking at a segment that really hasn't been, we haven't been able to access, which is that of pump connectivity. I think this represents a great opportunity for us. If you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for US economy got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year and that patient segment has, you know, we haven't been able to target it. Now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us, you know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nRight.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nRecently there was an independent third party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head to head study that was published a few weeks ago.\nShowing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's MARD. I look at that and I say, okay, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the.\nBest solution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment. I look at the baseline, I look at the pump as probably good drivers for us in 2024, 2025, but we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform. Like I've said to your question on IQVIA.\nI think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market. You know, the pharmacy channel in the US gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that drive, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. Maybe that's what you're seeing.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nAppreciate the thoughts.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year, and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since this story seems to be very much about line growth, I haven't heard you reference the Fab Five, one of my favorite analogies, in a long time. Maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab Five, and how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024. Thanks so much.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say yes, they are great products, and we didn't think about calling them that because they are going to be a flash in the pan for one or two years. We look at these as really long-term, great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company.\nOver the next few years, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate, I think, this year, sorry. In 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth, and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about a point of growth, total Abbott contribution. They're definitely stepping up. I'd say some of them I would call market-creating opportunities. Tricuspid I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement.\nGenerating referral pathways. We know how to do this, and we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products. With products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to market expansion, development, and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list are probably more market conversion. These are already large, attractive growth segments.\nThat we're targeting with our technologies.\nNavitor in the TAVR space, Aveir in the CRM side. These are large segments that were coming in and will have different value propositions. I think Aveir's got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market, and the value proposition for Aveir I think is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implanter, to the patient.\nI expect a lot from there in terms of growth. I expect a lot from Navitor. We're going to be expanding. We'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan.\nWe're investing in those areas. Yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50% at least. We're forecasting a 50% growth next year and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company. So, you know, that being said, I will say, you know, those are great products and they take a lot of focus. But we still have, you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users this year. Also, you know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution. We put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials.\nI talked about biosimilars in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre.\nWe're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostics market that we're currently not competing. So yeah, five, five. A lot of great contributions, but there's a lot in the chamber here, and I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Very thorough. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year or nice end to last year too? So here's a question I have in nutrition. You've done a great job of. Sounds like returning to normalcy. I'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single digit segment growth category. Thanks.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, yeah, I think kudos to the team here. You know we set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year to get to market leadership. In our October call we had already confirmed that, and I'd say over the last couple of months that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the number. Number two.\nYeah, I mean I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share.\nI'd say given the strength of the portfolio of the team and what we went through, and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre recall share.\nI don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio.\nI'd say we're probably above that four to six range that we used to have pre-pandemic, at least into 2024.\nAs I've said, I think that we can be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down. And I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share position."

Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; [indiscernible] Senior Vice President Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Robert Ford will. [indiscernible]\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we raised the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $4.42 to $4.46. Organic sales growth on the base business, which excludes COVID testing, increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter and was led by double-digit growth in all 4 of our major businesses.\nThis acceleration in sales growth is a result of our strong position in attractive growth markets. In conjunction with the additional investments we made across the company during the pandemic. In addition to the strong top line performance, we continue to deliver accelerating earnings power on our base business, and remain on track to deliver on the financial commitments we set at the beginning of the year. With a positive growth outlook for the businesses and the momentum we're building across the portfolio, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024.\nI will now review our performance in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 18% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth of 25% was led by continued market share capture in the U.S. in formula business, where we have now reclaimed the leadership position. Internationally, we continue to deliver well-balanced growth coming from both interim formula products and our PediaSure taller brand.\nIn Adult Nutrition, growth of 12% was driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands across the U.S. and international markets. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 11% in the quarter. This strong performance was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in several markets and therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health and CNS pain management.\nIn September, we announced an agreement with global biotech leader, MAb Science to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. This collaboration will help introduce cutting-edge medicines in the areas of oncology, women's health and respiratory diseases, the people in countries that have historically lacked access to these treatment options. Moving to Diagnostics.\nExcluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 10%, and led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew double digits, driven by above-market performance in the U.S. and internationally. Growth was driven by a continued increase in global demand for routine diagnostic testing and a strong recovery of our blood transfusion testing business following a period of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn Rapid Diagnostics, double-digit organic sales growth on the base business benefited from increased demand for respiratory tests in anticipation of an earlier-than-normal start to the flu season in the Northern Hemisphere. And I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew nearly 15%, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally.\nIn Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, and grew 28%. The global Libre user base now exceeds 5 million people with nearly 2 million of those in the U.S. where the Libre user base has nearly doubled in the last 2 years. A recent analysis of our U.S. user base showed that a growing number of Libre users are using Libre in combination with GLP-1 medications as part of a companion therapy approach for managing their diabetes.\nOn average, those using both Libre and GLP-1 exhibited a higher rate of use for both products, wearing Libre sensors more often and taking GLP-1 medication more frequently compared to other users. This increase in use or better compliance is a positive sign that these users are taking an even more active role in managing their diabetes. And while we traditionally think of therapy choices as having to compete against one another, this is a good example of a complementary relationship between 2 products that both help optimize the treatment of diabetes.\nIn cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology and structural heart. In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth across all major international geographic regions and high teens growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by double-digit growth of MitraClip and strong growth from several recently launched new products, most notably Navitor, our latest generation TAVR valve. In Ribbon Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aver, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual-chamber pacing. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 19%, driven by the recent launch of Ituna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete.\nSo in summary, this was a very strong quarter. with all 4 major businesses delivering double-digit organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales. Growth rates in the base business have improved every quarter this year on both the top and bottom lines. And the momentum we are building in positions us well for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024.\nI'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil?\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales decreased 1.5% on an organic basis due to as expected a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales.\nExcluded COVID-tested sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 13.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55% of sales.\nOn a year-to-date basis, our adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales which is below our original full year guidance of approximately 56% that we provided back in January. The difference is primarily due to lower gross margins on COVID tests due to lower volumes and price compared to our original forecast assumptions and the impact of higher inventory obsolescence as a result of maintaining higher inventory levels throughout the pandemic to help ensure product supply during a time when global supply chains were less predictable.\nAs the global supply chain environment continues to improve, we're adjusting our inventory levels to align with that trend. Adjusted R&D was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.42 to $4.46, which is comprised of our year-to-date results plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.17 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales to be in the low double digits and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions.",

With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, which reflects an acceleration in the contribution from the underlying base business. Organic sales, excluded COVID testing, increased low double digits for the second quarter in a row and was led by mid-teens growth in medical devices, along with double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition.\nOn our last couple of earnings calls, I've highlighted improving underlying demand trends across our businesses. These strengthening trends continued in both our institutional and consumer facing businesses this past quarter. Within the Institutional businesses, health care systems around the world that continue to improve their ability to expand the supply of health care services through ongoing efforts to adjust protocols, manage the labor challenges and increase the overall available capacity to treat patients.\nIn our more consumer-facing businesses, we're seeing consumers prioritize spending for health care products, which is driving increased demand for our products in the U.S. and internationally. I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Nutrition where sales increased 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., growth was led by pediatric nutrition growth of more than 20%. We continue to make good progress in increasing manufacturing production and have now recovered approximately 75% of the market share in the infant formula business that was lost last year as a result of the voluntary recall.\nInternationally, total Nutrition sales grew 6%, led by growth in both pediatric and adult nutrition businesses. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 12.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by growth across several markets, including India and China and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health and CNS pain management. This business continues to execute at a high level and capitalize on the favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends in emerging markets.\nMoving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 7%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew 10%, driven by performance in the U.S., Europe and China. This broad-based strong performance reflects the increased demand for routine diagnostic testing globally. And in the U.S., our blood transfusion testing business continues to make good progress, recovering from the impact of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew more than 14% on an organic basis, including double-digit growth in both U.S. and internationally. In Diabetes Care, Freestyle Libre sales exceeded $1.3 billion in the quarter and grew 25% on an organic basis. During the quarter, Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France for all people with diabetes who use insulin. This achievement was a direct result of the unique value proposition that Libre offers, a fully featured continuous glucose monitor made available at an accessible price.\nAbbott has led the way in expanding reimbursement coverage for continuous glucose monitors in order to bring the benefits of this life-changing technology to more people around the world. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology and structural heart. In electrophysiology, performance was led by international growth of more than 20%, which included high teens growth in Europe and strong growth in China.\nDuring the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our TactiFlex ablation catheter, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible tip and contact for sensing technology, which helps to deliver improved procedure outcomes and faster procedure types. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by MitraClip growth of approximately 10% and along with growth from several recently launched new products.\nEarlier this year, we submitted for FDA approval for TriClip, our minimally invasive tricuspid valve repair device, that helps treat a condition on as tricuspid regurgitation, a leaky heart valve disease. The clinical trial data supporting our submission showed that TriClip is a highly effective and safe treatment that provide a significant improvement in the quality of life for patients. TriClip is currently being reviewed by the FDA, and we look forward to bringing this first of its kind technology to patients here in the U.S.\nIn Ribbon Management, growth of 8% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. And during the quarter, we received FDA approval for our dual chamber leadless pacemaker, a first of its kind technology that allows for 2 pacemaker devices to communicate with one other inside the body to provide minimally invasive treatment for those with abnormal heart rhythms. Aveir was specifically designed to be upgradable and retrievable in order to evolve with patient changes in therapy needs over time. This unique technology offers the potential to revolutionize care for millions of people who require a pacemaker.\nAnd lastly, in Neuromodulation sales grew 16%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation evisioned for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. During the first half of this year, we introduced several new innovations, including the launch of Eterna and label indication expansions for treating painful diabetic neuropathy and chronic back pain for those who have not had or are not eligible for back surgery.\nSo in summary, we exceeded expectations on both top and the bottom lines. Growth in the underlying base business accelerated, driven by improving market conditions, contributions from both new products and legacy growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, which will sustain our strong growth profile in the future.\nI'll now turn the call to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert E. Funck\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results. Sales decreased 9.2% on an organic basis due to as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. .\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales, which reflects continued flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the second quarter.\nLastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales to be in the low double digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.3 billion, which is below our full year forecast of around $1.5 billion that we provided in April due to current testing dynamics, including lower demand for testing following the end of the public health emergency in May. For the third quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $100 million.\nBased on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1.5% on full year reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in April, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by approximately $0.05 based on our strong performance and outlook.\nCompared to the initial guidance we provided back in January, we have now raised our underlying base business earnings forecast by more than $0.15 offsetting the lower contribution from COVID testing versus our initial forecast. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.10, which reflects strong growth on the underlying base business. We forecast total underlying base business, organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our third quarter reported sales.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions.",

Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions.\n\nScott Michael Leinenweber\n\nVP of IR, Abbott Laboratories\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. .\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong results to start the year. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, which is above consensus estimates, driven entirely by strong underlying base business performance, excluding COVID testing. Organic sales growth excluded COVID testing increased 10% led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition.\nAs you'll recall, back in January, I expressed some optimism that the headwinds Abbott and other companies faced over the last few years were starting to peak and in some cases ease a bit. As we move through the first part of the year, that's exactly what we continue to see. Most notably, the impact of COVID has rapidly and significantly lessened. As part of this transition, certain behavioral shifts have been evident across society. One simple illustrative example has been the significant increase in travel and tourism, we've all seen, heard about or experience firsthand.\nA much more relevant and important behavioral shift that we're seeing in health care globally has been the increased priority people are putting on getting healthy and staying healthy. And for our businesses, the impacts have been increased routine diagnostic testing volumes, improved medical device procedure trends and strong demand for consumer-based health products. The net results this past quarter was strong, broad-based growth across our portfolio.\nImportantly, this growing focus on health adds to and enhances other favorable demographic trends such as a global population that's growing older and living longer and increasing access to health care around the world. Combination of these favorable market dynamics, along with the strength of our growth platforms and new product pipeline provides a strong foundation for sustainable, top-tier growth going forward.\nI'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 11% in the quarter. This continues EPD's impressive stretch of consistent strong performance, including double-digit growth each of the last 2 years. Growth this past quarter was led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management.\nTurning to Nutrition, where sales increased more than 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 35% included the impact of lower sales in the first quarter of last year due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products. We continue to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew mid-single digits overall, and sales in global Adult Nutrition also grew mid-single digits, driven by strong performance of our market-leading Ensure brand.\nMoving to Diagnostics, where as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in COVID testing sales compared to the first quarter of last year. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid- to -high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the U.S. and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year, though we're seeing improving market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales grew nearly 8% globally.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally.\nIn Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the U.S. and mid-teens internationally. During the quarter, Libre received U.S. FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. We're working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with both Libre 2 and Libre 3 as soon as possible.\nIn cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 8% overall in the quarter. And impressively, organic sales growth rate improved sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every one of our cardiovascular device businesses. This broad-based strength was led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure and Structural Heart.\nIn Heart Failure, sales of CardioMEMS grew more than 30%, which represents the third quarter in a row that CardioMEMS sales have grown more than 25%. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by high teens growth in Europe, including strong, broad-based performance across big 5 European countries, which was driven by cardiac ablation catheters and mapping systems.\nIn Structural Heart, growth was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, along with strong contributions from 3 recently launched products, Amulet, Navitor and TriClip, which combined to grow nearly 50% in the quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation sales grew 11%, driven by a recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we didn't previously compete.\nSo in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding financial expectations on both top and bottom lines. The strong performance we're achieving is broad-based and fueled by strong execution, new products and improving market conditions. And our core foundational growth platforms have strong momentum and are achieving exceptional results, positioning us well for top-tier growth going forward.\nAnd now I'll turn over the call to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert E. Funck\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\nTurning to our first quarter results. Sales decreased 14.5% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.3% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 28.3% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.\nTurning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be at least high single digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion, which is below the full year forecast of approximately $2 billion we provided in January due to current testing dynamics we're seeing in the market.\nFor the second quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $200 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of a little more than 2% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but now reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in January, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by a little more than $0.10 based on our strong performance and outlook.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions.",

Smith Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Third Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Today, I'm joined by Steve Shafer, Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nWithin today's presentation, we have provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements. that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI'll now turn the call over to Steve to begin our prepared remarks.\n\nStephen M. Shafer\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I would like to start by briefly thanking the many dedicated A.O. Smith employees and broader set of partners and customers in our ecosystem for another quarter of helping to make clean hot and safe water available to millions of people. We appreciate all you do to make that happen.\nPlease turn to Slide 4, and I will now review our financial performance in the quarter. Our global A.O. Smith team delivered third quarter sales of $943 million, a year-over-year increase of 4% and EPS of $0.94, a 15% increase over 2024. North America sales grew 6%, primarily as a result of our pricing actions and strong commercial water heater and boiler volumes. We achieved North America segment margin expansion of 110 basis points and Rest of World segment margin expansion of 90 basis points.\nContinued economic challenges and more limited availability of government stimulus programs led to a 12% decrease in local currency sales in China. Pureit contributed $17 million of sales in the quarter, and our legacy India business continued its strong double-digit growth trajectory by delivering 13% growth in local currencies.\nNorth America water heater sales increased 6% in the third quarter, driven by pricing actions taken in response to higher tariffs and other input costs as well as higher commercial water heater volumes. Our market-leading high-efficiency condensing gas and heat pump products continue to have a compelling payback story in commercial applications.\nOur residential water heater volumes were also positive. So we believe that Q3 industry volumes declined year-over-year. As we expected, we believe we outperformed the residential and commercial markets in the quarter, in part due to our production efficiency initiative that limited the prebuy impact on our sales in the first half of the year.\nOur North America boiler sales increased by 10% compared to the third quarter of 2024, led by the benefits of pricing actions and higher volumes of our high-efficiency boilers. North America water treatment sales decreased 5% in the third quarter as continued growth in our priority channels was more than offset by an expected decrease from the retail channel. Our priority dealer, e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels grew 11% in the quarter.\nIn China, third quarter sales decreased 12% in local currency as the ongoing economic challenges and reduced availability of government subsidy programs along with an increasingly competitive environment led to lower volumes. Despite these challenges and the resulting volume pressure, we achieved 90 basis points of margin expansion compared to last year through the restructuring initiatives we undertook in 2024 and other cost-saving measures.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. I would now like to take a moment and talk about our commitment to sustainability. For us, sustainability is not just a goal, but a core part of who we are and what we do every day. We are committed to not only developing and bringing to market innovative, high-efficiency products, but we are also dedicated to sustainability in our facilities and manufacturing processes. Later this week, we will publish our sustainability progress report, which will include our sustainability scorecard and an update on our water conservation, greenhouse gas emissions and waste reduction goals.\nWhat the report will show is that we are meeting or exceeding the goals that we set out for ourselves. The outcome of these efforts are providing both sustainability and bottom line results. For example, initiatives we have undertaken to support these goals include the test water recirculation system, which recycles water used during our product testing processes and our glass enamel reuse process, which captures waste glass enamel for reuse in our tank manufacturing process. These are examples of how we how we seamlessly integrate sustainability into 2 of our priority areas, operational excellence and innovation. We remain dedicated to finding better ways of doing things, including how to improve our business while protecting our planet.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6. Third quarter sales in the North America segment of $743 million increased 6% compared to the same period last year, primarily due to benefits of pricing actions as well as higher commercial water heater and boiler volumes. North America segment earnings were $180 million, an 11% increase over the third quarter of 2024. Segment operating margin was 24.2%, an increase of 110 basis points year-over-year. primarily due to pricing actions and higher volumes more than offsetting higher material and other input costs.\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $208 million decreased slightly compared to last year and included $17 million of sales from the Pure acquisition. Sales in our legacy India business grew 13% in local currency. China third-party sales decreased 12% on a constant currency basis. Rest of the World segment earnings of $15 million increased year-over-year as continued expense management and the benefits of restructuring actions more than offset lower volumes in China. Segment operating margin was 7.4%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior period. Pureit will continue to be a headwind in the near term as we focus on integration, which is progressing well.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. Operating cash flow grew 21% to $434 million, and free cash flow grew 35% to $381 million during the first 9 months of 2025. Compared to the same period last year, primarily due to lower inventory balances that were partially offset by other working capital outlays, including lower customer deposits in China. Our cash balance totaled $173 million at the end of September, and our net debt position was $13 million. Our leverage ratio was 9.2% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9. Earlier this month, our Board approved a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share, making 2025 the 32nd consecutive year that A.O. Smith has raised its dividend. We repurchased approximately 5 million shares of common stock in the first 9 months of 2025 for a total of $335 million. This is an increase compared to the same period last year as we raised our planned full year repurchase intentions from $306 million in 2024 and to approximately $400 million of shares for 2025.\nConsistent with our key priorities, we are actively assessing strategic opportunities and have sufficient dry powder for acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial criteria. Our M&A priority continues to be deals that strengthen our core business or help us build new growth platforms.\nPlease turn to Slide 10 in our 2025 earnings guidance and outlook. We are narrowing the range and lowering the top end of our 2025 EPS outlook from a range of $3.70 to $3.90 per share to a range of $3.70 to $3.85 per share. We have included the following assumptions in our outlook. We began to see the impact from tariffs in the third quarter and expect that our tariff costs will continue to increase into the fourth quarter as additional impacts make their way through our supply chain. Though the tariff plan remains uncertain, we maintain our estimate that annualized tariffs will increase total company cost of goods sold by approximately 5%, which includes tariff rates currently in place as well as the mitigation efforts we have implemented.\nAs a reminder, our mitigation strategies include footprint optimization, strategic sourcing and other cost controls and pricing actions as necessary. Apart from tariffs, we expect overall material costs for the year to remain approximately flat versus last year. With steel costs rising 15% to 20% in the second half of 2025 compared to the first half, we estimate that 2025 CapEx will be approximately $75 million. We expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $500 million. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $15 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $75 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we project our outstanding diluted shares will be 142 million at the end of 2025.\nI will now turn the call back over to Steve, who will provide more color around our key markets, top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2025 remaining on Slide 10. Steve?\n\nStephen M. Shafer\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThanks, Chuck. Key assumptions in our top line outlook include the following. We project that 2025 U.S. residential industry unit volumes will be flat to slightly down compared to last year, a slight decrease from our previous guidance due to residential new construction expectations that have come down since last quarter. Lower housing completions, particularly in multifamily as well as concern around consumer confidence have led to this revised outlook. The wholesale channel impact is expected to be greater due to a heavier exposure to new construction.\nThat said, we are encouraged by the resilient demand we are seeing in the commercial water heater market segment. And as a result, we are increasing our projection for commercial water heater industry volumes from flat to last year to up low single digits. We are pleased with our strong performance relative to the market in the third quarter and the share momentum we have going into the fourth quarter, supported by our winning products in this segment.\nEconomic challenges persist in China. While government stimulus programs helped to stabilize parts of the market in the first half of 2025, we believe the stimulus programs pulled forward a significant amount of demand. During the third quarter, national sub fees were discontinued, resulting in increased promotional activity and discounting from our competitors, much of which we chose not to participate in. Because we do not expect an improvement in market conditions in the near term, we are lowering our 2025 China sales outlook to a decline of approximately 10% in local currency. We continue to benefit from the restructuring actions taken in 2024 as well as other cost-saving measures, which we project will offset the margin impact of lower volumes for the year.\nOur 2025 North America boiler sales projection of an increase of between 4% and 6% compared to 2024 is unchanged. We are very pleased with our growth in the first 9 months of the year, although we believe we may have benefited from a minimal amount of prebuy related to price increases implemented in the second quarter. We continue to monitor our key markets closely. We have not changed our guidance that North America water treatment sales will decline approximately 5% in 2025 as we deemphasize the less profitable retail channel.\nWe continue to be pleased with the growth we have seen in our priority channels and our onboarding of new dealers during the year. Our plan to drive 250 basis points of operating margin improvement in 2025 for the North America water treatment business is on track.\nFinally, we expect the addition of Pureit will add approximately USD 55 million in sales in 2025, slightly higher than our earlier guidance. It will not have a significant bottom line contribution this year as we work through integration. Based on the continued economic challenges in China and the softening wholesale residential water heater market in the U.S., we have lowered our full year sales outlook from 2% to 3% growth to a range of flat to up 1% compared to last year. We continue to expect our North America segment margin will be between 24% to 24.5%, and we expect that Rest of World segment margin will be approximately 8%.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. Last quarter, I laid out my areas of focus. Earlier this month, the top 140 leaders of A.O. Smith gathered to talk about the future of our company, to align on key priorities and inspire each other through the opportunity to connect and share ideas on how to deliver the next great chapter of the A.O. Smith legacy. I came away from this important time together confident in our path forward and with the commitment from our leadership team to execute. I look forward to sharing more regarding this Leadership Summit and our focus areas in the quarters to come.\nI am also pleased to welcome Chris Howe as our new Chief Digital Information Officer. Chris is the transformational leader that we need to help us invest wisely in new technologies for the future, and unlock even more value potential in the technologies we are invested in today. In his previous roles, Chris led transformational effort to leverage enterprise software solutions or most recently worked on the forefront of generative AI solutions. He will be instrumental in ensuring we have the technical capabilities needed to support all our priorities, especially operational excellence and innovation.\nAs we shared last quarter and as part of our portfolio management priority, we announced the intention of our formal China strategic assessment. While we remain early in the process, we are making good progress. We commissioned a third-party analysis of the China market, and it confirmed many of our assumptions entering the strategic assessment.\nOne, our brand remains strong, well-known and respected among Chinese consumers, especially with regard to our innovative products and premium solutions. Two, our strategy to expand into broader categories that can be connected by Smart Home Solutions and our AI Link capability was a necessary path forward. And three, we have a number of go-to-market and business model opportunities to better strengthen the business and capture our fair share of market recovery. We believe that we have a good understanding of our challenges and are evaluating potential opportunities to ensure the future success of this business as we drive greater value for shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.\nIn conclusion, I am pleased [indiscernible] third quarter execution, particularly in the North American segment. I'm also encouraged by the progress we are making on our strategic priorities, including portfolio work to help strengthen our business going forward.\nRegarding execution. We delivered a solid third quarter in North America, led by pricing performance and our strong commercial high-efficiency portfolio while expanding margins through operational discipline. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to navigate the tariffs and competitive landscape in our core water heater and boiler businesses. where we serve a large replacement-driven market with a broad industry-leading portfolio and go-to-market model.\nRegarding our portfolio, we are driving double-digit growth in priority areas, including boilers, select North America water treatment channels and India. At the same time, through our strategic assessment, we are working to understand and address what is required to improve the performance of our China business.\nFinally, we continue to generate cash, maintain a strong balance sheet on our ready with dry powder necessary to build out our portfolio in ways that complement our business today.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks and are now available for your questions."

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please begin.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the A. O. Smith Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Today, I'm joined by Steve Shafer, Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nWithin today's presentation, we have provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website. A friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others.

We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Steve to begin our prepared remarks.\n\nStephen M. Shafer\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. We believe A.O. Smith has an outstanding foundation for profitable growth as a global water technology leader. I am both honored and excited to build on this foundation as the company's new CEO, and I'm confident in our company's future. This future will be powered by the many dedicated and capable A. O. Smith colleagues I have started to get to know over the past 1.5 years, and I look forward to the journey we have in front of us together. Later in our prepared remarks, I will share some of my early thoughts on priorities going forward that I believe will be most impactful in delivering that bright future for us.\nBut first, I would like to go through our second quarter performance, our updated guidance for the year and the announcement regarding our China business. Now turning to Slide 4 and our financial performance in the quarter. North America water heater sales decreased 2% in the second quarter, driven by lower volumes. Shipments in the first half of 2024 benefited from prebuy-related volumes ahead of an announced price increase. This year, we believe the industry once again bought ahead of price increases and tariff risk. We decided to take a more proactive approach by working closely with our customers to better align order rates to our strategy of smoothing production schedules in order to achieve greater operational efficiency. Like the overall industry, we still benefited in the quarter from a demand pull forward. However, our 2025 pull-forward impact was less pronounced compared to the demand pull forward we experienced in 2024, and we expect to gain operational efficiencies through the year because of these actions.\nOur North America boiler sales increased by 6% compared to the second quarter of 2024, led by higher volumes of our high-efficiency commercial boilers. North America water treatment sales increased slightly in the second quarter as growth in our priority channels, e-commerce, dealer and direct-to-consumer continued to offset expected retail declines. In addition to the growth in these priority channels, we are pleased with the improved profitability it provided, which helped contribute to North America segment operating margin expansion in the quarter. In China, second quarter sales decreased 11% in local currency as the ongoing economic challenges and limited availability of government subsidy programs outside of Tier 1 and 2 cities resulted in lower volumes. We maintained our operating margin year-over-year despite lower sales due to our 2024 restructuring initiatives and other cost control measures.\nIn addition to announcing our Q2 performance in China, we are also announcing today that we are initiating a process to further assess our China business in an effort to ensure that it is best positioned to compete and succeed in the future. We intend to evaluate a broad range of options in addition to further business improvements, including strategic partnerships and other alternatives. As we announced in Q4 of last year, given the market conditions, we have been working to optimize the operating structure in China and reduce costs to better position the business for the future. These initiatives are already delivering positive results. We are on track to achieve $15 million in annual benefits, which have resulted in sequential margin improvement quarter-over-quarter. Despite the current macroeconomic challenges, we believe the China market has substantial long-term potential.\nOur China business also has many competitive strengths, including a premium brand position, differentiated innovation capabilities, a well-established distribution network and a talented local team. We are committed to realizing the full potential inherent in our China business for our company and our shareholders, while benefiting our employees, valuable partners and customers. We believe that the assessment announced today will allow us to properly understand the potential options available to realize the full potential of the business. As the review progresses, we will continue to deliver best-in-class products and service just as we always have.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. I would now like to take a moment to discuss innovation at A. O. Smith. As a water technology leader, we continue to invest in and launch new to the world differentiated products. And I would like to highlight a few of those offerings today. We recently introduced the second product in our AdAPT gas tankless line, the Adapt which is our standard condensing product featuring industry-first integrated scale prevention technology. This product is positioned in the high-volume segment of the tankless market and is the latest proof point in our commitment to become the North American leader in tankless technology.\nWe have also just launched our Home Shield Full House water filter, which is certified to reduce PFAS to less than 4 parts per trillion for 500,000 gallons of water. In addition to taking whole house PPaaS reduction performance to a new level, it is also easier to install and provide both economic and ecological benefits for the homeowner. Next month, we will introduce the cyclone Flex, the next generation of our industry-leading commercial water heater that is smarter, more efficient and more flexible than ever. Staying the industry leader means never standing still, and this product is a continuation of our long history of cyclone enhancements and will help ensure we are best positioned for the 2026 regulatory change in the commercial market and remain the industry's #1 specified commercial gas water heater.\nThese are just a few examples of the exciting pipeline of new products we are bringing to market that has us confident in our future. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We delivered sales of $1 billion in the second quarter of 2025, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Earnings were $1.07 per share a 1% increase compared to the prior period.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. I Second quarter sales in the North America segment of $779 million decreased 1% compared to a difficult year-over-year comp. Higher boiler sales were more than offset by lower volumes of water heaters. North America segment earnings of $198 million were essentially flat to last year. Segment operating margin was 25.4%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year primarily due to mix benefits from our water treatment priority channel strategy as well as growth in high-efficiency water heaters.\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $240 million decreased 2% compared to last year. and included $16 million of sales from the Pureit acquisition. Sales in our legacy India business grew 19% in local currency. China third-party sales decreased 11% on a constant currency basis. Rest of the World segment earnings of $25 million were essentially flat year-over-year as continued expense management offset lower sales in China. Segment operating margin was 10.5% compared to 10.6% in the prior period. The Pureit acquisition is progressing well. However, we'll be a margin headwind in the near term as we focus on the integration.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. We generated operating cash flow of $178 million and free cash flow of $140 million during the first 6 months of 2025 and higher than the same period last year, primarily due to lower cash outlays for 2025 working capital needs that were partially offset by lower current year earnings. Our cash balance totaled $178 million at the end of June, and our net debt position was $126 million. Our leverage ratio was 14.1% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. We repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock in the first 6 months of 2025 for a total of $251 million an increase over the same period last year as we increased our planned full year repurchase intentions from $306 million in 2024 and to approximately $400 million of shares for 2025. We also opportunistically bought shares during the first half of the year. We are actively assessing strategic opportunities and have sufficient dry powder for suitable acquisitions. Our priority is on deals that strengthen our core business or help us build new growth platforms.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. In our 2025 earnings guidance and outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our 2025 EPS outlook from a range of between $3.60 and $3.90 per share to a narrowed range of between $3.70 to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of our revised EPS range is an increase of 2% compared to our 2024 adjusted EPS. We have included the following key assumptions in our outlook. Our guidance assumes an approximate 15% to 20% increase in the cost of steel in the back half of the year as well as the full impact of currently announced tariffs, which minimally impacted the first half of the year. Other input costs outside of steel and tariffs are slightly higher than 2024 and ratable for the year. The tariff landscape remains uncertain. We have refined our estimate of the annualized tariff impact on total company cost of goods sold to be an increase of approximately 5%, which is inclusive of currently announced tariff rates as well as the mitigation efforts we have implemented.\nOur mitigation strategies include footprint optimization, strategic sourcing and other cost controls. We estimate that 2025 CapEx will be between $90 million and $100 million as we continue to invest in engineering capabilities and prepare for the upcoming regulatory changes. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $500 million and $525 million. Interest expense is projected to be between $15 million and $20 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $75 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% to 24.5%, and we project our outstanding diluted shares will be $142 million at the end of 2025.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Steve, who will provide more color around our key markets, top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2025 remaining on Slide 10. Steve?\n\nStephen M. Shafer\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThanks, Chuck. Key assumptions in our top line outlook include the following: we project the 2025 residential and commercial industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year, which is unchanged. As we expected, we believe there will be some pressure on our market share in the first half of the year, as we managed our production levels despite the strong order rates we saw in response to tariff announcement and ahead of our main price increases. We anticipate a market share recovery in the second half of the year as we work through our backlog and our customers return to more normalized order patterns.\nIn China, we believe the economy remains challenged, and we continue to project that our sales in China will decrease 5% to 8% in local currency. While the stimulus programs benefited sales in Tier 1 and 2 cities, where we saw relatively flat sales compared to last year, stimulus programs were inconsistently applied in other regions, particularly in smaller cities. Additionally, many regions have not yet resumed subsidies in the second half of the year. Our forecast assumes that the currency translation impact will be minimal in 2025. We continue to expect to realize annual savings of approximately $15 million from our 2024 restructuring actions. And as a result, China operating margin is projected to be in the 8% to 10% range for 2025, even with lower volumes.\nWe remain cautious about the near-term market outlook, including the impact from the appliance discount trade-in program. However, we are pleased with how our China team continues to manage the challenging environment. We have raised our 2025 North America boiler sales projection from an increase of between 3% and 5% to an increase of between 4% and 6% compared to 2024. We are very pleased with our growth in the first half of the year. However, we believe we may have benefited from a minimal amount of prebuy related to price increases implemented in the second quarter. We continue to monitor the commercial markets closely.\nWe have not changed our guidance that North America water treatment sales will decline approximately 5% in 2025 and as we deemphasize the less profitable retail channel. We are pleased with the momentum we are seeing in our priority channels where we are seeing double-digit growth. We continue to project an operating margin expansion of approximately 250 basis points in 2025 for the North America water treatment business. Lastly, we continue to expect the addition of Pureit will add approximately $50 million in sales in 2025 and will not have a significant bottom line contribution this year as we work through integration. Based on our confidence in our ability to manage tariffs and other cost pressures, our expected improved relative market share performance in the back half of the year. our strong boiler sales in the first half of 2025, we have raised our full year sales outlook from flat to 2% to an increase of 1% to 3% compared to last year. We continue to expect our North America segment margin will be between 24% and 24.5%, and Rest of World segment margin will be between 8% and 9%.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. As I reflect on my last 16 months, there were several things that led me to join the company in March 2024. And I found that those first impressions have proven to be accurate. First, the company's dedication to its foundational values and doing business the right way, the Smith way, strongly resonates with me. Second, the genuine commitment of the entire global team to a strong culture of collaboration and innovation. Third, the quality of our businesses where we are a leader in the markets that we serve with a strong, trusted and enduring customer relationships. Our core North America water heater and boiler businesses provide a resilient base with stable 80% to 85% replacement rates, strong cash generation and attractive regulation-driven growth tailwind. And fourth, an amazing set of strategic opportunities that we can lean into to build our bright future.\nAs I now step into the CEO role, I'd like to highlight a few areas that my leadership team and I are focused on that I believe will play an important role in creating value at A. O. Smith as we go forward. First, operational excellence, we will remain focused on accelerating productivity and the elimination of waste through the expansion of our AOS operating system. While A. O. Smith already has a great foundational culture of continuous improvement on the plant floor, I believe we can benefit from a renewed focus on the application of lean principles not only to our manufacturing processes, but to other processes as well. I have personal experience both in deploying and running a number of operating systems in my career. And I believe the opportunity to expand our thinking of end-to-end processes and waste elimination can even further improve the operational and working capital efficiencies of our company.\nAn example of our focus on this operational discipline is our initiative this year to work with our customers to smooth our production schedules in our plants, which we discussed earlier. I also see technology playing a big role in helping us achieve new levels of productivity going forward. Both leveraging those technology investments we have already made more effectively and investing in new technologies to help us advance the way we work. We are also going to build upon our great legacy of innovation at A. O. Smith. Our pipeline of innovative products is strong, and we have made a number of major investments to prepare for the future both in terms of regulatory and technology shifts. Included in this investment is the recent commissioning of our brand-new product development center in Lebanon, Tennessee.\nEarlier, I shared some of the exciting new products we are introducing this year as examples of our powerful innovation capability. There is still much more we can do and I look forward to the opportunity to advance A.O. Smith's innovation capability to the next level. I am pleased to announce that Dr. Ming Cheng joined the company earlier this month as our next Chief Technology Officer. I worked with him for over 10 years at 3M and developed great respect for his leadership, business sense, technical expertise and great curiosity, all important attributes for an innovation leader. I'm confident that Ming will help us achieve this next level of innovation capability.\nThe third focus area I would like to mention is portfolio management. making sure that A. O. Smith is positioned well with a portfolio of businesses and products for future success. The assessment of the China business as well as the restructuring actions we took in China and North America water treatment last year, are consistent with my commitment to continually evaluate our portfolio and take the actions necessary to position them well for profitable growth. M&A and strategic partnerships to build out our business platforms will likely be a critical lever to enable this portfolio of work. And we have ample dry powder and management focus to help deploy it for the right targets. I look forward to sharing more information about these priorities as we lean into them and drive them forward to create value for A.O. Smith.\nMoving to Slide 12. In conclusion, as we continue to navigate the tariff landscape and pursue our long-term strategic investments, I am pleased with our team's second quarter performance. We executed well both responding to a number of uncertain factors in North America with agility and discipline and resetting the business in China to address the ongoing challenging market environment. These actions have allowed us to continue to make sequential margin improvement in both the North America and Rest of World segments. We continue to see strong growth momentum in areas where we are expecting growth performance, including the North America boiler and India businesses as well as the prioritized channels in the North America water treatment business. In both our margin improvement and growth efforts, I would like to thank all my A.O. Smith colleagues for your dedication and delivery.\nWe also believe the strategic actions we are taking are positioning us well for the future. Leveraging the AOS operating system, reenergizing innovation and driving our portfolio forward will be key to our success. And I am pleased to see our leadership team rallying around these priorities. Our strong market leadership, recurring revenue from our core water heater and boiler businesses and our solid balance sheet enable us to invest strategically and maximize shareholder return even in the face of uncertainty. We are confident in our future and our proven ability to achieve profitable growth. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Smith Corporation's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Jonathan, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Shafer, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nWithin today's presentation, we have provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations plus capital expenditures. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and our website. A firmly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we just described in this morning's press release, among others.\nAlso, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com. I will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning. Before I review our first quarter performance, I'd like to take a moment to highlight our recent announcement that Steve will assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer effective July 1. Over the past year, Steve has worked closely with me and our leadership team to deepen his understanding of our business identify opportunities to enhance performance and drive growth. I have full confidence in his ability to lead A.O. Smith and advance our position as a global water technology leader. As we have throughout this process, we will continue to ensure a smooth CEO transition over the next 2 months. I'll remain actively engaged as Executive Chairman of the Board continue to support the company's strategic direction.\nNow turning to Slide 4 and our financial performance. Our team delivered a solid performance in the first quarter with volumes tracking our expectations. I'm pleased with our sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. As anticipated, North America segment sales declined by 2% as higher boiler sales were more than offset by lower water heater volumes. As a reminder, we had a very strong first quarter in 2024 for water heating, creating a challenging year-over-year comparison.\nRest of World sales were essentially flat compared to last year. And China third-party sales declined 4% in local currency, reflecting ongoing economic weakness and soft consumer demand. In the quarter, we repurchased $121 million of our shares front loading a portion of our full year 2025 repurchase outlook of $400 million. Please turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales declined 4% in the first quarter driven by lower volumes. First quarter 2024 shipments benefited from prebuy related volumes ahead of an announced price increase, a favorable commercial gas mix. In contrast, 2025 volumes reflect a more normalized annual cadence. One of our key initiatives for 2025 is to level low production across the year to ensure optimal plant efficiencies. We have maintained our planned production schedule despite stronger recent order rates, which appear to be in response to our announced price increases. Working closely with our customers, we are managing orders based on historical order rates have adjusted lead times accordingly. We are continuing to monitor the situation closely.\nOur North America boiler sales increased by 10% compared to the first quarter of 2024 and as our high-efficiency commercial boilers continue to outperform the market. North America water treatment sales increased slightly in the first quarter as growth in our priority channels e-commerce, dealer and direct-to-consumer offset retail declines as we intentionally shift focus away from that channel. We are pleased with first quarter profitability which is tracking in line with the full year 250 basis point improvement we discussed during January's call. In China, first quarter third-party sales decreased 4% in local currency. Higher sales of electric water heaters and commercial water treatment products were more than offset by lower volumes of residential water treated products and gas water heaters. Margin improved by 200 basis points in the quarter driven by ongoing cost control efforts and benefits from our 2024 restructuring initiatives. I'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. We delivered sales of $964 million in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 2% year-over-year and earnings were $0.95 per share. A decrease of 5% compared to the prior period. Please turn to Slide 6. First quarter sales in the North America segment were $749 million, decreased 2% compared to a tough comp last year. Higher boiler sales were more than offset by lower volumes of water heaters. North America segment earnings of $185 million decreased 7% compared to last year. Segment margin was 24.7%, a decrease of 120 basis points year-over-year. The lower segment earnings and segment margin were primarily driven by higher boiler sales that were more than offset by lower water heater volumes, lower volume-related absorption and continued strategic investments, including tankless. .\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $227 million were essentially flat to last year, including sales from the Pureit acquisition of $12 million. China third-party sales decreased 4% on a constant currency basis. Lower sales in China were offset by the addition of Pureit. Rest of the World segment earnings of $20 million increased 15% compared to segment earnings in 2024 as expense management offset lower sales in China. Segment operating margin was 8.7%, an increase of 110 basis points compared to last year, driven by strong margin improvement in China. Pureit will be a margin headwind in the near term as we focus on integration.\nTurning to Slide 8. We generated operating cash flow of $39 million and free cash flow of $17 million during the first 3 months of 2025. And which is lower than the same period in 2024, but is in line with historical first quarter cash flow, which typically is our lowest cash-generating quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower accounts receivable collections as a result of higher sales in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 as well as lower year-over-year earnings. Our cash balance totaled $200 million at the end of March, and our net debt position was $70 million. Our leverage ratio was 12.7% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nI'll turn to Slide 9. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. We repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock in the first 3 months of 2025 for a total of $121 million, an increase over the same period last year as we increased our planned repurchase intentions from $306 million in the full year of 2024 to approximately $400 million of shares for the full year of 2025. We also weighted our share repurchases more heavily in the first quarter. Relative to our full year outlook as we opportunistically bought shares during the quarter. We continue to cultivate an active acquisition pipeline and have adequate dry powder available for the right acquisition. As always, we remain focused on transactions that meet our financial metrics and expand shareholder value.\nPlease turn to Slide 10 and our 2025 earnings guidance and outlook. We maintain our 2025 EPS outlook with an expected range of $3.60 and $3.90 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range is slightly higher than our 2024 adjusted EPS. We maintain our outlook on what has been a backdrop of uncertainty in tariff-related cost increases to our business. The tariff-related impacts that we considered in maintaining our outlook are based on what has been announced as of today. While our manufacturing footprint supports our in country for country business model, our supply chain costs are impacted by not only our direct import components but also our suppliers' footprint and import strategies. We have confidence in our manufacturing and supply chain strategy and execution as well as our suppliers' ability to manage in uncertain times.\nIn a moment, Steve will discuss the actions we have taken to mitigate the tariff impact, including pricing, expense management, supply chain and manufacturing initiatives. We have included the following key assumptions in our outlook. Due to the uncertainty of the tariff environment, we have considered within maintaining EPS guidance but excluded from our sales guidance, the impact of announced tariffs and related offsetting actions. Based on the current announced tariffs, which could change in the future, we estimate that annual impact could increase our total cost of goods sold by approximately 6% to 8%, exclusive of mitigation efforts. Our guidance assumes that our annual steel and other input costs, exclusive of tariffs will be similar to last year. This includes our projection that steel will increase in the second half of the year. We estimate that our 2025 CapEx will be between $90 million and $100 million as we continue to invest in engineering capabilities and prepare for the upcoming regulatory changes. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $500 million and $550 million. Interest expense is projected to be between $15 million and $20 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $75 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% to 24.5%. And and we project our outstanding diluted shares would be $142 million at the end of 2025.\nI'll now turn the call over to Steve, who will provide more color around tariffs, our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2025 on Slides 10 and 11. Steve?\n\nStephen M. Shafer\n\nPresident & COO\n\nThank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. First of all, I would like to take a brief moment to let you all know how honored I am to be announced as the next CEO of A.O. Smith effective July 1. It is a real privilege to be able to work with my dedicated and capable colleagues to help lead this iconic company into the future. I would also like to thank Kevin and his leadership and commitment to the company over the last 30-plus years and for the trust and confidence that both you and the board have put in me.\nAs Chuck mentioned, there is still uncertainty around tariffs. And while we are largely in country for countries, our business is impacted by the changing tariff environment as we have certain components that are globally sourced. We have mobilized cross-functional tariff response teams across our businesses to identify tariffs and supply chain-related risks and to develop action plans to mitigate those risks. These teams meet regularly to address the evolving tariff impacts on each of our businesses to ensure that we continue meeting the needs of our customers while taking action to mitigate tariff-related costs. In North America, in response to tariff cost increases as well as higher steel and other input costs, we have announced price increases of an average range of 6% to 9% on most of our water heater products. We have also announced price increases on our other product categories.\nBecause of the uncertainty of the tariff environment, we have not included in our announced pricing in our top line guidance. In addition to pricing, other mitigating actions include footprint optimization, strategic sourcing and other cost containment measures. Assuming the current tariffs go into effect as announced, we expect to begin seeing the benefits of our pricing actions by the end of the second quarter, while we are already experiencing tariff impacts as we enter the second quarter. In North America, the majority of our residential water heaters and all of our boilers and commercial water heaters are manufactured in the United States.\nApproximately 15% of our residential tank water heaters are produced in our Juarez, Mexico facility and our USMCA compliant. As previously planned, the production of our recently launched gas tankless products is being transitioned from our China facility to our recently completed tankless facility in Juarez. We are taking action to accelerate the transition given the current tariff environment.\nKey assumptions in topline outlook include the following: our projection that 2025 residential and commercial industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year, which is unchanged. In China, we believe the economy remains challenged with low consumer confidence and a weak real estate market. While we see the stimulus programs as positive, we expect the program to act more as a stabilizer in the market as opposed to a meaningful catalyst for growth. We have not changed our full year 2025 outlook and continue to project that our sales in China will decrease 5% to 8% in local currency. Our forecast assumes that the currency translation impacts will be minimal in 2025. We anticipate that our restructuring program in China will be substantially complete by the end of the second quarter. and we continue to expect to realize annual savings of approximately $15 million.\nAs a result, China operating margin is projected to be in the 8% to 10% range for 2025, even with lower volumes. I feel confident that our restructuring actions position us well for the market today and also to realize the benefits when the Chinese economy improves. We remain cautious about the near-term market outlook, including the level of sustainable impact from the appliance discount trading program. but we are pleased with how our China team continues to manage the challenging environment and maintain our premium brand position. We project our North America boiler sales will increase between 3% and 5% in 2025. While we are very pleased with our first quarter growth of 10%, we believe we may have benefited from a minimal amount of prebuy from price increases to be implemented in the second quarter. We are also cautious around the back half of the year and are monitoring the commercial market closely. We have not changed our guidance that North America water treatment sales will decline approximately 5% in 2025 and as we deemphasize the less profitable retail channel. We are pleased to see the strong start to the year in our priority channels and are looking to build on that momentum. We continue to project an operating margin expansion of approximately 250 basis points in 2025 North American water treatment business.\nWe expect the additional period will add approximately $50 million in the sales in 2025 and will not have a significant bottom line contribution this year as we work through the integration of this business. As I have noted, based on the significant volatility in the tariff landscape, we maintain our sales growth expectation of a range of flat to up 2%, pending further clarification on tariffs as we move through 2025. We expect our North American segment margin to be between 24% and 24.5% and Rest of World segment margin to be between 8% and 9%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. While we expect 2025 to be a year of muted bottom line growth as we navigate the volatile tariff landscape and continue to support our long-term strategic investments. As Kevin noted, we are pleased with our team's first quarter performance. I was particularly pleased with the following: our manufacturing execution as well as the steps taken to level load production and work with customers to manage order fluctuation caused by pricing actions. Our cost containment actions, which resulted in nearly flat SG&A spend in the first quarter compared to first quarter last year. That included increased SG&A expenses as a result of inflation and our Pureit acquisition.\nOur boiler sales growth of 10% in the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of growth for this category. Encouraging North American water heater sales, which, while lower relative to a tough comp last year, grew over 10% compared to the previous quarter. Both North America water treatment and China's profit improvement actions. We are on track to meet margin improvement goals through cost management and the benefits of restructuring. During the quarter, we also cut the ribbon and opened our world-class commercial R&D testing lab facility, Lebanon, Tennessee. This facility leverages our product development and engineering talent in one location, focused on continuing to drive our leadership in commercial water heating employers. And lastly, but very important to us. For the second year in a row, A.O. Smith was recognized as one of the world's most ethical companies by [ Ethno ] sphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. Living our values and doing business the right way is always front and center to how we operate, and it is great validation to be recognized by [ Ethno ] sphere.\nWe have confidence in our ability to navigate the volatile 2025 metro environment. Our leadership position in all the markets that we serve, the stable recurring revenue provided by our core water heater and boiler businesses and our strong balance sheet allow us to continue to invest in ourselves, make attractive strategic acquisitions and maximize shareholder return even in times of uncertainty. As always, we are in close communication with our suppliers, customers and other stakeholders as we navigate the challenging environment. We are deploying diligent cost management actions across our businesses. to ensure that we maximize profitability during this time of cost volatility. We are committed to leading the industry forward and are confident that we will continue to build our long history of innovation and proven ability to drive profitable growth. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning. First, I'd like to start off by saying that I'm pleased to have Steve Schaffer joining us on the call today. Steve joined A.O. Smith in March of last year, has spent the last 10 months getting to know our business, people, customers and operations.\nHis global leadership experience and strategic acumen have brought a valuable perspective to our business as we continue to create value for our key stakeholders. I'm pleased to have Steve as a member of our leadership team.\nTurning to Slide 4 and our financial performance. After a record 2023, our sales and earnings decreased in 2024. In North America, sales increased slightly as higher boiler and water treatment sales as well as water heater pricing benefits were offset by lower heater volumes. We experienced lower sales in China as a weak economy continued to negatively impact consumer demand, which led to a 4% price decrease in our Rest of World segment local currency third-party sales.\nOur legacy Indian business sales grew 13% in Vulcan currency in 2024, which is approximately 2x the market. We closed the Pure acquisition in the fourth quarter, which had a minimal impact on sales and earnings. With the strong business climate and the addition of Pureit, we continue to be excited about the long-term prospects of our India business. We returned $496 million of capital to shareholders with our dividend and share repurchases.\nAnd also in the fourth quarter, we completed construction of our tankless manufacturing facility. We put into action a strategy to improve the margin profile of our North America water treatment business. We began the process of reorganizing our China business to reduce costs and position us for profitable growth as the economy returns, and we announced our new sustainability goal of a reduction in water usage of 40 million gallons of water by 2030.\nThis goal follows our previously announced and already achieved 10% greenhouse gas emission reduction goal. Please turn to Slide 5. We North America water heater sales decreased 1% in 2024 as pricing benefits were more than offset by lower volumes. We saw strong shipments in the first half of the year, which were then balanced out by lower second half as volumes were below our expectations. We project full year residential industry unit volumes were roughly flat to 2023. We are confident in our stable retail and wholesale customer base, strong partnerships and competitive products. Based on customer conversations and certain stocking programs that we track, we believe our customers enter 2025 with water heater inventories in a normal to position.\nDuring 2024, residential new construction and replacement demand were resilient compared to 2023. We believe commercial industry unit shipments increased marginally year-over-year driven by growth in commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons. We project industry commercial gas units were down 3% to 4% in 2024.\nAs a reminder, commercial gas has an average selling price of approximately 3x that of commercial electric units and therefore, impacting our results more meaningful than the commercial electric growth. Our North America boiler business performed as expected and sales increased 8% compared to 2023, led by an CREST commercial boiler with Hellcat technology as well as our night FTXL, one of our commercial boilers that was impacted by the 2023 channel inventory destocking.\nWe are pleased with our 2024 boiler performance and with our market share growth in that category. North America water treatment sales grew 10% in 2024, largely driven by acquisition-related geographic expansion. We saw growth in our dealer, direct-to-consumer and e-commerce channel that were partially offset by lower sales in the retail channel. We have taken action to rebalance our product portfolio and improve profitability.\nIn the fourth quarter, we took a restructuring and impairment charge of $6 million to allow us to focus on the more competitive and financially attractive channels of the business. In China, full year third-party sales decreased 6% in local currency as a result of a weaker economy and soft consumer demand, particularly in the second half of the year. Higher sales of kitchen products were more than offset by lower volumes of our core water heater and water treatment products.\nIn the fourth quarter, we took a restructuring charge of $11 million. The actions taken to reduce costs by optimizing our business structure to better position us for profitable growth when the economy improves. In the fourth quarter, the appliance trained stimulus program generated increased demand for our products relative to the third quarter. This increased cell demand helped our customers reduce their inventory levels and improve working capital.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our full year and fourth quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. We delivered sales of $3.8 billion in 2024, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. higher boiler and water treatment sales and the benefits of pricing actions were more than offset by lower water heater volumes in North America as well as lower sales in China. 2024 adjusted earnings were $3.73 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $3.81 per share in 2023.\nTurning to Slide 6. Full year sales in the North America segment of $3 billion increased slightly compared to 2023. Pricing actions and higher boiler and water treatment sales were offset by lower volumes of water heaters. North America adjusted segment earnings of $714 million decreased 2% compared with 2023. Adjusted segment margin was 24.2% and a decrease of 60 basis points year-over-year. The lower adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily driven by pricing benefits and higher boiler and water treatment sales that were more than offset by lower water heater volumes and continued strategic investments.\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $919 million decreased 4% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $13 million primarily related to China. Segment third-party sales decreased 4% on a constant currency basis. Our sales decrease was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen products that were more than offset by lower sales of water heater and water treatment products in China.\nIndia sales grew 13% in local currency in 2024 and due to strong market demand for our premium products. Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $76 million decreased 24% compared to segment earnings in 2023, and primarily due to lower sales in China. Adjusted segment margin was 8.3%, a decrease of 210 basis points compared to 2023.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. Turning to fourth quarter performance. We delivered sales of $912 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher boiler and water treatment sales and the benefits of pricing actions that were more than offset by lower water heater volumes in North America and lower sales in China.\nAdjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.85 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $0.97 per share in the fourth quarter of 2023. Please turn to Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in the North America segment were $690 million, a 7% decrease compared to sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of higher boiler and water treatment sales as well as benefits of pricing actions that were more than offset by lower water heating cost.\nNorth America adjusted segment earnings of $154 million decreased 11% compared to 2023. Adjusted operating margin of 22.4% decreased 110 basis points compared to last year. The lower adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily due to the lower water heater volumes that were partially offset by pricing benefits and lower material costs.\nMoving to Slide 10. Fourth quarter Rest of the World segment sales of $237 million decreased 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower sales in China. India sales grew 11% in local currency in 2024 compared to 2023. Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings was $19 million and an adjusted segment margin of 8.1% were lower than 2023 adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin of $30 million and 11.5%, respectively. The decreases were primarily due to lower sales in China.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. We generated free cash flow of $474 million during 2024, lower than 2023, primarily driven by lower earnings and higher inventory balances that were partially offset by lower accounts receivable balances. 2024 free cash flow conversion was 89%. Excluding the impact of the higher capital spending for investments we are making in 2024, our free cash flow conversion was 95%.\nOur cash balance totaled $276 million at the end of December, and our net cash position was $83 million. Our leverage ratio was 9.3% as valued by total debt to total capital.\nLet's now turn to Slide 12. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. In addition to the strategic acquisitions we made in 2024 to grow our domestic and global water treatment footprint -- we also increased investments in our business to ensure that we have the right product portfolio and capacity to continue strengthening our position as a leader across all the markets that we serve and providing the most value for our shareholders.\nEarlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share. We have increased our dividend for over 30 consecutive years. We've repurchased approximately 3.8 million shares of common stock in 2024 for a total of $306 million. We continue our strong track record of delivering returns to shareholders.\nOver the last 2 years, we have returned almost $1 billion to shareholders through our dividends and share repurchases.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 and our 2025 earnings guidance and outlook. Our 2025 outlook includes an expected EPS range of $3.60 to $3.90 per share. The midpoint of the EPS range is slightly higher than our 2024 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that steel prices in the full year 2025 will be similar to 2024 and that steel cost in the back half of the year will increase from where they are today. We project that our 2025 nonsteel materials and freight costs will be roughly flat to 2024.\nWe project the launch of our tankless products, including tariffs in place today and higher shipping and other costs will be a headwind of approximately 50 basis points to our North America margins. We estimate that 2025 CapEx will be between $90 million and $100 million, a decrease compared to 2024, but higher than our historical CapEx as we continue to invest in our engineering capabilities and prepare for upcoming regulatory changes.\nWe expect to generate free cash flow of between $500 million and $550 million. Interest expense is projected to be between $15 million and $20 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $75 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% to 24.5%. Our Board has approved 5 million additional shares of stock for repurchase, and we expect to repurchase approximately $400 million of our shares of stock higher than previous years as we have confidence in our strong free cash flow generation, and we believe our shares have been undervalued in recent months. We project our outstanding diluted shares will be $142 million at the end of 2025.\nOur outlook does not assume a change in tariffs for China, Mexico or Canada, potential increase in China tariffs would temporarily negatively impact us with regard to our gas tankless imports from our facility in Nanjing until that production is fully transitioned to Juarez, Mexico. Our North America manufacturing footprint largely based in the U.S., gives us flexibility to competitively navigate potential future tariffs, which may impact trade between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.\nI'll now turn the call over to Steve, who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2025, while still staying on Slide 13. Steve?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing our outlook on 2025, I wanted to start by briefly sharing some early thoughts on my first 10 months with A.O. Smith. First and foremost, I've been impressed with the culture of how we do things at A.O. Smith. We are laser focused on doing business the right way and ethical way smooth play. We also have a strong culture of innovation, collaboration, people development and driving performance that is a great fit to my own personal leadership style.\nAs I've gotten to know our business better, we clearly have a portfolio of strong businesses in markets that we know well, with very close customer partnerships and industry-leading products. This positions us well to help lead the industry forward through future changes, disruptions and opportunities. I am energized and confident in the opportunities in front of us that first drew me to join this great leadership team.\nNow turning to our 2025 guidance. While I'm positive about the future positioning of our business, as Chuck highlighted in our guidance, we expect 2025 to be another year of relatively muted growth on both the top and bottom lines. Our outlook is influenced by a relatively flat industry growth expectation in our core North America water heater and boiler markets, while we expect to continue facing a soft market environment in China.\nWe are also taking some portfolio actions that will reduce growth in North America water treatment in the short term but will better position our business going forward. On the bottom line, we anticipate the near-term benefits of our restructuring and realignment actions to be mostly offset in 2025 by the continued strategic investments we are making to launch and scale innovative new products in support of our North America water heating and boiler business.\nThese investments will help ensure profitable growth over the long term and build upon our market leadership. Our top line outlook includes the following assumptions. We believe that U.S. new home construction remains in a deficit and that new construction and proactive replacement will be similar to 2024.\nBased on those factors, we project that 2025 residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes to also be flat to 2024 as demand for our commercial electric products, greater than 55 gallons has returned to pre 2022 levels.\nIn addition, our outlook includes carryover from our March 2024 price increases in North America, up 4% on most of our water heater products and 8% on heat pumps. In China, we believe the economy remains challenged with low consumer confidence in a weak real estate market. While we see the stimulus programs as a positive, we think it will take time to see real fundamental signs of recovery.\nAs a result, we project that our sales in China will decrease 5% to 8% in local currency in 2025 as the decline in consumer demand that we experienced in the second half of 2024 carries over into 2025. Our forecast assumes that the currency translation impact will be minimal in 2025. We anticipate that our restructuring program in China will be mostly implemented by the second quarter and we expect to realize annual savings of approximately $15 million. This would result in a recovery of operating margins to the 8% to 10% range for 2025, even with lower volumes.\nI have worked closely with the team and feel confident the actions being taken will better position us to compete in the more mature and more competitive market environment while still positioning us well to realize the benefits when the Chinese economy improves. While we are cautious about the near-term market outlook, including the level of sustainable impact from the appliance discount trading program, we remain confident in our team in China.\nWe project our North American boiler sales will grow between 3% to 5% in 2025. We expect to continue benefiting from the transition to higher energy-efficient boilers particularly as commercial buildings look to improve their overall carbon footprint. We expect North America water treatment sales to be between $235 million to $245 million, a decrease of approximately 5%, as we execute a reprioritization of our business to more competitive and profitable channels and products, supported by our announced restructuring. We project this shift will drive an operating margin expansion of approximately 250 basis points in 2025 for the North American water treatment business.\nI am personally excited about the potential of the water treatment space in North America for A. O. Smith and believe the actions being taken by the team to focus on the most attractive opportunities will position us well going forward. We project mid-teens top line growth in our legacy India business as we continue to build out the A.O. Smith water franchise in this attractive market.\nWe expect the addition of Pureit will add approximately USD 15 million in sales in 2025. We do not expect Pure to have a significant bottom line contribution in 2025 as we work through the integration of this business. Based on these 2025 assumptions, we expect top line growth to be flat to up 2%. We expect our North America segment margin to be between 24% and 24.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be between 8% and 9%.\nAs we exit 2024 and move into 2025, our commitment remains steadfast to lead the industry forward and support our customers. We are confident that our innovation and infrastructure investments position our business for profitable growth. We remain committed to driving the following top investment priorities from 2024 into 2025 to maintain this momentum. Our continued investment in the launch and scale up of the Adapt gas tankless water heater with X3 scale prevention technology. We are on schedule to introduce 2 additional tankless products to round out the product line in the first half of 2025.\nWhile there is a headwind to profitability today as we launched with production in China and then transfer production to Juarez, Mexico, we firmly believe that our gas tankless product line sets us off for long-term success in this product category. Also, our near completed investment in world-class commercial R&D testing and lab facility and Lumina, Tennessee.\nThe new center will house our commercial water heater and boiler engineers, where they will focus on the continued innovation of our commercial water heating and boiler portfolio. The collaboration and powerful exchange of ideas coming from this new facility will ensure that we continue to have leading-edge products, including heat pump technology for today and into the future.\nAnd finally, our ongoing manufacturing capacity investments to serve the market as regulatory changes in federal, state and local incentives drive demand higher for specific technologies. We have increased production of commercial heat pump water heaters and doubled our residential heat pump water heater capacity to meet this growing demand. We are also increasing our capacity to produce high-efficiency condensing water heaters.\nTo sum up, while we expect some of the market challenges in China to continue and we anticipate growth headwinds in the first half of the year for the North American water heating business as we faced tough comps against last year's order pattern, we remain confident in our future. The investments we are making in our capacity footprint, our engineering capability and our product portfolio have us positioned well for the environment ahead, including any tariff or regulatory uncertainties.\nAdditionally, the restructuring actions we have announced today will support our future growth and create more space for investments in more attractive space. A.O. Smith has a long history of managing through many economic cycles and uncertainties, and this proven experience will continue to serve us well. While there are growth headwinds in 2025, our leadership position in all of the markets that we serve, our stable 80% to 85% replacement business in water heaters and boilers and our strong balance sheet allow us to continue to invest in our business, make attractive strategic acquisitions and maximize shareholder return.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Welcome to the 2024 Second Quarter A. O. Smith Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Marvin. Good morning, and welcome to the A.O. Smith Second Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations plus capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses, exclude the impact of pension settlement income and restructuring and impairment expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investors.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4 and our second quarter results. I'm very pleased with our second quarter performance and how we are tracking for the year. In the second quarter, our global A.O. Smith team delivered record quarterly sales of $1 billion and EPS of $1.06, a 5% increase over 2023 adjusted EPS. North American water heater and boiler sales increased 10% due to higher volumes and pricing action. China third-party sales grew 2% in local currency. India achieved double-digit growth in local currency for the tenth consecutive quarter. And last week, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Pureit, a leading water purification business in South Asia. We look forward to welcoming the Pureit team to the A. O. Smith family later this year.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales grew 10% in the second quarter due to higher residential and commercial volumes and pricing actions. We began shipping our internally developed and manufactured gas tankless products in the quarter, and we are very pleased with market acceptance. Our North America boiler sales grew 10% compared to the second quarter of last year, driven by higher commercial volumes. I am pleased to see a return to growth as channel inventory levels normalize. We are on track to achieve our boiler sales forecast of 8% to 10% for the year.\nSales of our commercial boilers, particularly our CREST boilers with Hellcat technology continue to outperform the market. North America water treatment sales increased 8% in 2024 as acquisition-related dealer sales increases were partially offset by weakness in the retail channel.\nIn China, second quarter third-party sales increased 2% in local currency as a result of sales of kitchen products as well as HVAC products that were partially offset by lower volumes of residential water treatment. While markets for our core products remain challenged, we are pleased with our market share in the premium portion of the water heater and water treatment product categories. However, we have seen pricing and promotion pressures, particularly in the mid-price sector of the market.\nI'm now on Slide 6. This year, we are celebrating our 150th anniversary. It's a time to reflect on those 150 years of living our values of achieving profitable growth, emphasizing innovation, preserving our good name, being a good place to work and being a good citizen. It is also gratifying to be recognized for the continuation of those values.\nSo far in 2024, our team has received several honors that reflect our employees' dedication to our core values. Earlier this year, A. O. Smith was named one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. In addition, our commitment to innovation and energy management has resulted in our Nanjing China plant being selected as one of the 2024 Nanjing Environment Protection model enterprises, in recognition of our waste and emission reduction efforts.\nWe also received a 2024 ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Partner of the Year Award from the EPA for the sixth year in a row, for our long-term commitment to energy management through our products. In addition, we were named 2024 U.S. News Best Companies to Work for in Manufacturing by U.S. News & World Report. While the reward is the satisfaction our team receives for doing the right thing and living our values. These owners validate our values as a differentiator for our employees and stakeholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Second quarter sales in the North America segment were $791 million, a 9% increase compared with 2023, driven by higher water heater and boiler volumes as well as year-over-year pricing actions. North America segment earnings of $198 million, increased 2% compared with 2023 adjusted segment revenues. The higher segment earnings were primarily driven by increased volumes and pricing that were partially offset by higher steel costs and higher selling expenses to support our growth initiatives, including the launch of our gas tankless products. Segment margin was 25.1%, a decrease of 180 basis points year-over-year. The lower segment margin was due to the reasons I reviewed with regard to segment earnings, which more than offset higher volumes in the quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $245 million were essentially flat to last year and included unfavorable currency translation of approximately $7 million, primarily related to China as well as intersegment sales associated with recently launched tankless water heaters. Segment third-party sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis. The increase was partially driven by higher sales of kitchen and HVAC products, partially offset by lower sales of residential water treatment products in China.\nIndia sales grew 16% in local currency in the quarter, driven by growth in both water heater and water treatment categories with particular strength in our e-commerce, retail and commercial end markets. Rest of the World segment earnings of $26 million decreased slightly compared to segment earnings in 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable product mix and sales promotions in China. Third-party segment operating margin was 11.5%, slightly lower than segment margin in 2023.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $119 million during the first half of 2024, a decrease from the same period last year primarily as a result of higher inventory and accounts receivable balance as well as higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits last year, which more than offset higher earnings and higher trade payable balances.\nCapital expenditures increased $21 million year-over-year driven by our expansion projects. Our cash balance totaled $233 million at the end of June and our net cash position was $93 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.8% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we signed an agreement last week to acquire Pureit from Unilever for $120 million. Pureit offers a broad range of residential water purification solutions and has annual sales of approximately USD 60 million primarily in India. The addition of Pureit strengthens our leadership position as a global supplier of premium water treatment products and will double our market penetration in South Asia. The acquisition will also support our corporate strategy by enhancing our premium product portfolio and distribution footprint.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We narrowed our 2024 EPS outlook to an expected range of $3.95 to $4.10 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range has not changed and represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including; our guidance assumes that our steel costs in the full year 2024 will be roughly flat to 2023, our outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024 as they were in 2023, our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment similar to what we experienced throughout 2023.\nWe began shipping our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products in the second quarter. These products are being manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points in 2024. The tariff will be eliminated when production moves to Juarez, Mexico.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million, an increase over the last several years due to our capacity expansion projects, including our gas tankless facility in Juarez, expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee and adding high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity ahead of the 2026 regulatory changes.\nWe expect to generate free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of our shares of stock resulting in outstanding diluted shares of 147 million at the end of 2024.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024 while staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We reaffirm our outlook that 2024 sales will grow 3% to 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. Our outlook includes previously announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% on most of our water heater products. Price [indiscernible] for heat pump products is 8%. We began to see realization of the price increases in the second quarter.\nWe believe that a pre-buy ahead of the price increases pulled forward some demand in the first half of the year for both residential and commercial water heaters. We have seen some softness in our orders in July. Due to normal seasonality in the pre-buy, we maintain our projection that 2024 U.S. residential industry unit volumes to be flat to last year. Our projection that U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will increase low single digits in 2024 is also unchanged. Our outlook assumes that new residential home construction and product replacement will remain at levels similar to last year.\nIn China, we believe the economy and consumer confidence remain weak. We continue to see headwinds in consumer demand. While we are cautious about the second half of the year, we maintain our 2024 third-party sales growth guidance to be between 0% and 3% in local currency. Our forecast assumes a negative currency translation impact of approximately 2% for the year.\nWe reaffirm that we expect our boiler sales to grow 8% to 10% over last year. Our sales growth guidance for North America water treatment of an increase of 8% to 10% is also unchanged. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be approximately 25%. And the Rest of World third-party segment margin to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. We are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024. We saw strong growth in water heaters in the first half of the year, which we believe was partially driven by the prebuy. We are pleased to see a return to growth in our North America boiler business as channel inventory levels normalize and we continue to benefit from the transition to higher energy efficiency boilers, particularly in commercial applications.\nOur 3 capital expansion projects that will add capacity for key product categories in North America are on track and will position us well for long-term growth. India remains on track for another year of projected double-digit sales growth, and we're excited to complete the Pureit acquisition later this year. which will double our sales in the South Asia region, Pureit's strong brand and strength in the e-commerce channel will complement our premium brand will make us the #3 residential water treatment company in India.\nEven as we celebrate our 150th anniversary and a rich history of innovation with employees, customers and partners, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers and executing our key strategic priorities to advance our leadership position in heating and treating water around the globe.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by extending a warm welcome to Steve Shafer, who has recently joined A. O. Smith as our Chief Operating Officer. Steve is an accomplished business leader with deep global experience in manufacturing and leading innovative businesses. His strategic acumen and extensive global leadership experience will prove invaluable as we continue to focus on innovation and driving operational performance to enhance shareholder value.\nLet's now turn to the quarter on Slide 4. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered sales of $979 million in 2024 and EPS of $1, a 6% increase over 2023 adjusted EPS. North America sales increased 2% and segment margins increased 80 basis points due to a positive mix, higher commercial volumes and lower material costs principally steel. Our Rest of World segment sales grew 4%, recently introduced products in China contributed to the majority of the growth. In India, our sales grew 16% in local currency in the first quarter of 2024.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. We North America water heater sales grew 2% in the first quarter due to higher commercial volumes and a positive mix towards commercial gas and high-efficiency products, including heat pumps. Volumes were favorably influenced by our price increase effective March 1. However, year-over-year comps were somewhat muted by a strong first quarter 2023. Our North America order sales were flat compared to the first quarter of 2023. As a reminder, we do not begin to see the effects of the 2023 channel inventory destocking until the second quarter of last year.\nWe are pleased to see sales of our high-efficiency residential orders returned to more normalized levels in the first quarter of 2024. Sales of our CREST commercial borders with HealthCap technology increased over 30% in the quarter. North America water treatment sales grew 4% in 2024, driven by acquisition-related sales growth and pricing. Organic growth in the e-commerce and specialty wholesale channels were offset by softness in the direct-to-consumer and retail channels.\nIn China, first quarter third-party sales increased 6% in local currency. Our recently launched Kitchen products continue to be well received in the market and provide bundling opportunities that drive overall sales growth. Sales of HVAC systems which generally combined a combi boiler with the heat pump water heater increased 14% local currency in the quarter as well.\nI will now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. First quarter sales in the North America segment were $766 million, a 2% increase compared with 2023 driven by higher commercial volumes and the benefits of mix shift towards high-efficiency water heaters, including heat pumps.\nNorth America segment earnings of $199 million increased 5% compared with 2023. Segment margin was 25.9%, an increase of 80 basis points year-over-year. The higher segment earnings and margin were primarily driven by positive mix and lower material costs, partially offset by selling and advertising expenses in support of higher sales.\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $227 million increased 4% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $9 million primarily related to China. Segment third-party sales of $219 million increased 4% on a constant currency basis. The increase was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen and HVAC products in China. India sales increased 16% in local currency in the quarter, driven by growth in both water heating and water treatment with particular strength in our e-commerce and commercial end markets. Rest of the World segment earnings of $17 million decreased slightly compared to adjusted segment earnings in 2023, primarily due to sales promotions associated with new product introductions and product mix in China. Third-party segment operating margin was 7.9%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to adjusted segment margins in 2023.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. We generated free cash flow of $85 million during the first 3 months of 2024, a decrease from the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher incentive payments associated with record sales and profits last year and higher inventory levels that more than offset higher earnings and lower accounts payable balances. Capital expenditures increased $11 million year-over-year, driven by expansion projects. Our cash balance totaled $303 million at the end of March, and our net cash position was $183 million. Our leverage ratio was 6% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for investment in organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics as accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in 3 years. In the first quarter, we welcomed Impact Water products to the A. O. Smith family. Impact supports our growth strategy by expanding the West Coast presence of our water treatment business.\nPlease turn to Slide 10 in our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We reaffirm our 2024 EPS outlook of an expected range of $3.90 to $4.15 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that our steel costs in the full year 2024 will be a slight headwind compared to 2023. We project an increase in steel input costs in the second quarter of approximately 20% over the first quarter.\nOur full year steel input cost projection includes a slight decline in the steel price index in the second half of the year. Our outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024 as they were in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment, similar to what we've experienced throughout 2023. We introduced our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products earlier this year. These products will be manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. We expect customer shipments to begin later in the second quarter. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will negatively impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points when we begin to ship product. We are investing in manufacturing of Juarez, Mexico that will eliminate the tariff in the future.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $105 million and $115 million, an increase year-over-year due to capital -- the capacity expansion projects related to our gas tankless manufacturing facility at Juarez, expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee, and adding high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity to align with regulatory changes coming in 2026.\nWe expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $65 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% to 24.5% and we continue to expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of our shares of stock, resulting in our outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of the year.\nI will now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024, staying on Slide 13. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We reaffirm our outlook that 2024 sales will grow between 3% and 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. We maintain our projection that 2024 U.S. residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year after seeing a 6% growth in 2023. Our assumption projects that new home construction and proactive replacement remain at levels similar to last year.\nOur projection that U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes will increase low single digits in 2024 is unchanged. Our outlook includes the announced price increases in North America water heating of 4% on most of our water heater products. Price increase for heat pumps products is 8%. Our April orders are strong year-over-year as a result of resilient and demand in our management of prebuy orders. In China, we believe that the economy and consumer confidence remains weak. The real estate and housing markets are challenged.\nWe have not seen signs of improvement. Through March and April, we have seen headwinds in consumer demand. Given the continued weak economy and the softness we are seeing, we are lowering our 2024 third-party sales growth guidance in China to be flat to 3% up in local currency. Our forecast assumes a negative currency translation impact of approximately 1% for the year. We ended the second quarter with a strong backlog in our boiler business and reaffirm that we expect boiler sales to grow between 8% and 10% over last year.\nWe are revising our sales growth guidance for North America water treatment products from an increase of 10% to 12% to an increase of 8% to 10%. This reduction is a reflection of softness we are experiencing in our direct-to-consumer business, average order price in our retail channel, particularly for water softeners. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be approximately 25% and Rest of World third-party segment margin to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. We are pleased with our performance in early 2024. We had year-over-year growth in residential and commercial water heaters, along with a strong mix in the first quarter and we are pleased with our order rates we are seeing in this month. India is on track for another year of projected double-digit sales growth. During the quarter, we initiated three capital expansion projects that will add capacity for key product categories in North America.\nFirst, we broke ground on our tankless manufacturing facility in Juarez, which is on the same campus as our current residential water heater facility. Production in Juarez will improve logistics as well as eliminated tariff on products currently manufactured in our China facility. Production is targeted to begin in 2025. In addition, we launched our high-efficiency commercial gas water heater expansion in McBee, South Carolina. This expansion will increase our production capacity for our high-efficiency products, including our market-leading Cyclone product. As a reminder, Department of Energy Regulatory changes largely impacting commercial gas water heater efficiency levels will eliminate lower efficiency products from the market beginning in late 2026.\nFinally, in support of our R&D and product innovation within our commercial water heater and boiler markets, we have initiated the expansion of our 11 in Tennessee commercial lab and engineering test facility. The state-of-the-art facility will combine our commercial water engineering expertise under one roof and allow for cross-functional collaboration, particularly with mutual technologies like heat pump. We are in the early stages of all three projects, but we're off to a very good start. As always, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers as well as executing our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Smith's Fourth Quarter 2023. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the A.O. Smith's Full Year and Fourth Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of restructuring and impairment expenses, nonoperating noncash pension income and expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up for churn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4 and our full year results. 2023 was a record-setting sales and earnings year driven by resilient water heater demand and excellent execution by our team. North America sales increased 4% and adjusted segment margin increased 310 basis points due to higher water heater volumes and improved price cost relationship. Our Rest of World segment sales grew 4% in local currency as our recently introduced kitchen products in China were well received by the market.\nIn India, our sales grew 15% local currency in 2023 and benefited from sales of new products, which represented 30% of our sales. Free cash flow grew to $598 million, primarily driven by record profit. We returned $490 million of capital to shareholders with our dividend and share repurchases.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. Our global A. O. Smith team delivered record sales of $3.9 billion in 2023 and adjusted EPS of $3.81, a 21% increase over 2022. North America water heater sales grew 6% in 2023 due to strong demand for our residential and commercial water heater products. The residential unit industry demand increased approximately 6% compared to 2022, as new construction and proactive replacement demand remain resilient. Commercial industry units increased approximately 15% year-over-year as volume of commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons rebounded and aligned closer to pre-2022 levels.\nWe are pleased with our market share strength in both residential and commercial water heaters. Our North America boiler sales decreased 12% against a difficult comp of 28% growth in 2022. We worked down our backlog in 2022 after making significant production and supply chain improvements, which led to elevated channel inventories going into 2023. The resulting channel inventory destocking impacted our residential and small commercial boiler sales. Sales of our CREST commercial boilers with Hellcat technology increased over 50% in 2023.\nNorth America water treatment sales grew 2% in 2023 as higher sales and the e-commerce and direct-to-consumer channels were partially offset by lower sales in the wholesale and retail channels. Sales in the prior year benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved, and we worked down our order backlog, which resulted in elevated channel inventories in early 2023. In China, full year sales increased 4% in local currency. We are pleased with our performance in a continued weak economy. In addition to the successful launch of our kitchen products, we saw double-digit sales growth of our HVAC and commercial water treatment product categories.\nOur core water heating and water treating products also performed well as replacement approaches of residential water heater sales and residential water treatment sales, particularly consumables, remain resilient.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our full year and fourth quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. Full year sales in the North America segment rose to $2.9 billion, a 4% increase compared with 2022. Higher volumes of water heaters were partially offset by lower sales of boilers and pricing. North America segment earnings of $726 million increased 19% compared with 2022. Adjusted segment margin was 24.8%, an increase of 310 basis points year-over-year. The higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily driven by higher water heater volumes and lower material costs.\nMoving to Slide 7. Rest of the World segment sales of $957 million decreased 1% year-over-year, including unfavorable currency translation of $44 million, primarily related to China. Segment sales increased 4% on a constant currency basis. Our sales increase was primarily driven by higher sales of kitchen products and water treatment products in China. India sales grew 15% in local currency in 2023, which is approximately 3x the market. Rest of the World segment earnings of $99 million increased 3% compared to segment earnings in 2022, primarily due to higher sales in China. Adjusted segment operating margin was 10.4%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to 2022.\nPlease turn to Slide 8. Turning to fourth quarter performance, we delivered sales of $988 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, an increase of 6% year-over-year, led by higher water heater volumes in North America and higher kitchen product sales in China that more than offset lower boiler sales and pricing. Adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter were $0.97 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. Fourth quarter sales in the North America segment were $738 million, a 7% increase compared to sales in the fourth quarter of 2022, as a result of higher water heating volumes partially offset by lower boiler sales. North America segment adjusted earnings of $173 million increased 8% compared to 2022. Adjusted operating margin of 23.5% increased 20 basis points compared to last year. The higher adjusted segment earnings and adjusted segment margin were primarily due to higher water heater volumes.\nMoving on to Slide 10. Fourth quarter Rest of the World segment sales of $260 million increased 4% year-over-year primarily driven by sales of new products, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $3 million in China. India sales grew 11% in local currency in 2023, compared to 2022. Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $30 million decreased 6% compared to Q4 2022 segment earnings. An adjusted segment margin of 11.5% decreased 120 basis points compared to segment margin in the same period last year. The decreases were primarily due to promotions and advertising supporting the launch of our dishwasher and steam oven products in China.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. We generated free cash flow of $598 million during 2023, an increase of 86% over 2022, primarily driven by higher earnings and lower working capital [ lens ]. 2023 free cash flow conversion was 107%. Our cash balance totaled $363 million at the end of December our net cash position was $236 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.5% as measured by total debt to total capital.\nNow I'll turn to Slide 12. As we detailed at our Investor Day, in addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth, innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We target strategic acquisitions that meet our financial metrics of accretive to earnings in the first year and return our cost of capital in 3 years. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to continue to invest in ourselves through research and development and capital expansion while pursuing strategic acquisitions.\nEarlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. We have increased our dividend for over 30 consecutive years. We repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock in 2023 for a total of $307 million. We continue our strong track record of delivering return to shareholders. Over the last 2 years, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders through our dividends and share repurchases.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 and our 2024 earnings guidance and outlook. We are pleased to introduce our 2024 outlook with an expected EPS range of $3.90 and $4.15 per share. The midpoint of our EPS range represents an increase of 6% compared with 2023 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our guidance assumes that steel prices in 2024 will be a slight headwind compared to 2023. Relative to current steel prices, our projection includes a decline in steel price index in the second half of the year.\nOur outlook assumes non-steel material costs are similar in 2024, as they were in 2023. Our guidance also assumes a relatively stable supply chain environment, similar to what we experienced throughout 2023. We are monitoring the situation in the Red Sea and Panama down and currently have not experienced any negative impacts. We launched our internally designed and manufactured gas tankless products earlier this month, as we mentioned at our Investor Day, these products will be manufactured in our China facility until our North America capacity is completed in 2025. Associated import tariffs and other launch costs will impact North America margins by approximately 50 basis points. We are investing in manufacturing in Juarez, Mexico that would eliminate the tariff in the future.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $105 million to $115 million. an increase over the last several years due to capacity expansion projects related to our gas tankless manufacturing facility [ 4x ], the expansion of our engineering capabilities in Lebanon, Tennessee and an increase in high-efficiency commercial water heating manufacturing capacity to align with regulatory changes coming in 2026. We expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $525 million and $575 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $60 million.\nOur effective tax rate is estimated to be between 24% and 24.5%. And we expect to repurchase $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in our outstanding diluted shares of $147 million at the end of 2024.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2024, staying on Slide 13. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We project 2024 sales will grow between 3% and 5% compared to 2023, which includes the following assumptions. We believe the U.S. new home construction remains in a deficit, we project it will be flat in 2023. We also assume that 2024 proactive replacement will remain at a level similar to 2023. Therefore, after an approximate 6% increase in the industry in 2023 compared to 2022, we project that 2024 residential industry unit volumes will be approximately flat to last year. We project U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes to increase low single digits as demand for our commercial electric greater than 55 gallons continues its positive trend to pre-2022 levels.\nIn addition, our outlook includes the announced price increases in North America water heating up 4% on most of our water heater products. Price increase for heat pump products is 8%. These increases are projected to be effective late in the first quarter. In China, we believe it will take time for the economy to improve amid weakened consumer confidence in a challenged real estate and housing market, and we have not yet seen signs of significant improvement. Even with the continued backdrop of a weak economy, we project our sales in China will again grow 3% to 5%, and local currency in 2024, driven by resilient replacement demand, growth in demand for our water treatment products and our recently released kitchen products.\nOur forecast assumes that the currency translation impact will be minimal in 2024. We expect to return to growth in our North America boiler business with a projected sales increase of between 8% to 10% in 2024. We expect to continue to benefit from the transition to higher energy efficient boilers, particularly as commercial buildings look to improve their overall carbon footprint. We predict sales of North America water treatment products to increase approximately 10% to 12% as we expect to grow at 2x the pace of the market. Based on our 2024 assumptions, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 24.5% and 25%, and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 14. I'd like to thank everyone who joined us at our Investor Day late last year, either in person or via webcast. A recording of the webcast is available on our website. The team and I enjoyed sharing the exciting growth opportunities that we see on the horizon for all of our businesses. A summary of the key topics that we cover are on Slide 14. I look forward to sharing periodic updates on our initiatives including the launch of our gas tankless products.\nAs we look to 2024, we remain focused on our key strategic priorities to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water around the world. Those priorities are: expand and enhance our high-efficiency product portfolio, including heat pumps for space and water heating, expand our global water treatment capabilities by investing in technologies, people and geographic expansion and deploy capital effectively by investing in ourselves, pursue our active acquisition pipeline and returning capital to shareholders.\nWe have many reasons to be have optimism as we enter 2024. We see strong end market demand in North America for all of our product categories, and we expect to return to growth for boilers and North America water treatment as we believe our customers exited 2024 and 2023 with normalized channel inventories. We have begun several capacity expansion projects in North America that will support our growth in the long term. In China, we are projecting a second year of growth driven by innovative new products and resilient demand for our core products. And we expect to continue double-digit growth in India as our premium products and customer service are well received in the market.\nAnd finally, this year marks an important milestone for A. O. Smith, as we celebrate our 150th anniversary. What began as a small machine shop in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1874 and has grown into an innovative, industry-leading global water technology company with more than 12,000 employees. A. O. Smith has a rich and proud history, and we are excited to celebrate it with employees, shareholders, customers and partners across the globe.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Smith Corporation [Technical Difficulty] Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our call, please standby. Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the A. O. Smith's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to our first speaker for today, Helen Gurholt. Your line is now open.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thank you, everyone, for your patience while we dealt with our technical difficulties.\nWelcome to our A.O. Smith's third quarter conference call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into our operating results of our business, we provided non-GAAP measures.

If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue.\nWe will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4, and we'll review a few of our third quarter highlights. I'm very pleased with the execution of our team across all of our businesses to deliver a strong third quarter EPS of $0.90. The performance of our North America segment was particularly strong. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters as well as year-over-year improvement in our operating margin. China's new products drove year-over-year improvement as newly introduced kitchen appliance products were well received by the market.\nInnovative new products, combined with our strong brand, drove growth despite a continued challenging economic backdrop. India entered the year introducing a number of new products in both the water heating and water treatment categories and has delivered year-to-date sales growth of 17% in local currency. We also acquired WaterTec, a high-quality Arizona-based water treatment company. This acquisition aligns with our strategic growth aspirations to expand water treatment across the U.S. We welcome WaterTech team to the A. O. Smith family.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales increased 13% in the third quarter as a result of continued strength in residential water heater demand. As you may recall, sales in the third quarter of last year were negatively impacted by channel inventory destocking of residential water heaters, primarily in the wholesale channel. Our North America boiler sales declined 18% in the third quarter against a difficult comp in 2022. In the third quarter last year, we worked on our backlog after making significant production and supply chain improvements. We believe channel inventories are approaching normal levels.\nDemand for our commercial highest business, convention boilers, particularly our Hellcat Crest boilers, remained steady in the quarter. North America water treatment sales increased 5% in the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by pricing and e-commerce sales. The quarter also benefited from pricing-related margin improvement. In China, third quarter sales increased 9% local currency compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily due to our newly introduced dishwasher and steam oven products. The quarter also benefited from higher commercial water treatment sales and positive mix.\nI'm now on Slide 6. We continue to introduce new innovative products in water filtration. I'm pleased to highlight the launch of our new SmartFlow reverse osmosis filtration system under both our A.O. Smith and Aquasana brands. The product takes up less space and features an easy filter replacement process. Our SmartFlow technology features a multistage filtration process that removes up to 99.9% of contaminants, including PFAS, arsenic, microplastics and lead. It also features our innovative and exclusive side stream reverse osmosis technology, making this 1 of the most water-efficient systems in the market. This is 1 example of our commitment to bringing innovative water heating and water treatment treating products to the global market.\nOn November 6, at our Investor Day, each of our businesses will highlight new products that are driving results in the marketplace.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our third quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Third quarter sales in the North America segment were $710 million, a 9% increase over the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher residential water heater volumes that were partially offset by lower boiler volumes. North America segment earnings of $170 million increased 28% compared with the adjusted segment earnings in the third quarter of 2022. Operating margin of 23.9% improved 350 basis points compared to adjusted segment operating margin in the third quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin were primarily due to higher residential water heater volumes and lower steel costs, partially offset by lower boiler volumes. Segment pricing was relatively flat in the quarter compared to last year.\nMoving on to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $233 million, increased 1% year-over-year and 6% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $11 million. Sales of newly introduced kitchen appliance products, higher commercial water treatment sales and a positive mix in China, drove the sales increase in the quarter. India sales grew 13% in local currency in the third quarter compared to last year. Rest of the World segment earnings of $23 million increased 6% compared to segment earnings in the third quarter of 2022. Segment operating margin was 9.9%, an increase of 40 basis points compared to the same period last year, primarily as a result of higher sales of new products and a positive mix.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $396 million in the first 9 months of 2023, more than 2x the free cash flow generated in the same period last year. This was largely due to higher earnings and lower working capital cash outlays primarily related to lower inventory levels and lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $342 million at the end of September, and our net cash position was $212 million. Our leverage ratio was 6.4%, as measured by total debt to total capital. Our free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return of cash to shareholders.\nEarlier this month, our Board approved a 7% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.32 per share. We repurchased 2.4 million shares of common stock in the first 9 months of 2023 for a total of $161 million. We expect to repurchase $300 million of our shares for the full year 2023.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth through innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet also allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions along with organic growth.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our revised 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. We have increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted earnings per share range of $3.70 to $3.80 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share range represents an increase of 19% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, which include a stable supply chain with limited disruption.\nWe have increased our North America full year margin guidance to be approximately 25% based on our full year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship. We forecast that our Q4 material costs will be similar to our Q3 material costs. Our Rest of the World margin guidance of approximately 10% remains unchanged. We expect to generate strong free cash flow of between $575 million and $600 million.\nFor the year, CapEx should be approximately $65 million, corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $60 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And with the expectation to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, the resulting average outstanding diluted shares is expected to be 151 million at the end of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets, top line growth outlook and segment expectations for 2023, staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We have narrowed our 2023 sales outlook to grow approximately 2% compared to 2022, which was the high end of our previous guidance. Our outlook includes the following assumptions: Residential water heater orders remained strong through October. Therefore, we project 2023 residential water heater industry volumes will increase approximately 4% compared to last year. We continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions, both of which remain favorable.\nDemand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55-gallon continue to be robust. Our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-teens compared to 2022 is unchanged. We maintain our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% local currency in 2023. Our forecast assumes that the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 6% in 2023 compared to 2022. Our boiler business outlook of being down high single digits compared to last year is unchanged. As a reminder, 2022 is a difficult comp. We entered last year with a large backlog, which we worked down and exited the year with a normalized backlog partially, partly contributing to our boiler business growth of 28% in 2022.\nOur outlook for North America water treatment sales is to grow approximately 5% to 7% for 2023 also has not changed. We project that our sales in India will grow 15% this year.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. Again, we are very pleased with our performance in the first 9 months of 2023. In North America, residential commercial water heater demand remained strong through the third quarter. The year is lining up to have a normalized split of approximately 52% of volume in the first half of the year and 48% in the back half of the year. As we expected, North America operating margin was down sequentially in the quarter, but remained strong relative to historical performance at 23.9%, even as we recognized higher steel costs in the quarter, compared to the first half of the year.\nIn China, the team continues to execute very well across our various product lines through a balanced go-to-market channel strategy. New product introductions, continued growth in commercial water treatment and positive mix led to a 10% operating margin in the quarter. India continues to outperform the industry. We see great potential for our India business as it continues to deliver growth through new product introductions and premium customer service.\nOur focus remains on taking care of our customers as we continue to execute our key strategic objectives to advance our position as a global water technology leader.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in this morning's press release, among others. Also, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investors.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4, and we'll review a few highlights of our second quarter results. Our team delivered record adjusted EPS of $1.01 in the second quarter, driven by strong performance in our operating segment. We saw margin expansion in our North America segment, primarily due to a more favorable price cost relationship as well as robust demand for our commercial and residential water heaters. Our Rest of World segment delivered improved performance in the second quarter even as headwinds in the economy and currency exchange continue in China. Both China and India delivered sales growth of 15% local currency in the second quarter.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales decreased 2% in the second quarter of 2023 as higher volumes are offset by lower pricing. We saw continued resilience in residential water heater demand and year-over-year improvement in our commercial water heater business. Our North America boiler sales declined 13% in the second quarter compared to a tough comp last year as lower volumes more than offset the benefits from pricing. Channel inventory levels of residential and light commercial boilers remain elevated in the quarter as a warmer-than-normal winter resulted in lower industry demand. We believe channel inventory levels are approaching normal levels at the end of the quarter.\nDemand for our custom commercial high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers with O2 sensing technology were steady in the quarter and continues to gain traction in the market. North America water treatment sales were down 2% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to another tough comp in 2022 as pricing and strong e-commerce sales were offset by lower sales in our specialty wholesale and dealer channels. Sales in the first half of 2022 benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved, and we worked out our order backlog.\nI'm particularly pleased with the margin improvement we have seen this quarter in our North America water treatment business. In China, second quarter sales increased 15% in local currency compared to the second quarter of 2022 which was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related shutdowns. Demand continued to improve for our products, particularly for residential and commercial water treatment products. Sales of water treatment consumables were particularly strong in the quarter. We also saw a favorable mix in our water treatment and electric water heater product categories this quarter as recently launched products continue to be well received by the market.\nI'm now on Slide 6. According to our recent national consumer survey, nearly 9 out of 10 Americans have concerns about microplastics in their drinking water. Reducing plastic pollution has long been a priority for our North America water treatment business. Our North America water treatment products filter enough water to potentially eliminate over 1 billion single-use plastic bottles per year. I am pleased to announce that all of our countertop and undersink water filters are now independently certified to remove up to 99.6% of microplastics in addition to over 70 other contaminants, including PFAS and pesticides. We remain committed to leading the charge in identifying and becoming certified to remove [ macrocontaminants ] as they emerge.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our second quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Second quarter sales in the North America segment were $722 million, up 3% decline from the same period last year. The decrease is primarily driven by higher commercial and residential water heater volumes that were more than offset by lower boiler sales and pricing. Lower volumes contributed to approximately 1/2 of the organic growth decline. North America adjusted segment earnings of $194 million increased 19% compared with the second quarter of 2022. Adjusted operating margin of 26.9% improved 510 basis points from the segment adjusted operating margin in the second quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin were primarily due to lower steel costs and higher volumes of commercial and residential water heaters partially offset by lower boiler volumes.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of World segment sales of $244 million increased 6% year-over-year and 12% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $14 million. Our sales increase was primarily driven by higher consumer demand and favorable mix in China, particularly for residential and commercial water treatment products. India sales grew 15% in local currency in the second quarter compared to last year. Rest of World segment earnings of $28 million increased 56% compared to segment earnings in 2022. Segment operating margin was 11.6%, and an increase of 370 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year, primarily as a result of higher volumes of water treatment products and positive mix.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $236 million in the first half of 2023, higher than the first half of 2022 due to higher earnings and lower working capital cash outlays primarily related to lower inventory levels and lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $410 million at the end of June, and our net cash position was $204 million. Our leverage ratio was 9.8% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return of cash to shareholders.\nEarlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of [ $0.30 ] per share. We repurchased approximately 1,075,000 shares of common stock in the first half of 2023 for a total of $70 million. We are committed to repurchasing $300 million of our shares for the full year of 2023.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth driven by innovation and new product development across all of our product lines and geographies. We believe that our technology leadership and culture of innovation puts us in a strong position to capitalize on the mega trends of decarbonization and sustainability. The strength of our balance sheet also allowed us to pursue strategic acquisitions as we grow organically.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 in our revised 2023 earnings guidance and outlook. We've increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted EPS range of $3.45 and $3.60 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 12% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS. Our outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including our outlook assumes a relatively stable supply chain with limited disruption. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise. We have increased our North America full year margin guidance to a range of between 24% and 24.25% based on our full year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship. We will have higher steel costs in the back half of the year, which will put some pressure on North America margin. We forecast that steel costs in the second half of the year will be approximately 20% higher than the first half of the year. Our guidance assumes that other costs outside of steel remain at current levels.\nOur Rest of the World margin guidance of approximately 10% remains unchanged. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $550 million and $600 million. For the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in an average outstanding diluted shares of $151 million at the end of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and top line growth outlook for 2023, all staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We revised our 2023 sales projection to be a range of flat to up 2% compared to 2022, which includes the following assumptions. Residential water heater demand was resilient in the first half of the year. Therefore, we project 2023 residential water heater industry volumes to be flat to up 2% compared to last year. We continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions, both of which remain strong. Demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons was strong in the first half of the year, which leads us to raise our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-teens compared to 2022. We maintain our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% in local currency in 2023. We believe it will take time for consumer confidence to strengthen and for the economy to improve in China. Our forecast assumes that the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 5% in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe have decreased our outlook for our boiler business from being up mid-single digits to being down high single digits compared to last year. Last year, our boiler business grew 28% compared to 2021 partially driven by our backlog reduction during the year. We believe channel inventory levels of residential and light commercial boilers were elevated coming into 2023. The mild winter and warm spring resulted in lower demand coming out of the heating season, which slowed channel inventory reduction efforts.\nOrders for our energy-efficient custom commercial condensing boilers remain steady. Our outlook for North America water treatment sales growth of 5% to 7% for 2023 has not changed. We project that our sales in India will grow 15% compared to last year.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. We are very pleased with our performance in the first half of 2023. Demand for our commercial water heaters was strong. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters as new housing completion and proactive replacement remain robust. Our second quarter '23 -- 2023 North America adjusted operating margin of 26.9% was driven by improved price cost relationship and will lead to a full year margin improvement even as our steel costs rise in the second half of the year. Our China business performed well in a weak economy in the second quarter with sales growth of 15% and operating margins of over 12%. Market-leading products such as our high flow and hot water purifiers as well as dual tank electric water heaters led to a positive mix in the quarter. India continues to outperform the industry as our innovative new products drive market share gains.\nAs a final note, the U.S. Department of Energy has recently issued its proposal to raise the minimum energy efficiency standards for residential water heaters that is targeted to be affected in 2029. As we review the DOE's proposal, we continue to dialogue with the DOE and other industry participants to offer guidance from our unique market leadership perspective to ensure the final proposal considers all factors that may impact consumers, including affordability, installation challenges, market adoption and consumer awareness as well as state and local electrification regulations.\nAs a leader in energy-efficient water heater solutions, we believe A. O. Smith is well positioned to deliver a broad range of products that will meet or exceed the DOE requirements. And finally, our focus remains on meeting the needs of our customers as we continue to execute key strategic objectives to advance our position as a global water technology leader.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Smith First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Helen Gurholt. Helen, please go ahead.\n\nHelen E. Gurholt\n\nVP of IR and Financial Planning & Analysis, A. O. Smith Corporation\n\nThank you, Ellinor. Good morning, and welcome to the A. O. Smith First Quarter Conference Call. I'm Helen Gurholt, Vice President, Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis. Joining me today are Kevin Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Lauber, Chief Financial Officer.\nIn order to provide improved transparency into the operating results of our business, we provide non-GAAP measures. Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted segment earnings and adjusted corporate expenses exclude the impact of impairment charges, non-operating non-cash pension expenses as well as legal judgment income and terminated acquisition-related expenses. We also provide total segment earnings. Reconciliations from GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures are provided in the appendix at the end of this presentation and on our website.\nA friendly reminder that some of our comments and answers during this conference call will be forward-looking statements, that are subject to risks that could cause actual results to be materially different. Those risks include matters that we described in our -- this morning's press release, among others.\nAlso, as a courtesy to others in the question queue, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up per turn. If you have multiple questions, please rejoin the queue. We will be using slides as we move through today's call. You can access them on our website at investor.aosmith.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin to begin our prepared remarks. Please turn to the next slide.\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Helen and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 4, and we'll review a few highlights of our first quarter results. Our team delivered record first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.94, driven by strong performance in North America with sales up 3% due to higher commercial and residential water heater volumes.\nIn addition, we saw margin expansion across our water heating, boiler and water treatment product categories due to a more favorable price/cost relationship. Our Rest of World segment delivered consistent performance in the first quarter despite headwinds in the economy and currency exchange in China. In India, our sales grew 28% in local currency in the first quarter due to strong demand for our water heating and water treatment products.\nPlease turn to Slide 5. North America water heater sales grew 3% in the first quarter of 2023 as we believe we outperformed the market and experienced resilient demand for our commercial and residential water heater products.\nSales of commercial electric products were strong in the quarter as demand returned to pre-2022 levels. Last year, commercial industry shipments were negatively impacted by our regulatory change for commercial electric products greater than 55 gallons.\nOur North America boiler sales grew 2%, driven by previously announced price increases to offset higher costs. Residential boiler volumes decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by elevated channel inventory levels coming off a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2022. We believe inventory levels have normalized by the end of the quarter.\nDemand for our commercial high-efficiency condensing boilers, particularly our Hellcat CREST boilers with O2 sensing technology remained strong. North America water treatment sales were flat in the first quarter of 2023 compared to a tough comp in 2022 as higher direct-to-consumer and e-commerce sales were offset by lower sales in our dealer and specialty wholesale channels.\nSales in the first quarter of 2022 benefited from strong shipments as supply chain constraints improved and we work down our order backlog. We believe the majority of our dealers and wholesale customers exited the first quarter with normal inventory levels.\nIn China, first quarter sales decreased 10% local currency compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily due to weakened consumer demand. We have seen sequential improvement through April and expect that improvement to continue through the year. We believe it will take time for the Chinese economy and consumer confidence to improve. We saw a favorable price/mix in the quarter, particularly in our water treatment, as we recently introduced our large flow products that have been well received by the market.\nI'm now on Slide 6. A. O. Smith has recently been named in 2023 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence winner by the EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy. The ENERGY STAR award is given to companies that have made a long-term commitment to energy management through their products or services.\nThis is the fifth consecutive ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year award A.O. Smith has received and the third time being named a Sustained Excellence partner. These awards are a direct result of our strategic objective to expand and enhance our high-efficiency product portfolio, including heat pumps, as evidenced by the recent launch of our Voltex AL heat pump water heater. We are committed to continue development of sustainable water heating and water treating technology.\nI'll now turn the call over to Chuck, who will provide more details on our first quarter performance.\n\nCharles T. Lauber\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. Record first quarter sales in the North America segment rose to $753 million, a 3% increase compared with the same period last year. The increase is primarily driven by higher commercial and residential water heater volumes, partially offset by pricing.\nNorth America segment earnings of $188.6 million increased 22% compared with the first quarter of 2022. Operating margin of 25.1% improved 400 basis points from the segment adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of last year. The higher segment earnings and operating margin are primarily due to higher volumes of commercial and residential water heaters and lower steel costs.\nMoving to Slide 8. Rest of the World segment sales of $219.1 million decreased 14% year-over-year and 8% on a constant currency basis. Currency translation unfavorably impacted segment sales by approximately $17 million. Our sales decrease was primarily driven by lower sales in China as consumer demand was negatively impacted by COVID-19-related headwinds.\nWe saw month-over-month improvement in consumer demand during the quarter. India sales grew 28% in local currency in the first quarter compared to 2022, as our new products have been well received by the market. Rest of the World adjusted segment earnings of $17.8 million decreased 28% compared to segment earnings in 2022.\nSegment adjusted operating margin was 8.1%, a decrease of 160 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year, primarily as a result of lower volumes in China, partially offset by lower selling costs.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. We generated free cash flow of $109 million in the first 3 months of 2023, higher than the same period in 2022, due to higher earnings and lower working capital outlays, primarily related to lower inventory levels and a lower 2022 incentive payments paid in 2023. Our cash balance totaled $496 million at the end of March, our net cash position was $155 million.\nOur leverage ratio was 16% as measured by total debt to total capital. Our strong annual free cash flow and solid balance sheet enable us to focus on capital allocation priorities and return cash to shareholders. Earlier this month, our Board approved our next quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, which represents our 83rd consecutive year of dividend payments.\nWe repurchased approximately 821,000 shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2023 for a total of $53 million. We expect to repurchase $300 million of our shares in 2023, a $100 million increase from previous guidance.\nLet's now turn to Slide 10. In addition to returning capital to shareholders, we continue to see opportunities for organic growth driven by innovation and new product development across all of our product categories and geographies. The strength of our balance sheet allows us to pursue strategic acquisitions even in times of economic uncertainty.\nDuring the quarter, we committed to selling our business in Turkey and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $15.6 million. Primarily in anticipation of the liquidation of the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment. The business model in Turkey is more project-based than our core consumer and commercial water treatment business and no longer fits our current strategy.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 and our revised 2023 guidance and outlook. We've increased our 2023 outlook with an expected adjusted EPS range of $3.30 and $3.50 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range represents an increase of 8% compared with 2022 adjusted EPS.\nOur outlook is based on a number of key assumptions, including -- we assume a relatively stable supply chain, while challenges persist, disruptions are limited. We remain in close contact with our suppliers and logistics providers to manage and resolve supply chain issues as they arise.\nWe've increased our North American margin guidance from approximately 23% to a range of between 23% and 23.5%. Based on a full-year outlook on volumes and price cost relationship, we have recently seen a meaningful rise in steel index pricing, which will translate into higher input costs and relative to the first quarter, put pressure on North American margins in the back half of the year. We forecast that our steel cost in the second half of the year will be approximately 20% higher than the first half of the year.\nOur guidance assumes that other costs outside of steel remain relatively flat to our previous guidance, with favorable adjustments in our transportation cost outlook, offset by moderately higher costs outside of transportation. We expect to generate free cash flow of between $575 million and $625 million.\nFor the year, CapEx should be between $70 million and $75 million. Corporate and other expenses are expected to be approximately $55 million. Our effective tax rate is estimated to be approximately 24%. And as I noted earlier, we expect to repurchase approximately $300 million of shares of our stock, resulting in average outstanding diluted shares of $150 million at the end of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back to Kevin, who will provide more color on our key markets and topline growth outlook and segment expectations for 2023, Staying on Slide 11. Kevin?\n\nKevin J. Wheeler\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, A. O. Smith Corp.\n\nThank you, Chuck. We revised our 2023 sales projection to be approximately flat to 2022 at the midpoint, with a range of plus or minus 2%, which includes the following assumptions. Residential water heater demand was resilient in the first quarter, and therefore, we are raising our projection for the 2023 residential water heater industry volumes to be approximately flat to last year.\nWe continue to monitor proactive replacement and new housing completions. Demand for commercial electric water heaters greater than 55 gallons was strong in the first quarter and orders remained strong in April. We have raised our guidance for commercial water heater industry volumes to increase mid-single digits compared to 2022.\nOur China business performed as expected in the first quarter. We believe it will take time for consumer confidence to strengthen and for the economy to improve in China. We reaffirm our guidance that our sales in China will grow 3% to 5% in local currency in 2023. Our guidance assumes volumes in China improved throughout the year.\nOur forecast assumes the Chinese currency will devalue approximately 2% in 2023 compared to 2022. We are adjusting our outlook for our boiler business. We believe channel inventory levels of residential boilers are more elevated coming into 2023 than what we assumed in our prior guidance. While commercial growth aligns with our previous guidance, the amount of inventory in the residential boiler market resulted in sluggish residential boiler sales in the first quarter, and guides us to an annual growth outlook of mid-single digits.\nDemand for our energy-efficient custom commercial condensing boilers was steady in the first quarter, and job quoting remains active, particularly in the key institutional vertical. Our outlook for the North America water treatment sales growth of 5% to 7% for 2023 has not changed. Based on these factors, we expect our North America segment margin to be between 23% and 23.5% and Rest of World segment margins to be approximately 10%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. We are very pleased with our performance early in 2023. Demand for commercial electric water heaters rebounded to pre-2022 levels. We saw resilient demand for our residential water heaters. Our first quarter 2023 North America operating margin of 25.1% will drive significant full-year margin improvement even as steel costs rise.\nIn China, we saw sequential monthly improvement in our sales through April, and we expect that to continue through the year. We are pleased with our free cash flow through March, and we expect a strong rebound in free cash flow for the full year, as China emerges from COVID-19-related disruptions, and our dedicated focus on inventory reduction across our North America operations. Our focus remains on meeting the needs of our customers as well as executing our key strategic objectives to advance our position as a leader in heating and treating water, globally. Our strong brands across the portfolio, combined with technology-driven innovation and new product development will enhance our market leadership. And with our strong balance sheet, we are confident in our ability to capitalize on opportunities as we continue to execute our strategy.\nWith that, we conclude our prepared remarks, and we are now available for your questions."

Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.\nI would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVice President of Investor Relations.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2025. We Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\nEconomic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the related GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis for the non-GAAP financial measures for which it is providing guidance because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the timing and impact of certain items, which could significantly impact Abbott's results in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of 7.5% excluded COVID test sales. Our growth was led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices where several high-growth segments showed an acceleration in growth in the third quarter compared to growth in the first half of this year and also high single-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals led by double-digit growth in our key 50 markets. Earnings per share rose to $1.30, up high single digits compared to last year and up double digits when excluding the impact of the expected large year-over-year decline in COVID test sales that occurred in the third quarter.\nOur performance continues to be driven by innovation, positioning Abbott to consistently deliver high-quality results and durable long-term value to our shareholders. Recently launched new products generated nearly $0.5 billion in sales this quarter, and added more than 100 basis points to organic sales growth. Looking ahead, we expect increasing contributions from new products across the portfolio with a balanced mix of iterative and transformative innovation.\nI'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 4% in the quarter, led by adult nutrition business. Ensure remains the cornerstone of our adult nutrition portfolio trusted by millions of consumers seeking to maintain or improve their health, strong brand recognition, combined with favorable demographic and dietary trends, including an increased focus of protein intake and immune system health continues to fuel our growth.\nGrowth in Adult Nutrition was driven by 10% growth in international markets where we continue to see strong demand for both Ensure and Glucerna and to support future growth, we continue to invest in these well-known brands to ensure they evolve along with changing consumer preferences. We recently launched a new version of Glucerna that contains only 1 gram of sugar, and later this month, we'll launch a new version of Ensure that contains 42 grams of protein.\nMoving to Diagnostics where we saw modest sales growth in the quarter excluded COVID testing sales. As expected, challenging market conditions in China impacting both price and volume remain a headwind for our core lab diagnostic business. Excluding China, Core Lab Diagnostics grew 7% with markets such as the U.S., showing an acceleration in growth in the third quarter compared to growth in the first half of this year. Our strong consistent performance outside of China reflects durable underlying demand in markets around the world. And growth of 8% in point-of-care diagnostics was driven by growing adoption of 2 first-of-a-kind tests, our point-of-care concussion test and a high-sensitivity troponin test, which allows for earlier and more accurate detection of a heart attack.\nTurning to EPD. Sales increased 7%, led by double-digit growth in our key 50 markets, highlighting broad-based demand and strong commercial execution. From a product portfolio perspective, several therapeutic areas delivered strong contributions, including gastroenterology, cardiometabolic and pain management. These areas continue to benefit from favorable demographic trends and growing demand for high-quality, affordable medicines. We continue to make good progress as it pertains to our biosimilar strategy, a key growth pillar for EPD. During the quarter, we advanced the regulatory approval process for several biosimilars and remain on track with our planned cadence of product and geographic launches that began this year.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5% and driven by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, in electrophysiology, in cardiac rhythm management, in heart failure and in structural heart. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $2 billion in the quarter and grew 17%. In Electrophysiology, sales grew double digits in the U.S. and internationally. The launch of our new Volt PFA catheter in Europe continues to go very well and helped deliver double-digit growth in ablation catheters and international markets this quarter. Feedback from European physicians who have used Volt continues to be very positive, and we look forward to bringing bulk to the U.S. market next year.\nIn Structural Heart, growth of 11% was led by share gains in TAVR and growing adoption of TriClip. During the quarter, we achieved important milestones in our Structural Heart business. In July, we received regulatory approval for TriClip in Japan. TriClip is the first and only minimally invasive treatment option available to patients in Japan to treat tricuspid regurgitation. And in August, we received CE Mark for an expanded indication for our TAVR valve Navitor to treat people who are at low or intermediate risk for open heart surgery. This expanded indication is supported by data from our VANTAGE study which was presented as a late breaker at the European Society of Cardiology Congress.\nIn Cardiac Rhythm Management, growth of 13% was led by strong uptake of our lives pacemaker over, which is expanding the market and capturing share in both the single and dual chamber pacing segments. Our vision for over was to help change the standard of care for cardiac pacing and that vision is now becoming a reality with our Cardiac Rhythm Management business outperforming the market for 10 consecutive quarters and driving an acceleration in growth from high single digits last year to double digits this quarter.\nIn heart failure growth of 12% was driven by growth across our portfolio of ventricular assist devices and growth of CardioMEMS or implantable sensor used for the early detection of heart failure. -- and vascular growth of 5% was led by continued strong performance in our market-leading portfolio of vessel closure products and increasing contributions from a spree are below the knee, resorbable spent. In August, we received CE Mark for spree and we look forward to offering this innovative technology to people outside the United States who suffer from peripheral artery disease.\nLastly, Neuromodulation growth of 7% was led by strong performance of our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device in international markets, reflecting both continued uptake in existing markets and launches in new markets. So in summary, we delivered another very good quarter. Our pipeline has been highly productive and continues to fuel growth and we remain on track to deliver high single-digit organic sales growth and double-digit EPS growth.\nI'll now turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhilip P. Boudreau\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Finance\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. sales increased 5.5% or 7.5% when excluding COVID testing-related sales. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.30 was in line with the consensus estimate. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on third quarter sales, which was less favorable than what we forecasted at the time of our earnings call in July.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin profile was 55.8% of sales, which, as expected, reflects a decrease compared to the prior year due to the impact of tariffs. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales. Adjusted operating margin was 23% of sales, which reflects an increase of 40 basis points compared to the prior year. And based on current rates, we expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 1.5% on our fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we will now open the call for questions."

Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVice President of Investor Relations.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Philip Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.\nRobert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2025.\nAbbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31 2024. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the related GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis for the non-GAAP financial measures for which it is providing guidance because the company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort, the timing and impact of certain items, which could significantly impact Abbott's results in accordance with GAAP. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nAt the halfway point of the year, we are on track with our key priorities and objectives. In the first half, we delivered high single-digit sales growth over 100 basis points of margin expansion in both gross margin and operating margin, double-digit earnings per share, and we achieved a number of important milestones related to advancing key programs in our new product pipeline.\nOur sales growth excluded COVID testing sales, was 7.5% in the second quarter and 8% in the first half of the year. Our second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 and exceeded the consensus estimate and reflects 11% growth versus the prior year and 16% growth on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter.\nI'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before I turn the call over to Phil, and I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by 6.5% growth. In Adult Nutrition, where Abbott is the global market leader, we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands in the markets around the world, and this growing demand is driven by consumers seeking a source of complete and balanced nutrition, especially for those focused on protein-rich diets and meeting the dietary requirements for managing diabetes.\nMoving to Diagnostics. Sales declined 1.5% in the quarter, predominantly due to the year-over-year decline in COVID testing sales and the impact of volume-based procurement programs in China. Together, these represent a projected headwind of around $700 million or 750 basis points on the full year 2025 sales growth in Diagnostics. Excluding China, Core Lab Diagnostics grew 8%, reflecting strong underlying demand in the markets around the world.\nTurning to EPD. Our sales in nearly 8% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in our key 15 markets, which surpassed $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time. Key 15 markets include India, China and other markets across Asia, Latin America and Middle East. These markets represent the most attractive areas of growth for branded generic medicines.\nThe growth in these markets is supported by favorable long-term health care economic and demographic trends, including higher birth rates, and expanding middle class aging populations and growing demand for access to high-quality health care solutions. We serve this growing demand by offering a broad portfolio of branded generic medicines tailored to local conditions with a focus on key therapeutic areas. And additionally, we continue to make good progress towards building a best-in-class portfolio of biosimilars having completed 10 regulatory approval submissions across a range of emerging markets with launches projected to begin in 2026.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12%, driven by double-digit growth in diabetes care, heart failure, structural heart, electrophysiology and cardiac rhythm management. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose motors were $1.9 billion in the quarter and grew 19.5%.\nIn April, we announced a first of its kind collaboration with Epic, enabling direct integration of Libre sensor data into the leading electronic health record system. This seamless integration allows health care providers to easily view their patient's glucose data before during and after meeting with patients, supporting our goal of simplifying care to help deliver better outcomes for both health care providers and patients.\nIn electrophysiology, we had several key accomplishments in the quarter, including delivering a number -- delivering another quarter of double-digit sales growth initiating the launch of our new Volt PFA catheter and completing enrollment ahead of schedule in our [ PACTAFLEX-DUo ] U.S. pivotal trial.\nIn Structural Heart, growth of 12% was led by a combination of continued share gains in TAVR, strong adoption of TriClip and contributions from Amulet and MitraClip. During the quarter, we achieved several important milestones that demonstrate our commitment and progress toward expanding our portfolio of solutions to treat mitral valve disease.\nAs the leader -- as the market leader in mitral valve repair, we continue to invest in the success of MitraClip. So in addition to currently pursuing a label expansion to increase the addressable market, we recently launched a next-generation version of MitraClip, that further enhances the procedure with improved deployment and deliverability.\nAnd to accompany our leading position in mitral valve repair, we expanded our focus several years ago to include the development of mitral valve replacement technologies. And in May, we announced FDA approval of our Tendyne mitral replacement valve, which offers a new treatment option for those who are not candidates for open heart surgery or mitral valve repair procedure.\nAnd at New York [ Valves ] conference a few weeks ago, we provided an encouraging update on the development of our new [ transfemoral ] mitral valve replacement product. We acquired this innovative technology as part of our venture investments program, which led to the acquisition of Cephea Valve Technologies in 2019.\nAnd following that acquisition, we continue to iterate and enhance the technology and the FDA recently granted breakthrough designation. We plan to start the pivotal trial next year and look forward to creating a new solution to help treat the world's most common heart valve disease, which impacts the lives of millions of people around the world.\nIn Rhythm Management, our strong performance is a result of our strategy to build a comprehensive portfolio capable of significantly outperforming the market on our own historical growth rates. Our growth this quarter of 10% was led by strong uptake of AVEIR, our innovative leadless pacemaker, which is driving growing adoption of leadless pacemakers in both the single and dual chamber pacing segments of the market.\nIn April, we announced late-breaking data from the AVEIR conduction system pacing feasibility study. This was the first study to evaluate using a leadless pacemaker to deliver a conduction system pacing which is a novel approach to pacing that closely mimics the heart's natural electrical rhythm. And following the successful outcome of this study, we are targeting to start the pivotal trial next year.\nIn our heart failure business, often overshadowed by other high-growth businesses in our Medical Device portfolio, sales grew 14% in the quarter. This was driven by balanced growth across the portfolio, which included double-digit growth in ventricular assist devices used to treat both chronic and acute conditions, and double-digit growth in CardioMEMS, our implantable sensor for the early detection of heart failure, and vascular growth of 3.5% and was led by double-digit growth in vascular imaging and vessel closure products and increasing contributions from [ sprit ] are below the [indiscernible] and lastly, in neuromodulation, growth of 4%, was led by strong performance of our alternate rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device in international markets, reflecting both continued uptake in existing markets and launches in new markets.\nSo in summary, our diversified model continues to provide a strong foundation that is both resilient and designed to sustainably deliver top-tier results now and in the future. And that's evident in our performance in the first half of the year, which, along with our outlook for the remainder of the year and the momentum heading into next year aligns with our long-term sustainable growth objectives of delivering high single-digit growth, healthy margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. I'll now turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhilip P. Boudreau\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Finance\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\nTurning to our second quarter results. Sales increased 6.9% or 7.5% when excluding the COVID testing-related sales. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 increased 11% compared to the prior year and was above the consensus estimate.\nForeign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 0.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weakened, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin profile was 57% of sales, which reflects an increase of 100 basis points compared to the prior year.\nAdjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 27.7% of sales. Adjusted operating margin was 22.9% of sales, which also reflects an increased 100 basis points compared to prior year.\nBased on current rates, we now expect exchange to have a relatively neutral impact on our full year sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 2% on our third quarter sales. And lastly, for the third quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.32. With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As we progress through 2025, it is clear that we are operating in an increasingly dynamic environment. Abbott was built not just to operate, but to succeed in rapidly evolving environments like this. We have consistently demonstrated our ability to navigate the complexities arising from a range of global circumstances, including the repercussions of the global pandemic, global financial crisis, numerous geopolitical events, just to name a few. In the current evolving economic environment influenced by new tariff policies, represents another global development that we are prepared to adeptly manage.\nThe proven benefits of our diversified business model are evident now, a result of the strategic framework that drives our global manufacturing and supply chain operations. While tariffs will have a financial impact with 90 manufacturing sites around the world and decades of experience executing our global network strategy, we're well positioned to implement mitigations to help manage the impact of the tariffs.\nI'll now shift our focus to discussing our results for the quarter. Overall, we achieved our target growth objective, delivering high single-digit sales growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. First quarter sales grew 7% or more than 8% when excluded COVID testing sales. First quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 grew 11% versus the prior year and finished at the high end of our guidance range.\nI'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil, and I'll start with Nutrition. There sales increased 7% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in Adult Nutrition and double-digit growth in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, our relentless focus on research, innovation and product quality continues to make our Similac family of products, the #1 choice for parents in the United States. In Adult Nutrition, growth of 8.5% was driven by growing demand for Abbott's Ensure family of products that serve as a source of complete and balanced nutrition for people with a wide range of nutritional needs.\nMoving to Diagnostics. Sales declined 5% in the quarter due to the year-over-year decline in COVID-19 testing sales, resulting from a much weaker COVID season, which primarily impacted growth in our Rapid Diagnostics business. In Core Laboratory Diagnostics, low single-digit growth in the quarter reflects the impact of volume-based procurement programs in China. Excluding China, Core Laboratory sales grew 6.5%. And wrapping up in Diagnostics, we remain on track to go live by the end of the year with two new manufacturing and R&D investments in Illinois and Texas, totaling $0.5 billion related to expanding our U.S. transfusion diagnostic business. Our diagnostic business, our transfusion business is responsible for screening the U.S. blood supply. Our current blood screening system, Alinity s runs diagnostic tests to identify various antibodies and antigens that may be present in donated blood. We have developed a new system called Alinity m that will allow Abbott to enter the molecular nucleic acid testing segment of the blood screening market. This advanced technology is capable of detecting DNA and RNA of several diseases that could potentially contaminate blood donations. The nucleic acid testing market opportunity is estimated to be around $1 billion and represents an attractive new growth opportunity for our business.\nTurning to EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Growth was broad-based across the markets we serve, led by double-digit growth in more than half of our key 15 markets. We continue to make great progress on building a best-in-class portfolio of biosimilars that spans across several large and attractive therapeutic areas. In January, we entered into an agreement that provides Abbott commercialization rights to four additional biosimilars across emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Through the various collaboration agreements we have executed, we have now added a total of 15 biosimilar products, projected to contribute to sales over the next 3 years.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5%. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $1.7 billion in the quarter and grew more than 20%, including growth of 30% in the United States. In Electrophysiology sales grew 10%, which included double-digit growth in the U.S. and high single-digit growth in international markets. In March, we announced that Abbott obtained CE Mark earlier than expected for our Volt PFA system to help treat patients battling atrial fibrillation. We have already initiated the launch of Volt and we'll further expand the roll-up across European markets over the course of the year.\nIn Structural Heart, growth of 15% was driven by strong performance across our market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. Growth in the quarter was led by continued share gains in TAVR and growing adoption of TriClip. In March, new 2-year data from the TRILUMINATE clinical trial was presented at the American College of Cardiology Conference. The data showed that patients receiving TriClip had a statistically significant reduction in the occurrence of heart failure-related hospitalizations along with sustained reductions in tricuspid regurgitation and life-changing improvements in quality of life.\nIn Ribbon management, growth of 6% was led by consistent and sustained market penetration of Avere or innovative leadless pacemaker and Assert our newest implantable cardiac monitor. In heart failure, growth of 12% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offers treatment for chronic and temporary conditions. In January, CMS issued national coverage decision to cover CardioMEMS, a small implantable sensor that provides early warning indications that help doctors treat heart failure. This expanded coverage will broaden access to CardioMEMS for those with Medicare Advantage plans and help further expand coverage to those with commercial insurance plans.\nIn Vascular, growth of 6% was led by double-digit growth in vascular imaging and vessel closure products and growth in Esprit, our below the knee resorbable stent. In March, we announced the start of our U.S. pivotal trial to evaluate our coronary intravascular lithotripsy system in treating severe calcification in the coronary arteries prior to implanting a stent. We expect to complete enrollment in this trial next year and file for FDA approval shortly thereafter. We look forward to entering this large and fast-growing segment of the coronary intervention market and expect this to become a meaningful growth driver for our Vascular business. And lastly, in Neuromodulation. We began treating patients in our TRANSCEND clinical trial a first of its kind trial designed to evaluate using deep brain stimulation to address treatment-resistant depression, which represents a market opportunity exceeding $1 billion.\nSo in summary, we delivered another quarter of top-tier performance. Sales grew high single digits and earnings per share grew double digits. We expanded gross margin by 140 basis points and operating margin by 130 basis points compared to the prior year. The pipeline continues to provide a steady cadence of new growth opportunities with more than 25 key new products forecasted to launch over the next 3 years, and we remain on track to deliver on the financial commitments we set at the beginning of the year.\nI'll now turn the call to Phil. Phil?\n\nPhilip P. Boudreau\n\nCFO & Senior VP of Finance\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our first quarter results. Sales increased 6.9% or 8.3% when excluding COVID testing-related sales. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.09 increased 11% compared to the prior year and finished at the high end of our guidance range and above the consensus estimate. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.8% on the first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weakened, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin profile was 57.1% of sales, which increased 140 basis points compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by delivering on the underlying organic margin expansion we forecasted and also included an added benefit of more favorable fall-through from foreign exchange.\nGross margin expansion has always been a significant element of Abbott's company culture. At any point in time, a substantial number of margin improvement initiatives are underway that span across our businesses as well as our functional areas, including supply chain, marketing and other administrative groups. I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the valuable contributions from our Abbott employees around the world who are driving these exceptional margin expansion results.\nTurning our focus back to the first quarter results. Adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 29.5% of sales in the first quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 21% of sales, which reflects an increase of 130 basis points compared to prior year. Based on current rates, we now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 1% on the full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact around 0.5% on the second quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the second quarter, forecast adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.27.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. First, I want to express gratitude to my Abbott colleagues around the world whose hard work and passion are the driving forces of Abbott's continued success. Abbott's commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and serving the needs of our customers resulted in another year of exceptional performance, which included achieving sales growth of 9.5% excluding COVID testing, delivering 70 basis points of gross margin profile improvement, driving acceleration in the growth of our earnings per share throughout the year, and developing and advancing new products through our rich pipeline. The strong performance resulted in generating $8.5 billion of operating cash flow, which was used to reinvest in the business, fund capacity expansions, repay debt, and return $5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.\nThese accomplishments played a key role in continuing our well-established track record for delivering on our financial commitments, which included achieving results that finished at the high end of our initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024. These results included exiting the year with a very strong momentum as Q4 sales grew 10% excluding COVID testing sales, and adjusted earnings per share increased 13% versus the prior year. For 2025, we're well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth. As we announced this morning, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5%-8.5%, and adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.05-$5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint. I'll now summarize our Q4 results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition. Our sales increased 7% in the quarter.\nGrowth in the quarter was driven by double-digit growth in adult nutrition, led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. We achieved a significant milestone last year, with annual sales of Ensure surpassing $3 billion. This achievement helped deliver another year of strong performance in adult nutrition, with annual sales of adult nutrition products growing 9% last year. This strong performance is a continuation of a well-established trend. The five-year compound annual growth rate in adult nutrition is 9%, which reflects the impact of our well-known and respected brands, favorable demographic trends, and the significant investments we've made to expand manufacturing capacity to serve the growing global demand for our products. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased 6% excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics, where excluding COVID testing sales increased 16% in the quarter.\nThis was driven by strong demand for our portfolio of respiratory disease tests used to help diagnose influenza, strep throat, and RSV. In core laboratory diagnostics, growth of 4% was driven by continued strong demand for our market-leading immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and blood screening testing panels. Excluding the impact of challenging market dynamics in China, the combined growth in all other markets was double digits in the quarter. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 8.5% in the quarter, growth was well-balanced across markets and therapeutic areas that we participate in, including gastroenterology, women's health, CNS, and pain management. EPD also delivered broad-based growth across the markets we serve, including double-digit growth in several countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.\nBy focusing on the therapies most needed in these fast-growing markets, we continue to sustain our long track record of delivering strong growth, which includes a five-year compound annual growth rate for EPD of 8%. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14%. In diabetes care, sales of continuous glucose monitors were $1.8 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. For the full year 2024, sales of continuous glucose monitors were approximately $6.5 billion and grew 22%. This included growth of 27% in the US, where our market share on a revenue basis has increased by more than 10 share points over the last three years. In electrophysiology, growth of 9% was well-balanced across the US and international markets.\nAs expected, growth in the quarter was impacted by a challenging comparison versus the prior year, where we saw a sharp increase in demand for our EnSite cardiac mapping systems as customers prepared for the launch of PFA catheters. Excluding the impact of this prior-year comparison dynamic, growth would have been double digits globally in the US and internationally. In structural heart, growth of 23% was driven by strong performance across our market-leading portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions, and transcatheter repair and replacement products. Structural heart represents one of the most attractive areas in the field of medical technologies. It is an area that we have invested in heavily, and we're seeing those investments yield outstanding results. Our comprehensive portfolio of products drove an acceleration in sales growth in structural heart throughout the year.\nIn rhythm management, growth of 7% was led by Aveir, our innovative leadless pacemaker, and Assert-IQ, our newest implantable cardiac monitor, which we launched in the US last year. With growth of 7% for the full year, our rhythm management business delivered another year of performance that far exceeded the market, and we expect that to continue this year. Last month, we announced that we completed the first-in-human implants of a new version of Aveir specifically designed to deliver pacing to the left bundle branch area of the heart, activating the heart's natural conduction system. This highly innovative device, currently in development, was granted breakthrough designation by the FDA. In heart failure, growth of 9.5% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offer treatment for chronic and temporary conditions.\nIn vascular, growth of 7% was led by double-digit growth in vessel closure products and growth from Esprit, our below-the-knee resorbable stent. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 8%, driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device. So, in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong growth, with sales growing 10% and earnings per share growing 13%. For the year, we achieved the upper end of the initial guidance ranges we provided for 2024. We made great progress expanding our gross margin profile, and we expect that progress to continue into 2025. The pipeline continues to provide a steady cadence of new growth opportunities, and we're well positioned to deliver another year of strong growth in 2025. And I'll turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our Q4 results, sales increased 8.8% on an organic basis and increased 10.1% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on Q4 sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen against most currencies, which resulted in an unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in October. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the Q4. Lastly, our Q4 adjusted tax rate was 15%.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025, today we issued guidance for full-year adjusted earnings per share of $5.05-$5.25, which reflects double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range and contemplates an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $1.05-$1.09 for the first quarter. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth to be in the range of 7.5%-8.5%. Please note that we are no longer providing separate guidance for the sales growth excluding COVID testing sales, as COVID testing sales represents less than 2% of total company sales in 2024. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 2.5% on full-year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our Q4 reported sales.\nWe expect our full-year 2025 adjusted gross margin profile to be around 57% of sales, which reflects an improvement of around 80 basis points versus the prior year. We forecast our full-year 2025 adjusted operating margin profile to be in the range of 23.5%-24% of sales, which reflects an improvement of 150 basis points versus the prior year at the midpoint of the range. This improvement is driven by a combination of strong gross margin expansion and operating margin leverage. We forecast our adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 16%-17%, which reflects an increase compared to last year related to the adoption of the Pillar II tax framework. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session.

And again, that's star 11 to ask a question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from Robert Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Marcus\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice quarter and guide. And maybe, Robert, I could start with the 2025 guide. Once again, guiding to high single-digit organic sales growth, healthy operating margin expansion, and nice to see 10% EPS growth back in the algorithm again. Maybe you could just speak to some of the key growth drivers and how we should think about the different business segments on the top line, and some of the components of the operating margin expansion down the P&L. Thanks a lot.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure, Robert. Yeah, it's nice to see kind of the headline print now back to double-digit EPS growth. I think that's probably one of the things that you'll, it's one of the things you'll see now, Robbie, as we go into 2025. I mean, you've got a lot of growth drivers there, but I think one of the big things is that you don't have the COVID sales decline cloud that's kind of overshadowing all these real strong growth drivers that we've got in the business. And you saw that in Q3 as we showed 13% EPS, sorry, in Q4 as we showed 13% EPS growth. So I think that's one big aspect is just not having those sales decline. I mean, we've got COVID sales in 2025, but it's, as Phil said in his comments, significantly less from our total revenue perspective.\nI think it starts with the top line always, Robert. The markets that we compete in remain attractive. We're seeing acceleration in several of them. I mean, we're a very diversified healthcare company, so we get to benefit from all the different dynamics that are going on in healthcare, whether it's increased health and wellness focus from consumers. We get to benefit from that on our nutrition business. Every treatment requires a diagnostic test. About 70% of them require a diagnostic test. So we're seeing continued growth over there. We've got two areas where we focus on treatments, whether it's pharmaceuticals or med tech. All of those markets are accelerating. Within them, we've got strong product portfolios that are either keeping up with these very high-growth markets or we're outperforming the markets and taking shares.\nIf you look at the contributions, we've got your current drivers, whether it's Libre, TriClip, Aveir, Navitor, Amulet, all of those products in the cardiovascular space. So the bases are loaded, I would call that. Then you've got nice our next circle and a lineup of catalysts that are coming up right after that, whether it's biosimilars, Volt, innovations in the Libre portfolio, some clinical trial readouts. So I think we feel very good about all of the businesses. You saw all of the businesses improve their growth from Q3-Q4. I think it starts with the top line, and I think we're well positioned in them. To your question on the margin drivers, I'd say we've done a lot of work on gross margin expansion. We've talked about that, committing to a 70 basis point improvement in 2024. We achieved that.\nWe believe that we can achieve another 80 basis points of improvement in 2025. And that's what's embedded in that guide is continuous improvement on the gross margin to the tune of 80 basis points, really driven by continued focus on gross margin improvement programs and then mix as some of the higher gross margin products continue to grow ahead of the company average. You get that mix effect. And then down the P&L, I think you've got an opportunity, as we've talked about in the past, to be able to leverage the business and obtain spending leverage across the business. And again, I think that was another challenge we had during COVID or as the COVID was coming down. We really only relied on one lever of margin expansion, which was gross margin improvement. I'd say now you've got two.\nWe actually have two, which is our original formula of gross margin expansion and then spending leverage. So you put all that together, you've got about 16% actually underlying growth in the EPS coming from the top line, the gross margin improvement, and the spending leverage. And then we've got, obviously, some friction on FX. I think every company is going to face that as we've seen the strengthening dollar and increased tax rates, which also aren't a surprise. We've known about that. And so that brings us down to that 10%. So I kind of look at this and say, \"Okay, what you see now for 2025 is the Abbott that we know, the Abbott identity that we've built, which is high single-digit top line, double-digit bottom line, gross margin improvement, spending, leverage, and productivity, strong operating cash flow.\nWe know how to deal with FX, so we deal with it every year, and we're dealing with it again this year and still being able to deliver double-digit EPS, dealing with the higher tax rates. I think I saw some notes about calendarization, about maybe Q1 not coming in. I could tell you we looked at our Q1 and all of our gating. All of our gating on EPS is very much aligned to what it was in 2024. It's very much aligned to what it was pre-COVID. So again, all the elements of Abbott and the Abbott identity that we know are there, and we're looking forward to 2025.\n\nRobert Marcus\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Robert, I guess you talked about it starts with the top line. You had another really strong year for CGM with over 20% constant currency growth on $6.5 billion in sales. So I'd love to hear you talk about your expectations for growth in 2025, the status of the Libre 3 supply issues, and any color you have on the Lingo launch. Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. So let me talk about Libre 3 supply. As we spoke about during the last call, Larry, there was a little bit of a mismatch between our manufacturing coming up online and the demand that we were seeing, especially here in the U.S. That caused a little bit of friction there. But as I said, we were in process of getting our new manufacturing site up and running. I was there in November and seeing the team, and that's going now at full force. So Libre 3 supply with two manufacturing sites up and running. And I think you'll start to see throughout the next one or two quarters a change here and a little bit on the MBRXs, on the TRXs. I know you guys like to look at those quite often, I guess.\nThose are an important metric to look at, Larry, but they're not the only metric to see how the businesses are doing. I mean, I think you saw that in our Q4, we were able to grow the U.S. 24%. So there are other elements that aren't measured. I think you guys also saw the impact of relying exclusively on those data in Q3 as competitors had challenges also. So it's an important metric to look at, but I would say it's not the only ones, and I think we've kind of shown that here. So Libre 3 is doing pretty well, and it's just going to get better. As I look at 2025, I'd say there's some pretty interesting kind of growth drivers here for us. I'd say first, as a base case, I still think there's under-penetration in the intensive insulin-using segment.\nI mean, if you look at the U.S., there's still 25% of that segment that are not on CGMs. And if you think about that internationally, it's more like 50%. So I still think, as a base case to driving all this growth, there's all this opportunity in this segment. But I think there are three areas in 2025 that I believe accelerate that opportunity for us. One of them is obviously basal coverage. And we continue to see, with the publication of more clinical evidence, you see more and more markets move towards expanding basal coverage, reimbursement coverage. Now, we have a couple of markets where we're the only ones that do have that coverage, whether it's Japan or Canada. These are large markets. So these are great opportunities for us where we've got this head start, and we'll keep on driving that.\nSo I think basal is a big bucket of growth. I think the other area that I've talked about as being an area of growth for us is more kind of share ability to take share. And that's through connectivity strategies with insulin delivery systems. We've been talking about all the things that we've been doing in regards to partnership with insulin pump companies. And I think you'll see throughout this year several announcements on connectivities and different geographies. And that gives us the opportunity to penetrate, albeit a smaller segment, but be able to penetrate that segment and take share. And I think the third area of growth for us of acceleration is just the whole OTC non-diabetes application with the launch of Lingo. Continue to see very nice trends. We've launched it in a restricted number of U.S. cities.\nBut I think now that we understand what it takes to be able to drive adoption with this completely different consumer segment, that will probably be expanding this and expanding this more nationally here in the U.S. and potentially looking at other areas internationally to bring this. So I think the Lingo launch is going very well in several areas. I think it surpassed some of my expectations, especially regarding reorder rates. And I think those continue. And I think that's going to be another kind of leg of the stool, so to say, on this growth. So I think those are really the kind of growth drivers that we've got planned for Libre. I think the intensive insulin segment is still an opportunity, a pretty significant opportunity. And then you've got these three accelerators on top of that.\n\nLawrence Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about EP growth. Still strong high single digits in the quarter, and I think it was even faster than that, excluding the tough mapping comp. There's a lot of things moving around in that market right now. One competitor had a big setback in PFA, and your progress is moving forward with Volt. So just thinking about how you're thinking about EP growth in 2025 as you bridge to PFA in 2026 and your ability to kind of regain market share once Volt launches.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Yeah. I mean, I think this wasn't a surprise for us. And it wasn't really driven by any kind of adoption of PFA regarding our Q4 growth rate. In fact, as I've said in previous calls, I think the net effect for us, the net effect for us has actually been very positive. What we did have was an execution of that strategy, Travis, where we said, \"Okay, we're going to bridge ourselves.\" And one of the ways to do that is through our mapping. And that's what really drove our success in 2024, is what we did in Q4 of 2023, really taking advantage of our ability to offer the only real open, truly open mapping system. So that created that comp issue. It was double digits in Q4, 12% in the US, 12% internationally. So still seeing very good.\nI think, again, I would say these results. I think we outperformed a lot of the expectations that many of you guys had about our EP business. And I think the driver of that has been the team. The team in the field has just been spectacular, I think. And I've been close to them last year, and I think what they did was really strong. So I guess I answer your question in 2025, really looking at what we did in 2024. I expect to continue to benefit in 2025 from just the general increasing procedure trends. We've got opportunities to grow with some recently launched products, whether it's our GridX, our next-generation mapping catheter, our new Agilis introducer sheath. I mean, that's a great opportunity for us also. So yeah, it's going to be a little bit more competitive. It's been pretty competitive in 2024.\nI expect that intensity to increase when it comes to the ablation catheters. But I'm confident that we can maintain a strong position in the mapping segment and everything that comes with all the consumables that come with that. On top of that, our pipeline is very strong. We'll continue to engage KOLs and our customers. We've got an ongoing trial right now with a dual energy source catheter internationally and in the U.S. We've got integration with ICE. We've got kind of new sheaths to launch. So I think the pipeline allows us to continue that interaction with the KOLs and with the users. So we should expect. I think you mentioned bridging to PFA in 2026. It's more like 2025 on PFA, at least internationally. So I feel good about it.\nAnd maybe you've got a tale of two halves where the second half is going to grow faster than the first half as Volt comes on board. But I'd say for the full year, high single digits seems like a good place to start. Call that our base case. And then to the point that you made about competition and some of the dynamics that have occurred the last couple of weeks, it's still a bit too early to tell, but that could be an opportunity for us also. So I feel good about the business, not only the pipeline, but more importantly, the team that we've got. They're doing an incredible, real strong job.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research, Evercore\n\nHi, Robert. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a strong finish to the year. I guess I had a two-part question, if you don't mind. Really strong operating margins driven both by gross margins and operating leverage, but your gross margins are still below pre-pandemic levels. I'm curious, when you look at the margins, how sustainable are these trends? Perhaps not at triple digits, but should we be thinking about trend margin framework as gross margins normalize? And my second part is on balance sheet. I'm curious. There's been some M&A activity picking up in MedTech. How are you thinking about devices versus diagnostics? I'm curious. Any thoughts on cancer screening, MRD, etc.?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nI'll let Phil talk to the gross margin, the sustainability of that margin improvement, and then I'll take your balance sheet question.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nYeah. Thanks, Robert and Vijay here. On the gross margin front, I think we spoke to this the last few calls, and nothing here has really changed relative to an underlying focus of the business and of the organization, as Robert touched on here. I think the difference in recent years causing that erosion was the significant inflation in commodity prices, which has really sort of resorted back to, I'd call it, normalized inflationary pressures that we're very much accustomed to managing through with our organizations and focus on gross margin expansion. And so what you saw in 2024 was exactly that, the recipe we're accustomed to and the commitment in 2025 to do much of the same. So from an expansion standpoint, we expect this to continue, and it's not a matter of if, but when we get back to kind of the legacy and historical gross margin profiles.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I guess on your question on balance sheet, I've always talked about this, Vijay. I mean, we do take this kind of balanced approach. I'm not going to give you a formula of how much goes to here, how much goes to there. We do take a balanced approach. And on your M&A question, yeah, there's been an uptick of activity, no doubt. There are some good opportunities out there. And I don't think you're going to see a change in kind of rate environment, but maybe on the regulatory environment, I think that creates opportunity. I've said that we've got a strong organic pipeline. It allows us to be selective, allows us to look at opportunities that make sense strategically, but also generate an attractive return. I talked about how ROIC is important for us also. So not just top line, but return on that capital.\nSo we do take a position here of being stewards of that capital. So I'd say, yeah, we're in a great position. We do have some debt to pay down this year, which we will. I don't anticipate rates coming down to the point that we might want to look at refinancing that. So we'll pay off that debt. It's about $1.5 billion this year. But even with that, we're in a great position with our balance sheet to be able to leverage opportunities that we'll see. Talked about them. There's opportunities in MedTech. There's opportunities in diagnostics. And we're in a great position. It allows us to be selective.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research, Evercore\n\nUnderstood. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nJoshua Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and echo Vijay's congrats on a strong finish to the year. Another margin question, just because the operating margin guidance for 2025 was stronger than expected. I think you talked about a lot of the drivers, Robert and Phil, but just continued positive mixture from strong medical device contributions and the strong top-line growth. But I was hoping you may just help us think through just the margin expansion opportunities in EPD, nutrition, and diagnostics, and just with the outsized expansion in 2025. And how should we be thinking about sustained operating margin expansion in 2026 and beyond? And should we be thinking about 50-100 basis points a year? Appreciate you taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, I'd like to get to that pre-pandemic gross margin. I mean, I know we talk a lot about this being behind where we were from a pre-pandemic, but our op margin profile, especially after our guidance for 2025, is actually ahead of that. So we've been able to achieve that through our spending and spending efficiencies. But I think that's the right range to have. I mean, I think we've always had this notion. I mean, I talked about being able to offset FX and things like that and not provide any surprises. That's part of the algorithm there, which is we're just constantly having to address gross margin. It's not like this initiative, either because of inflation, or because of tariffs, or anything like that. It's just we're constantly working to improve gross margins.\nI'd say on the nutrition side, those gross margins, given what we encountered over the last two years, those came down. But if you look at them, they have been improving sequentially, almost like every quarter. We've got a ways to go to get back to where we were in 2022, Josh. That's a little bit more dependent on commodities, freight, and distribution, things like that. But I think the teams have got a really good strategy here of kind of working on cost to serve and even, quite frankly, using some pricing where we felt we had to because of some of the increase in those commodities. So I think the nutrition gross margin is definitely an opportunity that we've got over the next couple of years. The pharmaceutical teams have done an incredible job at maintaining a gross margin under pretty significant FX.\nI mean, they do a fantastic job at offsetting FX. If you look at the margin profile in that business, it's actually increased several couple hundred basis points over the last couple of years. So they've been able to do that also through gross margin. And I think the other element is just ensuring that we keep on driving the MedTech business that have accretive gross margins, quite frankly, across all of those different business units. And if we can continue to do that, then that's how you get to that model of maybe 50 to 100 basis points every single year. That's our target. We committed to 70, and we delivered to 70. We're now committing to 80 for 2025 and getting us closer to where we were pre-pandemic.\nSo, I feel good about what we're doing, the strategy we got in place, the discipline that we have as a management team to review these programs and dedicate time. They don't just happen. We got to make decisions. There's oversight. So, I feel good about it.\n\nJoshua Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nExcellent. Thanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping, Robert, you could go into a little bit more detail on the Structural Heart business. As you kind of break down the pieces of that portfolio, you have a balance of drivers, some more legacy like MitraClip and some that are more emerging categories like TriClip in the tricuspid repair segment. But maybe you could help us think about the evolution of that business, which did very nicely through 2024, and how we should think about that into 2025. And maybe that could just contextualize the broader outlook here. And I appreciate your comments about getting back to the habit of high single-digit top line and double-digit bottom line. But it looks like 2025 does carry some headwinds that may prove to be one-time in nature, like VBP dynamics in China on the diagnostic side, the transient competition in EP.\nSo maybe you could kind of give us some color on Structural Heart, but also help contextualize the growth rate in 2025 as we think about the long term as well?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. It's interesting. The sixth question comes on Structural Heart after we posted a 23% growth. So thank you, David. As I said in my opening comments, I think this is one of the most attractive areas in MedTech. And it's one that we looked at several years ago and said, \"We're going to build truly a market-leading portfolio of products.\" And we're not going to just kind of rely on one platform to kind of drive growth. We're really going to assemble a full area here and look across the entire area. And even in surgical, I mean, I think I look at our Epic valve. The feedback I keep getting on the surgical side of it is it's just doing incredibly well. And it's really a preferred go-to on the mitral side for surgical repair, but replacement.\nBut yeah, I think in the past, David, I think our Structural Heart portfolio was just viewed as MitraClip. And quite frankly, the sales would say, \"Yeah, that's probably the case.\" But as we've been building out the portfolio, building out our stroke prevention with PFO approval, with Amulet approval, and driving growth there, Amulet did very well in Q4 also, grew 25%. Getting into the aortic segment, right, and really being a player there that has established now clinical credibility, whether it's through clinical trials, but also actual real-world usage of the product. I've been seeing some of Navitor cases here in the U.S., and just the feedback has been very, very positive. So building our aortic portfolio there, we're making big investments, whether it's in our clinical trials to build out our indications.\nWe recently talked about, shared that we are developing a balloon expandable TAVR valve, and we want to have a full aortic portfolio. On the tricuspid side, we were one of the leaders there to say, \"Hey, there's no real good transcatheter opportunity here to treat PR.\" TriClip has done very well. It's done extremely well, quite frankly, throughout this year. I think the team has done an incredible job getting approved behind the competitor. I would say right now, our data says that the ratio of repaired to replaced is about 2 to 1, and we're leveraging all of that built-in kind of infrastructure and scale that we already built with MitraClip. So what you see now is a structural heart portfolio, $2.5 billion grown in, let's call it mid-teens, because it is much more diversified and, quite frankly, very competitive products in these high-growth areas.\nSo I think that's going to continue, and we're committed to making these investments. We've got new versions of Amulet to launch. We just got an approval for an updated version of TriClip that ease even more the implant. You're going to see clinical trials read out in this area for labeled expansion indications in TAVR and LAA. So this is an area that I think what you're seeing now, that kind of growth rate coming from the investments and just great execution from the team. So your question was about growth rate and.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah. I was trying to take a second one in there with just to contextualize the 25% growth rate given some one-time-ish headwinds like VBP in China, diagnostics, and the dynamics in EP being potentially kind of transient as well.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, listen, every quarter, every year, there's always going to be some headwind. What we're trying to do here is assemble, David, more tailwinds than headwinds, right? But yeah, I mean, you mentioned one, which is a little bit of a headwind for us in our diagnostic business regarding VBP. That's going to be with us in 2025 as they're rolling out new panels of testing. That's going to go through that. But outside of that, I'd say the diagnostic business is doing very well. Q4 growth rates in most areas were actually higher than the full-year growth rate in those same areas. U.S., Latin America, Europe, even Japan was faster in Q4. So yeah, we do have a challenge, but most companies are going to do. And you know what? We've gone through these, David.\nEvery company goes through a VBP, and what we're trying to do is, okay, we're not going to define the company by having this one kind of headwind. We've got a lot more tailwinds to leverage. We still have to deal with it. We're still managing it. It's still an important part of the business. But the company is more than just VBP in diagnostics in one important market, but just one market. So I think the growth rate is very robust. I mean, 8% of the midpoint on a base of $40-plus billion, I think is pretty strong and pretty good.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nTerrific. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is open.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the question. Nice quarter. I'm curious if you could just sort of step back and talk about the overall health of the MedTech market. I feel like I'm constantly answering questions on things such as volume and price and looking at you delivering mid-teens revenue growth. I think you're seeing something that maybe not everybody is seeing. I'd love to get your view on that. Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, I think it does put us. I mean, the way our portfolio is structured, Joanne, is that it does give us a little bit of a perch, a little bit of a bird's-eye view into the entire healthcare system and the spectrum, right? I think if you're getting questions on MedTech and MedTech growth, I think all you got to do is continue to look at what companies are reporting. And what they're reporting is ultimately what we're seeing in the market, which is it's not a post-COVID pent-up demand. You are seeing a greater focus from, whether consumers or the technologies that are being developed, that are attracting more people into these procedures. So I think what we're seeing here is continued utilization growth, really driven by, whether it's demographics combined with the innovation.\nI mean, what the industry is doing in terms of the innovation that we're bringing to the market, it's pretty spectacular. And the procedures are getting faster. They're getting less invasive. And that's attracting more people to look at these procedures as a real viable first-line option versus guided medical therapy. So I think that's going to continue as long as we continue to see this innovation where we are obviously positioning ourselves pretty strongly in this. And you've seen sequential improvement in the growth rate across, quite frankly, a lot of our businesses in MedTech. So I think the utilization is definitely increasing. I think there's maybe some questions of, okay, what's going to happen with pricing? We've historically seen some price erosion in the past. I'd say over the last couple of years, it's actually been pretty stable. So I don't know how that's going to play out.\nWe've got a scenario here where we believe that with our portfolio, we'll see some pretty stable pricing. But I think utilization combined with stable pricing is what's driving this MedTech growth. And we're seeing it in diagnostics too. A lot of our diagnostic business is actual hospital-based diagnostics. So we're seeing those diagnostic tests and those routine diagnostic tests continue to increase high single, double-digit, low double-digit growth rates in terms of utilization. So I think that MedTech is benefiting from just this increased utilization and focus of consumers wanting to take care of themselves and looking at these technologies as a viable option for treatment.\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for, excuse me, taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter, strong end to the year. Robert, we've talked in the past. I mean, obviously, we talk a lot about MedTech and the high-growth areas, but some areas where you've excelled are the legacy sort of slower growth businesses. I'm obviously thinking CRM being one of those mid- to high-single-digits growth. Can you talk about the approach that you applied in CRM and other legacy businesses? I'm thinking like heart failure, peripheral, and maybe how you're thinking about elevating those growth profiles in 2025, but then also longer term. Thanks so much for taking the question.\nYeah. So one of our strategies that we looked at a couple of years ago, Danielle, was if you looked at our MedTech business, it was growing like 8%, 9%. And that was a combination of probably high-growth areas like EP, structural heart, diabetes, even heart failure. And 40% of the portfolio was relatively flat. And that was mostly our vascular business and our CRM business. And the way we looked at it is to get our MedTech to be best in class, to be able to grow 12%, 13%, 14%, we need to continue the strong growth rate of structural heart, EP, diabetes, etc. But we had to find a way to accelerate the growth rate of our vascular and CRM businesses. And we said, \"If we can get them, these are historically been flat growth markets.\nIf we can get them to grow 5%, the way that would then work out is that we'd be able to elevate our MedTech portfolio to the mid-teens.\" So that's what we've been doing over the last couple of years, and the team has been executing on that. I think on the vascular space, what you've seen us do is kind of use a little bit of a combination of organic and inorganic to accelerate and increase our participation in higher growth areas, specifically in the peripheral side. So I think you started to see that. We've been growing. This quarter was a good quarter. Our target was around 5% for our vascular business by having stronger pipelines and portfolios in that more peripheral space. And you're seeing that now start to happen.\nOn the CRM side, our big strategy here was organic and getting to launch a very comprehensive and be the leaders in leadless. So we launched a single chamber a couple of years ago, launched a dual chamber last year, going to get into conduction and pacing leadless also. And I think that you've seen that over the last two years, our CRM business has grown 7%. And I think we can continue to extend that with the strategy that we're doing, which is to really lead in this area. I actually think that Aveir is probably the most underappreciated opportunity that we have in our portfolio. Look at it right now. You're asking a question towards the end of the call.\nBut I think really what you're seeing is these businesses, the focus, the innovation, the execution, and now you're seeing those start to deliver on that strategy to bring these flat businesses up to at least mid-single-digit growth. I think the team doesn't like that. I characterize them like that. So that's good. I'm glad that they think that they can do better than that. But we've got a lot of opportunity in those big areas, and we think there's innovation to be had in those. So we feel good about it.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nEquity Research Associate, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nOperator, we'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, thanks so much for squeezing me in. Just maybe a follow-up here, given the tech guide that you gave for this year and some of the dynamics in U.S. and overseas sort of tax policy. It'd be great to get your perspective on maybe the direction of where those things are going and how we should think about them for having. Thanks so much.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. Thanks, Matt. There's a lot of narrative at the moment going on. But to your point and to kind of the guide that we referenced in our opening comments here, what we've reflected is all kind of current tax laws, guidance, and geographic mix of where our business growth is coming from, which is about a 150 basis point increase at the midpoint of this guide. That increase in the guide is driven by the increased adoption or the rollout here of Pillar 2 as it's currently enacted in these countries. And so that's what we reflect. We continue to be a good taxpayer, compliant taxpayer, and we'll see how more of this narrative unfolds here. But currently, we're running the operations and reflecting kind of what's known. And as Robert highlighted, absorbing this still within kind of the way we run the business.\nLet me add in on that one, Matt. I think you'll hear this topic come up quite a bit. And if I just take a bigger picture here, I mean, corporate tax rates tend to get hyper-politicized, especially during election years. And it's really not a political debate. In the business world, it's just an expense. It's just another form of expense. And in our world, when one expense goes up, you got to manage, and other expenses have got to come down or maybe not increase at the same rate that they were increasing. And I think what you'll find, what you find sometimes is you get a small handful of companies that maybe have a really low tax rate, and then that viewpoint then gets unfairly applied to everyone in a large company.\nThen you get these predictable narratives of companies that got to pay their fair share, etc. The reality is most companies pay their fair share and then some. I mean, I could talk about Abbott. Our cash taxes are over 20%. And that's one thing that people never talk about, is we use these kind of GAAP rates. But what really matters is cash taxes. That's the money that's going to be paid. But more importantly, U.S. companies, companies like Abbott, we play a key role in making the U.S. economy so successful. We're conducting a significant portion of the R&D in the U.S. We invest billions of dollars in capital projects, which then drive this drive job growth. Our CapEx spend has increased over 60% over the last couple of years. We increased our workforce by 20%.\nWhen you increase that workforce, you're investing $hundreds of millions in employee healthcare and employee benefits. This Pillar II legislation, this Pillar II rule here that got adopted, that's added. I think this rate that Phil's kind of quoted, that's an additional $200 million of expense. That's all it is, is $200 million of expense that is not going to investing in other areas. What's even more challenging is of those $200 million, 2/3 of it is actually going to be paid taxes to overseas countries. That's not really good policy for the U.S. We're absorbing this. We're managing it. I think, as Phil said, there are a couple still some new policies or new issues that we have to kind of work on.\nBut I think the overall goal here has got to be to ensure the competitiveness of U.S. companies and U.S. multinationals. I'm hoping we can get to that during the next 12 months or so. Let me just kind of close then on the call. I think we had a really strong finish to 2024. We exited our Q4 organic sales growth with over 10% top line, 13% EPS, as I said, finished at the higher end of our range, expanded our gross margin, delivered what we said we were going to do. The pipeline continues to be highly, highly attractive, steady cadence of great new growth opportunities. I think to VJ's question, we've got a balance sheet that's going to provide us a lot of strategic flexibility. So I think we're really well positioned to 2025.\nSo with that, I want to thank you for joining us today. Thank you, Operator. Thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott's investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you all for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."

Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star one one keys on your touchtone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott with the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question and answer session. The entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott.\nIt cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMike Comilla\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood Morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks following their comments. We'll take your questions before we get started. Some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024.\nAbbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law on today's conference call.\nAs in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at Abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth.\nUnless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we reported organic sales growth of more than 9% excluding COVID testing sales. We also reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 which exceeded analyst consensus estimates and represents a 16% sequential increase from the first quarter. Based on our performance in the quarter and confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we raised our guidance and now forecast full year organic sales growth, excluding COVID-19 testing sales, to be 9.5% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4.61 to $4.71.\nOur performance continues to be driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio, with growth this quarter led by double-digit growth in medical devices and high single-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition. In addition to benefiting from outperforming expectations on the top line, we are also seeing positive contribution from gross margin expansion coming from continued execution from our supply chain teams, lower commodity costs, and favorable sales mix. I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil Boudreau.\nI'll start with nutrition where sales increased 7.5% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in International Adult Nutrition, and US Pediatric nutrition. International Adult Nutrition continues to perform at a very high level. The five-year compound annual growth rate of this business is more than 10%, which in addition to our market-leading position and commercial execution reflects the impact from positive demographic trends that drive increasing demand for our Ensure, and Glucerna brands.\nThrough the investments we've made to expand capacity, we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on these secular demand trends. On the topic of litigation regarding preterm infant formula and human milk fortifier, Abbott stands by our products and the information provided to the neonatologist specialists who have used them for decades. Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is a terrible gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants and it is devastating to families. However, plaintiff lawyers are advancing a theory that is without merit or scientific support.\nThese products, which are sold for hospital use, are incorporated into a feeding regimen along with human milk by experienced specialists and are an important part of the standard of care for the majority of preterm infants. Their use is supported by medical associations in the United States and other countries around the world. The products and their ingredients have been reviewed and are deemed safe for use by regulators who have also reviewed their labels. There has been no increase in the rate of NEC, meaning these cases have not emerged in response to a trend or any new information yet.\nWe're seeing plaintiffs' lawyers investing millions of dollars in misleading TV advertising in an attempt to move physician decisions from the hospital to the courtroom. Total revenues for these products are about $9 million annually and have remained at that level for the past several years. If these products were no longer available, physicians would be deprived of the vital food that is needed in the NICU. This would create a public health crisis affecting every state across this country. We believe it's important for all who have an interest in health of preterm infants to recognize the need for these products and to take action accordingly.\nMoving to diagnostics, where sales increased 6%, excluded COVID testing. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in core laboratory diagnostics and double-digit growth in point of care diagnostics. In core lab diagnostics, we continue to drive growth through increased adoption and utilization of our market leading systems and global demand for our extensive testing menus across the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and blood screening.\nWhile our Alinity family of diagnostic systems first launched more than six years ago, given the long contract cycles common in the diagnostics industry, we continue to see a benefit in our contract renewal and competitive win rates with several recent large account wins expected to increasingly contribute to growth in the second half of the year.\nTurning to EPD where sales increased 8% in the quarter, EPD continues to deliver at a high level as this business executes its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets where growth is supported by favorable demographic trends including increasing populations, growing middle classes, and an increasing focus on expanding access to health care. As you recall, we identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for this business. With our extensive presence in emerging markets, we have a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to millions of people in emerging markets.\nWe began implementing this strategy last year when we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in the areas of oncology and women's health, with the first of these expected to launch in 2025. We recently completed additional agreements that provide added access to biosimilar versions of market-leading autoimmune disease and GLP-1 medications. Biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market, and we look forward to continue to build one of the most complete portfolios in the industry.\nI'll wrap up with Medical Devices where sales grew 12%. In Diabetes Care FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 20%, and we announced in June that we received FDA approval for two new over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring systems called Lingo and Libre Rio, which are based on Libre's glucose technology that is now used by more than 6 million people around the world. While over-the-counter availability is a new option in the United States, we've been selling over-the-counter in international markets since Libre launched 10 years ago.\nGiven our clear leadership position in these markets, we have demonstrated our ability to tailor solutions, approach, and communication to the various types of users who compose the CGM customer base. Lingo is designed for consumers who are willing to improve their overall health and wellness. The Lingo wearable sensor and app will track glucose, provide personalized data, insights, and coaching to help create and maintain healthy habits. Libre Rio is designed for adults with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin and typically manage their diabetes through lifestyle modifications.\nIn electrophysiology, growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions, including 17% growth in the US, which represents an acceleration compared to the growth in Q1. Growth was broad-based across the portfolio and included 20% growth in ablation catheters. In structural heart, growth of more than 15% reflects an acceleration in growth compared to the first quarter and was led by several recently launched products that are driving new adoption and share capture in attractive high growth areas including TAVR, LAA, and tricuspid repair.\nThis quarter we launched our tricuspid repair device TriClip in the United States and continued our trend of capturing market share in the global TAVR market. In rhythm management, growth of 6% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and in June we announced that we received CE Mark in Europe for Aveir to be used in dual chamber pacing procedures, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. In heart failure, growth of 9% was driven by our market leading portfolio of heart assist devices that offer treatment for both chronic and temporary conditions.\nIn neuromodulation, growth of 8% was driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device, which obtained CE Mark in Europe last year. In vascular, we received FDA approval in late April for our Esprit dissolvable stent, a breakthrough innovation for people who suffer from blocked arteries located below the knee. Esprit is designed to keep the arteries open, deliver a drug to support vessel healing prior to completely dissolving over time.\nNew products like Esprit, combined with the investments that we made in our vascular business both organically and inorganically, have expanded our presence in faster growing areas and increased the future growth outlook for this business. So in summary, we exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom lines, and, as a result, we raised our financial outlook for the year. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin initiatives and, more importantly, our pipeline continues to be highly productive and thus we're well positioned to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I'll now turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nThanks Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results, sales increased 7.4% on an organic basis and increased 9.3% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter we saw the US dollar strengthen versus several currencies which resulted in more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates. At the time of our earnings call in April.\nRegarding other aspects of the P and L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SGA was 27.7% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.61 to $4.71, which represents an increase compared to the guidance range we provided in April. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of more than 2.5% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on Q3 reported sales. Lastly, for the Q3 we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to 1.22. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising you that your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. Again, that's star one one to ask a question. Please stand by. We compile the Q&A roster.\nOur first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Robert, congratulations on a nice quarter and thanks for your comments on the NEC litigation. I'm wondering if you have anything to add on that, Robert. I had one follow-up question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nNo, Larry, I think I said everything I said during my prepared comments. I guess the only thing is I think this is way overblown in terms of its impact, and we're working to obviously defend our position and, you know, working with all the different stakeholders so that they're aware of the situation, the gravity of the situation as it progresses. I've said all I have to say right now in my prepared comments, and if there's a need to kind of get further updates, we will.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right, thanks. Separately, Robert, your EP business grew nicely in the second quarter, 17% in both the US and international. What drove that? What are you seeing with PFA and the different geographies? How are you thinking about the sustainability of that growth before Vault launches? Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Well, I'm seeing what I thought I was going to see. It might be a little different from what some of you thought you were going to see. What we've been seeing is obviously an increase in the market. Right now the market has accelerated, seems to be growing above 20%. So when you look at our 17%. It's lower than the market, but it's actually growing faster than what it was growing pre-pandemic or just after we had done the acquisition. We'll see, I mean, that growth is obviously in value. We'll see if the growth in procedures actually translates.\nWe are actually in more procedures than what we were in the past given our mapping and our teams. I think it's a little bit too early to say if the actual number of procedures is going to significantly increase. The market has accelerated. It's predominantly, I think, price right now with introduction of this new product. It's predominantly being used in de novo procedures, atrial procedures. We think that's about 1/3 of all ablation procedures, Larry. The other 2/3 we continue to see, whether it's redos, VT, SVT ablations.\nIn that case, we continue to see RF really being viewed as the better option for those procedures. We'll see how that's going to translate over time. The penetration is, you know, is around 10% to 15%. It's been pretty stable from the point of view of mapping. You know, I think we haven't seen a real big change of what we saw, you know, during those first couple of months of launch in the last call. So over 90% of cases here in the US are still being used as mapping. We've got a 50% share of those mapping cases. I don't try and look at different types of denominators to get to that market share. I make sure my team just basically has the best access.\nFrom what we're seeing, it's about 50%. RF catheters, similar to what we saw in the last call, still being used in about 20% of the PFA cases. We continue to see that. I think the net effect of all of this is the market's growing, it's accelerating, we've got a strong position. Everything that we talked about in the past about. Our opportunity with the mapping and all the other consumables is there. RF still plays a role. It's still an important role. Our business is actually growing faster than what it was growing before. If you look at 2019, we're about 12%. 2018 was about 14%.\nWe're actually doing better now. So I think that this is positive for the market, which is why we've invested heavily in our PFA portfolio, which you'll start to see hit the market. I'd say next year. I'm not going to try and kind of time the quarter here, but definitely next year. I think this is good. The teams have done an incredible job at executing the strategy that we laid out. So kudos to them.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks so much. Thanks for the comprehensive answer.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BofA Securities\n\nHey, congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to ask about Structural heart. It really stood out this quarter, accelerated from last quarter. Just curious how much of that's on MitraClip recovery? You got TriClip approved early. How much you're seeing from the TriClip site and how much is coming in from some of the other newer products like Amulet and Navitor.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure.\nObviously Triclip.\nWas an important launch and helped accelerate the growth rate. Travis. I think it's pretty broad-based here. I mean, if you look at TriClip, we were ready to go because we had certain built-in advantages in this area. Right. We had the scale, we had the sales force, the manufacturing capacity, so we were ready to go. I think from our estimates here, even though we launched a quarter after our competitor with their system, I think the repair device is already in twice as many accounts as the replacement system. We had a natural kind of built-in advantage here as we went to the market, and the cases are doing very well.\nThe feedback's been very positive, but I think it's really broad-based here. Navitor has done very well both in international markets and in the US. The value proposition is starting to gain more traction. Great clinical profile, excellent hemodynamics, and that's, that's driving a lot of opportunity for us in international and US markets. We shared some data from our registry, from our Japan registry, and great safety also. That's doing very well. Amulet, we saw really nice growth in the US for Amulet this quarter with about 45%. That product is doing very well. We're focusing here on.\nContinued what I would call penetration in same store sales. So we're about close to 20% in the accounts that we're in. We're in about 1/2 of the market here in the US. So our opportunity here is to continue to expand the sales force. Go to newer accounts. That's done very well too. MitraClip, I think we continue to see some continued growth internationally in the US with competitive activity that's kind of slowed down a little bit of the growth. I think with TriClip now coming into the market and gaining traction, we'll be able to provide a value proposition across both repair systems and drive there.\nStructural heart, the growth rate has accelerated from Q1 doing very well. I'd say it's really across a full portfolio approach versus just really trying to sing it out one product or one technology. There's work we have to do in MitraClip, that's clear. In the US, internationally, it's done very well. All the other products that I talked about are doing very well and gaining market share and gaining adoption. That's why you saw structural heart growth rate actually accelerate. I continue to see that that's going to be definitely for the rest of this year and going into next year.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BofA Securities\n\nThat's super helpful.\nThen on your sensor business, how are you thinking about segmenting the market with Lingo versus Libre Rio, and how do you think those markets are going to kind of develop over time, and when you look at your core Libre business, anything to call out, any changes in kind of US versus international market dynamics?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, you're trying to cover a lot of ground there with that question. You could probably spend a whole call going through all of that. I think at its highest level, Libre continues to do very well. There's still a lot of growth opportunity. Obviously the basal opportunity is the biggest one and we're having great progress over there. Even in the MDI segment there's still a lot of penetration to occur. In the MDI segment, I think in the US there's still about a third of multiple daily injectors that aren't using CGM. International developed markets it's around 50%. There's plenty of growth in Libre.\nOur strategy here with Lingo and Libre Rio is just really to have a full portfolio and look at this as a platform where we can expand the user of the sensor technology across different types of diabetes populations. What is probably the larger market, which is people that don't have diabetes. I think if you take right now, I would say we're going to launch it here in the US and we're going to start expanding globally and we'll see how it looks like and what it takes to win there.\nWhat I do know based on the UK experience is that it takes some time to educate and communicate with a patient population that while excited about having new tools to drive healthier habits, they do need some time to understand its use. I think it's a pretty big opportunity for us and one that we've disproportionately invested to be able to get into this position. I think if you take Lingo and you look at US and Western Europe, the adult population there, you got about 400 million people in those markets. If you take a single-digit penetration rate, a few sensors a year, you're looking at a multibillion opportunity there and we're not there yet.\nI think once we've got better understanding of how this is going to work, we'll be better at forecasting it. Just at a high level and looking at it from a total adult population and relatively, I'd say modest penetration rate, that's a pretty big opportunity. Like I said in my comments, we've done this for a while since we've launched internationally and we've learned a lot and we're going to bring that learning experience here to the US so it's an exciting, exciting opportunity for us.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BofA Securities\n\nThanks, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOh, great, thanks. I'll add my congratulations on a good quarter.\nTwo for me, two product questions, maybe just to follow up on the FreeStyle Libre question, Robert, how are you thinking about sort of a holistic drive of advertising and word of mouth for these new products, especially as we move into the OTC versus generating data and how much will be necessary because I just, I think back five years ago and you know, where we are today was probably not in most people's forecasts. With the amount of data we have showing in non-diabetics how beneficial CGM is.\nHow are you thinking about data versus not data, insurance coverage versus not insurance coverage, and how do the markets look one way or the other?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, I don't think so from an insurance coverage perspective. I mean, if you're referring to Lingo specifically for non-diabetes, I think, I think it's going to be, I don't think that that's going to be something that we're building a forecast assuming reimbursement coverage over it. Even though I agree with you, there's nice data that shows. That people that don't have diabetes can benefit from this, Robbie, and it helps sustain behavior modification. Ultimately this is what it is. It's using data to be able to kind of help people that want to stay healthy, give them more information, and ensure that they can refine their habits or change habits.\nI think that that is at the core there. It's really communicating directly with consumers. If you think about the diabetes space and how CGM uptake, you needed both a communication with the patient, and you needed obviously a communication with the physician. I think that that's still important for the non diabetes. I think that some people will want to have some sort of recognition from the healthcare professional that this might be a good investment to do in. The key thing here is just the utilization. I don't think you're going to see people that don't have diabetes use this as a sensor 365 days a year.\nI said, if they're using it a couple times a year, there's still a benefit and we'll be generating data on this over time. I think it's going to be important to generate data even if it's not to communicate to payers to get reimbursement. Even if it's to communicate to the physicians, the primary care, and the direct consumers that there's a value here of doing that. I think the key thing here is personalization and how do you personalize information and the data and the coaching?\nThe strategy here is, yeah, you're going to have to use TV to be able to communicate, but I don't think, given our experience here, that you can just go on TV and blast TV advertising and you'll get this big uptake, and you're going to have to do some on-the-ground kind of guerrilla marketing, let's call it like that, together with TV advertising, to really be able to open up the market and then sustain it, sustain its use.\nThat's how we're thinking about it, and that's why we have a separate team, completely removed from the Libre and the diabetes team, that they're focusing on how to execute this strategy. I think it's more of a kind of S-curve growth versus kind of an out of the gate. I know that everybody's focused on what the sales are in the second half and whether it's me or the competitor. I think the bigger picture here is like, hey, there's a really big opportunity here, and if we do it right, it's an opportunity that will be more than a flash in the pan. It'll sustain itself, and it could become standard.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat color. One more for me, Aveir and the leadless pacing, particularly the dual chamber now with coverage, I think, is an underappreciated opportunity. Maybe if you don't mind, spend a minute there. How you see this market evolving and what's the early feedback on the launch so far? Thanks.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nUltimately, I think this whole leadless is going to change the growth trajectory of our CRM business. If you look at CRM, it grew 7% last year. It's grown 7% the first half of this year. As previously a flat business. We've been doing that, you know, I would say with good success on dual, but I wouldn't say that it's, at full cycle yet. Because one of the things that we're working on is ensuring that, you know, we're doing the training and we're getting physicians comfortable with the procedure. It's a completely different procedure versus what, the entire industry has been accustomed to.\nWe're using mapping, we're going into the groin vs doing pockets above the chest. It is a little different and we're focusing on that. That being said, we've been able to accelerate the growth rate just with a single chamber. I think right now, after two years, we probably capture about 50 share. But to your point, the bigger opportunities in dual and the procedures are going great. And once physicians get several under their experience with several of them, they're talking about, okay, how do we accelerate this?\nAn opportunity to drive more patients into it. We want to make sure we've got a pretty large base of well-trained and great-outcomes physicians across the United States.\nListen, this is a $3 billion global segment, and there really hasn't been much innovation in it. Here you have something that's truly unique and differentiated. I'd say once we feel that we've gotten to a point where we feel good about the capabilities, the training, and the amount of physician coverage that exists, this is definitely a product that I can see going a little bit more mainstream, having more direct consumer communications.\nBecause of the value proposition it affords them. I think this is a great opportunity for us. It might be underappreciated.\nWith the market, but it is definitely appreciated amongst me, the device team, and the CRM team, and we're working hard to get to that point where we can really let it go strong.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nMedtech Senior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for taking the questions, Robert. I wanted to just start asking about just kind of this multi-year trajectory for Abbott. You've been delivering top-tier organic revenue growth performances over the last two years and potentially have a two-year double-digit stack comp year. I think the team has been publicly stating that potentially the business could outpace pre-pandemic levels, which in that 7% to 8% range. I think during this call you've put forward a lot that supports that type of trajectory. But maybe just to reiterate your confidence level there, and is this kind of outpacing of pre-pandemic levels over the medium term dependent on M&A, or is this the core business with internal development programs that's really going to drive this top-tier growth out over the next couple of years?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nIs that the attempt to get to the 2025 kind of question?\nI'd say. Listen, we've been saying that we made investments during COVID to accelerate the company, make it stronger, build our portfolio so we could accelerate the growth. If you look at the last six quarters, we've been delivering top tier.\nHigh single-digit, double-digit growth. And this is on a company that's doing $40+ billion of revenue. So I think that's pretty impressive. If you look at our MedTech portfolio, it was the fastest growing MedTech portfolio last year, fastest growing in the first quarter of this year. We'll see what happens this second quarter. We positioned the company to be able to deliver this. Do I think that we can continue to deliver this top-tier performance.\nThroughout this year and into next year? Yeah, I absolutely do. Because of what we built and then just the evidence and the proof points that we've been able to reliably and sustainably deliver that. We feel good about our ability. The markets that we're participating in are attractive. So there are markets that we lead, and when those markets grow, like our leadership benefits. There are markets that are attractive that we're entering, and there's plenty of opportunity for market share gain.\nThere are markets that are attractive that we're building, and there's no real clinical opportunity, or there's a clinical opportunity for our products that we're developing to come in there. So as we build those markets, that, they become attractive, and our position gets solidified, and I think that framework applies to all of all four of our business units have opportunities across those three frameworks. On the M&A front, yeah, if we're able to find an asset that makes sense strategically to us, makes sense financially, that could add even further to that growth, and we've got the balance sheet to be able to do that.\nIt's not dependent, as I told you, it's really focused on the organic side to be able to deliver this top-tier growth.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nUnderstood, and thanks for that answer. Another kind of high level question you probably receive regularly, but just wanted: it's our understanding as well that your team, the board, every year, at least once a year, maybe multiple times a year, is just considering the strategic fit of the four major business units for Abbott. Maybe just to get an update on your thoughts on the business combinations and the potential for spins down the line. Thanks a lot.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. I don't think there's like this one moment in the year that we do it. We're doing it on an ongoing basis. The company has a history of ensuring that the portfolio that is assembled is not only delivering value to patients, governments, and health care systems, but it's also delivering value to our shareholders. We historically haven't shied away from asking ourselves questions and answering those questions. If there's an opportunity to create value through addition or through subtraction, then the company has shown that it's ready to do that.\nI think the two fundamental questions about that is, is there an opportunity to create value for shareholders, and is there somebody that could do better with our businesses?\nRight now you look at what we're doing with our businesses; we're performing at the highest level across all of the four segments. We'll see what happens during this earnings season here. But I feel very good about the team and what they're doing. Obviously there are areas that we could always do better, and we focus on that. At the highest level, all four of our sectors have been delivering outstanding growth, market-leading growth, and quite frankly innovating and fulfilling our purpose and our mission, which is to help people live healthier lives. I like the diversity.\nThe diversity provides both defense and offense capabilities, and as long as you're managing them within each one of their segments, allocating capital that is proportionate to their growth and their industry, and we spend a lot of time managing all four segments, then I think we're doing a good job at running them.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you and good morning, everybody. I was hoping to ask one question on the P&L side and one on the capital allocation side. Maybe I'll start with the P&L here. Kind of look at the guidance here for the back half of the year. Our math implies it's something like 100 basis points plus of year-over-year operating margin expansion and about 9% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. Can you maybe talk through some of the drivers that underpin that margin expansion on a year-over-year basis? Obviously we, obviously we saw a turn here in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1, but maybe walk us through some of the drivers that get to that improved margin and earnings growth performance.\nIn the back half of the year. Sure, I'll let Phil take that.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nYeah.\nGood morning, David. You know, Robert touched on opening comments here on some of that expansion already this year. We're in a pretty unique position relative to some of our peers in terms of our op margin profile that we're already back to pre-pandemic levels, and we did that strategically through managing spend through the ups and downs of COVID testing. As we talked earlier this year, Q1 was really the last big comp on sort of COVID testing impacts on sales and profiles with respect to margin expansion and gross margin in particular.\nThe guidance for the year is around 75 basis points as you highlight some progress here and more to go. The trajectory is there. We're focused on the things that we can control and execute on. In particular, some of this great portfolio contribution from our sales top-line performance, particularly in accretive businesses, is a contributor here, and one that we anticipate will continue to expand here throughout the year. We have dedicated teams in each one of our businesses focused solely on gross margin improvement, productivity yield improvements, cost reductions, and innovation that brings accretion to the portfolio.\nAll of those elements are contributors here, quarter in and quarter out, and continue to contribute through the rest of the year. Then we also have elements we've talked about, some of the cycles that we go through, be it in commodities markets and the like, some of the inflation the last few years that are starting to sort of stabilize and normalize. We're seeing freight and distribution profiles normalize and start to be more tailwinds as opposed to headwinds. We've also seen in commodity markets as well things not only stabilizing but coming down, and also contributing to tailwinds to gross margin, and anticipate that to persist here as well.\nThe combination of all of those contribute to the confidence here and continuing to drive the top tier sales performance but also expand margins throughout the year.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSuper helpful, thank you. Then maybe just on the capital allocation side, maybe thinking about the other side of Josh's question, if you look across the sector here, we've seen M&A pick up a little bit in the second quarter. I think there were $2 billion plus transactions announced with sort of transaction multiple starting to trend toward the lower end of historical levels. But could you maybe give us your latest perspective on the M&A environment and how you're thinking about capital allocation as your cash balance continues to build nicely here?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, on the capital allocation more broadly, listen, I've been pretty clear every call about we have a balanced approach, right? I know you guys cover a lot of companies that have different approaches. Our approach is balanced, and we believe that that balanced approach benefits the long-term shareholder.\nOne of the metrics that I believe, David, is a good measure of evaluating capital deployment effectiveness is ROIC. If you look at ROIC over the last three years.\nWe've averaged around high teens, and that's on the higher end of kind of the medtech peers that we often get compared to. We believe that ROIC is a good measure of how effectively we're deploying the capital, and we look at a balanced approach. Right. So are there internal capital investments that drive future growth? We've been talking about all these great opportunities we have, and we're funding them, and they're great returns. Debt pay down, we don't have much this year, but we took care of some towers last year because we obviously didn't want to refinance them.\nDividend and buybacks are. The dividend is definitely core to our investment identity. We intend to continue to grow our dividend. So that is a balanced approach.\nEven with all of that, we also, as you probably see, we have opportunity from a balance sheet perspective to deploy that from an M&A perspective. We've been spending time talking about our strong top line and the pipeline that we've developed, and that allows us to be a little bit more selective. You look at other transactions that happened, and you have to ask, okay, what's the strategy behind that? A lot of the times you can see you're having to sustain your growth rate. If you're in the business of driving top line through acquisitions, then you got to, that's part of your model.\nYou, you're going to have to keep doing that whether the valuations are right or wrong or not right. But we look at these strategic fit, can they generate an attractive return?\nCan we make the business better that we're acquiring? We don't want to be just a holding. I think that we've shown that when we do directly our acquisitions, that's the framework, fits in strategically, generates a nice return and we tend to operate them or add value to them than when they were standalone.\n\nDavid Roman\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAppreciate all the perspective and thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter here. Robert, one of the things that struck me when we spoke, I have two product questions, product specific questions when we last spoke is how you're looking at the sustainability of historically slower growing businesses and areas exposed to historically slower growing markets. Obviously I'm thinking CRM.\nCan you talk a little bit about the strategy there? Obviously there is a big part of that and just lead spacing in general and how sustainable, I mean it's like been multiple quarters now of organic growth in the mid plus single digit range. Then just one follow up, another product question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, well that was part of our strategy as we looked at our MedTech portfolio. You've obviously got high growth drivers there with EP, structural heart, diabetes, cancer care, neuro, heart failure. We looked at CRM and vascular, and those are more flat businesses. So the combination of that is you had a MedTech portfolio that was growing 7%, 8%, maybe 9% a quarter. To get to double-digits we needed those two businesses to get at least to mid single-digits. Right. I'd say on the CRM side, our strategy there is to really focus on Aveir leadless pacemaking. Leadless pacemakers.\nThere's a pipeline of products there. I don't want to tip my hand here, but we do Aveir dual chamber and stop there.\nThe teams have gotten R&D programs to continue to advance those and even to look at the ICD market also. What are the opportunities that we can do to innovate? There is space to innovate in that market, and that, for me, is important: the diabetes market. Fifteen years ago, people would say, well, gee, that's a slow growth market. Well, now look at it. If you focus on the innovation, on meeting needs, unmet needs, you can turn a market around from a business perspective. As I said in my comments, we've been repositioning the portfolio to more higher growth areas, peripheral areas, endovascular areas, but we started that a little bit later than what we did in CRM.\nI expect to start to see our vascular business start to also contribute to a higher growth rate the same way that CRM is. That just kind of bolsters our entire medtech portfolio and gets us into that 12%, 13% kind of growth rate. At least that's our target.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Then the follow-up question is on the structural heart side of things. I know Amulet's been on the market for a little bit here, but my impression is that now it's kind of like Abbott's no longer fighting with one hand tied behind their back. Can you talk a little bit about that? Your 45% growth, I think you said in the quarter, where to from here for Amulet. Thanks so much for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYes, it was a great quarter. I think the team's kind of hitting its stride right now. As I said, our focus here was really to kind of drive adoption in the centers that we were at versus expansion. The competitor has expanded the market. There's probably about 800 centers that are doing these implants and we're probably in about half of it now. That's good, right? That provides a market expansion dynamic here in the US.\nI think, I mean I'm really encouraged by some of the data that I'm seeing. I think it starts with the data, right? We had patient registry data come out where it showed that 95% closure rates were achieved post implant and sustained after 45 days. 90% of closure success rate using Amulet.\nFor patients that actually fail to achieve proper closure rate with a competitive product. So I think that there's an opportunity here for our value proposition, and then we've got to continue to invest. You know, we are already investing on our, you know, next generation Amulet, you know, focusing on ease of use, focusing, and we'll maintain our superiority here that we believe we have regarding the sealing of the LAA. We're investing in clinical trials. Obviously we've been public about Catalyst, which is a trial that will compare Amulet to NOAC.\nAntiarrhythmia treatment. So this is an exciting market for us and we're going to continue to invest in it. And ultimately it comes down to really looking at surrounding the electrophysiologist with the most comprehensive portfolio, whether it's on pacemakers and ICDs, structural heart interventions with, stroke preventions, and then obviously, you know, ablations and AF treatment. At its highest level, you know, that's the important side here is Amulet fits an important role. Even though we reported a structural heart, it's really playing a role here to surround the physician, the EP with the tools that they need to advance care.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nMike Comilla\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nOperator. We'll take one more question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nHi Robert, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a nice sprint here. I want to touch on biosimilars. You know, you brought this up on the call.\nCan you elaborate on your strategy there? Are you planning to manufacture these products? Is Abbott going to be a CDMO in that space or do you plan to launch your own biosimilars? Or is this more of Abbott being a distributor in taking advantage of your brand presence in emerging markets? What is Abbott's role in that place and how do you size that market opportunity for Abbott? When should that start contributing to Abbott?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. This is one where I'd say there's a couple phases to the strategy.\nThe core premise of this BJ is if you look at the emerging markets and the disease prevalence that exists in these emerging markets, they're no different than the disease prevalence in the US or Europe. I mean, you could look at some of them are higher, et cetera. In general, there's an opportunity to bring these biologics into the emerging markets. For a variety of reasons, those markets have not been a priority for the originators. Their main focus has obviously been.\nIn the international developed markets, US, Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, et cetera. This provides just a patient need opportunity that we want to size up. What we've seen we have done some more regional biosimilar deals that we've launched. What we've seen is that the growth of the molecule grows significantly.\nOnce a biosimilar enters in terms of penetration into a patient population. It's a different dynamic in developed markets, as we know, but in emerging markets, the category really expands. What we wanted to do is to say, okay, before we start to think about manufacturing, before we start to think about that, we want to be able to understand.\nWhat is the uptake of these products once you go ahead and?\nPutting a concerted effort to developing these types of products in emerging markets. It fits right into our wheelhouse where we've got relationships with governments, we have relationships with physicians, and we've got relationships with the distribution area. The question is, how can you do it, and how can you execute that strategy, with that's capital efficient, and doesn't erode kind of gross margin of that business? I give a lot of kudos to the team because they've really been able to position our presence in these markets.\nAs an advantage to these players that really aren't focusing on emerging markets. They're focusing more on the opportunity that exists in developed markets. Now they can partner with one single company, reputable company, to be able to use that capacity in other markets. I'd say we're in the phase right now of okay, is there sustainability to this? The deals that we've done give us access. Our gross margin is not dilutive, and we're going to see how it goes. As you think about the ramp up of what we've got in the pipeline, we'll start launching in 2025. But you look at some of the big molecules that will come up.\nFor us, 2026, 2027, that's, I think, when some of these very large oncology opportunities that we have will play a huge role for us and accelerate the growth.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director of Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nThere. That's helpful. Maybe one last one on capital deployment. I know it's been asked. I'm curious on share repurchases, you know. You guys have done phenomenal growth. Street doesn't seem to be giving credit. Why not? Didn't see any share repurchase in first half. Why is Abbott being conservative on share repurchases?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYes, well, we've done a lot of share repurchases over the last couple of years, let's say, catching up a little bit to maybe not doing as much repurchasing after the two, the two acquisitions we did in 2017 and 2018.\nIf you look at our repurchases and dividends, it's been about $20 billion that we've returned over the last four years. $20 billion in dividends and buybacks, and that accounts for a good amount of our free cash flow over the last couple of years to our shareholders. So we're not. The year's not over.\nAgain we'll see opportunities. We've got plenty of opportunities to be able to do that. I'd say I think we've done a pretty good job here at returning cash.\nBack to our shareholders over the last couple of years and that commitment will maintain. So I'll just close here. This was a great quarter for us and quite frankly a great quarter in connection with five quarters before that where we delivered above-market growth. I'm really pleased with our continued strong performance. We've raised our sales outlook, our EPS ranges for the second time this year. The toughest COVID test comps are now behind us. I look forward to not having to. We'll obviously report our COVID testing sales, but you'll still start to see those comps start to dwindle away now, which means then that our EPS is back to growth.\nI think one of the questions there about showing our EPS exiting the year in high single digits, double-digit kind of range, and getting back to our formula; that's what we're interested in, and we've got a lot of positive momentum here heading into the second half of the year. With that, we'll wrap up and thank you for joining us.\n\nMike Comilla\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's Conference Call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott's investor relations website at AbbottInvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect everyone. Have a wonderful day,"

Welcome to Abbott's Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. During the question-and-answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star one one keys on your touch-tone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott.\nWith the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Funk, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, which was above analysts' consensus estimates. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance ranges for both earnings per share and sales growth. We now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to 4.70, and organic sales growth excluded COVID testing-related sales of 8.5% to 10%. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, was 10.8% in the quarter, which represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\nThe strong start to the year was driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio, including growth of 14% in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals. In addition to exceeding expectations of both top and bottom lines this quarter, we accomplished a number of objectives across the pipeline, including obtaining several new product approvals and achieving important clinical trial-related milestones.\nI'll now summarize our Q1 results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in pediatric nutrition, driven by continued market share gains in the US infant formula business and growth across our international portfolio of infant formula, toddler, and adult nutrition brands. In January, we launched a new nutrition shake called Protality, which provides nutritional support for adults pursuing weight loss.\nAs people eat less and lose weight from taking GLP-1 medications, undergoing a weight loss surgery, or following a calorie-restricted diet, a portion of what is lost is lean muscle mass, which plays an important role in overall health. The combination of high protein and essential vitamins and minerals that Protality offers can help people preserve muscle while pursuing their personal weight loss goals. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. This quarter was a continuation of EPD's impressive trend of strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of the last five quarters.\nIn addition to a strong track record of top-line growth, this business has delivered equally impressive gains on the bottom line, with an operating margin profile last year that reflected more than 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2019. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased more than 5%, excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in diagnostics continues to be led by the adoption of our market-leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies, and blood screening facilities.\nOur development efforts in diagnostics focus on developing new systems and creating new tests that play an important role in making healthcare decisions, expand the accessibility of testing, and deliver a result as fast as possible. In April, we received FDA approval for a point-of-care diagnostic test that can help determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes. The test is run on our portable i-STAT Alinity instrument, which allows concussion testing to move beyond the traditional hospital setting and into urgent care centers, physician offices, and other locations that are closer to the patient.\nWith nearly five million people in the US going to the emergency room to be checked for suspected concussion each year, we believe this test has the potential to transform the standard of care for concussion testing. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14%. In diabetes care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. As I previously mentioned, Libre has several new growth opportunities that will help continue to fuel the strong sales trajectory we have forecasted.\nOne of those growth opportunities relates to the continued expansion of reimbursement coverage for Libre for individuals who use basal insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Last year, we announced that Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France to include all people who use basal insulin as part of their diabetes management. During Q1, Libre obtained reimbursement from a select number of institutional payers in Germany for basal insulin users who also use oral diabetes medication to manage their condition.\nThese select public and private payers cover a limited number of the approximately one million basal insulin users in Germany, but this is an encouraging sign of the potential for further coverage expansion not only in Germany but across other European markets. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10.5% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart, and continued acceleration in our cardiac rhythm management and vascular portfolios.\nIn electrophysiology, sales grew 18%, driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions and across all major product categories, including double-digit growth in ablation catheters and cardiac mapping-related products. We continue to make great progress toward bringing our innovative PFA catheter, Volt, to market. In March, we completed enrollment in our CE marked clinical study, putting us on track to file for international approval before the end of the year.\nWe also recently began enrolling patients in our US clinical trial called Volt PFA, which will generate the data needed to support an FDA approval filing. In structural heart, growth of 13% was led by strong performance in several high-growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, mitral, and tricuspid repair. Structural heart is an area that we have invested in over the past years in order to create a diversified portfolio that can sustainably deliver double-digit growth.\nIn the past, we relied almost exclusively on MitraClip to drive the growth, but today, the portfolio and growth are more balanced and reflect increasing contributions from newer products like Navitor, Amulet, and TriClip. In April, we received FDA approval for TriClip, a first-of-its-kind heart valve repair device designed for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation or a leaky tricuspid valve.\nData from the clinical trial supporting this approval demonstrated that patients who received TriClip experienced a significant improvement in the severity of their symptoms and quality of life. We're excited to now offer this life-changing treatment option to people in the United States that suffer from this condition. In rhythm management, growth of 7.5% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. Aveir has rapidly captured market share in the single-chamber pacing segment of the market and is now being used for dual-chamber pacing, which is the largest segment of the pacing market.\nThis revolutionary technology is helping to deliver growth rates in our rhythm management business that significantly exceed the overall growth in this market. Lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 17%, driven by Eterna, a rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. In January, we announced the launch of Liberta, the world's smallest rechargeable deep brain stimulation device, which is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. So in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom lines.\nAnd as a result, we raised the midpoint of our sales and EPS guidance ranges. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives, and we're seeing strong returns from the investments we're making across our growth platforms. Our pipeline has continued to be highly productive, delivering several recently new product approvals, and we're very well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I'll turn over the call to Phil.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our Q1 results, sales increased 4.7% on an organic basis, which, as expected, includes the impact of year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.9% on Q1 sales.\nDuring the quarter, we saw the US dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in exchange having a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.7% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 29.4% of sales in Q1. Lastly, our Q1 adjusted tax rate was 15%.\nTurning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to 4.70, which represents an increase at the midpoint of the range compared to the guidance range we provided in January. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8.5% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2.5% on full-year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on second-quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the Q2, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 to 1.12. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising you that your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. Again, that's star one one to ask a question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice Q1 here. Two for me. I'll just ask them both upfront. First, Robert, we almost never see Abbott raise guidance, particularly on the top line in Q1. Looking back over the past, I don't know, five, 10 years, it's very rare. So first part is, what gave you the confidence to raise the midpoint of the guidance this early on in the year?\nThen second, obviously, there's been a lot of concern during the quarter with competitors' loss in a case for NEC as it relates to infant nutrition. I was hoping you could address that. What's your stance on the ongoing litigation? I think there's about 1,000 cases that have been filed. Any upcoming data points or timelines we should be looking for? Thanks a lot.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure, Robbie. So let's go first to your question on the guidance. Yeah, you're right. I guess I had to go back and take a look at that. I think the last time we did raise in Q1 was in 2016. I'd say the framework here, Robbie, as we've always done, is we set a guidance at the beginning of the year, which we believe is top-tier. Then throughout the year, we want to beat that guidance, right?\nWe consider top-tier to be high single-digit, double-digit EPS growth. That's obviously excluding the COVID testing portion, which is what investors are really more focused on. So that was the guidance that we set a couple of months ago back in January. We'll target always have that top-tier guidance and find the appropriate balance between the opportunities and obviously the challenges that bracket that range.\nIf you remember, in January, I said I thought that there was more opportunities than risks. I think that some of the risks that we saw in January, I still think they haven't gone away. They're still there, whether it's geopolitics or whether it's FX, those are still there. Clearly, the performance of the business continues to be very, very strong. In some of our businesses, a lot of our businesses are actually accelerating in performance. So as I said in my comments, five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here.\nSo you look at each of the businesses: EPD, three consecutive years of double-digit growth, great margin expansion. The teams are now working to be able to introduce biosimilars in all the markets that we're participating in. Nutrition has done an incredible job at recovering share and growing our adult business.\nWe've grown a lot over $1 billion versus 2019. Diagnostics continues to have a great track record here of outperforming the market. We've got some great large account wins both in the US and internationally that we're rolling out into this year. Medical devices, I mean, what can I tell you? It's just been a real strong performer. The teams have done an incredible job there.\nLast year, we were the fastest-growing med tech company, at least from what I've seen from our guidance and from the other guidances in the market. That's what it seems to be again this year. So you put all that together, plus the pipeline that's been contributing to an accelerated level, great new product approvals. I put all that together, and I just feel that this type of performance that we deliver just gives us the confidence for the remainder of the outlook of the year. So we felt comfortable raising the guidance again in Q1, which is, as you pointed out, something that we don't usually do.\nI continue to believe going into Q2, as we move through, that there's probably more opportunities than risks here as we move forward. So I guess that's the framework of raising our guidance in Q1, which is something that we usually don't do. Just great performance and great momentum. Then your other question was regarding the net cases. I'd say from a date, yeah, we have some court cases that will happen in July. So that's maybe a milestone that we want to look at.\nBut if you were asking me about kind of our framework of how we look at this, I'd say for decades, we've provided specialized nutrition products that help doctors. I think that's a key thing here. It helps doctors provide the lifesaving nutrition to the premature infants. How you feed a premature infant, it's a medical decision, Robbie. Healthcare providers, they're going to use a range of options to meet the unique needs of each baby.\nThat includes mother's milk. That includes pasteurized donor's milk. That also includes pre-term infant formula. Because where mother's milk is not available, there is not a sufficient supply of donor milk to satisfy the nutritional needs of all of these premature infants that are born in the US. Quite frankly, even when they're available for some premature infants, human milk may lack some of the calories, the proteins, the vitamins, etc., that are necessary to support the nutritional needs of the premature infants. That mother's milk needs to be fortified in order to boost the nutritional output.\nThe medical community considers these products to be a critical part of the standard of care for feeding premature infants. Most of the societies, when you read their positions, consider it a standard of care to use these products. The doctors who work in the NICUs have used our products for decades, and they continue to do so today. Countless babies, Robbie, have benefited from these products, life-saving experiences over many, many years. There are clinical studies that have repeatedly established that these products are safe.\nSo these litigation cases, they're really seeking to advance a theory promoted by plaintiff lawyers that distorts the science and it distorts everything that we know. It's not supported by the medical community. So we're preparing for our cases to be able to kind of lay out the facts, the science, and the data. We stand behind our products.\n\nRobbie Marcus\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAppreciate it, Robert. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Managing Director and Medical-Device and Healthcare Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning. I'll echo Robbie's congratulations on the strong start to the year here. So Robert, I just wanted to focus on EP. So multi-part question here, but just one. So the EP business grew nicely in the Q1 in the US and outside the US. Can you talk about what drove that, what you're seeing with PFA and the different geographies, your expectations for your EP business going forward before the Vault launch? Just lastly, so it sounds like we should expect Vault approval in Europe sometime next year based on the filing date. Just want to confirm that. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Yeah. Like I said in my opening comments, we completed the trial. There's a six-month follow-up, Larry. So that means that we will be on target here to file for CE mark by the end of this year. Then it's just going to depend on that process. So I think that's probably our anchor point here is getting the filing in before the end of the year. Yeah. I mean, I'm not surprised by our EP growth.\nI know many on the call might be, but I'm not surprised. First of all, it's an important therapy. It's an under-penetrated disease. So we know there's plenty of growth in this segment. As a result of that, it's highly competitive, right? But we haven't been surprised by the growth. If you look at PFA, it's been in Europe for three years.\nIf you average our growth rate over the last three years in Europe, we've been growing mid-teens. The growth remains broad-based. It was broad-based in Europe again this quarter where we saw double-digit growth in ablation catheters. So not just on the mapping side, on the ablation catheter side also, but then also great growth on the mapping side. Yeah, this technology has now come to the US.\nI think we probably had maybe two months of seeing the technology be rolled out here in the US. I think the competitors have been very aggressive here in terms of bringing the technology to the accounts in the US. I can say we've mapped a lot of those cases, Larry. I'm not going to say we've been in every single case, but I'd say a vast majority of the cases we've been in there.\nThere are some similarities to Europe, but there are some differences to Europe. I think one of the things that we saw in Europe was that there was this inclination to use the technology starting off as kind of a one-shot. That had an impact more on the cryo business than I would say on the RF side. That's what we saw in our mapping cases. We saw here, at least in the first couple of months, that's where a large portion of those cases occurred. At least the ones that we mapped were in places where they were traditionally using cryo.\nI think the difference that we saw a little bit in Europe is that at least 90% of the cases that we were part of, directly or indirectly, were using mapping. That number was lower in Europe. So that's probably a little bit of the difference I saw here in the US. That bodes well for us, right? Our EnSite system, our mapping system, our mapping catheters are widely viewed as an excellent option here for mapping these PFA cases. We have a large installed base. Customers are familiar with it. Don't need to make room. Don't need to fight for capital. We've got best-in-class clinical support. The architecture here is open, as I've said in previous calls.\nSo it integrates well with these PFA catheters. We actually recently released a software upgrade last month that provides even better visualization to these catheters and potential for faster procedures and less fluoro time. So I think this is a perfect combination, quite frankly, in a time where there's going to be a market transition. There's a lot of new products. There's a lot of choices.\nWhen you have a situation like that, I think flexibility is key. That's what we heard from our customers. One data point that I thought was also interesting to your question of what helped drive that. In the cases that we were part of and we saw, we also observed that an RF catheter was pulled in about a quarter of the cases that we saw. So on top of the PFA catheter, an RF catheter was pulled to do touch-ups, etc. So I'd say right now, everything that we've seen in Europe on the positive side is happening. Then I think there's some interesting dynamics here in the US that could be favorable for us also. It's still very early.\nIf I look at March, we had probably one of our most, when we look at cases per day, that was probably one of our highest months. So so far, so good. We're excited about the technology. We're excited about our program. We released data on our program in some recent medical meetings that occurred. The feedback from those that have been using our product are very positive. The integration with EnSite, including the tissue contact force algorithm and the visualization, all of that is seen as a real promise and a differentiator versus what's being used today, so.\n\nLarry Biegelsen\n\nSenior Managing Director and Medical-Device and Healthcare Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is now open.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cowen\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Great to see the strong start here. A few more results. Robert, I was hoping to just ask first on Libre. Just internationally, any other payment or coverage decisions that we should have on our radar in various countries? Sounds like you've made some nice progress already in Germany. Then in the US, I was hoping you could just help or share your thoughts on the share gain opportunity in the integrated pump segment of the CGM market versus the share loss risk in the type 2 non-insulin cash pay segment with a competitive launch here early in 2024. I just have one follow-up.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. On your international question, I mean, it's always difficult to forecast exactly by month or quarter coverage kind of payment decisions. I can tell you, though, that the team has a full global map of all the work that's being done regarding clinical information and negotiations, etc. So it's difficult to kind of forecast it. What I have said is on previous calls and in some of my prepared remarks that I think you're going to see this just this build that will be occurring globally in the market as the data proves and shows the clinical, medical, and health economic benefit by reimbursing for this patient population.\nI think we're well positioned there. Internationally, I think we got some pretty large markets already: Canada, Japan, France, Italy, Germany. Those are markets that are either fully reimbursed or starting their process. Like I said, I think you'll see as the year progresses, whether it's in medical events or just as the year progresses, I think you'll see more coverage decisions. Maybe they don't get splashy big PR news, but we are seeing continuous increasing there on that. On the US side, I guess I disagree with your premise that I'm going to be trading share gains on the pump side for share losses on the non-insulin side.\nI mean, right now, I'm looking at the data, third-party audited data, seven out of every 10 new prescriptions for this basal population, which is primarily served by the primary care channel. Seven out of 10 are going to Libre. I think our product's going to get even more competitive and compelling. So I think this is a great opportunity.\nOur objective here is to maintain kind of our shared dominance and our shared leadership as it results in this patient segment. We do have an opportunity here to participate a little bit more actively in what is a little bit more of a smaller segment of the population, but nonetheless a very important one, which is the AID and the market system. So there's 150 to 200 thousand new starts a year.\nThere's an opportunity for shared gain also of existing users. I think that the opportunity to bring a dual analyte sensor with ketones. We showed some data at ATTD this year that showed the safety benefit or the value proposition of a dual analyte sensor for AID system. So I think that's going to be a compelling value proposition. Then we're working with all the pump companies here.\nI think as the year progresses, we'll see connectivity occur, whether it's with Libre 2 Plus, our streaming product, or whether it's with Libre 3. So this is an area that we're focusing on. It's a new segment for us to compete in. I don't think that we're going to be taking our eye off the ball as it relates to the basal opportunity that exists, so.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cowen\n\nUnderstood. Thanks. I just wanted to ask on the transcatheter tricuspid market. Congratulations on the TriClip approval. There's been some questions around the patient opportunity breakdown between TEER, TriClip, and replacement with Evoque. Maybe just any internal team thoughts on that patient opportunity breakdown. Then anything you could share on the pricing strategy for TriClip in the setting of competitor pricing. It's a replacement device at a significant premium. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, I'm not going to comment on our pricing strategy here just for competitive reasons. It is a differentiated and novel technology. So there is an opportunity. We'll have to see how this all plays out. You've got 510(k) submissions and all this stuff going on right now. What we're focused on here is launching a product and getting cases ramped up.\nThat's what's happening. I got some feedback yesterday from the team after a couple of weeks. Real nice cadence of growth. We're obviously focusing our initial cases on most of the accounts that were part of our pivotal trial. Just real nice cadence growth there and great feedback from physicians and patients post-surgery. I mean, if you're trying to poke at what's the breakdown going to be about replace and repairless, I think it's good to have options.\nI guess my view here is that I believe that probably safety is a key driver here to start off with. I think TriClip has shown a very strong, excellent safety record, both in clinical trials and real-world use. So I think that's going to play a key role here in determining repair versus replace. I expect repair or TriClip at least to be the preferred option unless the valves are too damaged.\nThen obviously, replacement is the only remaining option. There's a large pool of patients here. You've got 5 million people globally, two million people here in the US. It's going to be an opportunity here that we'll be generating more data, expand the indication of the product. So I think this is easily a billion-dollar opportunity for us here as we build the capabilities and as we build more clinical data.\n\nJosh Jennings\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cowen\n\nExcellent. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nHey, congrats on the good quarter. Maybe just while we're on the pipeline, talk a little bit about Aveir. It sounds like that product's going really well. Then I had a question on gross margins as well. Trying to think about, is this the right pace to kind of get back to pre-COVID levels? Is that still the opportunity longer term for gross margins?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, I think Aveir has done very well. I mean, we all know the advantages it has over the competitive system, whether it's single and dual chamber, the longer-lasting battery, the ability for replacement, retrievability, and upgradability. So I think it's done very well. From a single chamber perspective, I think we're now at about 50 share of the US market.\nSo that's been doing very well. We started doing our dual chamber procedures towards the end of last year and seeing a nice kind of ramp-up over this Q1 here. Focus here really is really about it's a completely different procedure, right? I mean, if you think about how these devices have been implanted, this is probably the first time in like 30 years that you have a real meaningful change on how this is done.\nSo our focus here is really getting great clinical results, a real thoughtful approach here about opening new centers and training. That's been working very well for us. You could see the impact on our growth rate. I mean, historically, our CRM business has been relatively flat with some platforms going up, some platforms going down. So our goal here with this program was to get our CRM portfolio to at least be a contributor to growth, mid-single digits, 6, 7%. So these last couple of quarters, we've done 7.5%.\nAveir has been doing well. It's going to continue to get better as more and more physicians get trained and we increase the amount of accounts. So I really like the cadence of how we're forecasting this business and the impact that it's going to have on our CRM portfolio. What was your other question?\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nJust on gross margins, kind of thinking about the path back to pre-COVID levels over the long term. Is this the right kind of cadence that you're this year's cadence, the right way to think about that?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that's a good cadence. I think we're forecasting here about 70 basis points of improvement this year. Feel good about that. I've talked about this not being a question of if, just a question of when. So I think that's not a bad cadence. We're going to focus on the things that we can control. The things that we can control are obviously our cost, our cost teams, and the teams that are working on improving gross margin.\nThey're delivering great results here while at the same time maintaining high service levels, not running into back orders, etc. Probably the biggest opportunity we have here, Travis, is just to expand the gross margin through portfolio mix, right?So when you have our medical device businesses growing at mid-teens consistently over the last, whatever, four or five quarters, that has a real strong impact on our gross margin. So a lot of focus on what we can control, our gross margin, the cadence. That's what we're targeting. So it's not really a question of if. It's just a question of when.\n\nTravis Steed\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BofA Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. Congrats again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, Robert. I had a two-part question. A lot of questions on pipeline, but I'm curious. When people ask us on sustainability of growth, if you could elaborate on pipeline, what else is there when you look at the future that gives us the confidence of sustaining its premium growth within the med tech industry?\nMy second part was on the financial modeling side. Looks like FX headwinds came in a little bit higher. Prior guidance had assumed $0.20 headwind to EPS from FX. Did that increase? I'm just curious because some questions on why the high end of the guidance was not raised. I suspect FX headwinds increased. Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah. As I said, there are certain challenges that still remain with us from January. FX is one of them. I'll let Phil answer that one. On your question on pipeline, listen, I could spend a whole hour on this just going through the pipeline. I guess I would bucket them into three categories. Vijay, I'd say you got your current contributors. FreeStyle Libre and Alinity, they still operate like pipeline projects and products, right? We still got multiple innovations going through them. MitraClip, great familiarity Aveir, Navitor, TriClip, Amulet, Protality or CardioMEMS, I think has got great opportunity in CardioMEMS.\nI mean, these are all products that I would still characterize them as early innings. Yeah, they're established, but they're still early innings and they got a lot of growth rate there. The second group of products I would call probably near-term future contributors. So think about it in the next 12 to 18 months, these products coming to market and starting to kind of generate revenue there. Our Lingo product, I'm very excited about that and bringing that to the US and expanding that globally.\nOur dual analyte sensor, our Volt system, Esprit, which is our drug-eluting bioresorbable stent for below the knee. It'll be the first of its kind. We're developing a whole new Alinity system that will target a segment of the market that we currently don't participate in. There'll be more to come on that. Then just the great opportunity we have with biosimilars into the emerging markets and doing it in a very capital-efficient way and bringing that and leveraging our position there. That's our next 12 to 18-month kind of catalyst there.\nAnd then thinking about beyond 2026, I mean, we're working on a PFA RF catheter. You got leadless, another kind of leadless pacing system that we'll be launching. We have a second-generation Amulet. Excited about entering to the IVL market sometime in 2027. Coronary DCB. We're working on kind of new TAVR systems also that allow us to branch out into other segments. We've got a whole plethora of new analytes in our biowearables market that will start to come out and have different applications in 2026.\nThen on top of that, all the clinical work that we're doing to expand indications, expand market, whether it's in TAVR, whether it's in LAA, whether it's in Mitral. So we've got, I'd say, a real nice cadence here of products and pipeline beyond, I'd say, the next 12, 18 months. We're looking at this 2026, 2027, 2028. I feel really excited about that. There's obviously more that we need to do and add. I think the base here looks really good in terms of the pipeline. Then I think your question on FX, Phil, you want to take that?\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nYeah. So I mentioned at the onset here, Vijay, in Q1, we saw about a 2.9% headwind on sales growth. We kind of at current rates anticipate something similar here in Q2. From a full-year perspective, at the current rates, it's about a 2.5% headwind on the top line. That said, kind of the earnings guide that we have here is in line with the organic sales performance and drop through to earnings on the increased midpoint on the EPS guide.\n\nVijay Kumar\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nGood morning. May I add my compliments and congratulations to the quarter? I have two questions, put them right up front. The first one is on the concussion testing. I'd love to understand the go-to-market strategy for that, how you think about the financial benefit, impact, and all that kind of good stuff. I think my second question is a little bit more big picture.\nAs you step back in a post-pandemic environment a couple of years into the CEO seat, how do you think about taking Abbott sort of to the next level? I mean, we all sit here and take a look at an incredibly strong balance sheet. How do you put that cash to work? And are these segments, divisions, ones you want to keep, or how do you think about adding to it? Thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. On the point of care, concussion test, I guess I'd summarize the opportunity here in twofold. I think there's a market conversion component to this, Joanne. I mentioned there are 5 million visits to diagnose a concussion. The number one method there to use that is on a CT scan. I think there's an opportunity here to transform that and allow one to get a faster response in that kind of emergency room visit, which is where the i-STAT and the point of care team already have a good position with some of our other blood gas and other assays that we provide to that segment.\nSo I think this will just slide right into that team. Then the value proposition here is going to be, okay, what's the cost of the system? Can we bend that cost curve? I think we've shown a little bit how we think about things, Joanne. If you look at Libre, if you look at Binax, if you look at how we think about pricing our products when it comes to market conversion and the opportunities that we have there. We'll be able to do it at a nice return for our shareholders. So I think that's an important part.\nThe market expansion opportunity that we have, I think, is going to still require some work on the product. Right now, the product's approved whole blood, but it's a venous draw. We're going to be working on a capillary draw. If you can then run this assay, taking a sample from a fingerstick, from a finger prick, then you can look at bringing that technology even closer to where the need for a rapid concussion test would be.\nYou could just look at how many universities exist in this country, how many high schools exist in this country. You can do some multiplications there and say, okay, this is a great market creation, market expansion opportunity. So I think that that's how we're thinking about it commercially, conversion and creation/expansion. There's some more work to be done in terms of the product and the claims and the trials there.\nSo this will be a multi-year kind of program over here where we'll start to see kind of nice growth in that segment. Then your other question was about the portfolio and balance sheet. Do we like the four segments? The answer to that is, yes, we like all the four segments. We feel that it gives us a real unique view into the healthcare system as a whole, starting with nutrition.\nThat's obviously the bedrock of good health. Then things happen and you need to get a diagnosis. We've got a great diagnostic portfolio that we've been expanding on and building on to make sure that we can capitalize on all the different types of modalities and locations where people can get tested. Then once we know, once a physician knows what the problem is, then they got to run through treatment, right?\nWe do that either through our medicines business or through our medical device business. So I think all four segments are super well aligned to the global demographics and trends in healthcare. We like that. There's always opportunities to add. We've shown that if there are areas that we feel that we can bring value in a combination, then as you mentioned, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet and strategic flexibility to do that as long as we feel that we can add value to that asset.\nWe felt like that about CSI. We felt like that about St. Jude. We felt like that about Alere. Those deals, they obviously help kind of reshape the company and accelerate our growth rates. I think that's predicated on us really believing that we can kind of bring value. We're not trying to fill some top line gap or some issues. So ROIC for us matters. Profitability matters. So we've got opportunities and we could be a little bit more selective to be able to add. I like the four segments that we're in. They've been well to shareholders, especially long-term shareholders.\n\nJoanne Wuensch\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Miksic\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for putting me in. Congrats on the really strong quarter, particularly med devices. So I had one follow-up on the—sorry, you're good. Background. One question on structural heart. Robert, you talked a little bit about the portfolio and the combination of the leading peer device and MitraClip being a little bit more mature in the category of structural heart, but being kind of augmented by some of these new products, like most recently, obviously, TriClip. If you could talk a little bit about sort of the momentum in the portfolio, as well as how much of the build-out of this portfolio is still coming organically or under review kind of strategically, I appreciate it.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, I didn't want my comments on MitraClip to be construed like, \"Oh, that one there is slowing down and we're relying on others to drive the growth.\" I mean, that wasn't the intent. If you look at MitraClip this quarter, it's growing at high single digits. If you look at the last five quarters, that's what it's been doing between high single digits, low double digits. That's good.\nWe always had a view here that this was an attractive area of growth, an attractive area of medical need. We wanted to be a leader here. So yeah, MitraClip, I guess we can call MitraClip the founding father of our structural heart portfolio. I think the team here has done an incredible job at bringing organic innovation into the portfolio.\nSo if you look at our structural heart, I mean, we grew 13% today. MitraClip grew high single digits, but it accounted for 3% of that growth. The other 10% came from all the rest of the portfolio that's being built. So I think that you'll continue to see that. We'll continue to make investments in this business, continue to make investments in the pipeline.\nI'd say right now, most of it is organic, whether it's innovating on LAA, innovating on our TAVR side, and all the clinical trial work that we're doing there. If there's an opportunity organically, I just put that in the same bucket that I think I answered kind of Joanne's question here, if it makes sense, and we can add it, we've got the flexibility to do it.\nBut the whole strategy here was to say, \"Listen, we're going to build a multi-billion-dollar structural heart business that can sustainably grow double digits.\" The way to do that is you can't be a—you can't be a division of only one product. I think the teams over the last four or five years have done a really good job at building that. There's more opportunity. I'd say probably the one that we're looking at and is very exciting for us is mitral replacement.\nWe launched a Tendyne product, which was more a transapical system. Our Cephea system is a transfemoral, transseptal. Feedback that we've seen from early implanters, early first-in-man is that this is a great, great valve. So there's an opportunity there also. So I'd say mostly organic, but got the capacity for inorganic if it makes sense.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThanks so much. Operator, we'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Antalffy\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. Yes, congrats on a strong start to the year. Robert, we spent a lot of time talking about the durability of growth in the med tech business. So I don't want to get too greedy, but just following up on Joanne's question regarding you guys do have a strong balance sheet.\nAre there any areas, I guess sort of how do you feel about the state of the med tech business today? Do you feel there are growth areas within med tech that maybe Abbott isn't participating in today, that Abbott could or should participate in today? Where are you looking beyond your current markets, if at all? Thanks so much. I'll just leave it to one.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Yeah, I get the attempt for triangulation here and the multiple different ways. I guess I'll sound a little bit boring here in terms of how I talk about this. I've been public that, yeah, we are interested. We look at areas that we can add value to. I'd say probably the ones that have jumped out more at us in terms of us studying and looking are probably more in the medical device side and on the diagnostic side.\nWe did look at a strategy for biosimilars for a medicines business, and that was a pretty capital-efficient way to do it. So yeah, we're looking. We continue to study. I'm not going to sit here and telegraph exactly, it's this, it's that. I think the key thing here is just we - I mean, look at our med tech business did this quarter. Look what it did previous four quarters. That allows me to be a little bit more selective. Yeah, over the last couple of months, we've seen some fairly large transactions in the med tech space.\nThose seem to be attractive growth areas. I talked about us getting access to some early IVL technology with the CSI acquisition. So that's an important area for us to focus on. I don't feel that with our strong organic growth that we need to go out and not pay attention to other key financial metrics that for us are important, right, in terms of ROICs and others because we've got that strong growth rate in med tech. So you won't get me telegraphing here exactly, Danielle, what specific segments we're looking at. What I can tell you is we have an active team. They study a lot. We look a lot.\nWe follow a lot. If there's a moment that makes sense for us, and those segments continue to be interesting, we've got the balance sheet and the track record to show that we can drive value out of these acquisitions. So I'll just leave it like that. Yes, we've got flexibility. That doesn't mean that we don't pay attention to other key financial kind of returns as we're looking at it.\nI feel that I can do that because we've got such a strong top-line growth and great pipeline and prospects. So with that, I'll leave it like that. I'll just close by saying, listen, we're very pleased with a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of double-digit organic sales growth on the base business. The investments that we've made during all those years of COVID are generating real strong returns.\nThe pipeline continues to be highly productive, as I've outlined. We've got clear visibility to a pipeline all the way out to 2027, 2028. Obtained several new product approvals that are going to help us accelerate our growth in certain areas. Typically, don't raise guidance in the Q1, but given the strong performance, the outlook, and the remainder of the year, we felt comfortable doing that. We're very well positioned to continue to sustainably deliver top-tier results. With that, I'll wrap up and thank all of you for joining us today.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThank you, Operator. Thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott's investor relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day. Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Q1 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your questions by pressing the star one one keys on your touch-tone phone.\nThis call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question and answer session, the entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us.With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Funk, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024.\nAbbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, which was above analysts' consensus estimates. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance ranges for both earnings per share and sales growth. We now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70, and organic sales growth excluded COVID testing-related sales of 8.5% to 10%. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, was 10.8% in the quarter, which represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.\nThe strong start to the year was driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio, including growth of 14% in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals. In addition to exceeding expectations of both top and bottom lines this quarter, we accomplished a number of objectives across the pipeline, including obtaining several new product approvals and achieving important clinical trial-related milestones. I'll now summarize our Q1 results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil.\nI'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in pediatric nutrition, driven by continued market share gains in the US infant formula business and growth across our international portfolio of infant formula, toddler, and adult nutrition brands. In January, we launched a new nutrition shake called Protality, which provides nutritional support for adults pursuing weight loss. As people eat less and lose weight from taking GLP-1 medications, undergoing a weight loss surgery, or following a calorie-restricted diet, a portion of what is lost is lean muscle mass, which plays an important role in overall health.\nThe combination of high protein and essential vitamins and minerals that Protality offers can help people preserve muscle while pursuing their personal weight loss goals. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. This quarter was a continuation of EPD's impressive trend of strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of the last five quarters. In addition to a strong track record of top-line growth, this business has delivered equally impressive gains on the bottom line, with an operating margin profile last year that reflected more than 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2019.\nMoving to diagnostics, where sales increased more than 5%, excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in diagnostics continues to be led by the adoption of our market-leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies, and blood screening facilities.\nOur development efforts in diagnostics focus on developing new systems and creating new tests that play an important role in making healthcare decisions, expand the accessibility of testing, and deliver a result as fast as possible. In April, we received FDA approval for a point-of-care diagnostic test that can help determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes. The test is run on our portable i-STAT Alinity instrument, which allows concussion testing to move beyond the traditional hospital setting and into urgent care centers, physician offices, and other locations that are closer to the patient.\nWith nearly five million people in the US going to the emergency room to be checked for suspected concussion each year, we believe this test has the potential to transform the standard of care for concussion testing. I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14%. In diabetes care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. As I previously mentioned, Libre has several new growth opportunities that will help continue to fuel the strong sales trajectory we have forecasted.\nOne of those growth opportunities relates to the continued expansion of reimbursement coverage for Libre for individuals who use basal insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Last year, we announced that Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France to include all people who use basal insulin as part of their diabetes management. During this Q1, Libre obtained reimbursement from a select number of institutional payers in Germany for basal insulin users who also use oral diabetes medication to manage their condition.\nThese select public and private payers cover a limited number of the approximately one million basal insulin users in Germany, but this is an encouraging sign of the potential for further coverage expansion not only in Germany but across other European markets. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10.5% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology, structural heart, and continued acceleration in our cardiac rhythm management and vascular portfolios.\nIn electrophysiology, sales grew 18%, driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions and across all major product categories, including double-digit growth in ablation catheters and cardiac mapping-related products. We continue to make great progress toward bringing our innovative PFA catheter Volt to market. In March, we completed enrollment in our CE mark clinical study, putting us on track to file for international approval before the end of the year.\nWe also recently began enrolling patients in our US clinical trial called Volt AF, which will generate the data needed to support an FDA approval filing. In structural heart, growth of 13% was led by strong performance in several high-growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, mitral, and tricuspid repair. Structural heart is an area that we have invested in over the past years in order to create a diversified portfolio that can sustainably deliver double-digit growth.\nIn the past, we relied almost exclusively on MitraClip to drive the growth, but today, the portfolio and growth are more balanced and reflect increasing contributions from newer products like Navitor, Amulet, and TriClip. In April, we received FDA approval for TriClip, a first-of-its-kind heart valve repair device designed for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation or a leaky tricuspid valve.\nData from the clinical trial supporting this approval demonstrated that patients who received TriClip experienced a significant improvement in the severity of their symptoms and quality of life. We're excited to now offer this life-changing treatment option to people in the United States that suffer from this condition. In rhythm management, growth of 7.5% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker.\nAveir has rapidly captured market share in the single-chamber pacing segment of the market and is now being used for dual-chamber pacing, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. This revolutionary technology is helping to deliver growth rates in our rhythm management business that significantly exceed the overall growth in this market. Lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 17%, driven by Eterna, a rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.\nIn January, we announced the launch of Liberta, the world's smallest rechargeable deep brain stimulation device, which is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. So in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom lines. As a result, we raised the midpoint of our sales and EPS guidance ranges.\nWe continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives, and we're seeing strong returns from the investments we're making across our growth platforms. Our pipeline has continued to be highly productive, delivering several recently new product approvals, and we're very well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I'll turn over the call to Phil. Thanks, Robert.\n\nPhil Boudreau\n\nEVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our Q1 results, sales increased 4.7% on an organic basis, which, as expected, includes the impact of year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.9% on Q1 sales.\nDuring the quarter, we saw the US dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in exchange having a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.7% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 29.4% of sales in the Q1. Lastly, our Q1 adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share."

With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance; and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks following their comments. We'll take your questions before we get started.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our 2023 results as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time have positioned the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier, given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range. But then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. While our procedures-driven businesses, such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing, experienced a slowdown due to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world place a greater emphasis on protecting their health. While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffer during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient. It was also during this time that we created a multi-billion-dollar COVID testing business.\nIn just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world, COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. Given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders.\nBut we knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead. We pulled forward or accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels.\nKnowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. The experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale up and subsequent scale down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company.\nOur R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions. And this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD, for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs, with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announce approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution. And in medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals along with several new opportunities to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio.\nThese new opportunities are well balanced with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year. Sales excluded COVID testing grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11% higher than our original guidance of high single digit growth.\nAdjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range, despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. This is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecast sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business.\nI'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil.\nI'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 14% in the quarter.\nIn pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the US was driven by continued market share capture in the US infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader.\nInternational growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\nTurning to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results.\nMoving to diagnostics growth, rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing. The flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in Q4 compared to that of the prior year, but in core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems. Paired with our broad test menu offering, Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations. The system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the US.\nI'll wrap up with medical devices where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion.\nIn terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe.\nIn rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products including Amplatzer, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis. In heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. Lastly in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19% driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.\nSo in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year. We outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil.\nThanks Robert.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\nTurning to our Q4 results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which, as expected, reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year over year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales.\nRegarding other aspects of the P and L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales and adjusted SGA was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, today we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024. For the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our Q1 reported sales. We forecast non-operating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

We compile the Q and A roster.\nOur first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOn a nice end to the year here.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nRobert, you know, pre-COVID Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAs you mentioned, you're guiding to eight.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nTo 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base. What has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high?\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nTo start the year?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nMaybe talk about the key assumptions, and I'll leave it there for my one question. Thank you. Thanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and quite frankly, as we talked about.\nThroughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take.\nSome of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business. I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean we operate in these four business segments.\nTheir underlying attractiveness still is very sustainable. Strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these four segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in. So I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range. You look at EPD. As I said in my comments, I mean these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging geography and different markets, and they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line.\nI think even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their op margin profile by 300 basis points.\nSo it's a pretty strong position, strong team. Then we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which historically hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets. It's probably been more of a developed markets play. So I think that's going to provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think, did an incredible job here, as we said at the beginning of last year, at regaining our leadership position here in the US. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product. But even adult, our adult business, our adult business has increased $1 billion since pre-pandemic, and it's just strengthening, getting stronger. It's $4 billion growing high single digits.\nThere's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes, and we're making investments in that channel. Also, Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well. Talked about our Alinity and, and infant formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio, and quite frankly the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute, and our Rapid Diagnostics portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing. And we've been making investments on new assays to be able to put through those instruments. And then medical devices historically was in that high single digit growth.\nI think what's changed there to become now.\nA double digit grower for us on a very large size business is that you have historically double digit growth businesses like HF, EP, Structural Heart, DC. I mean those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices, our CRM and Vascular businesses that were showing very little growth historically, and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4 with CRM. I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology. On Vascular, it's been a combination of adding in organically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio for higher growth segments. So I think that's really.\nIn a nutshell across all these very four attractive segments. We've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting. You saw that last year, every year double-digit growth, and they've gotten stronger, and they've gotten better, and they've gotten more growth opportunities with them. So, I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you. I've gotten some of the headlines here about accelerating sales but not seeing maybe that come through on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. Our core business grew EPS last year, 40-plus%. We're forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth.\nAt the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So I'd say yeah, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics, but we've proven to be pretty resilient there, and I think the range captures the opportunity that we have. On the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range, but it's only January, so I think this is a good starting point. Super helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. Was hoping to just follow up on your comments there, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. I know Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally, but was hoping that just thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business in that 30 to 50 basis point range. So if you could just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in 2024 and into the out years. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here too.\nRecover to their operating margin and try to get back to their margin pre-pandemic.\nIn a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre-pandemic level, and I think what you saw us do there, Josh and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we manage very well strategically the spending piece of it. We accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID. Sales were at their peak levels a few years ago, and then we held that spending flat these last couple of years.\nEven though our top line was growing pretty significantly here, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line. That is, I think about our big five activities this year, the company, and we can do all five of them at the same time. I'd say gross margin is pretty, pretty high up there in our priority. We're forecasting a pretty nice step up in our gross margin profile this year, roughly around 75 basis points. There's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement programs. Every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis, and they all get reported out. There's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs.\nSome of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. Whether it's commodity costs, freight, and distribution, all those elements seem to be, let's say right now and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, turning into tailwind. That helps. The other part here is just, I'd say, portfolio mix. As.\nSome of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher margin businesses, and they provide that mix element in that gross margin expansion. I think this provides a nice, you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year, but I expect over time we'll get back to our pre-pandemic, you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. For me, it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when. You know, we could target, you know, 50, 75, you know, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want. That kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. I'd say that's our biggest opportunity.\nI think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. Our big opportunity here is gross margin, and we're all over it.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open. Good morning.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches. I would love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the US EP business as we see some PFA launches this year. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Well, I think we've showed pretty strong, robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual in-market competition.\nIt's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story. US has been strong, China has been very strong for us, US this year, especially in VBP. I mean, there was some price challenges throughout the year with VBP, but the volume we picked up, the market share we pick up more than offset that. It's really been across the board here, and I think it really is about strength of the portfolio. You know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think is at the core.\nGood mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. I think launching TactiFlex, which is the flexible tip combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's outcomes to the patient or.\nTime of procedure, we've seen that consistently around the world. Then on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers. Yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth as we look to.\nMore PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the US. Listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology. I think there are some challenges with some of these first generation products. I do expect there to be uptake and usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first, at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment.\nFrom there, kind of moving past that, you know, right now I think, I guess that's my assumption in the US until I see something differently, that it will follow a similar pattern, and then the question will just be kind of the speed.\nI think the team has done a really good job here on the ground with the technology.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nOh, great.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks for taking the question, Robert. Maybe I could ask on Libre, you know, this is the most successful medical device. At the conference just a few weeks ago in San Francisco, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward, and targets.\nYou know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in 2024 and beyond. One question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data. It's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales, or at least prescriptions, are flattening out, yet the sales keep growing. How do we think about the discrepancy there? How big is the Medicare DME business?\nThe growth we're getting there from?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nBasil, thanks a lot.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSure.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nStrong growth in Q4 under $1.5 billion. US was up 32%.\nI'd say still haven't. Team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. You know, being able to put those kind of growth rates in the US without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\nYou know, the growth is going to come from. I've been pretty consistent about this, Robby, I mean there was a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here, but I'd say, okay, the basal is a big opportunity, it's a large opportunity for us. I also think it's multi year, so I don't think it's just a 2024, 2025. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely two plus years easily. Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you referenced IQVIA, Robby. Seven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre, and I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. It's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the US.\nIn Japan and in France, where that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution on growth. I think right now in the US most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private. Private commercial Medicare represents about 1/3 of the market. I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the awareness.\nBuild the trialing experience with primary care and that's what we're doing. That's what we have been doing, quite frankly, for some time. It's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. Like I said, easily two plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have, Robby, is.\nLooking at a segment that really hasn't been, we haven't been able to access, which is that of pump connectivity. I think this represents a great opportunity for us. If you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year and that patient segment has, you know, we haven't been able to target it, but now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us, you know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nRight.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nRecently there was an independent third party study. I think it's the first time we've seen an independent head to head study that was published a few weeks ago.\nShowing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's MARD. So I look at that and I say, okay, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the best.\nSolution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment. So I look at the basal, I look at the pump. It's probably good drivers for us in 2024, 2025, but we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform. Like I've said to your question on IQVIA.\nI think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market. The pharmacy channel in the US gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that drive, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. Maybe that's what you're seeing. Great.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nAppreciate the thoughts.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year and strong guidance. Just Robert, since this story seems to be very much about line growth. I haven't heard you reference the Fab Five, one of my favorite analogies in a long time. So just wanted to, and maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab Five and where, you know, how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024. Thanks so much.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say yes, they are great products, and we didn't think about calling them that because they were going to be a flash in the pan for one or two years. We look at these as really long term, great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company.\nOver the next few years, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year and they'll accelerate. I think this year, sorry, in 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about a point of growth, total Abbott contribution. They're definitely stepping up. I'd say some of them I would call market creating opportunities. Tricuspid, I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement.\nGenerating referral pathways. We know how to do this, and we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? With products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do. Regarding clinical work as it relates to market expansion, development, and market development, I'd say some of the other products on that list are probably more market conversion. These are already large, attractive growth segments that, you know, we're targeting with our technologies.\nNavitor in the TAVR space, Aveir in the CRM side. I mean, these are large, large segments that we're coming in and will have different value propositions. I think Aveir has got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market, and the value proposition for Aveir, I think, is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implanter, to the patient. That.\nI expect a lot from Aveir in terms of growth. I expect a lot from Navitor. We're going to be expanding. We'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision.\nWe're investing in those areas. Yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it, and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50% at least. We're forecasting 50% growth next year, and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company. That being said, I will say.\nThose are great products, and they take a lot of focus. We still have, you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here, too. Whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test, we're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users this year. Also, you know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution. We put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. I talked about biosimilars in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre.\nWe're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostic market that we're currently not competing in. Yeah, five, five. A lot of great contributions, but there's a lot in the chamber here, and I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025, just having a robust pipeline.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Very thorough, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year or nice end to last year too? Here's a question I have in nutrition. You've done a great job of, sounds like, returning to normalcy. I'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single-digit segment growth category. Thanks.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, yeah, I think kudos to the team here. You know we set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year to get to market leadership. In our October call we had already confirmed that, and I'd say over the last couple of months that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the number two.\nYeah, I mean I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share.\nI'd say given the strength of the portfolio, of the team, and what we went through, and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share.\nI don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio.\nI'd say we're probably above that 4 to 6 range that we used to have pre pandemic at least into 2024.\nAs I've said, I think that we can be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down. I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. This position with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on health care and on nutrition. I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher end 6 range going forward. You know, I think right now you'll see the impact of the share in the US, some partial year impact of the price.\nAllow us to be above that 6% range, and then as we move into next year, you know, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the adult segment, and what is that going to do for us?\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nHi guys.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks for taking my question.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nRobert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M and M, looking at the balance sheet, phenomenal position, you at least have a minimum of $20 billion of firepower. Abbott hasn't done any large deals in.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThe last few years.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHow do you see the opportunity for larger size deals?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWhat is Abbott's appetite for a larger.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSized, more meaningful transaction?\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWell, yeah, we've got a strong balance sheet and provides us a lot of flexibility on our, on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with we've got great pipeline, we have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top tier, sustainable growth.\nThat ends up putting, allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk, bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top line gaps that might be there. So that.\nAllows us to be more selective. If there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then.\nLike you said, you've done the math. We've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good.\nProfitability matters, earnings matter when you get into these larger size deals.\nYou have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top line play. I think they're harder nowadays. You look at what we did with St. Jude.\nWe have looked back at the deal model that we put together.\nSpot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought this business would impact the company.\nI'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work. If you want to look beyond just top line, and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital.\nI don't feel that we need to do anything like that.\nTo cover a top line kind of gap. If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term, not trying to fill a top line gap.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThanks guys.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nI'll take one more question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Travis Steed from Bank of America Securities, your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nHi everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some med tech companies are kind of calling out above normal growth. Curious, Robert, if you look at your med device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated catch up still coming through, or do you think this is more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious on some of your thoughts on the overall market. Yeah, I don't think that we're seeing any kind of catch up or pent up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more, at least I can speak for our portfolio. I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies. Right. I think there was some disruption.\nWe've talked about it in some parts of some procedures that require a little bit more pre-op planning or imaging before, and imaging after. I mean, I think those.\nThat combined with the labor shortages that occurred in 2022. 2022, I think that probably slowed a few of them down. I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that. I just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in, in.\nYou know, in CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the US but around the world too. Seeing that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis, a lot of our, a good portion of the diagnostic business, our core lab business, is actually in the hospital. We also get to see that too. You know, didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. We try and triangulate this. I just see this as, you know, procedures are returning back to normal, and because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients, I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve. Some are faster than others just given, I think, the market.\nMarket positions, et cetera. I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent up piece over here. Great, thanks a lot. Okay, well I'll wrap up here. Like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023. In many ways it sort of represented this transition year.\nRegarding the coming down of COVID, I think we did a really good job at managing the scale up and the scale down. A lot of healthcare companies actually participated in trying to solve the COVID problem, and I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. Our performance here is now transitioned from being driven by COVID-19 testing to once again being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company. We delivered double-digit organic sales growth on every base business on every quarter, and we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum.\nThe pipeline, we talked a bit about it, continues to be highly productive and, you know, I'm forecasting here top tier growth in 2024. As you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. We're in January, so we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nOkay, thank you, operator, and thank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nAll for your questions.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nThis now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00AM Central Time today on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Welcome to Abbott's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. During the question and answer session, you will be able to ask your question by pressing the star 11 keys on your touchtone phone. This call is being recorded by Abbott, with the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question and answer session. The entire call, including the question and answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks following their comments.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nWe'll take your questions before we get started.\n\nMichael Comilla\n\nVP, Investor Relations, Abbott\n\nSome statements made today may be forward looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024.\nAbbott cautions that these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1. A Risk Factors to our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended 31 December 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law on today's conference call. As in the past, non GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at Abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nCall over to Robert. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll discuss our 2023 results as well as our outlook for this year. Before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time have positioned the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.\nIn the two years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier. Given the large size of our company, we expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. While our procedures-driven businesses, such as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing, experienced a slowdown due to healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our branded generics pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course, and our nutrition business accelerated as people around the world placed a greater emphasis on protecting their health.\nWhile some companies saw their entire portfolio suffer during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient. It was also during this time that we created a multibillion dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. Given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors, and other stakeholders.\nWe knew that the pandemic would not last forever, so we planned ahead. We pulled forward or accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred, and the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale up and subsequent scale down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company.\nOur R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last two years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications, and geographic and reimbursement expansions, and this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD, for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. In nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs, with particular emphasis on the fast-growing adult nutrition segment. In diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments, and a new laboratory automation solution. In medical devices, we announced 10 new product approvals, along with several new opportunities to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio.\nThese new opportunities are well balanced, with each of our seven medical device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement. Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth. Both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year. Sales, excluding COVID testing, grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11%, higher than our original guidance of high single-digit growth.\nAdjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range, despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. This is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio, and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, as we announced this morning, we forecast sales growth, excluding COVID testing, to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion.\nWe forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business.\nI'll provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil.\nI'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In pediatric nutrition, double-digit growth in the US was driven by continued market share capture in the US infant formula business, where we are once again the market leader.\nInternational growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In adult nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.\nTurning to established pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results.\nMoving to Diagnostics, growth in rapid diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing. The flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. In core laboratory diagnostics, growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems. Paired with our broad test menu offering, Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations. The system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the US.\nI'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in six of our seven medical device businesses. In diabetes care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system, grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion.\nIn terms of sales dollars, FreeStyle Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.\nIn electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe.\nIn rhythm management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual chamber. In structural heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products including Amplatzer, TriClip, and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis. In heart failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year, driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. Lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.\nIn summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year. We outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth, and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024. I'll now turn over the call to Phil.\nThanks Robert.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nAs Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which, as expected, reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.\nForeign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.\nTurning to our outlook for 2024, today we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024.\nFor the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales, to be in the range of 8% to 10%.\nBased on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast non operating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, we will conduct the question and answer session. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press Star 11 on your telephone. You will then hear an automated message advising you that your hand is raised. To withdraw your question, please press Star 11 again. For optimal sound quality, we kindly ask that you please use your handset instead of your speakerphone when asking your question. Again, that's Star 11 to ask a question. Please stand by while we compile the Q and A roster.\nOur first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a nice end to the year here.\nRobert, you know, pre Covid Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically as you mentioned. You're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base. What has changed and what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions, and I'll leave it there for my one question.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and, quite frankly, as we talked about.\nThroughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the, some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business, I think ultimately that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these four business segments, and their underlying attractiveness still is, you know, is very sustainable. Strengthening our positions that we're already pretty strong in each of these four strategies segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of health care to be in. I'd make the case here that all four of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range.\nYou look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean these are three consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging geography and different markets, and they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they've expanded their op margin profile by 300 basis points. It's a pretty strong position, strong team. We layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which historically hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets. It's probably been more of a developed markets place. I think that's going to provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition, I think did an incredible job here.\nAs we said at the beginning of last year, regaining our leadership position here in the US speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product. Even our adult business has increased a billion dollars since pre-pandemic, and it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean, it's $4 billion, growing high single digits. There are a lot of med tech businesses like Larry that command very strong premiums in terms of valuation just by having those kinds of growth rates and sizes. We're making investments in that channel also. Diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our core lab business has done very well. We talked about our algorithm, formula, and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here.\nI think that's the result of our portfolio and, quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute. Our Rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there for decentralized testing. We've been making investments on new assays to be able to put through those instruments, and then medical devices historically was in that high single digit growth. I think what's changed there to become now.\nA double-digit grower for us on a very large size business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like Heartfelt or EP Structural, Heart adc. I mean, those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in medical devices. Our CRM and vascular businesses that were showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4 with CRM. I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology on vascular. It's been a combination of adding inorganically to the business and organically plays to reposition some of the portfolio for higher growth segments. I think that's really.\nIn a nutshell, across all these very four attractive segments, we've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. I think you're starting, you saw that last year, every year double-digit growth, and they've gotten stronger, and they've gotten better, and they've gotten more growth opportunities with them. I think that's really the driver there. I mean, if you, I've gotten some of the headlines here about accelerating sales but not seeing maybe that come through on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that Covid had on us and the clouding of it. Our core business grew EPS last year, 40+%. We're forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth, you know, this at the midpoint, double-digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean, there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry.\nI'd say yeah, you know, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics, but you know, we've proven to be pretty resilient there. I think the range captures the opportunity that we have.\nOn the earnings side, I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range. It's only January, so I think this is a good starting point. Super helpful. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I echo the congratulations on the strong finish of the year. Was hoping to just follow up on your comments there, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. I know Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you did not have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID testing business that you developed internally. Was hoping that, just thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business in that 30 to 50 basis point range, if you could just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of margin expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in 2024 and into the out years. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here too.\nRecover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position. Position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at the pre pandemic level, and I think what you saw us do there, Josh and I talked a little bit about in my comments, is I think we manage very well strategically. The spending piece of it. We accelerated the spending investments when we were at our COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago, and then we held that spending flat these last couple of years.\nEven though our top line was growing pretty significantly here, I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line. That is, think about our Big 5 activities this year at the company. We can do all five of them at the same time. I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. We're forecasting a pretty nice step up in our gross margin profile this year, roughly around 75 basis points. There's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. You know, every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis. They all get reported out, so there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs.\nSome of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. You know, whether it's commodity costs, freight, and distribution, all those elements seem to be, say right now and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, turning into tailwind. That helps. The other part here is just, I'd say, portfolio mix. As.\nSome of the device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow, those are higher margin businesses, and they provide that, you know, that mix element in that gross margin expansion. I think this provides a nice, you know, this provides a nice opportunity for us this year. I expect over time we'll get back to our pre-pandemic, you know, our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. For me, it's not a question of if, it's just a question of when.\nIf we could target 50, 75, I mean, it's never going to be as linear as we always would want.\nThat kind of expansion for us I think really provides a good opportunity to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years. I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending, and I think you see that in our profiles. Our big opportunity here is gross margin, and we're all over it.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nAppreciate those details. Thanks, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is open. Good morning.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you for taking the questions. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PFA launches. We'd love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates, and how you're thinking about the US EP business as we see some PFA launches this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks for taking the questions.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nSure. Well, I think we've showed pretty strong, robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual in-market competition.\nIt's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story. US has been strong, China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean, there was some price challenges throughout the year with VBP, but the volume we picked up, the market share we pick up more than, more than off. It's really been across the board here, and I think it really is about strength of the portfolio. You know, not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think is at the core, you know, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposables also. I think launching TactiFlex.\nWhich is the flexible tip, combined with the contact force, we've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's outcomes for the patient or.\nTime of procedure, we've seen that consistently around the world. I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers. Yeah, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth as we look to.\nMore PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the US. Listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology. I think there are some challenges with some of these first generation products. I do expect there to be uptake and usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first, at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the cryo segment.\nFrom there, kind of moving past that, you know, right now, I think, I guess that's my assumption in the US until I see something differently, is that, you know, it will follow a similar pattern, and then the question will just be kind of the speed.\nI think the team has done a really good job here on the ground, you know, with the technology.\n\nMarie Yoko Thibault\n\nAnalyst, BTIG\n\nThank you, Robert.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Robbie Marcus from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nOh great. Thanks for taking the question, Robert. Maybe I could ask on Libre. You know, this is the most successful medical device. At the conference just a few weeks ago in San Francisco, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward, and targets.\nYou know, maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in 2024 and beyond. One question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data, it's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales or at least prescriptions are flattening out, yet the sales keep growing. How do we think about the discrepancy there? How big is the Medicare DME business? You know, the growth we're getting there from basal.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nSure.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nStrong growth in Q4 under $1.5 billion. US was up 32%.\nI'd say the team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the US market in 2023. I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. Being able to put those kind of growth rates in the US without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system, I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale, and our brand.\nThe growth is going to come from. I've been pretty consistent about this, Robby. There was a lot of opportunity, opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here, but I'd say okay, the basal is a big opportunity, it's a large opportunity for us. I also think it's multi year. I don't think it's just a 2024, 2025. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely two plus years easily. Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean, you referenced IQVIA, Robby. Seven out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has. It's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the US.\nIn Japan and in France where that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution on growth. I think right now in the US most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private. Private commercial Medicare represents about 1/3 of the market.\n\nLawrence H. Biegelsen\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nSo.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nI think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the awareness.\nBuild the trialing experience with primary care, and that's what we're doing. That's what we have been doing, quite frankly, for some time. It's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us. Like I said, easily two plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have, Robby, is.\nLooking at a segment that really hasn't been, we haven't been able to access, which is that of pump connectivity. I think this represents a great opportunity for us. If you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for US economy got 150,000 to 200,000, I guess, new pumpers every year and that patient segment has, you know, we haven't been able to target it. Now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers, I think this is a great opportunity for us, you know, and I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option, especially for this patient population where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important.\n\nPhilip Boudreau\n\nSVP and CFO, Abbott\n\nRight.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nRecently there was an independent third party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head to head study that was published a few weeks ago.\nShowing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's MARD. I look at that and I say, okay, if you're a pump company and you're wanting to provide the.\nBest solution to your users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment. I look at the baseline, I look at the pump as probably good drivers for us in 2024, 2025, but we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform. Like I've said to your question on IQVIA.\nI think anybody who kind of follows pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market. You know, the pharmacy channel in the US gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that drive, you know, drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. Maybe that's what you're seeing.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGreat.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nAppreciate the thoughts.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nOur next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a strong end of the year, and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since this story seems to be very much about line growth, I haven't heard you reference the Fab Five, one of my favorite analogies, in a long time. Maybe I just missed it, but just wanted to get an update on those five products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think they're the Fab Five, and how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024. Thanks so much.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say yes, they are great products, and we didn't think about calling them that because they are going to be a flash in the pan for one or two years. We look at these as really long-term, great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company.\nOver the next few years, quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate, I think, this year, sorry. In 2023, those five products have represented about half a point of growth, and I expect that to increase in 2024 to about a point of growth, total Abbott contribution. They're definitely stepping up. I'd say some of them I would call market-creating opportunities. Tricuspid I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement.\nGenerating referral pathways. We know how to do this, and we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products. With products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to market expansion, development, and market development. I'd say some of the other products on that list are probably more market conversion. These are already large, attractive growth segments.\nThat we're targeting with our technologies.\nNavitor in the TAVR space, Aveir in the CRM side. These are large segments that were coming in and will have different value propositions. I think Aveir's got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market, and the value proposition for Aveir I think is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implanter, to the patient.\nI expect a lot from there in terms of growth. I expect a lot from Navitor. We're going to be expanding. We'll have two new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan.\nWe're investing in those areas. Yeah, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it and they continue to increase. They'll grow 50% at least. We're forecasting a 50% growth next year and they'll contribute about a point of growth to the overall company. So, you know, that being said, I will say, you know, those are great products and they take a lot of focus. But we still have, you know, we still have a lot in the chamber here too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users this year. Also, you know, we're doing a lot of work on Volt, which is our PFA solution. We put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials.\nI talked about biosimilars in EPD, our dual analyte sensor for Libre.\nWe're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the diagnostics market that we're currently not competing. So yeah, five, five. A lot of great contributions, but there's a lot in the chamber here, and I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThank you. Very thorough. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. Your line is open.\n\nDanielle Joy Antalffy\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Nice start to the year or nice end to last year too? So here's a question I have in nutrition. You've done a great job of. Sounds like returning to normalcy. I'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid single digit segment growth category. Thanks.\n\nRobert Ford\n\nChairman and CEO, Abbott\n\nYeah, yeah, I think kudos to the team here. You know we set out a target at the beginning of last year, this time last year to get to market leadership. In our October call we had already confirmed that, and I'd say over the last couple of months that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the number. Number two.\nYeah, I mean I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share.\nI'd say given the strength of the portfolio of the team and what we went through, and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre recall share.\nI don't know exactly when, but that'll be my expectation on that. You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire nutrition portfolio.\nI'd say we're probably above that four to six range that we used to have pre-pandemic, at least into 2024.\nAs I've said, I think that we can be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down. And I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the adult segment, which is growing high single digits and of which we've got very high market share position."

Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nRobert Justin Marcus\n\nAnalyst, JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; [indiscernible] Senior Vice President Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Robert Ford will. [indiscernible]\nBefore we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAbbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\nNote that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we raised the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $4.42 to $4.46. Organic sales growth on the base business, which excludes COVID testing, increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter and was led by double-digit growth in all 4 of our major businesses.\nThis acceleration in sales growth is a result of our strong position in attractive growth markets. In conjunction with the additional investments we made across the company during the pandemic. In addition to the strong top line performance, we continue to deliver accelerating earnings power on our base business, and remain on track to deliver on the financial commitments we set at the beginning of the year. With a positive growth outlook for the businesses and the momentum we're building across the portfolio, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024.\nI will now review our performance in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 18% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth of 25% was led by continued market share capture in the U.S. in formula business, where we have now reclaimed the leadership position. Internationally, we continue to deliver well-balanced growth coming from both interim formula products and our PediaSure taller brand.\nIn Adult Nutrition, growth of 12% was driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands across the U.S. and international markets. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 11% in the quarter. This strong performance was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in several markets and therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health and CNS pain management.\nIn September, we announced an agreement with global biotech leader, MAb Science to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. This collaboration will help introduce cutting-edge medicines in the areas of oncology, women's health and respiratory diseases, the people in countries that have historically lacked access to these treatment options. Moving to Diagnostics.\nExcluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 10%, and led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew double digits, driven by above-market performance in the U.S. and internationally. Growth was driven by a continued increase in global demand for routine diagnostic testing and a strong recovery of our blood transfusion testing business following a period of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn Rapid Diagnostics, double-digit organic sales growth on the base business benefited from increased demand for respiratory tests in anticipation of an earlier-than-normal start to the flu season in the Northern Hemisphere. And I'll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew nearly 15%, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally.\nIn Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, and grew 28%. The global Libre user base now exceeds 5 million people with nearly 2 million of those in the U.S. where the Libre user base has nearly doubled in the last 2 years. A recent analysis of our U.S. user base showed that a growing number of Libre users are using Libre in combination with GLP-1 medications as part of a companion therapy approach for managing their diabetes.\nOn average, those using both Libre and GLP-1 exhibited a higher rate of use for both products, wearing Libre sensors more often and taking GLP-1 medication more frequently compared to other users. This increase in use or better compliance is a positive sign that these users are taking an even more active role in managing their diabetes. And while we traditionally think of therapy choices as having to compete against one another, this is a good example of a complementary relationship between 2 products that both help optimize the treatment of diabetes.\nIn cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology and structural heart. In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth across all major international geographic regions and high teens growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by double-digit growth of MitraClip and strong growth from several recently launched new products, most notably Navitor, our latest generation TAVR valve. In Ribbon Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aver, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual-chamber pacing. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 19%, driven by the recent launch of Ituna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete.\nSo in summary, this was a very strong quarter. with all 4 major businesses delivering double-digit organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales. Growth rates in the base business have improved every quarter this year on both the top and bottom lines. And the momentum we are building in positions us well for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024.\nI'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil?\n\nOperator\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales decreased 1.5% on an organic basis due to as expected a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales.\nExcluded COVID-tested sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 13.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55% of sales.\nOn a year-to-date basis, our adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales which is below our original full year guidance of approximately 56% that we provided back in January. The difference is primarily due to lower gross margins on COVID tests due to lower volumes and price compared to our original forecast assumptions and the impact of higher inventory obsolescence as a result of maintaining higher inventory levels throughout the pandemic to help ensure product supply during a time when global supply chains were less predictable.\nAs the global supply chain environment continues to improve, we're adjusting our inventory levels to align with that trend. Adjusted R&D was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.42 to $4.46, which is comprised of our year-to-date results plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.17 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales to be in the low double digits and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, which reflects an acceleration in the contribution from the underlying base business. Organic sales, excluded COVID testing, increased low double digits for the second quarter in a row and was led by mid-teens growth in medical devices, along with double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition.\nOn our last couple of earnings calls, I've highlighted improving underlying demand trends across our businesses. These strengthening trends continued in both our institutional and consumer facing businesses this past quarter. Within the Institutional businesses, health care systems around the world that continue to improve their ability to expand the supply of health care services through ongoing efforts to adjust protocols, manage the labor challenges and increase the overall available capacity to treat patients.\nIn our more consumer-facing businesses, we're seeing consumers prioritize spending for health care products, which is driving increased demand for our products in the U.S. and internationally. I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Nutrition where sales increased 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., growth was led by pediatric nutrition growth of more than 20%. We continue to make good progress in increasing manufacturing production and have now recovered approximately 75% of the market share in the infant formula business that was lost last year as a result of the voluntary recall.\nInternationally, total Nutrition sales grew 6%, led by growth in both pediatric and adult nutrition businesses. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 12.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by growth across several markets, including India and China and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health and CNS pain management. This business continues to execute at a high level and capitalize on the favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends in emerging markets.\nMoving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 7%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew 10%, driven by performance in the U.S., Europe and China. This broad-based strong performance reflects the increased demand for routine diagnostic testing globally. And in the U.S., our blood transfusion testing business continues to make good progress, recovering from the impact of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew more than 14% on an organic basis, including double-digit growth in both U.S. and internationally. In Diabetes Care, Freestyle Libre sales exceeded $1.3 billion in the quarter and grew 25% on an organic basis. During the quarter, Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France for all people with diabetes who use insulin. This achievement was a direct result of the unique value proposition that Libre offers, a fully featured continuous glucose monitor made available at an accessible price.\nAbbott has led the way in expanding reimbursement coverage for continuous glucose monitors in order to bring the benefits of this life-changing technology to more people around the world. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in electrophysiology and structural heart. In electrophysiology, performance was led by international growth of more than 20%, which included high teens growth in Europe and strong growth in China.\nDuring the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our TactiFlex ablation catheter, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible tip and contact for sensing technology, which helps to deliver improved procedure outcomes and faster procedure types. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by MitraClip growth of approximately 10% and along with growth from several recently launched new products.\nEarlier this year, we submitted for FDA approval for TriClip, our minimally invasive tricuspid valve repair device, that helps treat a condition on as tricuspid regurgitation, a leaky heart valve disease. The clinical trial data supporting our submission showed that TriClip is a highly effective and safe treatment that provide a significant improvement in the quality of life for patients. TriClip is currently being reviewed by the FDA, and we look forward to bringing this first of its kind technology to patients here in the U.S.\nIn Ribbon Management, growth of 8% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. And during the quarter, we received FDA approval for our dual chamber leadless pacemaker, a first of its kind technology that allows for 2 pacemaker devices to communicate with one other inside the body to provide minimally invasive treatment for those with abnormal heart rhythms. Aveir was specifically designed to be upgradable and retrievable in order to evolve with patient changes in therapy needs over time. This unique technology offers the potential to revolutionize care for millions of people who require a pacemaker.\nAnd lastly, in Neuromodulation sales grew 16%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation evisioned for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. During the first half of this year, we introduced several new innovations, including the launch of Eterna and label indication expansions for treating painful diabetic neuropathy and chronic back pain for those who have not had or are not eligible for back surgery.\nSo in summary, we exceeded expectations on both top and the bottom lines. Growth in the underlying base business accelerated, driven by improving market conditions, contributions from both new products and legacy growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, which will sustain our strong growth profile in the future.\nI'll now turn the call to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert E. Funck\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results. Sales decreased 9.2% on an organic basis due to as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. .\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales, which reflects continued flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the second quarter.\nLastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales to be in the low double digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.3 billion, which is below our full year forecast of around $1.5 billion that we provided in April due to current testing dynamics, including lower demand for testing following the end of the public health emergency in May. For the third quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $100 million.\nBased on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1.5% on full year reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in April, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by approximately $0.05 based on our strong performance and outlook.\nCompared to the initial guidance we provided back in January, we have now raised our underlying base business earnings forecast by more than $0.15 offsetting the lower contribution from COVID testing versus our initial forecast. Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.10, which reflects strong growth on the underlying base business. We forecast total underlying base business, organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our third quarter reported sales.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\n\nRobert B. Ford\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong results to start the year. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, which is above consensus estimates, driven entirely by strong underlying base business performance, excluding COVID testing. Organic sales growth excluded COVID testing increased 10% led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition.\nAs you'll recall, back in January, I expressed some optimism that the headwinds Abbott and other companies faced over the last few years were starting to peak and in some cases ease a bit. As we move through the first part of the year, that's exactly what we continue to see. Most notably, the impact of COVID has rapidly and significantly lessened. As part of this transition, certain behavioral shifts have been evident across society. One simple illustrative example has been the significant increase in travel and tourism, we've all seen, heard about or experience firsthand.\nA much more relevant and important behavioral shift that we're seeing in health care globally has been the increased priority people are putting on getting healthy and staying healthy. And for our businesses, the impacts have been increased routine diagnostic testing volumes, improved medical device procedure trends and strong demand for consumer-based health products. The net results this past quarter was strong, broad-based growth across our portfolio.\nImportantly, this growing focus on health adds to and enhances other favorable demographic trends such as a global population that's growing older and living longer and increasing access to health care around the world. Combination of these favorable market dynamics, along with the strength of our growth platforms and new product pipeline provides a strong foundation for sustainable, top-tier growth going forward.\nI'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 11% in the quarter. This continues EPD's impressive stretch of consistent strong performance, including double-digit growth each of the last 2 years. Growth this past quarter was led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management.\nTurning to Nutrition, where sales increased more than 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 35% included the impact of lower sales in the first quarter of last year due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products. We continue to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew mid-single digits overall, and sales in global Adult Nutrition also grew mid-single digits, driven by strong performance of our market-leading Ensure brand.\nMoving to Diagnostics, where as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in COVID testing sales compared to the first quarter of last year. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid- to -high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the U.S. and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year, though we're seeing improving market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales grew nearly 8% globally.\nAnd I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally.\nIn Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the U.S. and mid-teens internationally. During the quarter, Libre received U.S. FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. We're working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with both Libre 2 and Libre 3 as soon as possible.\nIn cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 8% overall in the quarter. And impressively, organic sales growth rate improved sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every one of our cardiovascular device businesses. This broad-based strength was led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure and Structural Heart.\nIn Heart Failure, sales of CardioMEMS grew more than 30%, which represents the third quarter in a row that CardioMEMS sales have grown more than 25%. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by high teens growth in Europe, including strong, broad-based performance across big 5 European countries, which was driven by cardiac ablation catheters and mapping systems.\nIn Structural Heart, growth was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, along with strong contributions from 3 recently launched products, Amulet, Navitor and TriClip, which combined to grow nearly 50% in the quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation sales grew 11%, driven by a recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we didn't previously compete.\nSo in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding financial expectations on both top and bottom lines. The strong performance we're achieving is broad-based and fueled by strong execution, new products and improving market conditions. And our core foundational growth platforms have strong momentum and are achieving exceptional results, positioning us well for top-tier growth going forward.\nAnd now I'll turn over the call to Bob. Bob?\n\nRobert E. Funck\n\nExecutive VP of Finance & CFO, Abbott Laboratories\n\nThanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\nTurning to our first quarter results. Sales decreased 14.5% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.3% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.\nRegarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 28.3% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.\nTurning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be at least high single digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion, which is below the full year forecast of approximately $2 billion we provided in January due to current testing dynamics we're seeing in the market.\nFor the second quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $200 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of a little more than 2% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but now reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in January, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by a little more than $0.10 based on our strong performance and outlook.\nWith that, we'll now open the call for questions."

Welcome to the AbbVie Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert A. Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie's business continues to perform above our expectations. We delivered another excellent quarter, including strong financial results, pipeline advancement across all stages of development and strategic investments to drive sustainable long-term growth. Given our positive momentum, we are raising our 2025 outlook for the third time this year.\nStarting with our third quarter performance. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were nearly $15.8 billion, reflecting high single-digit sales growth and beating our expectations by approximately $300 million. I'm especially pleased with the execution of our growth platform, including combined sales growth of more than 40% from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, our leading immunology medicines as well as double-digit revenue growth from Neuroscience, our second largest and fastest-growing therapeutic area. With no significant LOE event in the near term, our growth platform provides a clear line of sight to growth into the next decade. This puts AbbVie in a strong position to fully invest for the 2030s and beyond.\nSince our inception in 2013, we have invested more than $84 billion to research, discover and develop new medicines and solutions for patients. We anticipate $9 billion of adjusted R&D expense in 2025, a substantial increase from the prior year. This supports numerous pipeline opportunities across our core areas, immunology, oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics as well as new sources of growth like obesity. More broadly, I'm very pleased with the breadth and depth of our robust pipeline with approximately 90 programs across all stages of development. We are making excellent progress and expect several important milestones over the next 2 years, including new product approvals for Tavapadon and [ PVC ], expanded indications for Rinvoq, [ Kinley ] , Qulipta and Ubrelvy and pivotal data for lutikizumab, [ MAPA ] and [ etentimag ]. These pipeline programs have the potential to drive growth for AbbVie later this decade.\nWe also continue to invest in external innovation adding novel mechanisms and platform technologies to further augment our pipeline to drive growth in the 2030s and beyond. Our recent deal activity includes announcing the acquisition of Gilgamesh's [ bretisilicin ], expanding our psychiatry pipeline with a next-generation psychodelic currently in Phase II development for NDD and closing the acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics, further strengthening our immunology pipeline with an in vivo CAR-T platform. Our consistently strong performance as well as the progress we are making to build and advance a robust pipeline fully supports our capital allocation priorities. This includes investing at least $10 billion of capital in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Construction is already underway for a new API manufacturing site in North Chicago as well as expansion of biologics manufacturing and R&D capacity at our existing site in [ Worcester ]. We are also committed to delivering a healthy sustainable dividend that grows every year.\nToday, we announced a 5.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2026. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 330%. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio, and our long-term outlook remains very strong.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.9 billion, up 11.2% on an operational basis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq continued to exceed our expectations, once again demonstrating robust growth across a broad set of indications. Skyrizi global sales were $4.7 billion, reflecting operational growth of 46%. Rinvoq global revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 34.1% on an operational basis.\nI'm especially pleased with our portfolio performance in gastroenterology, where these 2 medicines are on pace to nearly double their combined sales in IBD this year. Our uptake in Crohn's disease remains impressive with Skyrizi and Rinvoq together achieving in-play share leadership in a dozen countries. This includes capturing roughly 50% of newer switching Crohn's patients across all lines of therapy in the U.S. We see similar momentum in ulcerative colitis as well with Skyrizi and Rinvoq collectively holding in-play share leadership in more than 10 key markets and capturing nearly 1 out of every 3 newer switching UC patients across all mechanisms in the U.S.\nIBD continues to be an area of high unmet need with substantial headroom for biologic penetration as well as expanding lines of therapy. Given the compelling efficacy, safety and dosing profiles for both assets, Skyrizi with less frequent dosing favored by patients and clinicians especially for the maintenance treatment relative to the most effective dose for other IL-23s. In Rinvoq, often preferred for difficult-to-treat IBD cases, having demonstrated the strongest response rates in UC studies, as well as very strong efficacy in CD as well.\nAlong with Rinvoq's recently expanded label in IBD, which is a great outcome for patients who will now have access to Rinvoq earlier in the treatment paradigm when anti-TNF treatment is clinically inadvisable. So we remain very competitively positioned for continued strong growth across gastroenterology.\nMoving to the rest of our core immunology indications. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well in psoriasis, gaining share across our key markets. This includes an impressive 50% in-play patient share for biologics in the U.S. Rinvoq is also delivering strong prescription growth in rheumatology. In RA, Rinvoq continues to achieve the leading in-play patient share across lines of therapy. We now have 3 head-to-head studies demonstrating Rinvoq's superiority to other biologics in RA, including recent positive data from our [ Select ] switch trial, which clearly supports the clinical benefits of switching to Rinvoq after a first TNF failure. Lastly, we are seeing a very nice ramp in GCA, where Rinvoq now has full formulary coverage. I'm very pleased with the progress and look forward to the commercialization of additional sizable indications like alopecia areata and vitiligo.\nTurning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $993 million, down 55.7% on an operational basis, reflecting biosimilar competition. We continue to anticipate HUMIRA access in the U.S. will decrease throughout the remainder of this year and into 2026 as more plans select exclusionary contracts for existing patients. This step-up in volume erosion is expected to be partially offset by a price benefit also associated with these contract changes, which is included in our fourth quarter outlook.\nMoving to oncology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $1.7 billion, relatively flat versus prior year. Momentum from Venclexta as well as newer products, ELAHERE at [ Kinley ] and EMRELIS helped to offset the expected sales decline from IMBRUVICA, which continues to be impacted by competitive dynamics in CLL. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we are making to expand our commercial capabilities in both heme and solid tumors with our existing portfolio. These efforts will ultimately support our emerging oncology pipeline, which includes several promising programs to improve patient outcomes in many difficult-to-treat cancers.\nTurning now to aesthetics, which delivered global sales of approximately $1.2 billion, down 4.2% on an operational basis. BOTOX Cosmetic global revenues were $637 million and JUVEDERM global sales were $253 million, with growth rates for both products down on an operational basis. While our portfolio is performing well from a competitive perspective, we continue to face challenging market conditions in several key markets, which are impacting our results. With overall consumer sentiment remained quite low, especially in the U.S. as concerns about the economy and inflation way on discretionary spending, we now see category growth tracking below our previous assumptions globally.\nHowever, this near-term macro pressure does not dampen our excitement for the long-term potential of our leading aesthetics portfolio. We are investing to support patient activation with robust promotion and product innovation. We recently launched new consumer campaigns for Botox as well as fillers to further stimulate category growth, which remains highly underpenetrated and where we stand to disproportionately benefit upon market recovery giving our leading product shares. Innovation from our pipeline, including novel toxins like TrenibotE, a fast-acting short-duration toxin as well as several next-generation fillers will also provide growth in the coming years.\nMoving now to neuroscience, which is demonstrating exceptional performance. Total revenues were more than $2.8 billion, up 19.6% on an operational basis. I'm very pleased with our leading migraine portfolio with Ubrelvy, Qulipta and BOTOX Therapeutic, all delivering robust double-digit growth. Qulipta is now the #1 CGRP treatment for migraine prevention with a total prescription share of approximately 7.5%. Vraylar is also performing well in both bipolar and [ AMDD ] with total sales of $934 million, up 6.7%. Physicians continue to report positive feedback on Vraylar's strong benefit risk profile, including dosing flexibility, low sedation and the ability to address anhedonia and anxiety symptoms often associated with depression.\nLastly, in Parkinson's disease, Vyalev's launch trajectory has been very impressive. Total sales were $138 million, up 40% on a sequential basis. The uptake across international markets continues to exceed our expectations with physicians and patient communities highlighting meaningful improvements in on-time and off time from the 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms throughout the morning, day and night. Vyalev is the only Parkinson's treatment that often replaces the need for add-on oral therapies to manage motor fluctuations, reducing the daily pill burden for these patients. We anticipate expanded coverage of Vyalev in the U.S. soon, which we expect will provide further revenue inflection next year.\nI'm also excited about Tavapadon where we are pursuing approval for use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. This will be a very complementary offering for both [ BioLife ] and Duodopa. Given the significant commercial opportunity with our emerging Parkinson's portfolio, we are now actively expanding our field sales team to support higher anticipated demand next year. Overall, again, we are demonstrating strong revenue growth and our commercial execution has been outstanding.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights. Roopal?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP of Development & Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer\n\nThank you, Jeff. Starting with Immunology. We announced positive top line results from the second Phase III Rinvoq alopecia areata trial, reinforcing the potential for Rinvoq to significantly improve hair regrowth for patients suffering from severe forms of this condition. Data were consistent with the results from the first trial with Rinvoq demonstrating meaningful improvement in hair regrowth across both doses compared to placebo. We remain on track to begin submitting regulatory applications later this year. We also recently announced positive top line results from 2 Phase III Rinvoq vitiligo trials. In both studies, Rinvoq met the co-primary and key secondary endpoints at week 48, demonstrating improvements in both total body and facial vitiligo scoring compared to placebo.\nWe are very pleased with these results, which illustrate Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from nonsegmental vitiligo. The daily challenges of living with this condition can often lead to depression and anxiety. With no approved systemic treatment, there is very high unmet need for these patients. Once approved, Rinvoq could potentially be the first systemic therapy available for vitiligo. Regulatory submissions are planned for early next year.\nPositive top line results were also announced from the [ SELECT SWITCH ] trial, which compared Rinvoq to HUMIRA in RA patients who had an inadequate response or intolerance to their first TNF inhibitor. This is the first head-to-head study comparing anti-TNF cycling versus switching to Rinvoq. In this study, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority in HUMIRA for efficacy measures with nearly twice as many patients achieving low disease activity and remission, for RA patients who did not respond well to their first TNF inhibitor, these results clearly show the benefit of switching to Rinvoq rather than cycling to another anti-TNF.\nIn IBD, Rinvoq recently received a label update in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, allowing its use prior to anti-TNFs in patients who have received at least one approved systemic therapy when TNF inhibitors are clinically inadvisable. The treatment paradigm has evolved in IBD with increasing utilization of newer higher efficacy agents like Skyrizi. There are certain clinical scenarios when and anti-TNF may not be the most appropriate next treatment option for a patient. This label update provides physicians with the flexibility to use Rinvoq prior to anti-TNFs for certain patients after they have tried another approved systemic therapy.\nMoving to Oncology. The regulatory application was submitted to the FDA for [ PIVC ] in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. This rare aggressive blood cancer primarily affects an older population who is at high risk for complications with traditional chemotherapy or precluded from stem cell transplantation. As a new treatment providing durable responses with a manageable safety profile, our novel ADC has the potential to become an important new therapeutic option for these patients. At the recent ESMO meeting, we presented 3 orals for Temab-A, highlighting this novel ADCs potential, both as a monotherapy and in combination across advanced difficult-to-treat solid tumors.\nIn CRC patients who received 2 or more prior lines of therapy, and regardless of c-MET expression levels, Temab-A, in combination with [ bevacizumab ], demonstrated manageable safety and better responses and disease control compared to current standard of care. Treatment with Temab-A at 2.4 milligrams per kilogram plus [ bevacizumab ] achieved an objective response rate of 30% and a confirmed disease control rate of 97% compared to rates of 0% and 70%, respectively, for [ LONSURF ] plus [ bevacizumab ]. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase III study for this combination in late line all-comers CRC.\nIn a proof-of-concept study in pancreatic cancer, monotherapy Temab-A demonstrated an objective response rate of 24% in the overall population and 40% in patients who received first-line [ gemcitabine ] plus [ Abraxane ]. A Phase II study in pancreatic cancer is expected to begin next year. And in an exploratory study in MET amplified solid tumors after progression following standard of care monotherapy with Temab-A resulted in an objective response rate of 47% and median duration of response of 12.5 months for the 2.4 milligram per kilogram dose. Higher responses were observed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with a rate of 69% in gastroesophageal cancer with a rate of 71%. A Phase II study in MET amplified solid tumors is expected to begin later this year. We are making significant progress with Temab-A across a broad range of tumors, and there is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating durable efficacy and a manageable safety profile in these difficult-to-treat cancers. We look forward to providing additional updates on Temab-A programs as data mature.\nIn Neuroscience, the regulatory application for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease was recently submitted to the FDA. For many patients with Parkinson's, existing oral therapies aren't sufficient to manage symptoms. Our selective D1/D5 receptor partial agonist demonstrated robust efficacy as a monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and as an adjunct to [ levocarbidopa ] oral therapy in patients still experiencing motor fluctuations. Once approved, we believe Tavapadon will be an important new treatment option.\nResults from a Phase II study evaluating BOTOX an upper limb essential tremor were recently presented at the MDS Congress. In the study, BOTOX met the primary in all secondary endpoints, demonstrating significant improvements in all assessment measures compared to placebo. With a global patient population of about 25 million, essential tremor is the most common movement disorder. This progressive neurological condition can substantially hinder patients' physical activities and diminish their quality of life. Current treatment options are limited in terms of both efficacy and tolerability, leaving considerable need for new therapies.\nBased on these results, we plan to advance a new toxin for upper limb essential tremor. [ Jemmy bode ] is a novel toxin that has demonstrated different pharmacologic properties preclinically compared to BOTOX, such as less diffusion to neighboring muscles. Phase II studies for [ Jemmy bode ] in essential tremor and potential hernia repair will begin next year.\nTo further expand our neuropsychiatry pipeline, we acquired -- we acquired [ Bretasilisen ] from [ Gilgamesh ]. [ Bretasilisen ] is a novel [ 5-HT2A ] receptor agonist and 5-HT releaser with a short duration of hallucination that has demonstrated robust efficacy in a Phase II proof-of-concept study in major depressive disorder. Rapid efficacy was achieved after the initial dose with response and remission maintained through day 74 without additional intervention. This novel psycodelic has the potential to provide significant benefit to patients by offering rapid robust and durable antidepressant effects following a short in-clinic treatment session. Additional Phase II studies in depression are expected to begin next year.\nTo summarize, we continue to make good progress across all stages in therapeutic areas of our pipeline and look forward to many important pipeline milestones in the remainder of this year and into 2026.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott T. Reents\n\nSenior VP & CFO, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our third quarter results. we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.86, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $1.50 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense primarily reflecting upfront charges for the acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics and our license agreement with IGI. Total net revenues were nearly $15.8 billion reflecting growth of 8.4% on an operational basis, excluding a modestly favorable impact from foreign exchange.\nImportantly, our ex-HUMIRA growth platform delivered reported sales growth of more than 20%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 14.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 21.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 30.9% of sales, which includes a 17% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $667 million, the adjusted tax rate was 24.5%, reflecting the lower deductibility of acquired IPR&D expense this quarter.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.61 and $10.65. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the third quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $60.9 billion, an increase of $400 million. This updated forecast primarily reflects Skyrizi global sales of $17.3 billion, an increase of $200 million with continued share gains in psoriasis and IBD. Neuroscience global revenues of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting continued strength across Vraylar, BOTOX Therapeutic, Vyalev and the total oral CGRP portfolio. Aesthetics total sales of $4.9 billion, a decrease of $200 million reflecting greater-than-expected market softness globally. With the remaining $200 million increase reflecting the collective momentum from Rinvoq and several other products across our diverse portfolio. And we also continue to assume a relatively neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth.\nMoving to the P&L for full year 2025. We continue to expect adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of $9 billion and adjusted SG&A expense of $13.5 billion. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 41% of sales, in line with our previous expectations after including the roughly 6% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the third quarter. And we now forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 17.3%, also reflecting the impact of acquired IPR&D.\nTurning to the fourth quarter. We anticipate net revenues of more than $16.3 billion. This reflects an estimated 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.32 and $3.36. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nFinally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of September was more than $5.6 billion and we generated approximately $13 billion of free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year, which includes nearly $2.2 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow fully supports a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we are increasing 5.5% to $1.73 per share beginning with the dividend payable in February 2026. As well as capacity for continued business development, we have executed approximately 30 deals since the beginning of 2024, and we continue to assess external innovation across all of our key growth areas. We also remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026. In closing, AbbVie once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Cedric, we'll take the first question, please."

Welcome to AbbVie's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.

Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie delivered another outstanding quarter with results exceeding our expectations. We are making excellent progress advancing our pipeline and adding more depth through strategic transactions that support our long-term growth.\nTurning to our second quarter performance. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $15.4 billion, more than $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement includes sales growth of 22% from our ex-Humira platform with continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are now on pace to deliver more than $25 billion in combined sales this year, well above our initial expectations. We also delivered strong double-digit growth from neuroscience, driven by Vraylar, Vyalev and our leading migraine portfolio.\nBased on our momentum through the first half of the year, we are raising guidance for the second time. We now expect full year revenue of $60.5 billion, an increase of $800 million. We have now raised our revenue guidance by $1.5 billion since the start of the year. We are also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.21, and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.88 and $12.08.\nIn addition to our strong financial results, we are making great progress with our R&D pipeline across all stages of development. Notable highlights from our late-stage programs include the recent approvals of [indiscernible] for nonsquamous, non-small cell lung cancer and Rinvoq for GCA. The regulatory submission of [ Trenibot-E ] a first-in-class short-acting toxin in aesthetics as well as highly differentiated Phase III results in alopecia areata, a potential 10th indication for Rinvoq in the U.S. We are also focused on augmenting our pipeline with therapies and platform technologies that have the potential to elevate the standard of care for patients. These include promising early stage programs that have the potential to drive growth for AbbVie in the next decade.\nWe have executed more than 30 business development transactions since the beginning of last year.\nOur recent activity includes closing the agreement with Gubra for a long-acting amylin analog in the treatment of obesity as well as announcing our planned acquisition of Capstan Therapeutics, giving us an in vivo CAR-T platform that can further strengthen our immunology pipeline. We also in-licensed ISB-2001, a novel trispecific antibody for multiple myeloma, and we announced the collaboration with ADARx to develop next-generation siRNA therapies across multiple disease areas, including immunology, neuroscience and oncology.\nIn summary, I'm very pleased with the performance of our business and the progress we are making against our long-term strategy. AbbVie's outlook is strong, and we are well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $7.6 billion. Skyrizi continues to demonstrate impressive growth. Global sales were $4.4 billion, up 61.8% on an operational basis. We continue to capture robust in-play patient share in psoriatic disease. In the U.S., this includes clear leadership in psoriasis across all lines of therapy versus both biologics and oral agent as well as continued strong performance in the PSA derm setting with frontline in-play share leadership more than double the next closest biological oral therapy. Globally, Skyrizi continues to grow and achieve total psoriatic disease market leadership in numerous major markets around the world.\nI'm also very pleased with Skyrizi's performance in IBD, where we are on track to double our sales this year. In the U.S., we continue to capture more than 1/3 of newer switching patients in Crohn's disease and nearly 20% of newer switching patients in ulcerative colitis. As we look ahead, we feel very confident in Skyrizi's profile, including compelling efficacy, safety and dosing and our very robust head-to-head program where we have demonstrated superiority and clear differentiation against multiple novel therapies sets a high bar for comparison. So as we do compare our current dynamic share to total prescription share, it's clear there is still a substantial opportunity for continued total share gain across all of Skyrizi's indications over time, especially in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, which are still earlier in their launch trajectory.\nTurning now to Rinvoq, which is also demonstrating outstanding growth. Global sales were $2 billion, up 41.2% on an operational basis as we continue to see nice momentum across all of Rinvoq's indications. Uptake in IBD continues to be very strong. In the U.S., Rinvoq's in-play patient share across all lines of therapy for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is second only to Skyrizi among branded medicines. So our portfolio, Rinvoq and Skyrizi together are capturing 1 out of every 2 in-play Crohn's disease patients and 1 out of every 3 in-play UC patients in the U.S. a very strong combined leadership position in gastroenterology for AbbVie.\nI'd also highlight that we are making excellent progress with Rinvoq's global launch in giant cell arteritis, our sixth indication in rheumatology. Initial prescription trends as well as feedback from rheumatologists has been positive with access in the U.S. expected to ramp quickly over the rest of the year. Finally, we announced impressive Phase III results in alopecia areata, a chronic autoimmune disease leading to unpredictable hair loss with nearly 2 million diagnosed patients globally. Alopecia areata as well as the next wave of diseases, including Vitiligo, HS and lupus, would expand Rinvoq's treatment in both dermatology and rheumatology areas where we already have very strong call points with Rinvoq's core indications.\nTurning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.1 billion, down 58.2% on an operational basis, reflecting biosimilar competition. We anticipate Humira access in the U.S. will continue to decrease throughout the second half of this year as more plans select exclusionary formularies for existing patients.\nMoving to oncology which delivered total revenues of nearly $1.7 billion. [ IMBRUVICA ] global sales were $754 million, down 9.5%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL and partially offset by higher persistency rates for existing patients. Venclexta global revenues were $691 million, up 8.3% on an operational basis. This reflects strong demand in CLL with combination use of Venclexta plus BTK inhibitors emerging as a preferred fixed duration treatment. We are also seeing nice momentum from [ Ella here and up Kinley ], with both delivering double-digit revenue growth.\nAnd we are early in the U.S. launch of [ AMrellIs ], our newest ADC for previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients. This commercialization will help to establish c-MET expression as a valid biomarker in non-small cell lung cancer and also build AbbVie's presence more broadly in solid tumors where we have several promising next-generation ADCs in development, including TMAb A, which shares the same c-MET target.\nTurning now to Aesthetics, which delivered global sales of nearly $1.3 billion, down 8% on an operational basis. Botox Cosmetic global revenues were $692 million and [ JUVEDERM ] global sales were $260 million, with growth rates for both products down on an operational basis. Consistent with the past few quarters, economic challenges and lower overall consumer sentiment have impacted the aesthetics market, which continues to perform below historical levels. As noted on the first quarter call, we moderated our assumptions for near-term category growth globally, which is tracking largely in line with our expectations.\nFrom a competitive perspective, our facial injectable portfolio remains the clear leader with strong market shares globally. Our progress with the [ Ali ] loyalty program is going well, and we have robust plans underway to support patient activation. This includes a new Botox consumer campaign in the U.S. with ramping second half investment, continued injector training globally and bringing new products to market like [ Trenibot-E ], our fast-acting short-duration toxin with commercialization expected next year.\nSo as economic conditions improve from current levels, we remain very well positioned for growth over the long term in the aesthetics category.\nMoving now to Neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area where we continue to demonstrate robust growth. Total revenues were approximately $2.7 billion, up 24% on an operational basis. This exceptional performance is driven by continued double-digit operational growth of Vraylar with global sales of $900 million, up 16.3%. Botox Therapeutic, with global revenues of $928 million, up 14.2%. Ubrelvy with global sales of $338 million, up 47.2%, and Qulipta with global revenues of $267 million, up 76.9%. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from the head-to-head TEMPLE study comparing Qulipta to topiramate for migraine prevention. TEMPLE demonstrated that Qulipta had fewer treatment discontinuations attributed to adverse events as well as a significant reduction in migraine days versus topiramate. Given the high use of topiramate as a frontline treatment for migraine prevention, we anticipate these strong results will support earlier adoption of Qulipta.\nMoving to Parkinson's disease. I'm very pleased with the performance of Vyalev, where the global launch is off to an excellent start. Total sales were $98 million, up 56% on a sequential basis. Feedback from movement disorder specialists has been overwhelmingly positive with uptake across the international markets exceeding our expectations. Looking forward, we believe our emerging Park Parkinson's disease portfolio with [ BioLab ], Duodopa and Tavapadon forthcoming has the collective potential to a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the long term. So overall, I'm very pleased with the execution and continued strong performance across our commercial portfolio.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights. Roopal?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP of Development & Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer\n\nThank you, Jeff. Starting with immunology, where we continue to make meaningful progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since the last earnings call. FDA approval was granted for Rinvoq in GCA, representing our sixth rheumatology indications. Additionally, top line data from the first Phase III Rinvoq alopecia areata trial were just announced. In the study, Rinvoq met the primary and key secondary end points, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in hair regrowth across both Rinvoq doses compared to placebo. Baseline scalp coverage prior to treatment was approximately 16%.\nIn the Rinvoq 30 milligram group, 54% of patients reached 80% or more scale pair coverage and 47% reached 90% or more coverage at 24 weeks. A robust effect was also demonstrated with Rinvoq 15 milligrams. These are truly transformative results and compare very favorably to the efficacy shown in pivotal trials for other JAK inhibitors. The placebo-adjusted SALT 20 and 10 scores for Rinvoq 30 milligrams were approximately 20 percentage points above the rates for the highest approved doses of other JAK inhibitors. For the Rinvoq 15-milligram group, rates were approximately 10 points above. We are very pleased with these results, which certainly surpassed our expectations.\nResults from a second Phase III alopecia areata study are anticipated in the third quarter, followed by regulatory submissions starting later this year. The vitiligo program for Rinvoq is also nearing completion, with top line results from Phase III studies expected later this year. External innovation has supported expansion of our growing immunology pipeline. We recently announced plans to acquire Capstan. Their novel platform allows for in vivo programming of cells through mRNA delivery using targeted lipid nano particles. Capstan's lead asset currently in Phase I generates CD19-specific, CD8-positive in vivo CAR T cells. The CAR T cells are designed to achieve rapid and deep B-cell depletion without the need for lymphoablating chemotherapy while also avoiding other challenges associated with conventional ex vivo CAR Ts.\nThis innovative approach has the potential to become a transformative new treatment modality to reset the immune system and provide deep, durable drug-free remission for patients with autoimmune disease. Capstan's technology is a strong strategic fit for our early immunology efforts, where we have a number of internal assets designed to reset the immune system via depletion of pathogenic cells with the goal of delivering functional cures. We plan to advance several assets that deplete B cells into the clinic, each with a different target or modality. These include 2 anti-CD19 monoclonal antibodies that activate cell-mediated cytotoxicity, one with and the other without a payload team, [indiscernible] our BCMA CD3 bispecific T cell engager and [ ISB 2001, a BCMA CD38, CD3 trispecific T cell engager that is part of our recently announced agreement with IGI Therapeutics.\nAn interim analysis was recently completed on our monotherapy trial evaluating lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis. Lutikizumab showed numerically higher efficacy for the primary endpoint of endoscopic improvement compared to Humira, which was the control arm. However, the results were not sufficiently differentiated for us to pursue it as a monotherapy in this population. We believe there is still opportunity to drive incremental efficacy as a combination therapy in Crohn's disease where lutakizumab is being evaluated in combination with Skyrizi. Lutikizumab is one of several assets being studied and results from our Crohn's combination platform study will begin to read out next year. lutikizumab has the potential to drive efficacy across other autoimmune diseases. It has demonstrated strong efficacy in hydratinitis supertiva, where Phase III is ongoing with data expected in 2027. Additional studies are underway evaluating monotherapy or combination approaches in psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis and rheumatoid arthritis.\nMoving to oncology. [ AMRElLis ] received accelerated approval from the FDA as a monotherapy in previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with high c-Met expression. This is an important new treatment option for patients with this challenging disease. At the recent ASCO meeting, we presented encouraging data for several novel ADCs in our oncology pipeline, including preliminary data from a Phase I dose expansion study evaluating TMAb A, our next-generation CMAT ADC in patients with EGFR mutated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. TMAb A demonstrated high and durable responses across c-Met expression levels with an objective response rate of 63% and median duration of response of 9.8 months. Based on these results, we plan to initiate additional studies in both first and second line.\nOther highlights from the AbbVie meeting included encouraging early-stage results for ABBV-706 and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors and results from a registration-enabling Phase II study evaluating PVEK in BPDCN, which will support a regulatory submission later this year. At the ESMO meeting this fall, we have several planned presentations for TMAb A, including results from a Phase II study in combination with [ bevacizumab ] in CRC as well as data from a proof of concept [indiscernible] in pancreatic cancer. We will also present updated data at the upcoming World Conference of Lung Cancer from our ABBV-706 dose-ranging proof-of-concept study in small cell lung cancer.\nIn the area of hematologic oncology, we recently announced a license agreement with IGI Therapeutics to develop a novel trispecific T-cell engager for multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases. This first-in-class T cell-engaging antibody targets BCMA and CD38 on myeloma cells and has the potential to deliver deep and durable responses, ultimately improving outcomes for patients. Despite advancements, the 5-year survival rate in multiple myeloma is still only about 60%. So unmet needs remain high.\nQuality of life is also important, patients currently receive triple and quad therapy, which can be challenging from a safety and convenience standpoint. HCPs and patients will continue to seek next-generation therapies that can provide high efficacy better safety and less complicated dosing regimens. We are extremely well positioned to address the unmet needs across all patient segments in multiple myeloma, with 3 next-generation multi-specific T cell engagers, [ Etentamag ], ISB 2001 and [ SIM0500 ]. These off-the-shelf therapies may be particularly important for community-based sites where approximately 80% of patients receive care.\nIn the area of Neuroscience, we announced positive top line results from the head-to-head Phase III TEMPLE trial comparing Qulipta and topiramate for migraine prevention. The primary and all secondary endpoints were met in the study, demonstrating that patients treated with Qulipta have fewer discontinuations due to adverse events and a greater reduction in migraine days compared to patients receiving topiramate. Over the 24-week treatment period, 12% of patients discontinued Qulipta due to adverse events compared to 30% for topiramate, 64% patients on Qulipta achieved at least a 50% reduction in mean monthly migraine days compared to 39% of patients on topiramate. These results add to the body of evidence supporting Qulipta as a first-line treatment option for episodic and chronic migraine prevention.\nIn the quarter, [ MAVIRET ] was approved for the treatment of acute HCV. With this label expansion, caregivers can now treat HCV patients immediately following diagnosis rather than waiting until progression to chronic disease. Earlier treatment, coupled with increased testing brings us closer to achieving the World Health Organization's goal on global HCV elimination by 2030.\nTo summarize, we've made significant progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year and continue to expand our pipeline through internal and external innovation. We look forward to additional data readouts and regulatory milestones throughout the remainder of 2025.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott T. Reents\n\nSenior VP & CFO, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.97 which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.42 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.4 billion, reflecting growth of 6.5% on an operational basis, excluding a modestly favorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was 84.4% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 13.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 21% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 44.3% of sales, which includes a 5.3% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $678 million. The adjusted tax rate was 16.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.88 and $12.08. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $60.5 billion, an increase of $800 million. This reflects a relatively neutral impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth. Our updated revenue forecast includes the following approximate assumptions for several of our key products and therapeutic areas.\nIn immunology, we now expect Skyrizi global revenues of $17.1 billion, an increase of $600 million reflecting continued share gains in psoriasis and IBD, and U.S. Humira revenues of $3 billion, a decrease of $500 million, reflecting biosimilar competition. In Neuroscience, we now expect global sales of $10.5 billion, an increase of $300 million. This includes a $100 million increase for [indiscernible], reflecting strong international uptake with the remaining $200 million increase split relatively evenly across Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic and the total oral CGRP portfolio. And in oncology, we now expect [ IMBRUVICA ] global revenues of $2.9 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting higher persistency rates for existing patients, and Venclexta global sales of $2.8 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting continued strong demand in CLL.\nMoving to the P&L for 2025. We continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales. We now expect adjusted R&D expense of approximately $9 million and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.5 billion. We also now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 45% of sales, in line with our previous expectations, after including the 1.8% unfavorable impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the second quarter.\nTurning to the third quarter. we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15.5 billion. This reflects an estimated 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.24 and $3.28. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nIn closing, AbbVie once again delivered outstanding top and bottom line performance, with results well ahead of our expectations. I'm pleased with the momentum from our ex-Humira platform, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq and Neuroscience, which further supports AbbVie long-term outlook.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we'll take the first question, please."

All participants will be able to listen only until the question and answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ms. Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; and Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. AbbVie is off to an excellent start to the year with Q1 results exceeding expectations across several of our therapeutic areas. We also continue to advance our promising internal pipeline and add external opportunities to further strengthen our business and long-term outlook. Turning to our Q1 performance, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were more than $13.3 billion, nearly $550 million ahead of our expectations.\nI'm especially pleased with the performance of our ex-HUMIRA platform, which delivered robust sales growth of more than 21%. Immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and Aesthetics are all performing at or above our expectations, and we are well positioned to exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second full year following the US HUMIRA LOE.\nBased on this strong performance, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted EPS between $12.09 and 12.29. As you are aware, there is speculation that sectoral tariffs could be forthcoming. Any related impact from these tariffs as well as other potential new or reciprocal tariffs have not been contemplated in our guidance. To the extent there is an impact, we believe it would be in line with our peers given that AbbVie has an extensive manufacturing presence in the US, including API, biologics, toxins, and small molecules. Over the next decade we anticipate investing more than $10 billion of capital in the US to support our volume growth and our expansion into new areas such as obesity.\nTurning back to our performance, I'm very pleased with the excellent progress we are making with several pipeline programs that have the potential to be meaningful sources of growth. These include Lutikizumab across several immunology indications, 383 and multiple myeloma, and our next generation ADCs including Temab-A for several solid tumor types and 706 for small cell lung cancer. We also continue to add depth to our pipeline with strategic transactions that can help drive growth in the next decade. This includes the recent acquisition of Nimble Therapeutics to expand our immunology portfolio with oral peptides as well as a license agreement with Gubra to develop an amylin analog for the treatment of obesity. Obesity represents a significant global health concern with high unmet need. This market will continue to evolve with improved offerings and we believe our program with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset.\nGoing forward, we plan to invest further in obesity along with other opportunities across our existing five key growth areas.\nIn summary, the fundamentals of our business are strong and we are well positioned for the long term. AbbVie has a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff,\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nthank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.2 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are performing exceptionally well, contributing $5.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 65%. I'm especially encouraged with our portfolio performance across IBD, where Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to capture significant share given their efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles in Crohn's disease, which is roughly 2/3 of the overall IBD market. These two treatments together are capturing roughly 1/2 of in-play patients in the US, and total prescription share is now in the mid teens. Internationally, our Crohn's portfolio has achieved in play leadership in nearly a dozen key countries in ulcerative colitis.\nSkyrizi has already achieved the leading in-place share in the US following the launch in the second half of last year. Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are now capturing 1/3 of in-play UC patients, a very strong leadership position for AbbVie. We are also seeing strong momentum across indications in Dermatology, and Rheumatology as well. For Skyrizi, we continue to gain share in psoriatic disease where we have achieved the leading in-place share of new and switching patients in nearly 30 countries and see substantial room for total share growth. For Rinvoq, we are seeing increasing prescription demand globally across each of the rheum indications as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis, the fastest growing immunology market where we have two compelling head-to-head studies versus Dupixent.\nWe are also preparing for the global launch of giant cell arteritis, another new source of growth for Rinvoq. We received European approval earlier this month and expect FDA approval soon. The addition of this indication further rounds out Rinvoq's rheumatology label and gives patients with GCA access to a new compelling oral therapeutic option. Overall, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive results across all of their approved indications, and we will be raising our full year sales guidance for both products. Turning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, down 49.5% on an operational basis below our expectations, primarily due to faster share erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression in the US. As a result, we will be lowering our full year sales guidance for US HUMIRA, moving to oncology where total revenues were $1.6 billion, exceeding our expectations.\nImbruvica global sales were $738 million, down 11.9% reflecting competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global revenues were $665 million, up 12.3% on an operational basis. This strong performance reflects continued momentum in CLL as well as shared leadership in frontline AML among patients who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. We also have an emerging commercial portfolio in solid tumors. This includes Elahere, our leading ADC for ovarian cancer with global sales of $179 million, as well as Teliso-V, a potential new medicine for late-line non-small cell lung cancer patients. With US regulatory approval and commercialization expected in the next couple of months, Teliso-V will be supported by a dedicated sales force and medical affairs team which will target academic and community cancer treatment centers to reinforce the importance of c-MET as a biomarker and build relationships that support our emerging solid tumor franchise.\nTurning now to Aesthetics, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, down 10.2% on an operational basis. This was in line with our expectations. Botox Cosmetic global revenues were $556 million, down 10.7% on an operational basis, and Juvederm sales were $231 million, down 20% on an operational basis. As we have seen over the last several quarters, economic headwinds have continued to impact market conditions. Based on the trends we are seeing, including a decline in recent consumer sentiment, we are moderating our assumptions for category growth globally and adjusting our full-year sales guidance for Aesthetics accordingly. While near-term Aesthetics market conditions remain challenging, the long-term prospects for the category remain attractive given high consumer interest and low penetration rates for facial injectables. I'm particularly excited about BoNT, our fast-acting short-duration toxin, which we recently submitted for US regulatory review.\nThis first in class toxin represents a distinctive innovation for the treatment of glabellar lines and has the potential to be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the facial aesthetics category. We anticipate commercialization next year.\nMoving now to Neuroscience where total revenues were approximately $2.3 billion, up 17% on an operational basis with all key products exceeding our expectations. Vraylar global sales were $765 million, up 10.3% reflecting share capture in both Bipolar 1 disorder and adjunctive major depression. We continue to get very positive feedback on Vraylar's profile in terms of dosing flexibility, low sedation, and the ability to treat a full spectrum of symptoms.\nWe are very competitively positioned with our migraine portfolio where all three of our therapies continue to deliver double digit operational growth. Botox Therapeutic global revenues were $866 million, up 17%. Ubrelvy global sales were $240 million, up 18%, and Qulipta global revenues were $193 million, up 48.3%. In Parkinson's disease via Vyalev, global sales were $63 million, reflecting continued strong uptake in Japan and Europe. We are also pleased with the early launch feedback in the US where revenues are expected to ramp gradually over the next couple of quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination.\nLastly, we are making excellent progress with the development of Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease. This first-in-class D1/D5 selective dopamine agonist has a favorable benefit-risk profile and the potential to differentiate in several areas such as sedation and impulse control. Tavapadon could potentially be used as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunctive therapy to Levodopa for more advanced patients, which would be a complementary addition to our existing PD portfolio with Vyalev and Duopa. We expect to submit Tavapadon for regulatory review later this year with commercialization expected in 2026.\nOverall, I'm extremely pleased with the execution and strong momentum across our commercial portfolio, and with that I'll turn the call over to Roopal for comments on our R&D highlights.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nRoopal, thank you, Jeff. I will start with immunology. We received European approval for Rinvoq in GCA and expect FDA approval soon. We remain on track for several important data readouts this year as well, including phase III data for Rinvoq and alopecia areata and vitiligo, and data from Skyrizi's head-to-head study in psoriasis vs. SOTYKTU. Our early and mid-stage immunology pipeline continues to advance. Recent initiations include a phase II study evaluating Skyrizi in combination with Lutikizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and a phase I study for our next generation TL1A antibody, which is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with Skyrizi in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This summer we will start a phase II study evaluating a combination of Lutikizumab and our anti-CD40 Ravigalimab in rheumatoid arthritis.\nMoving to our ADCs and oncology, we anticipate accelerated approval in Q2 for Teliso-V as a monotherapy in previously treated non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer with high c-MET expression. This is a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need, and when approved, Teliso-V will be the first c-MET-directed ADC for these patients.\nWe're also making good progress with Temab-A, our next generation c-MET ADC. A phase II dose optimization study evaluating Temab-A with a PD1 inhibitor as a front line combination therapy in eGFR wild type non-small cell lung cancer was recently initiated in the eGFR immune segment. We plan to initiate studies for Temab-A as a monotherapy in the second line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first line setting. Preliminary phase I results will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting this year. Phase II data from our CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab will be available, which could enable a phase III study in an all-comers population.\nProgress also continues with ABBV-706 in small-cell lung cancer. This ADC utilizes the same TOPO-I warhead and linker technology as Temab-A but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. In the phase I study, ABBV-706 was efficacious across doses with an objective response rate of approximately 60% in patients with relapsed or refractory small-cell lung cancer based on maturing duration of response and progression-free survival data. We plan to advance ABBV-706 into a trial in a relapsed/refractory population and a dose optimization study in combination with a PD-L1 in the frontline with the goal of establishing a chemo-sparing regimen as a new standard of care.\nIn the area of hematologic oncology. The data readout remains on track for the phase III Venclexta MDS trial, and if positive, our regulatory submissions would follow later in the year. A regulatory submission for PIVC and BPDCN is also planned for this year.\nWe continue to make good progress with our BCMA-CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. Recruitment is going well in the phase III monotherapy study in later lines, and we are on track to be fully enrolled by early next year. Additionally, we continue to evaluate 383 in various combinations, including with Pomalyst, Revlimid, Darzalex, and Iberdomide. We'll begin seeing data from these combinations next year, which could enable phase III studies in earlier lines of therapy.\nNow moving to neuroscience, our data from the long-term TEMPO-4 phase III study continue to support Tavapadon's favorable benefit risk profile. Efficacy in both early and advanced Parkinson's patients was maintained beyond a year, and the safety profile was consistent with that observed in the previous phase III studies with no new safety concerns identified. Rates of adverse events of special interest remain low, with impulse control disorder and peripheral edema less than 1%, dyskinesia approximately 2%, and sedation less than 5%. These results underscore Tavapadon's potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with Parkinson's disease. Our regulatory application is planned for later in the year.\nMoving to other areas of our pipeline in aesthetics, the regulatory application for our rapid-onset short-acting toxin BoNT was recently submitted. We also began the clinical program to evaluate co-administration of BoNT and Botox, which has the potential to be co-formulated as a novel product offering the combined benefits of rapid onset and Botox-like duration.\nIn obesity. Our partner Gubra recently announced positive interim results from the first part of a multiple ascending dose study for our long-acting amylin analog ABBV-295. This initial phase of the study tested one and two mg dosed once weekly for six weeks in healthy, lean, and overweight patients. The study showed ABBV-295 performed well, demonstrating a dose-dependent mean weight loss compared to placebo and a tolerability profile consistent with the results from the single ascending dose study. Mean weight loss in the two mg cohort, which had a mean BMI of 24, was 7.8% compared to a weight gain of 2% in the placebo arm on day 43. The second phase of this study is ongoing and is evaluating higher doses in overweight and obese patients with 12-week dosing. Titration and longer dosing intervals will also be assessed.\nFull data from this part of the study are expected next year.\nTo summarize, significant progress continues with our pipeline and we look forward to important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals throughout 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our Q1 results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.13 unfavorable impact from acquired IPRD expense.\nTotal net revenues were more than $13.3 billion, reflecting robust growth of 9.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted gross margin was 84.1% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 24.6% of sales.\nThe adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.3% of sales, which includes a 1.9% unfavorable impact from acquired IPRD expense.\nNet interest expense was $627 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $12.09 and $12.29. Please note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPRD expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion, an increase of $700 million.\nThis reflects an estimated 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth.\nThis updated revenue forecast includes the following approximate assumptions for several of our key products. We now expect Skyrizi global revenues of $16.5 billion, an increase of $600 million, reflecting share gains in psoriasis and IBD, Rinvoq global sales of $8.2 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting momentum across all approved indications.\nUS HUMIRA revenues of $3.5 billion, a decrease of $500 million reflecting higher erosion from biosimilar competition as well as further molecule compression.\nBotox Therapeutic global sales of $3.6 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting growth in chronic migraine and other indications.\nTotal oral CGRP revenues of $2.2 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting strong prescription demand.\nImbruvica global revenues of $2.8 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting lower erosion. Venclexta global sales of $2.7 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflects continued uptake in both CLL and AML across our key countries. And for Aesthetics, we now expect global sales of $5.1 billion as we are moderating our assumptions for market growth globally. As a result, total sales guidance for Botox and Juvederm will each be lower by roughly $100 million.\nMoving to the P&L for 2025, we continue to forecast full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion.\nWe now expect adjusted R&D expense of approximately $8.9 billion reflecting additional investment in our robust pipeline for long-term growth.\nWe also now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales in line with our previous expectations after including the 0.4% unfavorable impact of acquired IPRD expense incurred through Q1.\nTurning to the Q2, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $15 billion. This reflects an estimated 0.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange on full year sales growth.\nWe are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 49.5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.26 and 3.30. This guidance does not include acquired IPR and expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nOur guidance is based on current trade rules and does not reflect the impact of any additional trade policy shifts including pharmaceutical sector tariffs. While it's difficult to quantify in the absence of actual policy details, it's worth noting any related unfavorability in 2025 would reflect a partial year. Given the timeline for a 232 investigation.\nWe are actively preparing for a number of potential scenarios and would expect to put into place mitigation strategies as we have more information.\nRelevant to these dynamics. I would also highlight that AbbVie has a significant US manufacturing presence that spans 11 sites, with plans to add four new manufacturing plants to our network, expanding our production for API, drug product, peptides, and devices in the US.\nAs we continue to invest and grow our US operational footprint, we believe a more competitive tax policy building on what was accomplished through 2017 tax reform will encourage a sustainable shift towards US manufacturing over the long term.\nIn closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year. We are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio and continue to be well positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our first question, we'll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat.\nThanks for the question and congrats on the results. Just two for me. Maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Obviously some big step up in the guidance here. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on which of the indications are most attributable to the upside we're seeing right now? And maybe just talk a little bit about the competitive landscape, maybe particularly Tremfya more broadly launching in IBD and how you're thinking about that dynamic. And then just my second question was on staying in immunology on HUMIRA. Can you just talk a bit more about how you're thinking about the tail for HUMIRA in light of some of the erosion that you're seeing this year? Thanks so much.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nChris. This is Scott. I'll start with kind of where we saw the increase attributed to for the various indications. I'll turn to Jeff for your other questions. We raised Skyrizi by $600 million to $16.5 billion, and that's split between $200 million in psoriatic and $400 million in IBD indications.\nWith respect to Rinvoq, we raised that $300 million and that's across all of the approved indications. So you can attribute that to 100 for rheumatology, 100 for derm, and the remaining 100 for IBD.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris. It's Jeff. Maybe I'll give some sense. We're obviously very, very pleased with the performance of Skyrizi and Rinvoq in immunology. As you've seen from the report.\nMaybe to give some perspective, you know, it's not uncommon to start to see in-class competition. We've seen that in psoriasis. We've seen that across the board. Maybe I'll just give a little.\nBit of a perspective over sort of.\nThe historical dynamics that we've seen with the IL23 category. So for example, if you go back to like 2018, 2019, when the IL23s were starting to come in psoriasis, the total patient share at that time in the early days was about 7% of the IL23 class. Now it's over 60%. And if we look at where IBD is, you know, obviously we launched first with Skyrizi in Crohn's and you know, everything's recently launching here in UC, it's about 7% of the total patient share in IBD. So you can imagine as we start to watch what this category is going to mean to transform IBD, we remain very confident. It's not a zero-sum game. We feel very confident in our profile and what we're able to deliver if we look across UC, if we look across our head-to-head data versus sequence versus the other trials.\nNet-Net, we see very, very strong momentum across the board, regardless of competitors that may come in. My thoughts on the HUMIRA tail again as I highlighted and Scott highlighted in his remarks, you know, we are seeing a bit of faster erosions as the biosimilar start to play out. This is of course the third year of the biosimilar event, so it's really not too surprising. We also do continue to see the molecule continue to erode. As we look and we don't have full visibility and we'll be monitoring the 2026 access as we go throughout the year, we do expect it to step down again. Just makes sense that will be the fourth full year.\nSo we'll have deeper visibility of that tail sometime over the course of the year. But as we said before, the real impact of the tail is when HUMIRA does not have a meaningful headwind to our overall growth as a corporation. So we expect that to start to develop over that 2026 time period.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nOkay, thank you, Scott. Operator. Thank you, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please. Go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research Pharma and Biotech Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.\nThanks so much.\nCongrats on the quarter.\nMaybe two questions for me as well.\nYou know, you alluded to some of.\nThe mitigation strategies you're taking with respect to tariffs potentially. Could you just elaborate little bit more there in terms of what that means for maybe inventory, and then any contemplation on any changes to IP domiciling? And the second question I had is on your amylin program there. I know you talked a little bit about next steps, but was just wondering if you can elaborate in terms of how much higher you're going on doses, what you'd expect that to translate to in efficacy, and maybe the size of those cohorts, like how many more patients will we get in this next update?\nThank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. This is Rob. So Scott and I will handle your first question, and Roopal will handle your second question. So just to, I think, back up and maybe talk about, you know, AbbVie's manufacturing network and then I can mention how we're thinking about potential mitigation. I think it's important to know that, you know, we have a broad footprint that allows us to assure supply for our patients around the world. And that's really why you've been able to see us avoid supply disruptions during events like the COVID pandemic. I mean, and today we have a robust US manufacturing network with more than 6,000 American workers across 11 sites. As I mentioned in my remarks, that includes manufacturing of API, biologics, toxins, and small molecules. You know, for example, our largest product, Skyrizi, is made in the US for the domestic market.\nGiven our expected volume growth and our expansion into areas like obesity, as I mentioned, we'll continue increasing our US footprint with over $10 billion in planned capital investment during the next decade. In terms of potential mitigation in the near term, we could take inventory management actions or secure alternate sources of API. We could also look at cost efficiencies and productivity initiatives as a source of mitigation, which we always do. I think what's more challenging is trying to pass the tariff impacts to our customers, especially with penalties in the government channel, and with existing contracts in the commercial setting. So I don't see that as a viable source for mitigation. Longer term, we will add more US manufacturing capacity, which is part of the planned capital investment of over $10 billion.\nSo specific to 2025, we would look to mitigate the impact as much as possible with a combination of supply chain actions, cost efficiencies, and any additional over performance from our growth platform. But in the meantime, we have enough confidence in the momentum of our business to raise our guidance this year, which should be viewed as a positive.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nYes, then Dave, with respect to IP, you know, IP has been looked at. I think when people try to assess the impact of potential tariffs on our sector, IP has been looked at as kind of a proxy as to what that impact might be, and certainly directionally, I think that is something that would be somewhat telling. You know, that said, when we look at our profile overall, Rob mentioned the strong US presence that we have, but we don't see our profile suggesting any sort of outsize impact for us as a company. You know, the tax rate is something that you can look at, which is essentially when you think of the bookends of the minimum tax for earnings outside the US, for tax earned in or income earned in the US.\nThat really kind of aligns with where that IP is structured, and that blending of your incomes kind of produces generally directionally your tax rate. You see us being relatively in line with our peers, and so that suggests that we have a similar IP profile from an overall perspective. I'd also just quickly point out that sometimes with Allergan, as that was a company that we redomicile back to the US, it was a foreign headquarter company. Recall that Allergan was a series of several companies that were put together over a few years, and those companies all have a significant US presence as well. So Allergan's profile is not dissimilar from ours as a whole either. So I think when you think about that IP profile, it's important from a tariff perspective. It's also very important from a tax reform perspective.\nThere was a lot of progress made in leveling the playing field for US companies in 2017 tax reform that did a lot of good things and really helped invest in the US as well as create a competitive environment for our companies. We see it as an important piece of building upon that tax reform to encourage further and long-term, as I mentioned in my remarks, sustainable investment. I see a tax reform initiative building on 2017 coupled with tariffs as something that will encourage US manufacturing over the long term. We feel very good about our profile right now.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal, and I'll answer the ABBV-295 question regarding the multiple ascending dose study. Currently, with the data you've seen, we're at one and two milligrams. We have the opportunity here in this study to go several-fold higher than the two milligrams. We also have the opportunity to go beyond six weeks, namely around 12 weeks, before we get into formal phase IIB, which I would say around next year, which we would go quite a bit longer. The sample size, what you've seen here, may be a little bit larger because of the multiple ascending dose format here. We'll see larger sample sizes once we get into the formal phase IIB. The other opportunities here are also to look at titration at the one milligram or maybe even lower. We don't see any adverse events beyond suppression of appetite.\nSo there's an opportunity to be able to start low and start titrating up to doses quite a bit higher than two milligrams. But we're open to watch this study and be flexible. The other important findings would be around muscle and bone. So those would be other things that will be evaluated as well as looking at dosing. The half-life is around 270 hours, so that could give us an opportunity to go twice a month and even potentially monthly. So all that will be captured in this data set. We expect to see some data next year and then that will allow us to best design a more formal phase IIB study.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Carter Gould from Cantor. Please go ahead.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Cantor\n\nGood morning.\nThanks for taking the question. Obviously there's been a lot of discussion around drug pricing kind of resurfacing, and some rumblings around Most Favored Nation kind of bubbling back to the surface.\nWanted to get a sense understanding of.\nYour expectations and flexibility, if need be, to take actions outside the US and.\nMaybe more of a commercial question.\nAs we think about the potential co-administration of BoNT and Botox.\nCan you kind of help frame how you think that would impact the market?\nIs this something that could just grow the overall pie, move share, et cetera?\nAny thoughts on that front would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nHey, Carter, it's Rob. I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second question. I think as we study the environment, we are very supportive of a balanced approach that addresses affordability while also encouraging innovation. You've seen many of our peers reinforcing the importance for the EU to properly value innovation, which we echo and would support any policies that encourage that outcome. That said, we hope the administration contemplates the harm that international reference pricing could have on US healthcare, the US healthcare industry, and future innovation. I think anything like price controls, cost increases, or higher taxes just leaves less investment available across the industry to advance new innovative medicines. That said, I'm very encouraged by the administration's willingness to address the pill penalty in the IRA, and as fixing that would support long-term innovation in our industry.\nAnd so as we look at the push, I think for the EU to more properly value the innovation is an absolute appropriate push. We're encouraged by some of the policies that really support innovation. You know, Scott also talked about tax reform, and I think that's an important lever as well. As we think about, you know, what are the things that will drive investment in the US and drive more innovation. I think if you just look at AbbVie as an example, we've invested over $5 billion of capital since tax reform in 2017. I mean that includes a new oncology research center in South San Francisco, Skyrizi manufacturing capabilities in the US, eye care capacity expansion in Waco, Texas, and technology infrastructure upgrades across our footprint, just to name a few.\nImportantly, as Scott mentioned, tax reform allowed us to acquire Allergan, an Irish-domiciled company that we then redomiciled into the US. I mean that transaction enabled AbbVie to continue increasing our R&D investment through the HUMIRA LOE, which is unprecedented. That will ultimately help us really lead to more innovation in our pipeline and ultimately impact patients of the future. So when we think about policy, we think tax reform has provided the right incentives to invest more in the US and more in innovation, and that's what we would encourage.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, and thank you for the question. Let me give a quick update on the BoNT and the combination approach in terms of how we're starting to think about it. Obviously we're super pleased with the recent filing on BoNT. As we've highlighted before, the short acting toxin will operate on two different levels for us. First it will stimulate the funnel. It will basically be a market stimulator because we know there's lots of considerers in the marketplace that are just worried about going to a full strength toxin because it lasts for three to four months. The approachability of a short acting toxin that works in about eight and a half hours and is gone in two and a half weeks makes the market much more approachable for the people in the consideration phase.\nSo we think it's going to work on the market and our share because obviously we've done studies with Botox after BoNT now in the combination used. Carter, it's very interesting. This is more of a pure sort of share play when we talk to the consumers. Many of the consumers are using a lot of Botox, and you start saying, can you imagine a Botox that works almost immediately? So an immediate acting Botox that gives us the potential. And we'll have to see how those trials and those studies play out to actually restate the whole market. Because what's remarkable about BoNT is that we can see a two-grade change in the glabellar lines in eight and a half hours. So nothing has ever worked even close to that fast.\nSo we could even have a premium toxin that sits alongside Botox, day one, or a replacement product for just simply a better Botox, an immediate-acting Botox. So it gives us a lot of flexibility, and it's certainly very exciting. As Roopal has highlighted, the program that will begin here for the combination.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nCourtney Breen\n\nSenior Research Analyst of US Biopharma, Bernstein\n\nHi all, thanks for taking the question today. I wanted to loop back to part of the inventory and tariff conversation. We've been able to get some explicit answers from some of the peer companies. So just wanted to see if you were able to give us context as to whether you have enough inventory in the US to support products like Rinvoq, Botox, Vraylar, or HUMIRA for the rest of this year. What about 2026 and 2027? And then the second question is just on the back of the prior BoNT question. Can you give us a little bit of context as to the pricing strategy for that kind of treatment market because arguably kind of with a shorter duration.\nTime horizon, you have kind of less value. And so I'd love to see understand a little bit more about how you're thinking about placing these products together. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll take your first question and Jeff will take the second look. Absent policy details, we're not going to get into speculating on the impact. I think you've known us to be a company that once we have a full understanding, we're very transparent and detailed. If you think about how we approached the Part D benefit redesign, as soon as we understood that impact, we were well in advance of the implementation of that, discussing the impact on the company. But with tariffs, we don't have the policy details for sectoral tariffs. So it's premature to speculate on the impact. And once we have that information, we'll.\nCommunicate at the appropriate time.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nRegarding the pricing. Obviously, since we just had the filing, it's premature. We'd go through a very rigorous pricing analysis as we would get closer to launch, and some of the considerations that we would look for, which is obviously, as I mentioned, the rotation of even more patients into the assessment brings a lot of value to those practices. And if you think about it, the lifetime value of those new patients is very meaningful. So that could play into dynamics of ultimately how we price the BoNT once we ultimately make that decision sometime next year. Obviously it does work shorter, so that might imply a different or lower price point to start the trial.\nBut those are all considerations commercially that we will go through, as we go through our launch readiness process over the course of the year, to really optimize the impact of that product as we bring it to the market.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Courtney. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nSenior Biotech and Pharmaceutical Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. Congrats on all the progress.\nI would like to understand a little bit more about your thought process around?\nGubra's Amylin and there have been a couple of strategies.\nOf course Novo is trying to.\nCombine it with GLP-1, but then there is a strategy or thought process that.\nAmblin could be a good agent as a standalone agent.\nSo how are you thinking about this?\nEspecially with the longer acting version? Do you think there is a strategy to just use this as a single?\nAgent, especially among patients who cannot tolerate GLP-1? We'd love to get your thoughts. Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey, Mohit its Roopal, I'll take that. So thanks for highlighting some of the potential here, and I think we're thinking about it quite broadly. So as you stated, there's an opportunity here as a monotherapy. I think the way we think about it is tolerability is key. We see a number of dropouts upwards of 30% even after a month of starting with the current set of assets. And then when we look over the course of the year, 60% to 70 of the patients will drop. Now, there's a variety of factors that drive that discontinuation, but a key component is tolerability. So to have a monotherapy that's tolerable, that provides meaningful weight loss and potentially has other potential benefits. We've seen preclinically preservation of muscle. We'll have to see if that plays out, but that could be another benefit in the long term when this launches.\nWe do anticipate many of the patients will have already been on.\nAssets that are available today. So it could serve as a nice follow on for folks that couldn't tolerate or came off for other reasons and want to go somewhere else. Now, in terms of combinations, recall when we did this deal, one thing we liked about it was also the neutral pH of the formulation. So that could enable combinations with a variety of mechanisms. As Rob stated, we continue to be interested in this space and we'll be thinking about other potential opportunities which could include combinations that may drive further weight loss. But key for us would be tolerability and.\nDurability of use.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. Two questions. First of all, Bristol appears to think there's a path forward with Cobenfy in adjuvant schizophrenia based on existing data. Where does AbbVie stand in its analysis of the future of Emraclidine? For instance, has a path forward become more clear in the last few years, few months? Secondly, I believe AbbVie has more plants in Ireland than any other company. Curious how you think about that as well as your overall OUS footprint. Do you cut back OUS to invest in the US or do you maintain the presence of OUS? Given the fact that in four years we could have a different administration with very different views and related to this topic. Yesterday Roche said that their US plants are 50% utilized. I'm wondering if AbbVie would share a similar percentage. Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey, it's Roopal. I'll start with the schizophrenia questions. In terms of the recent data, it's difficult for us to comment. I think that'll be a discussion between the company and health authorities regarding the utility of a failed study.\nThat would be their discussion to have. How we look at Emraclidine is that we do still see potential and we want to approach this in a stepwise manner. The first step would be to look to see if we can further dose escalate beyond what was previously studied. We saw variable PK levels in those patients from the pivotal studies. Some were low and we think there's an opportunity to raise that. So a multiple ascending dose study will be initiated this year and that would apply to potentially monotherapy and schizophrenia as well as the adjunctive setting.\nSo as that data rolls out and if we're able to utilize a higher dose, then we would again stepwise go forward into a phase II setting to further de-risk and apply our learnings in terms of trial design. And then if we see strong data there, which could be as a monotherapy, could be as an adjunct, and also in neurodegeneration psychosis, then we would move into the phase III setting. But I would say we still believe there's opportunity here.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThen.\nSteve, this is Rob. I'll take your question on the manufacturing footprint. As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, obviously AbbVie, we have a very broad footprint. An important part of the strategy is to assure supply. As I mentioned earlier, we went through a global pandemic without any supply disruptions, and that strategy certainly paid off. We also have, I'd say, a very robust manufacturing network in the US. I think what's been widely misunderstood is Skyrizi as an example. Our largest product is made in the US, and so when we look at our global footprint, we consider assurance of supply. As Scott mentioned earlier, clearly, obviously tax has an influence on longer term how you'd want to structure your supply chain. Certainly I think with a more competitive tax policy that sort of provide the appropriate incentives.\nWe try to say we have obviously been ramping our volume considerably. You look at just the performance, just think about biologics capacity and just the tremendous ramps we've seen for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And so we stay ahead of the curve, we ensure that we are investing appropriately so we can keep up with that demand. I'd say the commercial team puts a lot of pressure on operations because they're performing so well. But operations stays ahead of the curve and invests appropriately.\nAnd so when we look at the investment, and when I mentioned the greater than $10 billion investment that takes into account, in the US, that takes into account our volume growth that we expect in addition to new areas that we will invest in, for example, peptide manufacturing as an example, as we enter that space, obviously now as we enter into obesity, it makes sense to add that capability. And so that will also be part of our supply chain strategy here. So that's the way we're thinking about it.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nAll right, thanks, Steve. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of David Risinger from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nThanks very much, and congrats on the performance. So, I have two questions, please. And they're both a bit high level. So, the first is the industry is facing three major US government risks, actions that are harming biopharma innovation, including significant FDA disruption and questioning of proven medical science, tariff threats. And also, the Trump administration's agenda to take prices down more than the Biden administration took down drug prices. So, considering what appears to be a lack of appreciation in Washington of the benefits that the biopharmaceutical industry brings to Americans, can you please comment on how your executive team and board are engaging differently today with Washington leadership to change the political agenda for the better? And then, second, the press release mentions that guidance doesn't reflect any trade policy shifts, including pharmaceutical sector tariffs.\nCan you describe the potential trade policy shifts that you're considering or thinking of beyond tariffs? Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nDavid, I'll take the first question. Roopal, you can certainly add on as it relates to the FDA. And then Scott, you can take that last question. So you know, we're obviously not a member of [PhRMA] today. AbbVie, but we do continue to communicate with the association really to seek alignment on the most critical issues for the industry. Now, AbbVie has a large government affairs organization that engages with lawmakers and the administration on our top policy priorities, and that includes tax reform. We've talked about that quite a bit today: IRA, 340B, and patient affordability in Medicare. And we have actually seen some positive results from that engagement. I mean, just this week, Congress released a report on 340B which included a recommendation that changed the law to more clearly define a patient, which should help address the abuse that is occurring with this program.\nI would also view the 340B policies in the latest executive order as a positive. I also previously mentioned that seeking to eliminate the pill penalty is a positive for innovation. So we will continue to work with lawmakers, as we always have, on policies that support a healthy US Biopharma industry, continued innovation, and patient affordability.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. Regarding FDA interactions, I would say our teams have been in active discussions with the FDA and on multiple programs across therapeutic areas, sometimes daily interactions, and no signals of a slowdown. We are monitoring the situation closely. However, thus far we haven't experienced any delays to our timelines.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nIt's Scott, just with respect to your question on my initial comments.\nIt's just the trade policy shift we're talking about here: the pharmaceutical sector tariff or the potential pharmaceutical sector tariffs. It's not any additional things that we were contemplating. Certainly the environment has some uncertainty out there, but specific to that comment, we were speaking of the pharmaceutical sector tariffs.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Vamil Divan from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nBiopharmaceutical Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. And I just, I don't think, sorry if I missed some of this, but one of the tariff discussions, I was curious about the aesthetic side. I know the pharmaceutical products are excluded from the current tariffs, but I thought products like your breast implants and Juvederm may be included right now. So it's curious if that's the case or not. And if it is, then why wouldn't there be some accounting for that in your new guidance or maybe you just absorb it within your guidance. Any impact there? And the second is just on the aesthetics side and appreciate the macro issues and all the macroeconomic pressures.\nI'm just curious if you can comment on the market share dynamics, and is there any sort of share shifts that you're seeing either in toxins or fillers that may be impacting things beyond the macro components? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Vamil. It's Scott. You were right. It's a great question regarding the current tariff rules that are in place. So, in general, pharmaceutical products and our products are exempt from those, similar to our peers. However, there's a couple exceptions to that. And then, specific to Aesthetics, yes, there are some application of the rules to Aesthetics, but we have absorbed the Aesthetics impact in the guidance, and I will tell you it's modest. It's something approximately $30 million. So, something fairly modest in the current rules, and that's something that we have absorbed. So, all of the guidance that I gave and reported today from the margin profiles and otherwise includes us absorbing.\nThat's\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah Vamil yes. So I'll go over your market share, give you some flavor on that, and I'll focus on our two big markets.\nThe US and China. As I mentioned, we were right on our guidance, right on our forecast.\nFor Q1.\nRemember the biggest impact there was the price because we reversed the alley redesign from last year. So when we looked at basically what happened from Q3 to.\nQ4 to Q1.\nWe know we took a market share hit in toxins in that Q4. The good news is we've seen a complete reengagement in basically the old ALI program with all of our accounts. So things are quite stable. We actually had a one market share point gain back from where we were. Now we still have to gain some more share over the course of the year to come back to where we were pre the change to Alli. We have lost year over year some share in toxins in the US and filler. Our share is very, very stable. We did not see a significant share impact on the filler side the business. It's just been sort of a double-digit market pressure there. Now in China, I'm quite pleased with the share performance.\nWe've recently had a couple of significant approvals. Sequentially, we have the masseter approval.\nFor Botox, which is sort of in.\nThe lower face and jawline, and also Volux, which is in Juvederm. So we've actually seen significant positive momentum in Botox share in China as well as positive share in filler. So it's a little variable across the board. Our big push will be to recover that share over the course of the year in the US toxin space. Hope that helps.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Alexandria Hammond from Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexandria Hammond\n\nDirector and Head of Therapeutics Research, Wolf Research\n\nThanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Skyrizi and Rinvoq have consistently surpassed expectations, but we've been getting some questions on what might drive long term growth in INI as it relates to these assets. Could you comment on when we should start seeing results from your Skyrizi and Rinvoq combination trials? And as a follow up, what combination are you most excited about from a mechanistic perspective? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll start on the Skyrizi question and the combinations. So.\nThe studies have initiated, and we would anticipate next year starting to see early data readouts. And I would say we're excited about several of these mechanisms. We've utilized quite a bit of data that we've already collected to see what could be the best combination, and ultimately clinical data will guide that path. But we use biopsy data. The team has applied machine learning to these data sets, spatial omics, a variety of different techniques, and the ones that we like are one, the Alpha 4 Beta 7 combination. We think that could be a good combination. We like Lutikizumab, which is a bispecific to anti-IL-1 alpha and, importantly, IL-1 beta. We see that overexpression in patients with IBD that have failed other advanced therapies. We see something similar for TREM1, which would be another potential combination.\nAnd then as I mentioned, we also have a longer acting agent designed to be longer acting TL1A that could also be a very good fit with IL-23 like Skyrizi. The other thing we'll be doing, since I mentioned a variety of different combinations, is also capturing a number of biomarkers to see if there's any potential for pretreatment segmentation in the future, consistent with what we do in oncology. Thus far, no real successes. I would say, maybe there's hints in TL1A, but we're gonna generate that data as well to see if there's opportunities to be able to use biomarkers in the future to segment these patients.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nMaybe Alexandria, I might add, when we look at Skyrizi and Rinvoq, certainly we're very pleased with the strong demand in the quarter, and that led to us taking a combined $900 million of increased guidance for the year. We've also given the long-term guidance in 2027, which we continue to feel very confident in. Also, I think it's worthwhile to think about Rinvoq will have a second wave of indications towards the end of the decade. They'll add a couple billion dollars of sales. We really see these two products, even before the combination that Roopal spoke about, as having a long runway for at least the next eight years. We feel very good about that from that perspective.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll just add on to that. I think strategically when we look at the company and we have this clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, we can use that time, and obviously we're looking to elevate the standard of care for immunology patients. We think these combination studies are a way to accomplish that. But we're going to use that time to just as we did with HUMIRA; we came up with Skyrizi and Rinvoq as a way to elevate the standard of care. And you know, that was the second that really launched us into a second chapter of the company.\nThe third chapter is going to be as we think about the growth beyond Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and we have the time and we're investing appropriately to identify what those drivers will be, and you know, within immunology and outside of it. I mean, we have five key growth areas that we're very confident can drive growth. But obviously you've now seen us enter the obesity space as we think about more sources of growth, and we think that's also an opportunity. So we think the company is very well positioned to grow very nicely for at least the next eight years and then use that time and the investment that's available to grow beyond that.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Alexandria Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thank you for the question. Had a question on current immunology price volume dynamics specifically: is the low single-digit headwind being realized? If so, is it somehow being blended where HUMIRA is seeing outsized headwinds while Skyrizi and Rinvoq are seeing tailwinds? Or is there some sort of co-pay shift or is there a shift in co-pay utilization year over year or sequentially? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nJames. It's Scott. So I think I'll start with Skyrizi and Rinvoq. If you look at Q1, those were both driven by strong demand. Now we've talked about pricing being slightly negative for those two products on a full year basis. We did see a little bit of favorable price in the quarter, and that's just a timing issue. So in the quarter, probably two things. One, Jeff's organization continues to do a very good job of focusing on copay utilization and effectively managing that. So we saw a little bit of benefit from copay utilization, and then in addition we had anticipated some channel mix changes later in the year, but those actually came to fruition a little bit earlier than we thought.\nAnd so those factors, I would say, along with some other gating issues, combined being price favorability, but we still anticipate negative pricing headwinds on a full-year basis. With respect to HUMIRA, we talked about in the quarter on the full year that there is a decrease in volume associated with share erosion as well as the compression of the overall molecule. So that volume is going to continue. I think you'll see that volume a little bit more pronounced throughout the year, but there certainly continues to be some price. You've got some unwinds of accruals that cause price impacts, but you also have just the changing of the rebate dynamics as we entered into a new contract year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, James. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Geoff Meacham from Citibank. Please go ahead.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHey guys, thanks for the question. Rob had another one on policy. Wanted to get your perspective on PBM reform, which is often mentioned as highly likely to happen this year. What would you say are the main elements that you'd want to see in reform, and the second one on bd? Is there a therapeutic area that you guys feel like you still have to add to? I wasn't sure if neuro remains one of the top priorities. Just post-emraclidine, and it does seem like multiple shots on goal and metabolic disease is kind of the approach a lot of other biopharmas are taking, but I wanted to get your perspective. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nI'll take those questions. So on PBM reform, I think we're supportive of anything that helps with patient affordability, and so to the extent that that improves the dynamic on patient affordability, that that is truly realized.\nIn their pockets, that's favorable. So we are supportive of the efforts there, but it's really all about making sure that we're addressing patient affordability as it relates to business development. We obviously really like the five key growth areas that we have today. As I mentioned, those will certainly drive very strong growth for at least the next eight years. I think sometimes there's a misconception about neuroscience. For AbbVie, it's more than just psychiatry. We have a very strong migraine franchise that's performing exceptionally well in Parkinson's. We're seeing great results. And we've been in Parkinson's for a long time with Duopa. But as we think about the ramps we're seeing with BioLEV, that innovation we've brought for those patients, and Tovapodon, which came from Cerevel, we could really start to see our Parkinson's franchise emerge.\nAnd so when I think about neuroscience, I would think about it really in four segments. There's psychiatry; it's an important segment. There's migraine, there's Parkinson's, and there's all other neurodegeneration. We obviously are investing in Alzheimer's. So you just look at the business development activity. Since the beginning of last year in neuroscience, we extended our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter, who discovered Vraylar. You know, we added a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh. We acquired a next generation A beta antibody that's very promising for Alzheimer's from Aliada. We're also investing in novel approaches for migraine disease. So we are actively investing in neuroscience. We obviously added obesity because we do think of ourselves as being a company that's going to be very large in the next decade. So it doesn't hurt to have another source of growth.\nWe have evaluated various options beyond the five. We chose to move into obesity for a number of reasons. It's obviously an extremely attractive market, has high prevalence, and plenty of headroom for growth. It's a market that has ample space for multiple players and new entrants. I think we're also uniquely positioned with our Aesthetics business to access that channel in addition to therapeutics. Importantly, and it's something we always focus on, is where are there high areas of unmet need? As we think about our portfolio, that's really our strategy, is to drive a remarkable impact for our patients by elevating standard of care. When we look at obesity, there's plenty of opportunity, whether it's reducing GI side effects, improving body composition, more consistent weight loss across patient types, and longer lasting weight loss.\nAnd so as we evaluate that opportunity, we found the amylin class to be very attractive given it's the most validated non GLP1 mechanism for obesity and has very encouraging early data. And we believe the amylin opportunity with Gubra has the potential to deliver a differentiated asset. So, so we will continue investing in obesity, we'll continue investing in our five key growth areas, and we think that gives us the right mix to drive growth for the long term.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Jeff. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of US Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Bank of America\n\nThank you. I have a question on drug advertising. So AbbVie is the number one spender on this. Hard to turn on a TV without seeing something like a Skyrizi ad, and that says you see a very positive ROI from that level of spending. As you know, there's an occasional talk by the administration about limiting such advertising. My question is, do you think there's any basis in reality for that? I know you'll say it shouldn't happen, but that doesn't mean that it won't potentially happen. Then on obesity, as you noted, your Amylin is long-acting. Doesn't that imply that a really kind of key next part of the portfolio is a long-acting GLP? Or are you not interested in the GLP-1 space at all?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thanks Tim. It's Jeff and you're right; it's difficult to know if DTC reform would take place or what it might look like. I think you're right. We're very supportive of the First Amendment rights to be able to advertise, and obviously we work with the FDA on every single claim that we make on television. If there were to be a change, we would be able to pivot. I mean we could shift our investment to disease awareness. That could help us drive because we have such leading in place share to continue to basically invest in the right way to consumers. We certainly could move to other channels because it's not really clear if it would just be mass media or et cetera. So certainly the whole market would take a step back if that were to happen.\nOur brands would still be very, very competitive in terms of our ability to pivot and toggle were that to happen. Difficult to predict. We would be of course planning for any of those contingencies were they to take place.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nTim, it's Roopal regarding different mechanisms, so as stated previously, we think there's opportunity as a monotherapy and also as a potential combination. I would say we haven't ruled out any particular mechanism that we would combine with. The other thing to mention, I think I already stated this, but we do have a neutral pH in the current formulation for ABBV-295. So that potentially makes it more amenable to combinations. But mechanisms that you mentioned and potentially others I would say are on the table for us.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Trung Hien from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrung Hien\n\nProgram Manager, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks. I've got two questions if I can. So first, just very quickly, you did touch on the pricing dynamics with Skyrizi in Rinvoq, but did the strong performance include any notable one-time contributions, inventory build, or pull-forward effects? And then second, similar to Vamil's Aesthetics question, but China reciprocal tariffs have been enacted. Is that contemplated in your guide, and is that material to your Aesthetics business? And then just I know it's early days, but are you seeing any shifts in demand there? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nScott, I'll answer your questions. Thanks for the questions. So with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I would say the one item that I would point to. Again, this was strong demand overall. The one thing that also helped the growth in the quarter was with respect to the retail destocking. So in the past we've talked about there's some retail inventory buildup as a form of price speculation in the fourth quarter. I talked about on the fourth quarter call that we didn't see a lot of that. And then that was, you know, again confirmed. We did not see. There was no unwind like there has been a prior year. So there was a year-over-year benefit from that, the lack of destocking.\nFrom the retail buildup in Q1.\nBut again that was fairly modest. When we talk about our overall growth globally, 72% operationally, the demand was really in the 60s%, and so you just saw a small portion from that retail destocking. With respect to the China tariff, yes, you're right, there is some impact for Aesthetics in those products in those numbers. But again that impact is fairly modest. We've contemplated that in our guidance. And so I would say overall the existing tariffs you're talking about $30 million approximately globally, and a decent component of that is with respect to the Aesthetics business. And then maybe I don't know if Jeff would like to comment on; I think you'd ask if we've seen any demand changes in China.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nNo, we haven't over the last 30 days. I mean, obviously things are. Things change quickly. But as I mentioned, if we look at the quarter, we've been encouraged by the share growth we've seen in China based on the recent approvals for both the toxin and the filler category.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, operator. We have time for one final question.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our final question we'll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nConor MacKay\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi there, this is Conor MacKay on.\nFor Evan, thanks for taking our question and congrats on a great quarter. Botox and Elahere were two products that, outside of your INI business, came in sort of meaningfully ahead of analyst expectations. Can you maybe walk us through what's driving the strength for each of those?\nThank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start on your question and thank you for that. So certainly, as I mentioned in the prepared remark and Rob as well, Vyalev is emerging as a very, very important product, and we communicated certainly that it could continue to exceed expectations. So it's quite remarkable. We continue to see strong uptake in Japan, across Europe. And while we're only in the commercial market, which is about 30% of the market in the US because we're still waiting on the full Medicare reimbursement, the market feedback is exceptional. I mean, this is a really amazing product to help patients sleep through the night, control of movement disorders. It's unlike Duopa, it's. It lasts for 24 hours. It's a more simple Sub-Q injection versus surgery that you might get. So it's playing out exactly as we had hoped.\nAnd so you're just seeing some strength of that in the quarter. That's also why we remarked that we're excited to bring Tevapadon, which is also showing some very nice data here. And we're getting ready for the file to start to really build out a more meaningful Parkinson's category. And then Elahere, we continue to see nice uptake, very unique product. Obviously it's got a, you know, 30% improvement in overall survival. It's well tolerated non-chemo. So the US business continues to perform very well, and we are starting to see the international launches. We've pulled forward significant international launches from the time that we had had done the deal with ImmunoGen. And we're going to start to see those international launches ramp here over the next several quarters. So that gives some sense over that brand as well.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nConor, this is Rob. I'm glad you asked a question about Elahere because oncology doesn't get enough attention for the company. Elahere came to us through the ImmunoGen acquisition. It was a very successful acquisition. It basically combined their ADC capabilities with our, and now you're starting to see the AbbVie internally discovered ADCs emerge. We've talked about Teliso-V. We're very excited about Temab-A, ABBV-706. You think about long-term growth drivers for AbbVie oncology with that emerging pipeline. And Roopal and I both mentioned ABBV-383, the bispecific for multiple myeloma. We have, I think, a very exciting emerging oncology pipeline that could be an important growth driver for the company. So I appreciate the specific question about Elahere.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Colin. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for joining the AbbVie Q1 2025 Earnings Conference Call. That concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the AbbVie Q4 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThank you. Good morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer, Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings.\nAbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you Liz. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our Q4 performance closes out another excellent year for AbbVie. And I am very pleased with the significant progress we made in 2024. We executed on our top commercial priorities, advanced our pipeline with key regulatory approvals and promising data, and further strengthened our business through strategic transactions. Turning to our results, we delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $10.12, which is $0.49 above our initial guidance midpoint excluding the impact of IPR&D expense.\nTotal net revenues were $56.3 billion, exceeding our initial guidance by more than $2 billion. Our results demonstrate a rapid return to sales growth with full year revenue up 4.6% on an operational basis, despite $5 billion of US Humira erosion in 2024. This outstanding execution is driven by our ex-Humira platform. Which continues to outperform expectations, delivering full year sales growth of more than 18% with revenue growth accelerating to 22% in the fourth quarter. As I look to 2025 and beyond, we are well positioned with our ex-Humira platform. It will allow AbbVie to deliver robust mid single digit revenue growth in 2025 and exceed our previous peak revenue in just the second year following the US Humira LOE.\nGiven that we have no significant LOE events for the rest of this decade. We have a clear runway to growth for at least the next eight years, including a high single digit revenue CAGR through 2029. We anticipate a substantial portion of this growth will be driven by robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. These two assets are expected to collectively generate nearly $24 billion of revenue in 2025, reflecting growth of more than $6 billion. Based on this strong momentum, we now expect Skyrizi and Rinvoq to exceed more than $31 billion of combined sales in 2027. Which is $4 billion above the guidance we provided last year.\nWe are seeing strong performance across all of their approved indications, especially in IBD. And we see several tailwinds that will support growth into the next decade, including healthy immunology market growth, strong share capture given best-in-class profiles, continued robust market access, and momentum from new indications. Such as the recent launch of Skyrizi in UC as well as the potential for five new indications for Rinvoq over the next few years. In Neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, we are seeing very robust performance with sales of $10 billion expected in 2025, reflecting growth of $1 billion across psychiatry, migraine, and Parkinson's. In Oncology, I am very encouraged by our long-term growth prospects. This includes our BCL-2 inhibitor Venclexta, our FR Alpha ADC for ovarian cancer, ELAHERE, our two novel c-MET ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and ABBV-400, and our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma, ABBV-383.\nLastly, while the recent performance in Aesthetics has been impacted by challenging market conditions in the US and China. The category remains very attractive given low penetration rates for facial injectables. When the market returns to more normalized growth, our leading commercial portfolio and forthcoming pipeline will help drive improved performance. Based on the market trends over the last few years and our assumption for a gradual recovery in the near term, we now expect Aesthetics to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through 2029. Turning now to R&D. We have made excellent progress with our late-stage programs.\nThese advancements include recent approvals for Skyrizi in UC. EPKINLY and later lines of follicular lymphoma. ELAHERE for FR Alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. VYALEV for advanced Parkinson's, and new indications for BOTOX and JUVÉDERM. In 2025, we anticipate approvals for Rinvoq in GCA and Teliso-V for non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. As well as regulatory submissions for Tavapadon in Parkinson's, Venclexta in higher-risk MDS, and BoNT/E for Aesthetics.\nWe have also added depth to our pipeline by signing more than 20 early-stage deals since the beginning of 2024. Including promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in Immunology, Oncology, and Neuroscience. We have significant capacity to continue pursuing external innovation with a focus on differentiated opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. In summary, I am very pleased with AbbVie's execution in 2024 and expect our diverse portfolio to drive strong growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7.3 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi total sales were nearly $3.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 57.9%. Rinvoq total sales were more than $1.8 billion, reflecting operational growth of 47.1% on a full year basis. Skyrizi and Rinvoq delivered approximately $17.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of nearly $6 billion year over year, exceeding our expectations. These results reflect strong performance across all approved indications.\nI'll share some highlights in the US. Skyrizi total prescription share in the biologic psoriasis market is now approximately 40%, reflecting a very significant lead relative to all major competitors. With in-play capture rates remaining very strong. Over the course of 2025, we anticipate new data for Skyrizi on hard-to-treat areas of the body, including scalp and genital psoriasis. In addition, we expect the readout of our fifth head to head study in psoriasis comparing Skyrizi to Sotyktu, which will continue to differentiate the brand versus oral competitors. Rinvoq is now capturing more than 20% in market share in atopic dermatitis as our communication around our LEVEL UP study versus Dupixent continues to ramp.\nRecall that in LEVEL UP we showed strong comparative results on stringent endpoints of skin resolution and itch reduction. In RA, Rinvoq is achieving the leading in-label share in the second-line plus market. Consistent with the brand's label. We see that US physicians are increasingly utilizing only one TNF prior to initiating Rinvoq treatment in RA. In psoriatic arthritis, Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are capturing a leading in-label share in the room category. Highlighting the effective co-positioning of both agents in this important segment.\nAcross IBD, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also capturing substantial portfolio share given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. In Crohn's disease, which is roughly 2/3 of the overall IBD market, these two treatments together are capturing approximately half of the in-play share. With total prescription volumes ramping very rapidly in ulcerative colitis, we are seeing a very strong inflection following the Skyrizi launch in the second half of last year. Both Skyrizi and Rinvoq together are already capturing roughly 1/3 of the UC in-play market, which supports robust momentum going forward for both AbbVie brands. We see similar performance internationally as well where Skyrizi and Rinvoq are also achieving leadership positions across our major countries. So I'm very pleased with this momentum and continue to see a significant opportunity for share gains.\nAcross our existing indications in addition to the typical market growth we see across Rheum, Derm, and Gastro in 2025 and beyond. Turning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of more than $1.6 billion, down 48.7% on an operational basis, primarily due to biosimilar competition. We continue to see molecule compression in the US with volume moving to other novel mechanisms which has resulted in the benefit to both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. We anticipate Humira access will decrease throughout 2025 as more plans move to exclusive biosimilar contracts. It's reasonable to assume that roughly half of US covered lives will continue to have parity access to Humira on a full year basis. With select exclusionary contracts for existing patients expected to begin around the middle of the year.\nMoving now to Oncology, where total revenues were approximately $1.7 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $848 million, down 6.2% reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $655 million, up 13% on an operational basis. Reflecting strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. Lastly, ELAHERE continues to demonstrate a strong launch trajectory for FR Alpha Positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with global sales of $148 million. Sales in the US are annualizing at more than $600 million and commercialization is now underway in key international markets where we are accelerating regulatory and reimbursement timelines.\nMoving to Neuroscience, where total full year revenues were $9 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.3 billion. In the quarter, total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 19.9% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of VRAYLAR with global sales of $924 million, BOTOX Therapeutic with global revenues of $873 million, Ubrelvy with global sales of $303 million, and QULIPTA with global revenues of $201 million. Beyond these leading therapies for psychiatry and migraine, we are very excited for an emerging portfolio in Parkinson's disease. We recently launched VYALEV, the only subcutaneous 24-hour continuous infusion of levodopa-based therapy for the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease. As a less invasive non-surgical delivery system that can provide meaningful improvements in on-time and off-time, we are seeing very high interest from both physicians and patient communities.\nParkinson's experts report significant benefit from the continuous 24-hour delivery and the control of symptoms morning, day, and through the night. While sales in the US are expected to ramp gradually over the next several quarters as we work to establish the appropriate Medicare coverage and benefit determination, uptake internationally is exceeding our expectations. Finally, I'm very encouraged by the data we are seeing for Tavapadon for potential use as a monotherapy for early Parkinson's disease as well as an adjunct to optimize oral therapy for more advanced patients. Tavapadon represents a very complementary addition to our Parkinson's disease portfolio with VYALEV and Duopa. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our Therapeutic portfolio which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2025. With that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on Aesthetics. Carrie.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Q4 global Aesthetic sales were approximately $1.3 billion, reflecting an operational decrease of 4.4%. In the US, Aesthetic sales of $839 million declined 5% as challenging market conditions and promotional dynamics impacted key assets. Consistent with recent quarters, the US facial injectable market continues to be affected by suppressed consumer spending that is related to the cumulative impact of high inflation over several years as a higher price procedure relative to toxins. Current conditions are most notably impacting the filler market, which declined by approximately 10% in the quarter. The toxin market remains more resilient, demonstrating low single digit percent growth.\nAlthough we continue to be the clear market leader in toxins and fillers in Q4, our facial injectable share declined by a few points. In October, we launched an updated version of our All? consumer loyalty program, which was designed to benefit providers by increasing treatment frequency, patient retention, and cross selling. While some providers embraced the new loyalty program, many felt the new construct was too complex to integrate into their practices. Therefore negatively impacting market share and inventory levels. Based on this market reaction, we reinstated our original All? consumer loyalty program earlier this month. This action has been met with a rapid and favorable response from our providers with encouraging early indicators for sales and market share recovery.\nInternationally, Aesthetics sales were $459 million. This represented an operational decline of 3.2% that was primarily due to lower JUVÉDERM sales, as BOTOX Cosmetics sales were roughly flat on an operational basis. Our international results were impacted by our second largest global market, China. Where lower consumer spending related to economic headwinds continues to affect performance. Looking to 2025, we've planned prudently with our outlook for modest aesthetic sales growth. In the US, this reflects a gradual improvement in market growth rates and share for both toxins and fillers.\nAdditionally, based on our All? loyalty program changes, we expect a one-time price adjustment to negatively impact our first quarter US results. Internationally, we are focused on retaining a strong competitive position as we launch multiple new products in China while we closely monitor market conditions and consumer sentiment. In summary, while economic headwinds in key geographies have created a near-term impact on market conditions. We continue to see significant long-term growth potential given high consumer interest and low penetration rates. Allergan Aesthetics is uniquely positioned to benefit based on our customer relationships, commercial investments, and innovative pipeline. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Carrie. We continue to make significant progress with our R&D efforts to advance novel clinical programs across all stages of our diversified pipeline. In 2025, we expect a strong cadence of important data readouts, regulatory submissions, and new approvals as well as many clinical trial starts for key programs starting with Immunology. Regulatory applications are under review for Rinvoq and GCA, with approval decisions anticipated in Q2. Data for two Phase III Rinvoq programs will be available this year, alopecia areata and vitiligo, and for our HF and lupus programs in 2026. Moving to Skyrizi. Data from the head-to-head in psoriasis versus Sotyktu will be available this year.\nAlso, this year, to further support differentiation in IBD, a study comparing Skyrizi to Entyvio in ulcerative colitis will be initiated. Additional mid-stage monotherapy and combination studies are planned in 2025. A Phase II study evaluating lutekizumab in atopic dermatitis. A Phase II study evaluating Skyrizi and lutekizumab in psoriatic arthritis, and advancement of our anti-TREM1 antibody ABBV-8736 with the eventual goal to add it to the Crohn's disease platform, study as a monotherapy and in combination with Skyrizi. Moving to Oncology, where multiple regulatory and clinical milestones, as well as Phase transitions for key programs, are planned. One area that we are particularly excited about is our ADC pipeline where several assets are aimed at multiple tumor types. Our regulatory application is under review for accelerated approval of Teliso-V as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-MET overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\nThe target for an approval decision is in the first half of this year. This represents a segment of lung cancer with high unmet need where patients have limited options and tend to have a very poor prognosis. If approved, Teliso-V would be the first c-MET directed ADC for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. We are also rapidly advancing our next-gen c-MET asset. A Phase III study evaluating ABBV-400 also known as Temab-A was recently initiated in patients with c-MET overexpressed refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. Temab-A as a monotherapy is being compared against chemotherapy plus bevacizumab this year.\nData from a Phase I CRC study evaluating Temab-A in combination with bevacizumab could enable a Phase III study in an all-comers population. Temab-A is also progressing well across lung programs. A Phase II study in EGFR wild-type non-small cell lung cancer is being planned where Temab-A will be evaluated with a PD-1 inhibitor as a frontline combination therapy in the EGFR-mutant segment. Results from the ongoing Phase I study could enable Temab-A dose optimization studies. As a monotherapy in the second-line setting and in combination with osimertinib in the first-line setting in gastroesophageal cancer. A Phase II trial was recently started evaluating Temab-A in combination with chemotherapy and a PD1 inhibitor in frontline patients.\nWe are also excited about ABBV-706, an ADC that utilizes the same topo warhead and linker technology as Temab-A but with an antibody that targets SEZ6. Encouraging data in small cell lung cancer were presented at ASCO last year, and this year dose optimization and longer-term duration data will be available. This readout could lead to the initiation of a registrational study in second-line and dose optimization in combination with standard of care in the front-line. Moving to FR Alpha ADCs, ELAHERE is now approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in the US and Europe and is currently in Phase III development for the platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer segment. Also, a next-generation ADC targeting FR Alpha, IMGN151, is currently in Phase I. This year, ELAHERE will be tested in combination with bevacizumab and a PARP inhibitor.\nIMGN151 is being advanced into dose optimization as well as in studies with standard-of-care agents such as bevacizumab, carboplatin, and a PARP inhibitor. These mid-stage studies for ELAHERE and IMGN151 will be used to inform our Phase III approach in various settings for ovarian cancer. Including induction and maintenance in platinum-sensitive patients and in combination for frontline maintenance. Another ADC from ImmunoGen known as Pivekimab sunirine targets a rare hematologic malignancy called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Based on positive data from the pivotal Phase II study, a regulatory application is planned for later this year. If approved, this would be an important new treatment option for patients with this aggressive blood cancer. Also, in the area of Hematologic Oncology, the Phase III Venclexta MDS study is nearing completion with an overall survival data readout later this year.\nNow moving to Neuroscience, following the emraclidine and EMPOWER-1 and EMPOWER-2 study readouts, a thorough analysis of the data was conducted to better understand the placebo effect observed in the two trials. Our findings point to a lack of uniformity of placebo effect across sites when assessing sites beyond those with high placebo response. A clear efficacy signal was observed, albeit more modest than reported in Phase Ib. Therefore, we see a path forward as an adjunct to atypicals in schizophrenia and as a monotherapy in psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These are diseases where there is a high unmet need for safe and tolerable treatments that can provide even a modest benefit. Additionally, our intention is to explore higher doses of emraclidine.\nThis is based on the degree of variability observed in the PK data from the EMPOWER studies. If higher doses are found to be safe and well tolerated, there is a potential opportunity to evaluate Emraclidine as a monotherapy in schizophrenia as higher doses may result in greater efficacy. A multiple ascending dose study will be conducted this year, and data will be available in the early part of 2026. Following this dosing work, Phase II studies in adjunctive schizophrenia, and potentially monotherapy schizophrenia, will be initiated. Dose ranging in elderly patients is ongoing, with Phase II studies planned in 2026 in patients with psychosis related to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Staying on the topic of Parkinson's disease, positive top-line results from the third Phase III trial for Tavapadon were recently announced.\nIn the TEMPO-2 trial, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a significant reduction in the severity of Parkinson's disease symptoms compared with placebo at week 26. Key secondary endpoints were also achieved. We are very pleased with the emerging profile for Tavapadon, which shows strong efficacy as a monotherapy and as an add-on to levodopa-carbidopa. The six-month data from the Phase III studies show Tavapadon to be generally safe and well-tolerated with low rates of adverse events of special interest such as sedation and impulse control disorder. Longer-term safety data will be available this year, and regulatory submissions will then follow. Moving to Aesthetics, we met with the FDA late last year regarding our BoNT/E submission for the treatment of glabellar lines.\nWe are in the process of generating additional CMC data requested by the agency, which should be completed in the next few months. The regulatory submission will likely occur around the middle of the year. To summarize, there have been significant advancements across all stages of our pipeline in 2025. We anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones including many trial starts for key programs. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.16, which is $0.08 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.88 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $15.1 billion, reflecting robust growth of 6.1% on an operational basis excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, our ex-Humira platform delivered reported growth of 22%, once again exceeding our expectations. Adjusted gross margin was 83.8% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 15.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 23.6% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 34.7% of sales, which includes a 10.4% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense.\nNet interest expense was $610 million. The adjusted tax rate was 20.2%. Turning to our financial outlook for 2025, our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $12.12 and $2.32. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year. We expect total net revenues of approximately $59 billion, reflecting robust operational growth of 5.7%. Despite a roughly 4% net unfavorable impact across our portfolio from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign.\nAt current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for select key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global Immunology sales of $29.4 billion, including Skyrizi revenue of $15.9 billion. Reflecting growth of more than $4.1 billion. Driven by continued strong performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD. Rinvoq sales of $7.9 billion, reflecting growth of nearly $2 billion with continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications.\nHumira total revenue of $5.6 billion, including US sales of $4 billion as more plans exclude branded Humira around the middle of the year. This forecast includes a $600 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. In Oncology, we expect global sales of $6.3 billion, including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.7 billion, which reflects a $400 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. BOTOX sales of $2.6 billion, reflecting continued strong demand partially offset by a $100 million net unfavorable impact from Medicare Part D benefit redesign, and ELAHERE revenue of $750 million. For Aesthetics, we expect global sales of $5.3 billion, reflecting gradual improvement in market conditions across global markets as well as market share recovery. In the US this includes BOTOX Cosmetic revenue of $2.8 billion and relatively flat sales for JUVÉDERM.\nFor Neuroscience, we expect global sales of $10 billion reflecting continued double-digit growth. This includes VRAYLAR revenue of $3.5 billion reflecting continued strong prescription demand partially offset by a $200 million net unfavorable impact from the Medicare Part D benefit redesign. BOTOX Therapeutic sales of $3.5 billion, total oral CGRP revenue of $2.1 billion, and VYALEV sales of $300 million. For Eye Care, we expect global sales of $2.2 billion. Moving to the P&L for 2025, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales. Adjusted R&D investment of approximately 14.5%, adjusted SG&A expense of approximately $13.2 billion, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 47% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of approximately $2.6 billion, which primarily reflects the annualized financing cost for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions.\nWe forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to approximately 15.6%. Finally, we expect our share count to be roughly flat to 2024. Turning to the Q1, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $12.8 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. This revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas, Immunology sales of $6.1 billion, including Skyrizi sales of $3.2 billion and Rinvoq revenue of $1.6 billion. We expect US Humira sales of $900 million. We also anticipate Oncology revenue of $1.5 billion, Aesthetic sales of $1.1 billion, which includes an unfavorable one-time price adjustment due to the reimplementation of the original All? program, Neuroscience revenue of $2.1 billion, and Eye Care sales of $550 million.\nWe are forecasting an operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales and modeled a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13.8%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.47 and $2.51. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's robust business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was approximately $5.5 billion, and we expect to generate free cash flow approaching $17 billion in 2025, which includes roughly $2.7 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments. This free cash flow will support a strong and growing quarterly dividend, which we have increased by 310% since inception.\nAs well as debt repayment, where we expect to pay down nearly $3 billion of total debt this year and remain on track to achieve a net leverage ratio of 2x by the end of 2026. Our strong cash flow also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio. In closing, we are pleased with AbbVie's results in 2024 and our financial outlook remains very strong. We have considerable momentum across our diverse portfolio and we continue to be well-positioned to deliver robust growth in 2025 and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nSenior Biopharmaceuticals Research Analyst, Guggenheim Securities\n\nGreat, thanks for taking the question. So maybe just to dive a little deeper on Rinvoq, obviously great performance and guidance, can you just comment a little more on pricing dynamics that you're seeing there? As for how you factored in pricing both for this year and maybe over the next several years. And then just a quick follow up on the comments that were given around Aesthetics, especially on the share side. I think you lost a few points but maybe getting it back, can you just give a sense of where you think the share is now for BOTOX and JUVÉDERM sort of at this point in time? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThanks Vamil. It's Jeff, and I'll comment on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, and I think we've been very consistent that. Over the near term and over time, this is a volume-based business. So we're going to see price declines year over year, but I would say modest, right. We've sort of highlighted that as we negotiate the formularies we've started to consistently see sort of these low single digit price concessions.\nNow obviously what Scott highlighted was unique for the 25 year with the Part D redesign that he outlined. So overall consistent low single digit price declines from the rebating side with a one-time Part D. We would anticipate once we lap the Part D we would see that sort of trend going forward.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Vamil, this is Rob. I'll just add that if you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our strategy here was to elevate the standard of care for patients and ultimately would drive a rapid return to growth for the company beyond Humira. And that's exactly what we've been able to execute. That strategy has played out. You see the differentiation in the marketplace. We have nine head to head studies, we're launching a few more. We've upgraded our guidance now by additional $4 billion in 2027.\nWe've been very consistent in our language around the pricing dynamics. You know, we said when you think about rebates, think about it as negative low single digits going forward. But given the robust performance of these assets, it's volume that's dominating the growth and we would expect that to continue.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll answer your question around BOTOX and JUVÉDERM share. So in the US we remain the clear market leader for both toxins and fillers. In Q4, a few points of share erosion bringing BOTOX to around the low to mid-60s. JUVÉDERM to around the low to mid-40s. As I said, the reversion of the loyalty program back to the original one, which we announced in December and then put into action 21 January 2024, was greeted with very positive response from our customers.\nEncouraging signs for us to recapture that share for both BOTOX and JUVÉDERM throughout the year. Just to note that the share did not go to one competitor. Rather it was more distributed among the entire competitive set. Thanks Vamil, operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat thanks so much. Just a two-parter on the Skyrizi Rinvoq dynamics. Maybe just first on the 2027 guidance, can you just elaborate on what were the biggest drivers of upside to those targets? As you think about the various indications for the drugs, is it fair to think most of this coming from IBD or is it across the board, and then probably a longer term question on those brands. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on how we should think about the growth rate beyond 2027? So basically how mature will these franchises be by then and what type of growth rates, can we think about over time? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThanks Chris, it's Jeff. I'll start on that. So the primary driver of the change is in fact share capture. So you know, the pricing assumptions have been consistent. You know we can call the markets pretty well. We see the, we see the actuals and the long term trends there. So it's been really share capture and I would say that we see it across the board. Certainly we've been super encouraged with Skyrizi in psoriasis.\nWe continue to see very, very robust TRx share trends. And there's no question that the ramps in IBD have been very, very significant. So that's a big piece of it. But I would say it's across the board. So, predominantly share capture. I don't know if Scott, you have anything to add, but that's the big dynamic there on the $4 billion.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nYeah, Jeff, maybe Chris, it'd be helpful. I can give you the breakdown by indication between the two on the 2027 guide. So we talk about $31 billion combined in 2027. That's our new long term guidance. That is $11 billion for Rinvoq and $20 billion for Skyrizi. Rinvoq is broken down, rheum is about $4.8, dermatology $2.5, IBD $3.7.\nOn the Skyrizi side, 12.5 of that $20 billion guide is from psoriasis and the remaining $7.5 billion is coming from IBD. That might help you kind of see those. Where the growth is coming from as well.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nIf we speak to it in terms of the $4 billion, just to give you a sense, then to add to what Scott just mentioned. So Skyrizi is up $3 billion, $1 billion of that is psoriatic and $2 billion is IBD. We're just seeing tremendous ramps early days with IBD. Then for Rinvoq it's up $1 billion from the previous guidance. And that's a mix of, you know, roughly $300 million rheum, $200 million derm, and $500 million IBD. So again, you know, across the board we're seeing tremendous performance, particularly in IBD. And then your question on how to think about the growth.\nWe have obviously given guidance beyond 27, but as I look at the sell-side consensus, clearly the growth that's in sell-side consensus beyond 27 is below our expectations. We would expect to see these markets continue to grow. We would also expect to see continued share gains, albeit as you start getting close to that in-place share level. The share curve bends. But still you expect to see some level of share growth. And then keep in mind, we will have the five, we expect the five new indications for Rinvoq collectively adding about 2 billion in peak sales.\nAnd so that will also contribute. So as I think about the rate of growth for Skyrizi and Rinvoq beyond 2027, you know, Rinvoq will likely grow faster than Skyrizi because of those new indication. You'll still see a robust performance from both assets, you know, at least through 2032.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Citigroup, your line is open.\n\nGeoff Meacham\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thanks so much for the question. Just had a couple, first one on Cerevel, you guys called. About the partial impairment today. The press release just want to get your perspective as to what the drivers are for the remaining value. You know, assuming Tavapadon is mostly it, but wasn't sure what you'd assume for Emraclidine or backup compounds.\nThen just on Aesthetics, you know. With the new guidance to 2029, is it fair to say that you think 25 could be the trough or have we already seen a trough in terms of the growth rate? I'm just trying to think of the longer term picture. And then just on BoNT/E, I wanted to get your perspective about the potential success there, adding new patients to the paradigm, just given the potential there. Thank you.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nJeff, this is Rob on your first question regarding Cerevel. So keep in mind the accounting rules do not allow you to write up an intangible. So even though we are more optimistic about Tavapadon now than we were at the time of the deal, we can't write that value up. So that would be the same as what we originally ascribed. We still obviously, as Roopal walked you through the development programs for Emraclidine, you know, still see opportunity in adjunctive schizophrenia as well as neurodegenerative psychosis. We haven't completely given up on the monotherapy opportunity either.\nBut that's a more heavily risk-adjusted opportunity now. So when you think about the value, you have to take into account, you know, the timing, so there's some level of time delay as well as a different probability of success for monotherapy. That's all baked in to because you're essentially valuing risk-adjusted revenues. You have to take that into account. That said, we're, you know, we're still optimistic about the asset. We're pursuing it in these indications.\nAnd again, as I mentioned, we haven't completely given up on monotherapy. That'll depend on dose-ranging, but that is the way we constructed the revaluation of the intangible. But overall, we still see a very nice opportunity, particularly for Tavapadon. And we still see potential for Emraclidine as well.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nJeff, I'll take your question regarding the Aesthetics trough. So we've not specifically guided that, but the way that we have modeled it and think about it is we do see recovery. And I think the big headwind here over the last two years has been the economic conditions. So we do see continual improvement. Carrie spoke about some of the market growth rates that we're seeing coming back in the US for both fillers and toxins. So we would, you know, if you model, you would anticipate 2025 to be the trough and then you know, our long term guidance is that high single digit compound annual growth using 2025 as the base year through 2029.\nAnd if you model that, that's going to put you somewhere north of $7 billion. Certainly this is a business we continue to be excited about. We think that there continues to be low market penetration rates globally, frankly, and we've got some innovation to continue to drive market growth. That market has grown low double digits historically. But I think, as we model, we're thinking a high single-digit growth in the markets. But we do see some growth accelerators with BoNT. And maybe I'll let the team talk about BoNT.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nMaybe I'll just mention here, just more broadly, this is Rob on the business. I think as we reflect on the Aesthetics performance and we are just going through a period of macroeconomic pressure on that business. But we do continue to see an attractive long-term setup. Again given low penetration rates, high consumer interest, and our leading portfolio including some exciting pipeline programs and toxins and fillers. You know, when you think about as part of AbbVie, the Aesthetics business has been able to continue investing despite the macroeconomic challenges and that will allow us to maximize opportunities when the market does recover. We set up this business to be a global and fully integrated unit with dedicated support from R&D and business development.\nAnd I'm confident that focused approach will pay off in the long run. It's just been difficult for us to call the market recovery. But we still have a lot of confidence in the long-term outlook.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThis is Carrie. I'll comment on BoNT/E. So as you said, BoNT/E will be an important catalyst for new patient activation into the category. Consideration continues to be very high for Aesthetics and for toxins. And like we said, it continues to be underpenetrated. And that's because there continue to be barriers for these people who are interested in the category but not acting around cost, and concerns of an unnatural look. And that's really where BoNT/E will play an important role based on its unique profile that is suited to address these these concerns.\nIt's fast-acting, it has short duration. So it's going to be a nice option to position for these considerers to try BoNT/E and then our commercial strategy will be to convert them from BoNT/E to BOTOX. So this is going to be an important pipeline catalyst to help us to activate that consumer market and drive more consumers into the toxin category for BOTOX.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nAnd it's Roopal, maybe one comment to add to Carrie on the R&D side. Even thinking past that, this year we'll initiate a study with BoNT + BOTOX to cover people immediately and get that long-term benefit. So those studies will start this year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Jeff. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned the net impact of the Part D redesign. Can you tell us what the volume impacts you guys are assuming, if any, in that calculation? And then the second question I had is on the pipeline slide you noted you could have some Phase II UC data for NX-13, which I believe is your oral NLRX1 agonist. Just maybe speak to conviction level there and how you think about that on the forward if that would be something that you could move into Phase III. Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nTerrence it's Scott. I'll take your question on the volume. So we have guided a 4% net impact across the business for a headwind to growth for Part D redesign. Now when we think about that volume offset, we've not quantified that in the guidance, but that is part of the 4%. I would say in the grand scheme it's a fairly modest offset overall. I think part of what you need to do when you think about that volume is recognize that when you look at the patient segments that exist, there's roughly three patient segments and they each take about 1/3 of the business.\nBut this is really something that will impact the standard eligible. And we're working very hard to ensure that people are electing cap and smooth. And so we really see that volume offset coming from that 1/3 of the patient segment to drive that. So that's why I think it's a little bit more of a modest offset. But we've not quantified iit.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd it's logical when you think about it because the other 2/3, I mean you have the LIS population which is 1/3. So they don't have an out-of-pocket burden like the standard eligible do. And then the other 1/3 are covered by employer plans where again they don't have the same out-of-pocket burden. So when we analyzed it, we looked at the market and saw that about 1/3, as Scott mentioned, of the population would benefit from the lower out-of-pocket. But keep in mind the cost share applies to the entire book of Medicare business. That's why the volume doesn't offset the price impact.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThis is Roopal, I'll cover the NLRX question. This is our asset from Landos. We had observed very early data, I would say Phase Ib in ulcerative colitis, and that looked good, but it was a very small sample size, I would say. This will be a robust Phase II with a placebo comparator, and we'll get objective data from centralized review of endoscopic data. It will be a good data set to look at, and if it looks good, definitely would be a Phase III asset for us. The other consideration we would have, similar to what I highlighted about other biologics that we'd be combining with Skyrizi, if this looks good, this could be a combination agent with Rinvoq as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Terence. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I have a question regarding ini. I know you talked in the past about Skyrizi, Rinvoq benefiting from some of the Humira prescription going to these agents as well. Taking that aside. Still, it seems like the volume or INI space is growing rapidly.\nCan you talk a little bit about the underlying dynamics as well here. Why this market continues to grow and how should we think about longer term for the overall market growth itself? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, so thanks Mohit. It's Jeff. And like we talked about before, particularly around the acute event in this case, this was the CVS exclusion in April. We could clearly start to measure the fact that not all of the switching from Humira. was going to the biosimilar. We saw about 20% of it was slipping away into new mechanisms or more advanced mechanisms like Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\nNow we continue to see the molecule compress, and you know, it's just physicians are using just less and less sequentially Humira and the biosimilars over time. I would say it's becoming harder to measure because you're also seeing a lot of dynamics around new head to head trials, new indications, and new other approaches. So I would say overall it's there, but it's relatively modest in the scheme of the volume that is basically accruing from basically the promotion and the profile of the medication. So it should continue. The more that we see sort of disruption in the market. You'll probably continue to see the molecule on trend continue to compress now.\nAlbeit modest. Your other point is very important. These markets are still very, very buoyant and significant. One of the dynamics that we see over time, and I think we'll begin to see it quite dramatically around the world, particularly in IBD, is that the lines of therapy start to expand. It used to be like primarily what was fueling the markets was primarily the new patients coming in off of older traditional medications. But now you're seeing the emergence in atopic dermatitis of the second and third line markets which are growing quite substantially.\nYou're going to see that significantly emerge in IBD. Whereas before physicians were really, really afraid to move people along. They did dose intensification, they added more steroids. But now that there's drugs like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and other agents, you're seeing those markets, lines of therapy expand. So that should continue and you know, we've contemplated that in our long-term projections. But that gives you some sense of why you're observing what you're seeing.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAs we look across, this is Rob, as we look across the specialty areas in psoriasis and IBD, you know we're projecting high single-digit market growth. Atopic dermatitis in the mid-teens, it's growing very, I mean you're seeing still fairly low penetration rates for atopic dermatitis. So there's tremendous room for growth. So we would anticipate mid-teens market growth there and then in rheumatoid arthritis that's probably more like low- to mid-single digits. But you can see across the board, very nice market growth which then will be complemented by the market share gains.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Dave Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much. So I have two questions please. First, regarding ABBV-400 or Teliso-V, could you please frame your long-term commercial vision for this candidate. Including what some may underappreciate about how broadly it could potentially be adopted in the early 2030s, and then second on external transactions. Emraclidine was a setback, but AbbVie's overall M&A track record has been very successful. Could you please discuss your agenda for M&A, including the potential to leverage your franchise strength and related product categories. Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah hi, it's Jeff. So I will give some thoughts on that. It's a very, very attractive asset. I think it's underappreciated, and part of it is the first category it will compete in, which is colorectal cancer. If you look at the response rate that we've seen, let's say in a smaller or mid-sized cancer type, which is ovarian cancer, with ELAHERE, it's quite striking. I mean, ELAHERE has been the most rapidly adopted ADC in the entire US oncology market.\nAnd it's because it entered this market, that was basically almost all chemo-based, with unmet need where there'd been no innovation. And when we look at the entry with ABBV-400 or TMAB-A, into colorectal cancer. It's a substantially larger tumor type as is quite evident. We've already seen very, very nice monotherapy result in later lines, much, much better than we've seen with the old chemo standard of care. Really it's whether or not they have c-MET or not. Now the thing that will really cause a big inflection that Roopal can talk about in a moment is that it's the combinability as you go up into the lines of therapies, okay.\nThat's really going to make this thing inflect and become a very, very significant product for patients in colorectal cancer over time. You know, the studies will have to bear that out. As well we're seeing very, very significant early results in lung cancer as well. So it is, I think it's an underappreciated asset. We'll have a chance with Teliso-V to sort of set the market around this whole c-MET, the modern c-MET area, but it's quite striking. So first we establish in later lines very big cancer directly against older chemotherapy and then we move combination as we move forward so thanks for the question.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nRoopal. Maybe just a comment there on our strategy around ADC and I think 400. It's a good highlight of that. So we think about what's a good target, meaning high expression on the tumor, and low expression in healthy tissue. And then we continue to focus on patient selection, individualization of care, and utilizing robust biomarkers as Jeff mentioned, c-MET. That is the opportunity to optimize benefit, risk, and particularly tolerability with our topo warhead platform.\nWe've seen low rates, for example, of alopecia, stomatitis, diarrhea, which others I think continue to struggle with. And safety and tolerability, as Jeff has mentioned, are critical. So we're also very focused on proper dose optimization to get this right. So we're able to combine in earlier lines, and that's the same approach that we have with the other one I mentioned, 706, and small cell lung cancer, and others in the pipeline then.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nDavid, this is Rob. I'll take your question on M&A, and thank you for acknowledging the strong track record we've had as a company. I would agree with that. When you think about the transaction with BI, that brought us Skyrizi, with Pharmacyclics, that brought us IMBRUVICA, and really gave us the critical mass to be a leader in blood cancers. Then the transaction with Allergan which gave us three verticals that can really drive long-term growth for the company: neuroscience, Aesthetics, and Eye Care. Then more recently the transaction with ImmunoGen which really bolstered our ADC pipeline.\nAs Roopal has highlighted in terms of our go-forward strategy on BD. We continue to pursue assets that can add depth to our pipeline and really drive growth in the next decade. We have clear line of sight to growth for at least the next eight years within the company today. So my focus is really about bringing in assets that can help drive that growth in the next decade. And since the beginning of 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've signed more than 20 early stage deals across immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In immunology we've added novel mechanisms that have the potential to raise standard of care either as a monotherapy or in combination with Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\nYou should expect that strategy to continue. In oncology, we've added new platforms including multispecifics, trispecifics, T cell engagers, and insight to CAR-T approaches. And then within neuroscience, it's not always appreciated, the work we've been doing in neuroscience. Above and beyond Cerevel, we expanded our discovery collaboration in psychiatry with Gedeon Richter who discovered VRAYLAR. We also invested in a novel mechanism for mood disorders with Gilgamesh, and we recently acquired a next-generation A beta antibody for Alzheimer's from Aliada. Again, you know, that is our area of focus. We have these five areas that can drive long-term growth.\nI mentioned neuroscience, Aesthetics, and Eye Care, and, of course, immunology and oncology. These are all large markets with high unmet need. And so, you know, our BD efforts are focused on building pipeline depth in those areas. Now, I should say, you know, if we see an opportunity for differentiation in another large market with high unmet need, we would consider pursuing it. Especially if it can help drive growth in the next decade and the company has the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Dave. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceuticals Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you so much. I have an observation and two questions. The observation is splitting hairs, but on Part D redesign, the guidance had been a three percentage point headwind. It was just said on the call, four percentage points. A year ago it was two percentage points. If there is a change, please can you identify that?\nRelated to that is my first question. Are you seeing any evidence that IRA Medicare pricing is spilling over to the commercial market? And if yes, to what degree? Or is there absolutely none? And then my second question. The company has provided a lot of helpful perspective on the Aesthetics market, but can you distill it to a number?\nThe guidance for Aesthetics was previously greater than nine billion in 2030. What is that number now? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve. This is Scott. I'll go ahead and start with your Part D observation and question. With Part D, we've really, we saw that as something that the analysts and maybe the marketplace hadn't fully understand sort of the impact. I think we were one of the first companies to come out and talk with any sort of specificity and granularity around what we saw that Part D impact, mechanics of how it would work, and the impact to it. So we came out with a guidance number, and I think that has probably, as you noted, the numbers, but it's evolved a little bit over time. I would say it's evolved not necessarily from our understanding of Part D but because really the mix of the business.\nSo when we talk about it in the second quarter, I believe I came out and said we saw it would see an approximately 3% headwind to growth from the Part D redesign. We've distilled that number and made a precise number of 4%, roughly 4% today. Really, when you think about when I came out of that 3%, we've seen momentum in the business, and we've seen momentum in the business in areas, immunology, and oncology in particular, where we raised some guidance where we saw, you know, have high Part D channel mix. So that's really been a business mix change that has led to that 4% change. That's really kind of what it amounted to.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, I'll just add, I mean, when you think about the setup for the company in 2025 we said we would return to robust growth and we're delivering in absolute terms, per our guidance, a little bit more than $2.5 billion of growth. That's with headwinds from US Humira erosion around $3 billion, the Part D benefit redesign of approximately $2 billion. When you do the math on the roughly 4% and then a $500 million headwind from the stronger US dollar. So the underlying growth platform is going to drive $8 billion of growth when you think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq as well as neuroscience. The change you're seeing from, as Scott mentioned, is really more of a mix, a function of mix. But we're very pleased with the underlying growth of the business that's allowed us to absorb these impacts and still deliver robust growth in 2025.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nSteve, it's Jeff. I'll take your second question. So, as we've negotiated across the commercial books and the Medicare books, we have not seen any spillover or slippage in our actual negotiations over the last cycles. And one thing I would add is that we have seen in 2024 some more consumption on the benefit redesign, particularly in our oncology agents. So for IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we actually see lower discontinuations and some more consumption. And so that's encouraging because again, if you remember that Part D sort of had the lead in where the cap moved down to roughly 3,300, 3,400, it'll sequentially move down more to 2,000 with the smoothing next year.\nWhich is a good policy because it's encouraging to see that the change in benefit design makes people stay on their cancer medication a bit longer. Again, the volume will be more modest than the price hit, as Rob and Scott described it. But that's the dynamics that we're seeing in the channels.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nAnd see on your question regarding the Aesthetics guidance, I'll reinforce maybe what I said earlier and Rob as well. So when we look at that guidance, that long term guidance is calling for high single digit CAGR 2025 through 2029. So using 2025 as the base year, if you do the math on that range, that is something above $7 billion, a little bit north of $7 billion, depending on where it falls within that high single digit range. So that's why we've specifically given the range on the high single digit. The market growth that we've seen historically has been low double digits, but we're seeing that market, we're modeling for now, high single digit growth during the time period that we've given this long term guidance. And so I think that answers your specific questions.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceuticals Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Tim Anderson with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you, a couple of questions please. On Aesthetics, a question I've asked before. What are your expectations for how obesity drugs are going to impact this business? You could argue that the surge in use of products. The GLP-1s could be either a tailwind or a headwind to the use of products like toxins and fillers. It could be a headwind if patients are having to pick and choose between which products to put their out-of-pocket dollars towards.\nAnd then a second question unrelated to the first. PBM reform still being debated in Washington. If AbbVie had its way, what would change about the current relationship between PBMs and drug companies? And what would you argue should be left alone?\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll answer your first question around the obesity market and the Aesthetics opportunity. And you're exactly right. It continues to be both a headwind and a tailwind. A headwind in terms of share of wallet. As these consumers are making decisions on what they're going to spend for.\nWe see that more for the higher price products like fillers, and then also a tailwind as this gets a new group of consumers or patients interested in Aesthetics. And many of our aesthetic providers are administering these products. And so they see this as an opportunity for lead generation and bringing new patients into the category. So we do see it as both a headwind and a tailwind in the short term, but a tailwind in the long term. And the question is not if injectables work. We know that these products work well in these patients.\nIt's really about how we can partner with our customers to build it and integrate it into their treatment practice. And that's what we're doing with our customers now and helping them position BOTOX and JUVÉDERM in our product line for these new patients they're entering their practice.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Tim, this is Rob. I'll take your question on PBM reform. Look, if there are changes to the rebate system, you know, we don't have a strong preference between rebates or discounts. And that's because, you know, we've always competed on the attributes of our products, both the clinical benefit they provide and the value they return to health systems. So we're confident in our ability to compete in either world. I would just point to our share performance in international markets that do not have a rebate based system. And we see similar market shares in those countries as well. So we can compete effectively in either system we don't have a preference.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Raymond with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nChris Raymond\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, thanks. Just a question on atopic derm as a target indication. Just from some of our work, it. Looks like the upside we're seeing in Rinvoq is largely in rheum and gastro. And I know you guys have sort of mentioned this, and it's fairly well known. But in atopic derm, at least from our data, it looks like things are starting to flatten out a little bit.\nAnd I heard your comments on the derm share of Rinvoq revenue in 2027, but that would seem to infer maybe some kind of inflection. So maybe a two-part question here. First, talk about the current maybe atopic derm growth dynamic and is there an inflection sort of anticipated. And then the second part of that is should we be paying more attention maybe to Lutekizumab or as a contributor here. I know Jeff, you've talked about atopic dermatitis as a very important indication that you guys are targeting or is there some other sort of area like external innovation that you think will augment maybe your position in this indication?\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, it's a very good question. It's an important segment, and to give you some sense of what we see in terms of the inflection. So we have seen a significant inflection in our new patient capture, and this is despite the launch of other interleukin products over the last year. So we've ramped to the highest in-place share that we've had, and it was largely flat in the teens for, you know, mid-teens for many, many quarters. And it's ramping up now above 20%. And a lot of that is we've been able to start to distinguish Rinvoq on these stringent endpoints.\nBasically like really minimal disease activity where you're taking itch down to a very, very low level and you're almost completely clearing the skin. And those are the endpoints where we significantly outperform Dupixent. Now having said that, Dupixent still got the vast majority there, but we are seeing. We will see that in patient share start to build into the TRx over time because our TRx share is quite below 20% at that point. I think the other thing that I'd note is that in many, or if not most of the outside the US markets, our shares are much higher and building even a little bit faster. So in several large markets we actually are ahead of Dupixent.\nAnd some of that has to do with the way that the label worked during our initial launch, etc. But we're quite bullish over time in terms of Rinvoq. This is the best agent in terms of getting to the complete control. Now having said that we would and we will continue to look for more assets. Some are in our pipeline as described, but this is a very, very attractive space that we want to continue to invest in. I don't know Roopal, if you've got any comments on Ludi or some of the other concepts?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThat's right. I mean with the 5% penetration rate there's still many patients that are. SoLutekizumab will be our next one. And as Jeff mentioned, there's other pipeline assets that we're working on and key being skin clearance along with that itch. And if you can get them both and have a safe and tolerable profile, I think that will continue to be competitive.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Thank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. The next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat, thanks for taking my questions just two from me. So firstly, your sales in Q4, did you see any notable difference in trends in stocking or gross-to-net patterns across the portfolio ahead of the changes in Part D versus previous years? Specifically, I'm interested if you had any meaningful one-offs for Skyrizi and Rinvoq for the quarter, and then circling back on Aesthetics. Thanks for that updated long-term guide. Can you give us a bit more color geographically how we should think about the split between ex-US, China versus the US as you return to growth? Is there an expectation on one coming back quicker than the other? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Scott. I'll talk about the stocking. So we did not see in the past. We've talked about it a couple years ago in particular, but the stocking was relatively minimal in terms of the impact. So we did not see anything with respect to Skyrizi and Rinvoq on the stocking in Q4 that will be impacted in Q1.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nNo real dynamics here on gross to net either.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nNo, that's right. For Skyrizi and Rinvoq. I'm sorry, no dynamics around gross to net. For Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Then with respect to Aesthetics. I don't care if you want.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nSure. For Aesthetics as we think about the long term. We see, like we said, we're planning prudently further economic recovery around key markets like US and China where it's been challenging for the past few years. Both those markets will continue to be important moving forward as well. The rest of the world. We see Japan as posting nice growth, as being an underdeveloped market that we're able to invest in.\nAnd then the pipeline catalyst will be important in both US and the rest of the world. Notably, in China in the past year we've had multiple new pipeline catalysts which continue to help drive share for both toxins and fillers last year and this year. Aand we expect the international business to continue to increase as a percent of the revenue for overall Global Allergan Aesthetics.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung. Operato we have time for one final question please.\n\nOperator\n\nSure. Our last question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thank you very much. When you think about going beyond 2030 with your strategy across the portfolio, can you comment about the potential impact of some of these combination approaches in immunology? Do you expect these to be IP extending? Will there be co-formulation-based approaches? Just trying to understand the potential revenue implications, noting that clearly there could be some clinical benefit that could certainly make sense. And then just a question about a business segment that has been around that you never talk about, which is iCare.\nHow and why does this fit going forward? I understand there's a legacy with the Allergan deal, but just trying to think about the overall portfolio in areas where. You clearly have strengths. But this seems to be one which is noted less than 5% of revenues. What is the role for that on the board? How are you thinking about it? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey Chris, it's Roopal. Maybe I'll start the ball rolling here on how we think about combos into 23, sorry into 2030. So the first thing is we have a very strong foundational asset in, particularly, IBD with Skyrizi. And you've heard me mention other combo studies in psoriatic arthritis today as well. Now that we would combine with the multiple assets that we've mentioned over time. TL1A, TREM1, alpha4beta7, IL1 alpha beta, Lutekizumab that we already have.\nThese that we would be able to look at as monotherapies and combo therapies. If they look good as monotherapies, they could also move forward by themselves for all of these assets. We're also looking at biomarker approaches, particularly with Lutekizumab. But we would apply that same strategy to all of these assets and as combinations. The goal would be co-formulation. So, as we enter into the clinical study, we are also doing CMC work in parallel to facilitate combination co-formulation approaches.\nSo that would also be a convenience factor, and we would want to match with longer acting agents. So, for example, the TL1A we believe to be a longer acting agent. For TREM1 we're seeing a long pharmacodynamic effect as an example. But then the next way that we think about this, these combo strategies is if we start seeing utility there, obviously moving forward with the co-formulation. But we are very competent in making bispecifics. Lutekizumab is one of those.\nSo then in parallel we're making bispecifics that could then also stand alone as single assets. And then as you've heard recently with our Nimble transaction, we would also be looking at different mechanisms as an oral peptide. The lead one being IL23 but we're also working on a TL1A. And what's unique and what we like about that platform, is the potency, potentially being able to reduce the amount of peptide that's required and these assets having long half lives. So if that holds, then you could imagine combinations as a pill with these peptides with that type of profile that we hope to see. So, multiple steps as we think about immunology.\n\nRobert Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd then this is Rob, your question on Eye Care. I mean our focus on Eye Care is in glaucoma, retinal disease, and prescription dry eye. We like that business. It participates in a large market with high unmet need that meets that criteria. It has very much a scientific focus an it's a data driven business. It's a very efficient business as well and obviously we're excited about the REGENXBIO gene therapy program focused on wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy.\nDepending on how that plays out, I think you could see that as becoming a stronger growth driver. We obviously have four of the five. As you think about, you get a lot of questions there, but we don't get as many questions on Eye Care. But we do believe as you start to get more visibility to this REGENXBIO program. You'll likely spend more time focusing on it. We think of it as a potential to be a long-term growth driver for the company and we like the fit it has for AbbVie.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Chris. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time."

Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations.\nAbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It's a pleasure to speak with you today. As AbbVie's new CEO, I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie's promise to our patients, employees, shareholders, and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie's business is performing at or above our expectations.\nWe are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter. Our Ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie's total sales, will outperform our initial full-year sales guidance by more than $1 billion driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology.\nIn addition, US HUMIRA performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters. With biosimilar competition, the strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top-tier high single-digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade. Turning to our results, I'm especially pleased with immunology where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations.\ncontinues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn's disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains, and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. RINVOQ is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications; we are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade.\nIn oncology, ELAHERE has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma.\nIn neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline, and we're excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon.\nLastly, we've been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year, we have executed nearly a dozen early stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong momentum of our business.\nAbbVie's results once again exceed our expectations, and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie's top tier long term outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you, Rob. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7 billion. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $4.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 50% in their fifth full year on the market.\nThese assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head-to-head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture for SKYRIZI. We continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis where total prescription share of the US biologic market has increased to approximately 38%.\nShare is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment where SKYRIZI has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the US biologic market, and for RINVOQ we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications as well as additional momentum in atopic dermatitis including total prescription share of 10% in the US. We are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology where SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year.\nThe adoption in Crohn's disease has been impressive with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ now achieving a combined market share in the US of more than 40%. SKYRIZI has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn's with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara following our compelling head-to-head study data published last year.\nThis positive trial, which demonstrated SKYRIZI's high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission, has driven a significant inflection in performance, and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis is now underway in the US with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months. Early feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging with SKYRIZI's UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for naive patients who have not been exposed to biologics.\nWe also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of RINVOQ in UC where the brand is now achieving a leading in place share in the US internationally. RINVOQ UC is now approved in 75 countries, with reimbursement and share gaining momentum. Having two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need.\nTurning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the US was in line with our expectations in the quarter, and our guidance contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that HUMIRA will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year.\nMoving now to Oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. VENCLEXTA global sales were $637 million, up 15.8% on an operational basis with strong momentum across CLL and AML. ELAHERE is also performing very well with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data.\nRecent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for EPKINLY in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for EPKINLY's second indication, Follicular Lymphoma in the US, with European approval expected later this year.\nNeuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double digit growth of VRAYLAR with global sales of $774 million, UBRELVY with total revenue of $231 million, and QULIPTA with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis.\nFinally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson's to the US soon. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the momentum across the Therapeutic portfolio and with that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nCarrie, thank you, Jeff. Q2 global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth of 2.8% on an operational basis. In the US, aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance was supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid-single-digit percentage versus the prior year.\nHowever, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter's inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our US facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader with strong and stable market share internationally.\nSecond quarter aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery. Consistent with what we experienced in the US. Economic challenges have impacted JUVÉDERM sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio.\nBased upon JUVÉDERM's relatively higher price point. Looking to the rest of the year, we expect our market leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the US and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near term dynamic, we remain confident in the long term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio.\nGlobal market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options.\nFor example, in China launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic Masseter Muscle Prominence indication, and in the US we will soon launch JUVÉDERM VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing, and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the Platysma Prominence indication by the end of the year.\nPipeline catalysts like these in the key US and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training, and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you Carrie. We continue to make very good progress advancing our pipeline with several regulatory and clinical milestones since our last earnings call. I will start with immunology. We received FDA approval for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis, which marks its second inflammatory bowel disease indication. SKYRIZI is now the only IL-23 specific inhibitor approved for both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nSKYRIZI has proven to be a highly effective, durable, safe, and well tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease, and this recent approval further strengthens AbbVie's leadership position in this market. We also received a positive CHMP opinion recommending SKYRIZI for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Europe, with an approval decision anticipated soon.\nEarlier this month we submitted our regulatory applications in the US and Europe for RINVOQ and Giant Cell Arteritis. Our submissions are based on the previously announced phase III results from our SELECT-GCA trial where RINVOQ demonstrated superiority compared to placebo on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, on disease flare, and showed a reduction in total steroid exposure at week 52. We expect approval decisions for this indication next year. We also recently began a phase III study for lutikizumab.\nOur anti-IL-1 alpha/beta bispecific in Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS is a skin disease that can be debilitating, and there are limited treatment options. In our phase II study, lutikizumab demonstrated strong clinical response rates and improvement in skin pain in a very refractory patient population.\nBased on these results, we believe lutikizumab has the potential to become an important new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe HS. We look forward to providing updates on the phase III program as the data become available.\nIn the second quarter, we announced two additional immunology transactions as we continue to invest in external innovation to expand our pipeline. These include the acquisition of Celsius Therapeutics, which brings a Phase II-ready anti-TREM-1 antibody for IBD, and a license agreement with FutureGen to develop a next-generation anti-TL1A antibody for IBD that is designed to have less frequent dosing compared to other TL1As in development and will be evaluated in combination with SKYRIZI.\nThis follows the four immunology deals we announced earlier this year, which as a reminder included the acquisition of Landos and their oral NLRX1 agonist in phase II for UC, a partnership with OSI to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist for IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus to utilize their immune toleration platform for novel IBD therapies, and a collaboration with Tentarix to develop conditionally active multispecific biologics in immunology and oncology.\nMoving to oncology, where we continue to make very good progress across all stages of our heme and solid tumor pipeline. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive top-line results from our phase II PICCOLO study evaluating ELAHERE as a monotherapy in ER-alpha positive, third-line plus, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer for those not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. ELAHERE met the primary and key secondary endpoints in the study, demonstrating an objective response rate of 52% and median duration of response of 8 1/4 months.\nDetailed results will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Following discussions with the FDA, we will be submitting Teliso-V for accelerated approval as a monotherapy in patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild-type non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer. This submission will be reviewed under FDA's Real-Time Oncology Review Program. Teliso-V has also received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA.\nOur submission will be based on the results of our phase II LUMINOSITY study where Teliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, and overall survival with a tolerable safety profile. Submission is expected in third quarter with an approval decision anticipated in 2025. The confirmatory phase III study for this potential accelerated approval is currently ongoing. We continue to see encouraging data for ABBV-400, our next-generation c-Met ADC which uses a topo payload.\nRecall that we've advanced 400 in late-line colorectal cancer based on the deep responses and prolonged durability observed as a monotherapy in our phase I trial, and we remain on track to begin a phase III study later this year in third-line CRC.\nWe're also seeing encouraging signals of activity for this next-gen ADC in the non-small cell lung cancer cohort from our phase I study. The preliminary data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, and based on the emerging phase I results, we plan to begin a phase II program for 400 in lung cancer.\nIn the area of hematologic oncology, we received accelerated approval in the US for EPKINLY as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of prior therapy. EPKINLY is now the only T cell engaging bispecific approved in the US to treat both follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients suffering from follicular lymphoma.\nWe also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. In the quarter, we initiated a phase III monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. 383 is designed for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T cell engaging BCMA based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy.\nWe remain excited about this asset's potential to become a best in class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment.\nIn addition to our phase III monotherapy program, we have an ongoing phase I study in later lines of multiple myeloma to evaluate 383 in various combinations including with Pomalyst, REVLIMID, and DARZALEX. Based on this work, we will begin phase II combination studies in earlier lines of therapy next year. Moving to Neuroscience, we're in the quarter we announced that we received a complete response letter for our 951 regulatory application in the US. The CRL is based on observations identified during an inspection at a third-party manufacturing site that was unrelated to 951.\nThe CRL did not identify any issues related to the safety, efficacy, or labeling of 951, nor has the FDA requested any additional clinical data or device related testing. We're working closely with the site and the FDA to get clarity on timelines and we'll provide updates as soon as information becomes available.\nMoving to an update on one of our Alzheimer's disease programs, we recently completed an interim analysis of a phase II study evaluating ABBV-916, our amyloid beta antibody. The emerging efficacy and safety profile in this study is similar to what has been demonstrated by approved agents. However, given the evolving landscape, we do not believe 916 as a monotherapy treatment will be sufficiently differentiated from other emerging therapies. As a result, we are discontinuing further development for 916 as a standalone antibody.\nAs Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction soon and we look forward to welcoming the team into our RD organization. The Emraclidine Pivotal Studies in Schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out near the end of this year. We'll also see data from two additional phase III studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease later this year. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed and data are available.\nIn aesthetics, we recently received approval for Botox in China for masseter muscle prominence, marking the first global approval in this indication for any neurotoxin. Masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. We anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication in China, which will help to further build our portfolio in the face shaping segment.\nA regulatory application is under review in the US for Botox and platysma prominence, which is another novel indication that will help build our position in the lower face and neck segment. We continue to expect an FDA approval decision later this year, and we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E near the end of this year. Our rapid onset short acting toxin has a highly differentiated clinical profile, and once approved would offer patients a novel option compared to currently available toxins.\nSo in summary, we've made great progress across all of our therapeutic areas in the first half of the year, and we look forward to additional data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals throughout the remainder of 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our second quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.65, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.52 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $14.5 billion, $450 million ahead of our guidance and reflecting robust growth of 5.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.3% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 18% sales growth from our ex-HUMIRA growth platform.\nAdjusted gross margin was 85.2% of sales, adjusted R&D expense was 13.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 22.9% of sales. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.6% of sales, which includes a 6.5% unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Net interest expense was $506 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18.8%.\nTurning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to between $10.71 and 10.91. This EPS guidance continues to contemplate approximately $0.19 a dilution for the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which is expected to close soon. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond Q2.\nWe now expect total net revenues of approximately $55.5 billion, an increase of $500 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions with the entire sales increase once again driven by our ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which is now on pace to deliver nearly $6 billion of sales growth in 2024. We now expect SKYRIZI global sales of approximately $11 billion, an increase of $300 million due to strong performance across all approved indications.\nRINVOQ total revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, an increase of $100 million reflecting continued robust uptake in IBD. VENCLEXTA total sales of approximately $2.5 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflects momentum in both US and international markets. For aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.5 billion given slower-than-expected near-term market growth, particularly in the US and China. As a result, our total sales guidance for Botox and JUVÉDERM will each be lower by roughly $100 million.\nMoving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast a full year adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%. We now anticipate an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales in line with our previous expectations after including the approximately 2% impact of acquired IPR&D expense incurred through the Q2 and we forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 16.3%, also reflecting the impact of IPR&D.\nTurning to the third quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14.2 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.92 and $2.96. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may occur in the quarter. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding performance, and I'm very pleased with the strong momentum across the portfolio heading into the second half of the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We'll now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question and congrats Rob on the CEO position. Looking forward to the forward here. The question I had is last quarter you guys gave some early commentary on. How to think about 2025. Looking at the business, obviously momentum and immunology. Some headwinds in aesthetics. So, any update on how you're thinking? About the 2025 outlook, particularly growth for revenue relative to EPS? Thanks.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. This is Scott. I'll handle the question. So with respect to 2025. You know, as you know, we haven't given guidance yet, and we'll provide that at a later time. But we have communicated a few top level, high level.\nhelps to put in context the several dynamics at play. Next year we have indicated that we'll be returning to robust revenue growth despite the headwinds from Medicare Part D redesign and continued HUMIRA erosion. When you think about robust growth, we characterize robust growth to be above industry average growth, which we see in the low single digits. When you think about the drivers, I mentioned in my remarks that we have $6 billion of growth from the growth platform in 2024, that we're expecting $5 billion of that is coming from SKYRIZI and RINVOQ alone.\nOur Neuroscience franchise is growing by more than a billion dollars. Aesthetics has begun to recover from the economic headwinds. In 2025, we see incremental contributions from SKYRIZI, UC, which was recently approved, as well as 951. All these factors demonstrate strong momentum in the business.\nThen when you think about the offset of HUMIRA, you know, that erosion that we have expected this year at $4.5 billion. Last year that erosion was $6.5 billion. We do expect another step down in absolute dollar terms in 2025 for that erosion as well. So that will be less of a headwind to growth in 2025 than it was in 2024. We feel very, very strong about that. I think from a part D perspective, we've talked about the several points of growth headwinds that we see there. I think when you model that, you can think about those several points as approximately a 3% headwind to growth.\nOverall, very strong momentum from the business with some headwinds, but we feel very confident in our ability to return to robust growth at the top line. Regarding EPS, the bottom line, we see EPS growing in line with that revenue growth that we've talked about. So EPS will benefit from operating margin expansion. We've talked about that operating margin expansion will be on the SG&A line as we leverage the revenue growth and drive efficiencies. And we have a good history of doing that. So that operating margin will expand.\nHowever, that expansion will be roughly offset by the fact that in 2025 we'll have a full year of interest expense associated with the financing for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So robust growth at the top line and in line growth from an EPS perspective.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just two questions for me. Maybe first on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI, great results in the quarter. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the price versus volume dynamics this quarter? It seemed like results were maybe a little bit stronger than the RX trends would have implied, and I just was wondering if there's anything notable there. My second question was on the immunology portfolio and as we think about 2025.\nI know we're probably in the middle of contracting season right now, but just directionally, what are you anticipating for HUMIRA, and should we be thinking about any incremental pressures on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI just given biosimilar HUMIRA dynamics going forward. Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Chris, it's Jeff. I'll take that question. So as noted, we're very, very pleased with the fundamental momentum on RINVOQ and SKYRIZI. So all of the indications are really hitting their stride. So we can see the impact of obviously consumer investments we've made. We've adjusted some of the sales forces. We started to anticipate the ulcerative colitis that's helped us basically increase our share of voice.\nAnd I think the other dynamic in terms of some of the incremental strength has come from this dynamic that we started to see earlier in the quarter where some of the HUMIRA switching that takes place actually starts to accrue towards SKYRIZI and RINVOQ because the physicians, when there's this disruption in the market, will sometimes bring in those patients and start to assess them. And we saw about 20% would move to other mechanisms.\nSo while it's a component, there are certainly multifactorial approaches why we see this very, very strong volume dynamic and share capture. For both of those agents. If I move to the contracting for 2025, obviously the contract season is in progress and it's progressing and the negotiations are well underway. I think it's important if you'll recall that we already have some multi-year contracts in place that cover 2025. So that's a positive dynamic. The remaining payer negotiations, as I mentioned, are underway and we anticipate that those will close out during the normal cycle.\nI would say that, you know, at a macro level we do expect to maintain parity access next year for HUMIRA for a meaningful portion of lives across all of the channels. Now that said, our HUMIRA access will certainly be lower than this year as we continue to anticipate and watch certain segments of the market move to adopt biosimilars.\nWe've understood and planned for this obviously as we enter that third year of the biosimilars. We're well aware of dynamically evaluating how this is going to work out. Certainly things are progressing. We already have some in place from those multi-year contracts and we'll be in a better position to provide some more information obviously later in the year as those negotiations or the remaining negotiations fully close out.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Chris, this is Rob, just to reiterate a point, an important point that Jeff made. One trend that we are watching very closely is the switching from the HUMIRA molecule to new mechanisms. I mean we are starting to see an inflection that is accruing to new mechanisms like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, as Jeff mentioned. And it makes sense. Doctors that are reevaluating the patients in their practice are likely looking at more than just the patients that are covered by CVS. What we have factored in is the CVS impact. What we didn't factor in necessarily is an impact beyond just the CVS lives.\nAnd to the extent that trend continues, it would represent a downside for HUMIRA and an upside down upside for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, which is a very good long term trade off for us. That's an important point. We want to make sure that was captured.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rob. And maybe Chris, one more point that I didn't address was the SKYRIZI and RINVOQ contracting. We are anticipating very robust and consistent access for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And. Our former comments around sort of low single digit price erosion should be quite consistent with what we said before. Obviously the Medicare Part D is a separate dynamic, so things are stable and we're anticipating ongoing very strong access for both of those brands.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Carter Gould from Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst of US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question, and then congrats on the results. I guess. First, just a housekeeping point. I guess in the last call you had talked about earnings growth not being quite at the rate of revenue growth, and it sounds like today you see those more in line.\nAny, I guess, further color on kind of what's driving that. I would assume it's sort of the key ex-HUMIRA drivers, but any other color there would be appreciated. And I guess the more pertinent question maybe on the commentary on Cerevel. Should there be any expectation for divestments or other concessions as we contemplate that deal closing? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nYeah, this is Scott. I'll take the question regarding EPS growth or earnings growth in line with the revenue growth. So when we look at this, as I mentioned, we're looking at a couple of things. The SG&A that we're driving some operating margin expansion, we spend a lot of time focusing on that, and we do see some efficiencies that we can drive, and we do see we'll have the ability to leverage that.\nSo there will be expansion operating margin, which you would expect to then let earnings outpace the revenue growth. However, there is this offset, and we had a very successful bond offering when we set the financing in place for Cerevel and ImmunoGen. So. But that will be an offset to the operating margin expansion. So you can think of those two as essentially netting one another and then driving that earnings growth in line with the top line.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nCarter, this is Rob. I'll take your question on Cerevel. Look, we've made very good progress with the FTC and have certified substantial compliance to their second request. No divestments are expected. I would expect the transaction to close soon, potentially as early as next week. We're obviously very excited about the potential best in class therapies in Cerevel's pipeline, especially in Emraclidine for schizophrenia, Tavapadon for early Parkinson's, and their core antagonist for major depression. I mean, these assets clearly will be great additions to our neuroscience franchise.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to Vamil Divan. Please go ahead.\n\nVamil Divan\n\nManaging Director, Guggenheim\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. So maybe one, if I could just, I guess for Rob, just around sort of your business development priorities. Now you mentioned obviously did a sort of larger deal last year with Cerevel, ImmunoGen; you've done a number of these smaller acquisitions. And I guess I'm trying to get a sense of the kind of balance between investing for the long term and then sort of balancing the near term earnings growth outlook. I know. So there's a lot of focus on that $11 floor for a long time.\nObviously with all the IPR&D, you sort of dipped a little bit below that for this year, which makes sense. But I'm just trying to think now that we're sort of halfway through the year, how are you thinking about sort of where your priorities are and, you know, the need to kind of balance the near term numbers versus investing for the long term. Thanks.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nYeah, yeah, thanks for the question. So you know the $11 floor again was on an ex-IPR&D basis where obviously with this guidance ex-IPR&D I think we're just a little bit over $11.40 and we're certainly positioned to return to robust growth. I mean we're delivering robust revenue growth this quarter. When you look at the outlook for 2025, it's very strong. We should be beyond the conversations on the floor at this point as we think about the trade-offs for the long term and the short term.\nClearly we have an on-market portfolio today that can drive the growth that we need to deliver on that high single-digit top-tier outlook in this decade. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on early-stage assets that can drive growth in the next decade.\nAnd you've seen us execute nearly a dozen deals this year along those lines. These include new mechanisms in immunology that can combine with SKYRIZI or RINVOQ, or be pursued as model therapies. We've also added new platforms including multispecifics that have applicability in immunology and oncology. Our deal targeting in situ CAR T therapy is another example of a platform investment in oncology, and we added a novel mechanism for psychiatric disorders given our focus in neuroscience.\nSo we intend to continue adding more depth to our pipeline in our core areas, particularly think about early-stage deals. Because what we're really trying to set up for is that growth in the next decade. We have a clear line of sight to top-tier growth this decade, and we want to position the company to deliver strong growth in the next decade as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Vamil. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Chris Shibutani from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Shibutani\n\nSenior Analyst and Managing Director of Biotechnology Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning. On the aesthetics business. Today has been a day of reporting across the industry. There's some commentary that aligns with what you said. However, some additional questions I have are on granularity about procedure volumes and pricing. Now, in the first quarter you talked. About promotional activities that you pushed towards a seasonally strong second quarter one.\nShould we think about the pricing backdrop as being a component of some of the sluggishness as opposed to purely thinking about or primarily thinking about volume procedures? And if you could sort of respond in the neurotoxin neuromodulator versus the filler segments, that'd be helpful. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll address the question. So first, let's talk about the market dynamics for market growth in the US for facial injectables. So late last year, we started to see a recovery and a return to growth of the toxin market. And we've seen that market growth recovery continue into this year in that mid-single-digit range. And that's volume, that is traffic into our customers' offices, and that's really been consistent for the past few quarters.\nSo the market dynamics for our business are really driven by patient demand and volume. Although when we think about price, price is a factor that we'll be looking for the second half of the year, which will give us some favorable pricing dynamics.\nWe did take a price action at the beginning of the year for toxins, and then we will have some more efficiency when it comes to our strategic shifts in our pricing promotions for the second half of the year. So, one example of that would be promotions we did last year, for example, around competitive launches that we won't need to do this year based on the success of our competitive strategy last year. So, really, our performance is driven by market growth, and we have also had some nice stability in our market share. Anything you'd like to add?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nMaybe because it's worth mentioning. So some of that shift in promotional activity that you mentioned, we did talk about in the first quarter that there was a destocking that occurred of inventory levels, and when Carrie made her remarks and we spoke about it last quarter, we said that would reverse over time. We did see that reversing in the second quarter on a partial basis.\nAnd when you think about the reversal of that Q1 destock, you can think about from the US market, that really would reduce by 50% or cut in half the growth rates we published for the actual results for both Botox and JUVÉDERM.\nSo we saw that partial reversal of that destocking event and then we will see that continue to unwind throughout the course of the year, especially as we have some of our larger promotional activities in the back half of the year with Botox Day and JUVÉDERM Day. We do see typically an inventory, a stocking uplift from those activities.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Mohit Bansal from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-head of Therapeutics Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the pipeline in IBD space as well. I mean you have done a bunch. Of these and then there has been. Some movement, especially in the oral IBD drugs as well. I mean, given your expertise, would love to understand how do you think about? Pipeline moving beyond the likes of SKIRIZI. These IL-17s and all, because these drugs are pretty good.\nBut when you think about an oral. What is the ideal profile of the drug that could be a first-line drug which RINVOQ could not be? And then when you think about combinations. I mean, what are you exactly looking for? Thank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHey Mohit, it's Roopal. I can talk about that. With respect to orals. We did do this deal with Landos, and this is our. NX13 asset, which we'll anticipate a readout end of this year, beginning of next year, and early data point to good outcomes in ulcerative colitis. This asset works through NF-kappa beta. So you'll see what we've observed in preclinical models is reductions in IL-6, IL-1, TNF, interferon gamma.\nAnd it's potentially a monotherapy and one that wouldn't have a boxed warning. So far the safety data has looked good, but there's also opportunities. We believe, as you mentioned, combination that you could still combine with RINVOQ and, as I mentioned, the boxed warning. And in certain geographies RINVOQ has utilized post anti-TNF. Even with a combo there, there's still opportunity. The second- and third-line segments in IBD and across immunology continue to grow, and they're getting larger and larger as patients cycle through biosimilar anti-TNFs.\nWe'll see them cycle through, for example, in IBD with IL-12/23 like Stelara. So in the future there's multiple opportunities, and the way we think about these is do we see an asset that is novel and can address mechanisms that haven't been addressed yet and can they complement something like RINVOQ?\nSo if you see a little bit less efficacy, that may be okay. If it's complementary, it may not work necessarily as a monotherapy, but we still see opportunities for combo. And given the other assets that we've talked about that could be IV or sub Q, we still see a lot of opportunity with SKYRIZI, and a platform study and IBD will kick off later this year looking at various combinations.\nMany of the assets that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, including a TL1A, including our own internal Alpha-4 beta-7, could be added on to SKYRIZI to drive that efficacy even higher because there's still a bit of a ceiling effect, and I would say the unmet need in IBD in particular continues to be quite high.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nOperator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Chris Raymond from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Raymond\n\nManaging Director and Senior Biotech Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThanks. Just another follow-up on HUMIRA. So Jeff and Rob, just hearing your commentary about how when patients discontinue HUMIRA, a number of them are switching to newer biologics. And I think you gave the 20% number going to newer biologics like SKYRIZI and then also RINVOQ. But we saw some of this happening in the gastro space with one of. The checks we did recently.\nI wonder if you could provide maybe a little more color on this phenomenon. Is there a particular therapeutic silo where this is maybe happening more extensively? Can you give us a sense as to how this has been influenced? Or accelerated by biosimilar availability? Just any more color there Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thanks for the question. It's almost like a bimodal phenomenon. So the 20% I highlighted. So if you just look from our data, when we just look at the CVS template, so we can see the degradation of HUMIRA that goes down, down pretty steeply because remember, it's an exclusion. So HUMIRA is no longer widely available at all. So most of it happens within the first two or three weeks.\nAnd in that one segment, we see that the biosimilar doesn't take up all the HUMIRA loss and we can see it moving to other mechanisms, particularly SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. So that's within, let's say, the acute biosimilar event. Now, to Rob's point, what he highlighted is if you take a step back and you look at the macro market. We've started to see in Q1 and Q2 that the overall molecule, so that's the Adalimumab molecule, inclusive of biosimilars, has started to compress faster than it did before.\nThere was the availability of this action that was taken by CVS. So it's a doubling of effect acutely in the segment that takes place with the exclusion and then the wider market. Now, we're watching this pretty carefully because we obviously haven't seen something like this before in terms of the compression of a molecule. So that's basically the dynamics that we're seeing. We do think it's because some physicians or segments of physicians.\nThey realize that these biosimilars, where there's an acute interruption, you know, they want to check how the patients are doing. If they're not fully in remission when they come in for their appointment, let's say before the switch, sometimes they're transitioned at the rates that I described. That's sort of the prescriber behavior. Now, where is it coming from? Like. Well, we actually see that it is accruing across all of the indications, particularly HUMIRA has quite robust, let's say, base dynamics in the rheumatology indications.\nBut we can see it in rheum, we can see it in derm. Derm to SKYRIZI in particular, which is probably not a surprise given the position. I highlighted a 38% share and a 60% in place share for SKYRIZI and derm. And we also do see it to some degree in gastroenterology. So to Rob's point, we're going to continue to monitor that if the overall molecule would continue to compress, obviously there would be some mitigation of some of it accruing over to SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. And so we'll have to continue to see how these weeks and months play out here over third quarter.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Gary Nachman from Raymond James, please. Go ahead.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nManaging Director of Biopharma and Biotechnology, Raymond James\n\nAll right, great, thanks. Can you talk more about how you're managing the growth for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in IBD across both UC and Crohn's, which have both been really strong? And with the SKYRIZI UC launch, is there any cannibalization there with RINVOQ? I guess, generally, how do you see those products working synergistically, both in terms of sales force and reimbursement, if you see any sort of issues or conflicts there. Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thank you for the question, a very important question in terms of how we commercialize these. Roopal highlighted it. Obviously you have the two big indications with two assets within those indications. And so we have constructed, not just in the US but around the world, a very sophisticated approach in terms of multiple sleeves of representatives and medical experts that are representing both drugs across both indications.\nAnd it really is, let's say, for example, in our largest market, the US it's relatively easy to execute because what we see is that our representatives can highlight SKYRIZI's data and potential as the obvious frontline agent, which is obviously tremendous data. I mentioned the sequence data, I mentioned our core data. The naive to biologic data in UC is absolutely fantastic for the SKYRIZI data.\nAnd then really ironically, because of the label changes that took place a few years ago, RINVOQ is positioned in later lines. So really that sort of approach is highly synergistic in terms of we recommend that physicians consider starting with SKYRIZI and the efficacy will be fantastic. But to Roopal's point, there's still, you know, still pressure on that disease. And then you have a backstop with tremendous, tremendous data on RINVOQ in later lines.\nAnd so that's how we position it. We look and we monitor the cannibalization. It's quite modest. And overall, when you look at the dynamic of share capture, it's quite encouraging to see how the infield teams and the commercial teams are managing all of those assets. So we're very encouraged about how we've approached the market in terms of our execution and, and I think the results are speaking for themselves.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. Regarding the 2024 sales guidance, which I realize is about $55 billion, but it implies similar growth in the second half as in the first half, if not a slight deceleration. Why won't total sales do better? And what were your reservations about raising sales guidance today? Seems that across the business strengths are exceeding challenges. So it would seem not unreasonable to have higher sights. Now, second question is, I'm wondering if you can elaborate on the comment a portion of HUMIRA loss is a portion of HUMIRA loss closest to a quarter, a half, or three quarters of loss? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, this is Scott. I will talk regarding the revenue. So just to clarify, we did raise the revenue guidance in total from $55 billion to $55.5 billion, $500 million raise, and that included a $300 million raise for SKYRIZI, $100 million raise for RINVOQ, $100 million raise for VENCLEXTA, $200 million spread across other products, and then a $200 million reduction in the guidance for aesthetics. So we do see very strong momentum in the business. We did raise our sales guidance from $55 billion to $55.5 billion.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Steve, this is Rob, and if you just look at, as I mentioned in my remarks, the first half of the year, we talked about operational growth around 4%. The implied operational growth in the second half based on our guidance would be slightly above that and really driven by the ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which on a reported basis grew more than 18% this quarter. And so we're very pleased with the performance of the business. And I think when you look at the guidance and you do the math, you'll see that the actual implied second half operational growth is slightly higher than the first half.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nSteve, it's Jeff. To give some sense, we're looking at coming up on the third year of biosimilars. The first way to think about it, in the first year of 2023 we had very strong parity access across all the channels, and we really exited the year around, I think, 97% or something like that. This year, I think when we look at all the ins and outs, I think the three-quarter approach is quite reasonable.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks earlier, one of the questions, it will certainly be lower next year, and I would think that that range would be around that half point. But again, we're not fully complete with all the dynamics. That gives you some broad, broad spectrum over three years, maybe around the halfway point, ± as we go into 2025.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Steve. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Trung Huynh from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi guys, Trung Huynh from UBS. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. Another aesthetics. Thanks for your comments this year, and you've also moderated your short-term guide accordingly. But you've noticed that the long-term 2029 guide remains intact. So with growth around 4% this year in line with that new guide, I imagine next year will be slightly higher. But then it does imply that growth is well into the double digits for 2027, 2028, and 2029 on calculations.\nJust what here makes you confident about that level of growth later in the decade? And then secondly, just following up on some of your thoughts on the immunology pipeline. You noted the potential of the utility of multispecifics in immunology. You've got a pretty strong bispecific platform. Just what are your thoughts on the data that you're seeing here? Is there anything in development that we should be looking at? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Scott. I'll start with your question regarding the long-term guidance on aesthetics. So you're right, we've guided to a long-term $9 billion in 2029 and we're not changing that guidance. The guidance change, as you noted that I mentioned, is just a short-term guidance change for 2024. You know, we remain very confident in our ability to hit that $9 billion in 2029. When you think about these markets, there's very low penetration in the markets globally. There's a lot of excitement, excitement in the space and we expect the market to recover and grow at historical rates.\nI would say when we look at the market growth we do see that rebounding and growing well. And then you also should think about there's additional innovation coming that'll drive that. So we have some of the additional indications of Botox that Roopal walked through as well as the quick-onset short-acting toxin BoNT/E that will also drive additional market growth. And so we continue to feel very, very comfortable with our ability to achieve that on a long-term basis in 2029 strong.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nIt's Roopal. I'll take the next question on the pipeline. So we continue to be excited about bispecifics, in particular lutikizumab. And it's an IL-1 alpha and importantly also one beta. And this we believe distinguishes it from earlier generation assets that were singular and let's say only took out IL-1 alpha. We see, I would say very, very strong benefits in hidradenitis suppurativa. And I don't think that was observed as a pure monoclonal.\nAnd the efficacy that we're seeing is in a 100% anti-TNF failure population and very significant early stage 3, 70%. It was one of the most severe, probably the most severe ever studied. So we think there continues to be potential in the bispecific space as you take out multiple cytokines. The way to address it is through engineering of the assets. The other way is combination.\nSo we can get to that bispecific approach through combos. And then thirdly, I would say earlier in the pipeline is the multispecific approach, which the advantage that could provide is you maintain your bispecific approach, but then a third arm, let's say, can target specific cells and that could further enhance efficacy and in particular safety. And we're looking at that approach in immunology and as well in oncology. And that was reflected in our partnership with Tentarix.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Trung. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHey guys, thank you so much for. Taking my question and really, really helpful updates today. So, just looking at kind of the.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nCan you just, can you speak up just a little bit? Sorry,\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nCan you guys hear me? All right, does that work?\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nIt's still faint, but we'll do our best.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nAll right, sorry about that. I'll speak very loudly. So when looking at expected growth for VRAYLAR, over the next few quarters, can you comment on what type of impact you think new competitors to the NVD market might have and what you can? Do to help maintain or grow its position going forward?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. We're very pleased with how both of the indications are performing, and we monitor them very carefully, certainly with bipolar and AMDD. So when we look at our quarterly surveys of our target physicians and really our whole call cycle, we can see now that VRAYLAR is the most preferred agent overall for bipolar disease based on its indication set, its tolerability, its efficacy, etc. And we've really gone to the very top of the league table for AMDD depression as well. So if we look overall on our demand, we're tracking above 20% in terms of the push.\nWe continue to focus our team and where necessary add share of voice in terms of our sales force. So we're quite comfortable that we can continue to grow our share, which has been growing very, very nicely, particularly on the MBRX side and certainly face the competitive dynamics and navigate those as we go forward.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nEVP of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, maybe to add, it's Roopal here. There is going to be competition, but what we see as a benefit clinically for VRAYLAR is that full spectrum coverage in bipolar, and when you're able to take mania, you don't need an adjunct of therapy for that. So that's a big advantage. The other thing that we continue to hear, and probably reflected in data, is the really limited impact on fatigue and sedation. And so what we're hearing is with VRAYLAR, patients really don't have to sacrifice their daytime productivity in order to gain that benefit.\nAnd then the other benefit, I would say, with VRAYLAR is flexible adjustable dosing. So these things together, I think, underlie what Jeff was speaking about.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Evan. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext we'll go to the line of James Shin from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. You mentioned some of the HUMIRA contracts go into 2025. Does that also apply to SKYRIZI and RINVOQ? And that's what gives you visibility on the low single-digit price erosion. And secondly, has the introduction of co-branded HUMIRA and now that PBMs are more intertwined with biosimilars changed the negotiation dynamics at all? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, so typically, you know, again in some cases we are able to secure, you know, multi-year contracts and as you can imagine that we, we would do that for the portfolio basically the way that our products work. So that does help with the visibility in terms of what our access would look like for 2025 as well as the pricing dynamics. Again, I want to clarify that the negotiating season is not fully complete, but the dynamics are progressing as I highlighted there. So yes to your first question. The other dynamic in terms of Cordavis.\nYou know, I'm not sure that that's actually changing the dynamics in terms of the negotiations overall. That was, obviously, a volume-related deal with CVS that we announced, you know, over a year ago or almost a year ago now. So it doesn't necessarily play into other negotiations. Each of these payers and pharmacy benefit managers, they have their own ideas in terms of how they want to approach the INI category and certainly. The emergence of the HUMIRA biosimilars. So it's a CVS unique dynamic.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, James. We have time for one final question. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nFor our last question we'll go to the line of Louise Chen from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\n\nLouise Chen\n\nManaging Director, Cantor Fitzgerald\n\nHi, thanks for taking my questions here. So wanted to first ask you, do you still feel that your aesthetics business is a good strategic asset for you? And if so, where do you see the synergies within your organization? The second question I wanted to ask you is how you think Pharma will fare under a Democratic versus a Republican presidency and how you're going to navigate through that uncertainty in the near term. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nSo, Louise, this is Rob. I'll take your question. Look, we like the aesthetics business. When you think about the growth profile, the profitability. We have set it up as a fully integrated standalone unit because it behaves differently than the therapeutics business. We think we've actually seen, since we announced the transaction, really strong performance. We've exceeded our deal model expectations.\nSince we announced the deal, we think it's operating very well. Obviously, we're working through some macroeconomic headwinds, but when you look at, for example, share performance, we had the entry of Daxxify last year, and we did not lose any share. I think a lot of investors were concerned that we'd see considerable share loss.\nSo, I think the team has done a remarkable job of competing in this marketplace, going through a period where economic headwinds, we're still very confident given low penetration rates, given our relationship in the field, the potential innovations that we plan to bring forward. It has a very nice fit, and you think about just from a profitability and a growth standpoint, fits the profile we're looking for. So, I certainly feel it's a nice fit for the company as it relates to the acquisition.\nLook, it's hard to handicap it whether it's Democrat or Republican. If you think about, you know, we've obviously contemplated the Inflation Reduction Act, we've come out and said that, you know, even with, you know, modeling that impact in that we still expect to deliver. On our long term outlook.\nNow I will say, you know, our view on the IRA from a policy perspective is, you know, we're certainly in favor of the Part D benefit redesign since it helps address patient out of pocket burn. But you know, the price setting provisions in the IRA will certainly harm long term innovation in our industry. So we are hopeful that if it's a new administration or the current administration that they'll reassess those provisions that ultimately are harmful for long term patient care in the US.\nI mean, it clearly takes away the incentive to launch in later lines of smaller patient populations, which is really a very unfortunate negative outcome from the legislation. So the way I view it is addressing patient out of pocket burden is good policy, but taking away the incentive for innovation is not. My hope is under either administration that will be reconsidered.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Louise, that concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for joining the AbbVie Q2 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time and have a wonderful rest of your day.\nGood morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Second Quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question and answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rob Michael, Chief Executive Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Roopal Thakkar, Executive Vice President, Research and Development, Chief Scientific Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements. Additional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\n\nRob Michael\n\nCEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. It's a pleasure to speak with you today as AbbVie's new CEO. I look forward to building on our track record of success and delivering on AbbVie's promise to our patients, employees, shareholders, and communities. As we begin this new chapter, nearly every aspect of AbbVie's business is performing at or above our expectations.\nWe are demonstrating a rapid return to revenue growth with operational sales up nearly 4% through the first half of this year, including robust mid single digit growth in second quarter. Our ex-HUMIRA growth platform, which covers more than 80% of AbbVie's total sales, will outperform our initial full year sales guidance by more than $1 billion driven by strong performance in immunology and oncology.\nIn addition, US HUMIRA performance continues to meet our expectations, having achieved or exceeded our guidance in all six quarters with biosimilar competition. The strong performance across our diversified portfolio will drive top tier high single digit compound growth through the end of this decade, which will support continued investment to drive growth in the next decade.\nTurning to our results, I'm especially pleased with Immunology where our leading portfolio is delivering performance well above our expectations. SKYRIZI continues to demonstrate strong momentum in psoriasis and Crohn's disease, where we have substantial headroom for additional share gains, and the recent approval in UC will add another source of long-term growth. RINVOQ is also delivering robust growth across all approved indications.\nWe are making excellent progress with late-stage development in five additional indications that we anticipate will launch in the second half of this decade. In oncology, ELAHERE has accelerated our on-market presence in solid tumors. We also have several exciting pipeline programs including two novel c-Met ADCs for solid tumors, Teliso-V and 400, as well as 383, our BCMA CD3 bispecific for multiple myeloma.\nIn neuroscience, our leading therapies for migraine and mood disorders continue to gain share and are competitively well positioned. The pending acquisition of Cerevel will further augment our neuroscience pipeline and we're excited about what our two companies can achieve together to make a difference for patients with neuropsych disorders. We have certified substantial compliance to the FTC second request and anticipate the Cerevel transaction will close soon.\nLastly, we've been very active with business development, investing in exciting opportunities that can drive growth in the next decade. Through the first half of this year we have executed nearly a dozen early stage deals. These include promising technologies and innovative mechanisms that can elevate the standard of care in immunology, oncology, and neuroscience. In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong momentum of our business.\nAbbVie's results once again exceed our expectations and we are raising guidance for the second time this year, underscoring our confidence in the business. The robust performance of our growth platform and the advancement of our pipeline supports AbbVie's top-tier long-term outlook. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you, Rob. We continue to demonstrate strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $7 billion. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are performing exceptionally well, contributing more than $4.1 billion in combined sales this quarter, reflecting operational growth of 50% in their fifth full year on the market.\nThese assets are approved across a broad set of indications and are collectively supported by nine compelling head to head studies that demonstrate clear differentiation across multiple novel therapies, which has resulted in strong share capture for SKYRIZI. We continue to advance our clear leadership position in psoriasis, where total prescription share of the US biologic market has increased to approximately 38%. Share is also ramping nicely in PsA, especially in the dermatology segment where SKYRIZI has achieved roughly 15% total prescription share in the US biologic market.\nFor RINVOQ we are seeing increasing share across each of the rheum indications as well as additional momentum in Atopic Dermatitis including total prescription share of 10% in the US.\nWe are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology where SKYRIZI and RINVOQ are on pace to double their respective sales in IBD this year. The adoption in Crohn's disease has been impressive with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ now achieving a combined in-play share in the US of more than 40%. SKYRIZI has achieved overall in-place share leadership in Crohn's with in-place share approximately now 13 points ahead of Stelara following our compelling head-to-head sequence data published last year.\nThis positive trial, which demonstrated SKYRIZI's high efficacy versus Stelara, including a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission, has driven a significant inflection in performance, and we anticipate continued share momentum. Commercialization for SKYRIZI and ulcerative colitis is now underway in the US with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the next several months.\nEarly feedback from gastroenterologists has been very encouraging with SKYRIZI's UC data viewed as impressive, particularly for naive patients who have not been exposed to biologics. We also expect the European launch in the coming months. We also see very robust adoption of RINVOQ in UC, where the brand is now achieving a leading in-class share in the US internationally. RINVOQ UC is now approved in 75 countries with reimbursement and share gaining momentum.\nHaving two novel therapies that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy to treat both of these IBD conditions demonstrates our commitment to transforming the treatment landscape for physicians and patients in this area of high unmet need.\nTurning now to HUMIRA which delivered global sales of $2.8 billion, down 28.9% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the US was in line with our expectations in the quarter, and our guidance contemplates the impact of additional formulary changes over the course of the year. Importantly, we continue to anticipate that HUMIRA will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.6 billion.\nIMBRUVICA global revenues were $833 million, down 8.2%, reflecting continued competitive dynamics in CLL. VENCLEXTA global sales were $637 million, up 15.8% on an operational basis, with strong momentum across CLL and AML. ELAHERE is also performing very well with sales of $128 million and our compelling overall survival data.\nRecent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines and the expansion of commercial resources will continue to drive rapid uptake. Lastly, we continue to be pleased with the prescription trends for EPKINLY in DLBCL. Commercialization is now underway for EPKINLY's second indication, Follicular Lymphoma in the US with European approval expected later this year.\nNeuroscience total revenues were nearly $2.2 billion, up 15.2% on an operational basis. This robust performance is driven by continued double digit growth of VRAYLAR with global sales of $774 million, UBRELVY with total revenue of $231 million, and QULIPTA with global sales of $150 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $814 million, up 9.6% on an operational basis.\nFinally, we are pleased with the early launch trends for 951 in Japan and Europe and look forward to bringing this innovative therapy for advanced Parkinson's to the US soon. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the momentum across the Therapeutic portfolio, and with that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nCarrie, thank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, representing growth of 2.8% on an operational basis. In the US, aesthetic sales of $863 million increased by 4.4%, driven by Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM growth of 7.1% and 10.4%, respectively. This toxin and filler performance is supported by a consistent recovery in the facial injectable market as the number of procedures in both categories increased by a mid single digit percentage versus the prior year.\nHowever, this level of market growth was lower than previously anticipated. Sales for Botox Cosmetic and JUVÉDERM also benefited from a partial reversal of the prior quarter's inventory destock, which was related to the timing of certain promotional activities. From a competitive perspective, our US facial injectable portfolio remains the clear market leader with strong and stable market share internationally.\nQ2 aesthetic sales were $527 million, roughly flat versus the prior year on an operational basis, as declines in China were balanced by growth in other international markets. In China, our largest international market, sales growth continued to be impacted by sustained economic headwinds as well as a challenging comparison to the second quarter of last year, which benefited from a strong post-COVID recovery.\nConsistent with what we experienced in the US, economic challenges have impacted JUVÉDERM sales growth more than other areas of our portfolio. Based upon JUVÉDERM's relatively higher price point.\nLooking to the rest of the year, we expect our market leading aesthetics portfolio to continue to perform well from a competitive perspective across the globe. As we evaluate market dynamics and leading economic indicators, particularly in the US and China, market growth trends are below our prior expectations. Based upon this, we have moderated our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite this near term dynamic, we remain confident in the long term growth outlook of our aesthetics portfolio.\nGlobal market penetration rates are extremely low and we expect long term market growth to accelerate from current levels as economic conditions improve. As the market leader, we are also committed to driving growth by activating new patients and launching innovative treatment options.\nFor example, in China, launch activities are underway for the Botox Cosmetic Masseter muscle prominence indication, and in the US we will soon launch JUVÉDERM VOLUMA XC for the treatment of temple hollowing, and we expect an approval for Botox Cosmetic in the Platysma prominence indication by the end of the year.\nPipeline catalysts like these in the key US and China markets, along with our significant investment in consumer activation, injector training, and practice support, will enable us to grow the aesthetics market and maintain our clear leadership position over the long term."

Welcome to the AbbVie Q1 2024 earnings conference call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Also in the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, and Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer, Global Therapeutics. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, Global Research. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings.

On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and our regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick A. Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024, with first-quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective 1 July 2024 and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you've heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition. The Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession, and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition as our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long term.\nWe are successfully navigating the Humira US loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority and competitive advantage, and our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients, will continue to fuel our robust pipeline for years to come. After a multi-year process, our Board has unanimously selected Rob Michael, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, as AbbVie's next CEO. I have known and worked with Rob for many, many years, and he is an excellent choice as my successor. He brings the experience, the leadership, and the strategic vision to build on AbbVie's past successes, advance our strategy, and enhance shareholder value.\nSince our inception, Rob has held several important leadership positions that have collectively had a tremendous impact on AbbVie, from establishing our financial planning organization to navigating the end of exclusivity for Humira in the U.S., to driving key business development opportunities that have been critical to diversify our business and support long-term growth, including the acquisitions of Allergan, ImmunoGen, and the pending Cerevel transaction. Looking back, AbbVie has evolved tremendously as an independent company, and our performance has truly been exceptional. Since our inception, we've grown our revenue from $18 billion to $55 billion. Our market capitalization has increased substantially from $54 billion to roughly $300 billion today. We have achieved a total shareholder return of more than 675%, which is top-tier relative to our peers.\nImportantly, we have substantially increased our investments in R&D to discover and develop new medicines that have the potential to improve the lives of patients. As I look ahead, our company has never been stronger, and our future has never been brighter. We are executing well across all aspects of our business, and our long-term growth prospects remain very strong. In summary, it has been a privilege and immensely gratifying to serve with all of my AbbVie colleagues for the past 11 years, growing AbbVie into what it is today. I look forward to continuing to work with Rob and the leadership team to create meaningful value for our shareholders and all of our stakeholders. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank all of our shareholders for the trust and confidence you put in me as AbbVie's CEO.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for comments on our recent business performance. Rob?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rick. Before I comment on our first-quarter performance, I want to congratulate Rick on his exceptional leadership of AbbVie over the past 11 years. During his tenure, Rick made several strategic moves that have positioned AbbVie to have a bright future beyond Humira, consistently drove the organization to deliver very strong performance, and demonstrated a genuine care for our employees, patients, shareholders, and communities that has defined who we are as a company today. It has been my privilege to work closely with Rick over many years, and I look forward to working with him in his role as Executive Chairman. AbbVie's outlook is very strong, and I am excited about the remarkable impact that we will continue to have on patients' lives. During the first-quarter performance, we're off to an excellent start to the year with strong top- and bottom-line results.\nWe reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations. This overachievement was driven by our ex-Humira growth platform, which delivered revenue growth of more than 15% this quarter and includes continued robust sales from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, with combined growth above 50% in their fifth full year on the market, as well as double-digit revenue growth from several other key products, including Venclexta, Vraylar, Ubrelvy, and Qulipta. This broad-based sales momentum clearly demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio, with multiple growth drivers to support our long-term outlook. We are also making excellent progress with several of our near-term priorities. We recently completed the acquisition of ImmunoGen, which accelerates our entry into the solid tumor market and strengthens our oncology pipeline.\nThe integration has been seamless, and we are impressed by the caliber of talent we have welcomed into AbbVie. We also remain on track with the pending acquisition of Cerevel, which we anticipate will close in the middle of the year. Cerevel's pipeline of differentiated assets will further augment our neuroscience portfolio. In addition, we continue to advance our R&D pipeline and invest for long-term growth. This progress includes the FDA's full approval of Elahere for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, a meaningful first-in-class treatment for patients, and a significant long-term growth opportunity for AbbVie in solid tumors. We also gained U.S. approval of Juvéderm Voluma XC for temple hollows, further strengthening our leadership and aesthetic fillers. We executed several business development opportunities, adding novel early-stage programs and partnerships in oncology and immunology.\nGiven the strong results this quarter, we are raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.16 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.13 and $11.33. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie, and I am extremely pleased with the momentum of our diverse portfolio. We're off to an excellent start to the year, and we are well positioned to deliver a high single-digit revenue CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for immunology, which delivered total revenues of approximately $5.4 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi global sales were $2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 48%. We continue to see exceptional momentum across all of the approved indications.\nIn psoriasis, Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market, with a total prescription share now above 35%. That's more than double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. Share is also ramping nicely in PSA, especially in the dermatology segment, where we are now capturing 1/4 of every new or switching in-play biologic patients. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved psoriatic in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries. In IBD, Skyrizi is on track to add more than $1 billion of incremental sales growth this year. We are seeing tremendous performance in Crohn's disease, where our compelling head-to-head data versus Stelara is driving a meaningful inflection of patient share. As a result, we have now achieved in-play share leadership in Crohn's across all lines of therapy in both the U.S. and Japan, as well as other key markets around the world.\nAnd finally, we are preparing for the launch of Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which represents another substantial long-term growth driver. We expect approval decisions in the middle of this year and anticipate rapid access in the U.S. following our launch. Given the robust frontline capture for Skyrizi in Crohn's and the exceptional Bio-naive data we have generated in UC, we anticipate a strong launch. Turning now to Rinvoq with global sales of approximately $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of 61.9%. In RA, we continue to see strong prescription growth across each of the four approved indications, and I'm especially pleased with our performance in rheumatoid arthritis, where Rinvoq has achieved in-play share leadership in nearly 20 key international markets. Atopic dermatitis is tracking in line with our expectations, with continued market share momentum globally. Importantly, we recently announced positive results from Level Up, our second head-to-head study in AD.\nLevel Up demonstrated Rinvoq's superiority for patients starting therapy on the 15-milligram dose versus Dupixent across key efficacy parameters, including the high levels of skin clearance and itch reduction. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will support additional share capture, especially given Rinvoq's label use in the U.S., which requires that initiation with a 15-milligram dose. In IBD, Rinvoq's uptake continues to be very strong. Rinvoq is capturing high teens in-play patient share in ulcerative colitis, as well as mid-teens in-play patient share in Crohn's disease. This performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still relatively early in the launch phase for both the UC and CD indications, and the lines of therapy are also expanding, with second-line plus growing even faster as patients cycle to newer, higher efficacy agents like Rinvoq in IBD.\nTurning now to Humira, which delivered global sales of approximately $2.3 billion, down 35.2% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. played out slightly better than our expectations in the quarter, with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price. As previously communicated, the recent changes to the CVS template formularies were anticipated in our full-year outlook for US Humira, and the volume impact is tracking in line with our expectations. Our guidance has also contemplated the impact of additional formulary changes that are expected to go into effect over the course of the year. We continue to anticipate that Humira will maintain parity access to biosimilars for a significant majority of patient lives this year. Moving now to oncology, where total revenues were more than $1.5 billion, exceeding our expectations.\nImbruvica global revenues were $838 million, down 4.5%, reflecting continued competitive pressure in CLL. Venclexta global sales were $614 million, up 16.3% on an operational basis, and we are seeing robust momentum internationally with strong performance for both CLL and AML. Elahere generated $64 million of sales to AbbVie, reflecting a partial quarter of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. The Elahere sales and marketing team is executing very well, and I'm pleased with the smooth integration into our commercial organization. We anticipate that the recent positive updates in the NCCN guidelines for both platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients, as well as the full label approval, which of course includes the compelling overall survival data that has never been achieved before in these platinum-resistant patients, will continue to drive strong Elahere uptake.\nLastly, the global launch of Epkinli in third-line plus DLBCL is also performing well, and we remain on track for the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Neuroscience total revenues were nearly $2 billion, up 16% on an operational basis, again ahead of our expectations. This robust performance is driven by continued double-digit growth of Vraylar, with global sales of $694 million, Ubrelvy, with total revenue of $203 million, and Qulipta, with global sales of $131 million. Each of these leading assets continue to gain share and remain competitively well-positioned. Botox Therapeutic is also performing well, especially in chronic migraine. Total global sales were $748 million, up 4.5% on an operational basis. And finally, we are very excited about 951, which will be commercialized as Vyalev in the U.S. and represents a potentially transformative next-generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease.\nFeedback from the launches in Japan and Europe has been very encouraging, and we remain on track for commercial approval in the U.S. later this year. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the strong and balanced growth across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter, a testament to our differentiated product profiles and commercial execution. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Q1 global aesthetic sales were over $1.2 billion, reflecting a modest decline on an operational basis. In the U.S., aesthetic sales of $776 million were roughly flat versus the prior year. We continue to see sustained momentum in the facial injectable market recovery that emerged in the back half of last year. Consistent with the past few quarters, the toxin market grew by a mid-single-digit %. We saw similar year-over-year increases in the number of facial filler procedures, representing a return to quarterly market growth for the first time since early 2022. From a competitive perspective, our U.S. aesthetics portfolio continues to perform well. Market share for both Botox Cosmetic and Juvéderm was stable in the first quarter, as these assets remain the clear market leaders.\nWhile we're pleased that the market and share trends across U.S. facial injectables are aligned with our previous expectations, our first quarter results were impacted by customers holding lower than normal inventory levels at quarter end. This dynamic relates to a decision made during the quarter to shift the timing of certain promotional activities into the second quarter. We therefore expect inventory levels to normalize in the second quarter and remain on track to deliver full-year aesthetic sales growth in the U.S. Internationally, first quarter aesthetic sales were $473 million, reflecting an operational decline of 5.5%. Consistent with our expectations, growth in China was impacted by persistent economic headwinds, as well as a challenging comparison versus the first quarter of last year, which benefited from a robust recovery post-COVID. We are monitoring the economic developments across China and continue to anticipate a recovery in the second half of this year.\nOur pipeline continues to generate important new assets. Uptake of our recently launched Juvéderm Volux and SkinVive products remains strong, underscoring the importance of innovation within aesthetics. Given this context, we are excited for the upcoming launch of Juvéderm Voluma XC for the treatment of Temple Hollows. As the only HA dermal filler approved for use in the upper face, we anticipate the Voluma XC introduction will activate more consumers and support the long-term growth of our filler portfolio. Within our toxin pipeline, we continue to expect FDA approval of the platysma prominence indication for Botox near the end of this year, enhancing Botox growth potential as a non-invasive treatment to reduce the appearance of vertical neck bands and improve jawline definition. We also remain on track to submit a new drug application for our short-acting toxin, BoNT/E, before the end of this year.\nThis novel toxin has demonstrated a rapid onset of action, as well as a short duration of effect, meaningfully lowering the barrier for toxin adoption across consumers who have been considering but hesitant to try Botox. Given this profile, BoNT/E has significant market expansion potential as satisfied patients would naturally convert to Botox. Overall, the underlying trends across our aesthetics portfolio align well with our previous expectations, and we remain on track to deliver high single-digit global aesthetics growth this year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Carrie. I'll start with immunology. We recently announced positive top-line results from two phase 3 studies for Rinvoq in dermatology and rheumatology. In the Level Up study, which evaluated Rinvoq against Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, Rinvoq demonstrated superiority on the primary endpoint at week 16, which was a composite endpoint measuring skin clearance and itch reduction. Twice as many Rinvoq patients achieved this very stringent endpoint compared to Dupixent. Rinvoq also demonstrated superiority on all ranked secondary endpoints in this trial. Level Up was a study in which patients started on Rinvoq 15 mg and could escalate to 30 mg if they did not achieve treatment goals, which is how Rinvoq is prescribed for atopic dermatitis in the U.S. We also saw very rapid responses, with Rinvoq demonstrating superiority on itch as early as week 2 and on skin lesions as early as week 4.\nRinvoq's safety profile in the Level Up trial was consistent with what has been observed in previous studies. There were no serious infections in patients treated with Rinvoq and one in the Dupixent group. The rate of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms. There were no malignancies, MACE events, or VTEs reported in either treatment group. Based on these data, as well as results from previous phase 3 studies, we remain very confident in Rinvoq's profile in atopic dermatitis, and we believe it offers meaningful advantages over other products on the market today. We also announced positive top-line results from our phase 3 Select Giant Cell Arteritis trial, which evaluated Rinvoq in combination with a 26-week steroid taper regimen compared to patients receiving placebo in combination with a 52-week steroid taper.\nIn the study, Rinvoq 15 milligrams met the primary and key secondary endpoints, demonstrating superiority on sustained remission from week 12 through week 52, as well as on disease flare, and reduction in cumulative steroid exposure at week 52. Importantly, Rinvoq's safety profile was consistent with what has been observed in more than 15,000 patients previously studied across controlled trials. The mean age in this population was 71, which is the oldest population studied to date with Rinvoq, and the average prednisone equivalent dose at baseline was almost 35 milligrams. Rates of serious adverse events and VTEs were similar across treatment groups. There were no MACE events in the Rinvoq arm, while there were two in the placebo group. Based on the results from the Select GCA trial, we believe Rinvoq has the potential to be a safe and tolerable oral treatment option.\nWe plan to submit our regulatory applications for this indication later this year. We continue to make very good progress with our inflammatory bowel disease programs. We anticipate several advancements this year, including the initiation of a phase two study for Lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis, the start of our phase two Crohn's disease platform study, which will evaluate combinations of Skyrizi with Lutikizumab and other novel biologics. We remain on track for approval decisions for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, with the U.S. expected in Q2 and Europe in the H2 of the year. We also continue to invest in external innovation to expand our immunology pipeline, as evidenced by four deals that we announced in Q1.\nThese include the acquisition of Landos Biopharma, which brings an oral NLRX1 agonist currently in phase 2 for ulcerative colitis, a partnership with OSE Immunotherapeutics to develop a novel ChemR23 agonist antibody for inflammatory conditions such as IBD and RA, a collaboration with Parvus Therapeutics to utilize their immune tolerization platform to develop novel therapies for IBD, and a collaboration with Tentarix Biotherapeutics to develop conditionally active multispecific biologics in immunology and oncology. We are excited to partner with these companies who are all pursuing very innovative approaches to developing transformative therapies. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter we closed the ImmunoGen transaction, which brings exciting programs in both solid and blood cancers. Last month, Elahere received full approval from the FDA for FR-alpha positive platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in patients treated with up to three prior therapies.\nThis conversion to full approval was based on data from the confirmatory phase 3 Mirasol trial, where Elahere demonstrated an overall survival benefit and significantly reduced the risk of cancer progression. We expect to see results from additional ImmunoGen programs this year, including data from the phase 2 Piccolo study evaluating Elahere as a monotherapy in FR-alpha positive third-line plus platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients who are not eligible for retreatment with platinum-based therapies. We expect to see data in the second half of the year from a potentially registration-enabling phase 2 trial for our CD123 targeting ADC, Pivec, in a rare blood cancer called blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. Now, moving to program updates in hematologic oncology.\nBased on the totality of the data from our Transform One trial and following recent feedback from regulators, we will not be submitting Navitoclax for approval in myelofibrosis, and we will wind down the Transform Two study in the relapsed refractory setting. In other areas of HEMONC, we remain on track for several regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for Epkinly in relapsed refractory follicular lymphoma, the phase 3 readout from the Venclexta Verona trial in treatment naive higher risk MDS, and initiation of a phase 3 monotherapy study for ABBV-383 in third-line multiple myeloma. We remain very excited about this asset's potential to become a best-in-class BCMA CD3 bispecific by providing deep, durable responses and low incidence and severity of CRS, with the potential for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment.\nMoving to other areas of our pipeline. In aesthetics, we remain on track to submit our regulatory application for BoNT/E in the second half of the year, our rapid-onset short-acting toxin as a highly differentiated clinical profile compared to currently available neurotoxins. BoNT/E is designed for patients that are considering using facial toxins for the first time or for a special event and will allow them to experience results over a very short period of time. This novel toxin will complement our existing business as patients would naturally transition to Botox following experience with this trial toxin. In neuroscience, we continue to make good progress with ABBV-951, where we have received regulatory approvals in 33 countries thus far and anticipate an approval decision in the US in Q2.\nAs Rob mentioned, we remain on track to close the Cerevel transaction in the middle of this year. Cerevel recently announced positive top-line results from their phase three Tempo Three trial evaluating Tavapadon as adjunctive therapy to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease. In the study, Tavapadon met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a 1.1-hour increase in total on time without troublesome dyskinesia compared to patients treated with levodopa and placebo. Tavapadon also met the key secondary endpoint in the trial, providing a significant reduction in off time compared to levodopa and placebo. Two additional phase three studies for Tavapadon in Parkinson's disease are expected to read out later this year. The Emraclidine pivotal studies in schizophrenia remain on track to begin reading out later this year as well. We look forward to providing updates on these programs once the transaction has closed.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. Starting with our Q1 results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.3 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance, and reflecting a return to growth of 1.6% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.9% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect more than 15% sales growth from our ex-Humira growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 42.2% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 82.9%, adjusted R&D expense of 14.7%, acquired IP R&D expense of 1.3%, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.6%. Adjusted net interest expense was $429 million. The adjusted tax rate was 14.8%.\nTurning to our financial outlook, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $11.13 and $11.33. This increase of $0.16 at the midpoint includes $0.26 of operating overperformance, partially offset by $0.10 of higher dilution due to the earlier close of ImmunoGen. As previously communicated, this earnings per share guidance includes $0.42 of dilution related to the recently closed acquisition of ImmunoGen and the pending acquisition of Cerevel. Please also note that this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $55 billion, an increase of $800 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.9% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast includes the following updated assumptions, with the entire sales increase driven by our ex-U.S. growth platform. We now expect Skyrizi global revenue of $10.7 billion, an increase of $200 million due to strong momentum across all approved indications. Rinvoq total sales of $5.6 billion, an increase of $100 million, reflecting robust uptake in IBD. Imbruvica total revenue of $3.1 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting lower erosion. Elahere total sales to AbbVie of $450 million, an increase of roughly $200 million, reflecting a partial year of revenue following the February close of the ImmunoGen acquisition. Moving to the P&L for 2024, we continue to forecast adjusted gross margin of approximately 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14%, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5%, and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5%.\nWe now expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.2 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. Turning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion, which includes US Humira erosion of approximately 32%, reflecting a step-up in volume erosion with the recent CVS formulary change, partially offset by a one-time price benefit also associated with that change. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 1.3% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 49.5% of sales, and we are also modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 16.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $3.05 and $3.09. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. In closing, I'm very pleased with the excellent start to the year.\nWe are demonstrating strong momentum across the portfolio, and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our first question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question and congrats on the progress, and congrats to Rob as well. So maybe let's just start with 2024. I mean, so thanks for this guidance. But when we look from 2024-2025, there are a couple of headwinds that you have highlighted in the past.\nSo obviously, IRA Part D redesign would be there, and Humira may have another leg down. And given the volume erosion share, people are a little bit concerned there. Can you help us understand what is your current thinking on the trough 2024 versus 2025? And could you give us some confidence that you can continue to grow in 2025 despite these headwinds from IRA and Humira? Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nSo Mohit, this is Rob. I'll take that question. So if you think about 2024 and 2025, I mean, clearly the ex-Humira growth platform is demonstrating great momentum. If you just think about Skyrizi and Rinvoq alone, are growing by more than $4 billion per year. Aesthetics will recover to high single-digit growth. Our neuroscience franchise will grow by over $1 billion this year on the heels of strong momentum from Vraylar and our migraine portfolio.\nWe will have incremental contributions from Vyalev and Elahere in 2025. So we have several drivers that will offset Humira erosion next year, as well as the Part D benefit redesign impact, and allow us to still deliver robust revenue growth. When you think about that redesign impact, it will really spread across our business, most concentrated in immunology and oncology. We would estimate that that total revenue impact could be worth several points of growth. While we will still deliver robust revenue growth, we will have that headwind in 2025. Keep in mind, for us, the IRA impact really hits us in 2025 and isn't a significant headwind in the years that follow, as products that are subject to negotiation will not have that Part D cost share impact.\nSo the way to think about it is, despite that headwind in 2025, we will still deliver robust growth with that growth rate accelerating in the years that follow. And then if you think about on a margin perspective, we're going to continue to expand operating margins, so that will be a tailwind. You should be, though, modeling annualization of interest expense from these transactions. And keep in mind that we essentially would have, think of it as a roughly half year for Cerevel and 10 and a half months this year for ImmunoGen. So that should be something that you do model for 2025. So we'll have robust revenue growth. We'll have earnings growth, not quite at the rate of the revenue growth because of that annualization impact. But then when you get to 2026 and beyond, you have even faster revenue growth and very robust earnings growth.\nSo that's probably the best way to think about the profile of the company. But when you look at that ex-Humira growth platform, there's a lot of momentum there, and we are very well positioned to deliver very robust growth.\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe I could just ask a couple on the aesthetics side. It sounds like your commentary is pretty generally in line with what you said before, but obviously, the number was a little lighter this quarter than even your guidance and what people were expecting. So can you maybe just talk a little bit more about that? You mentioned some shift in promotional efforts to the second quarter and maybe the inventory levels then as a result being lower.\nMaybe I don't know if you can quantify that a little bit. Was this sort of planned when you gave your guidance back in February, or is this something that sort of evolved over the course of the quarter? Maybe just kind of why the decision was made would be helpful to give us some comfort on the outlook there. Thanks.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. Thanks for the question. So first, I'll give a little bit of context to the fundamentals in terms of market growth and market share, which were in line with our expectations. So our market share continues to be strong and stable for Botox Cosmetic despite a new competitor, strong, stable share at high levels. And then for our Juvéderm line, continued share strength, even some share pickup in the past few quarters as we launch our new products.\nSo like you said, those fundamentals are in line with our expectations. As we were going through the quarter, we really realized that the aesthetics market is quite sensitive to seasonality, with Q2 and Q4 typically having the highest volume. After a few years of COVID and economic disruption, we're now anticipating a return to that typical seasonality. So we shifted investment in some of our sales and marketing efforts into Q2, which impacted customer and sales promotional timing and activities, which then resulted in lower inventory held by our customers in Q1. We do expect that to come back in Q2 and the rest of the year. I'll let Scott address the rest of that question.\nSure. Thanks, Carrie. So Vamil, to quantify the inventory impact in the first quarter, it was a little bit more than $50 million between Juvéderm and Botox.\nYou can think of that as being split roughly 2/3 to Botox and 1/3 to Juvéderm. I think, as Carrie mentioned in her remarks, that impact of that inventory; we expect that to turn in Q2.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Vamil. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGreat. Thank you very much. Good morning. When we think about the 2024 upcoming contracting season, which obviously has been quite dynamic for Humira over the past year plus, can you provide us with any insights in terms of structural aspects within your contracts that you build in that may help provide offsets? We often have limited visibility. We're looking at the prescription volume trends, and it feels as if our calculus is sometimes incomplete.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nBut what can you reassure us in terms of the dynamics as we're seeing this year to play out and how you're approaching contracting for the future? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Hi, Chris. It's Jeff. So the contracting season typically starts April or May, and frankly, as we've highlighted before, can run in the immunology category really through the end of the year. So we have a few philosophies that we look towards, which are we want to continue to basically make sure that patients, if possible, based on our pricing concessions, aren't disrupted. Because when you start to disrupt patients, they do struggle with the change. It's a change in their treatment course. And so as we look to that, we've historically highlighted that we are negotiating for parity contracts with Humira. And we do put some controls in place.\nIn some cases, but not all, we seek multi-year contracts with our payers to try to establish the relationship, the pricing, etc. We will think of ways to make sure that those contracts can hold so they have some teeth in them. They can't just be willy-nilly discarded. So it is a long-term, in some cases, partnership over a couple of years with these payers. I can't go into the details over exactly how those controls work, but suffice it to say that there's terms, timing, and limits in terms of when contracts can be changed, even maybe some clawbacks in some cases. So because we want these more sustained relationships because of our position in the category with these great brands, we typically use those sort of techniques, and that's how we go for it.\nSo again, it's hard to look forward too much because it is dynamic as we look to 2025, but we've been quite successful in maintaining good access for our brands, and certainly, Humira is tracking in line with our expectations.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan, and your line is open.\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just a couple more on the Humira front. I think in Humira, you had mentioned that in 2024, you expected most of the impact would be price versus volume. But I think the street's been concerned that we're seeing more volume erosion, particularly with the CVS book of business. I'm just interested in your latest thinking as we think about price versus volume for the remainder of this year as we consider CVS, Cigna, etc.\nHow should we think about that balance just so there's kind of no surprises as I guess we watch these volume trends playing out? And then maybe just on a related topic, can you talk at all about the tail for Humira sales in the U.S.? I guess the heart of the question, do you expect that you'll see most players or payers eventually switch out Humira like we're seeing at CVS? And if so, is it still reasonable to think about there being kind of a decent tail of revenue, I guess, for this product in the U.S. over time? Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Great, great question. There's a lot in there. Let me go through it in a systematic fashion. So I think first, to directly answer your question, we still, as we look forward, believe that the significant majority of our lives will be at parity.\nSo that means our guidance around the majority being price is still holding in our go-forward look. Let me give you some perspective. I had some in my opening remarks over what's happening with CVS. So the first is that, as I mentioned, the step down in volume was really anticipated. And based on our analysis of the data, which I'll highlight, it's really right in line with our expectations. Now, one of the things in my remarks, I often talk about new-to-brand or in-play share capture. And that's a really good way to look at performance, particularly early in launch cycles when you're looking at capture rate or competitive dynamics. I think it's important that investors and analysts need to be very mindful when you have a dislocation, or disruption, or switching.\nYou can get very, very fooled at looking at NRX or NBRX because it sort of overinflates what you might be looking at. So I think that's important. The other fact base that we look at is, in terms of the step down, we look at other analogs, and we look at the Cosentyx Taltz analog, or Taltz was advantaged in ESI for Cosentyx back in 2019. We see that typically in this category, almost 90% of the erosion tracks within the first two to three weeks. That's actually what we're starting to see, we believe, with the CVS template following that similar pattern. So if you can't really look at NRX or NBRX, you really have to look at TRX in this case, Chris. This is very interesting.\nWe would make sure to guide folks to look at what's happening with the TRX data in the market. What we see is that not all of the Humira prescriptions are moving to a biosimilar. If you look at the first two weeks, it's pretty meaningful. Over 20% of the Humira prescriptions are moving to other mechanisms of action, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. In fact, while we haven't studied this week as much, it actually seems to have accelerated a bit from there. That actually makes some sense because if you think of it from the physician's perspective, when patients are being switched, they often take a break and a pause to say, \"Are these patients really under control? Should I consider an alternative?\" That's actually what we see playing out in the market.\nSo the pure degradation or step down from Humira is in line with what we see, but we are seeing a fairly significant move to other mechanisms, as I mentioned, including our own Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And that could be very, very good for patients who are probably getting better care for control of their disease. Now, having said that as well, if we look through the rest of 2024, we have very solid contracts with our payers through 2024. And remember that these payers can add biosimilars at parity whenever they choose. We saw that last year in the middle of the year, and that's really not different now. So when we look at the structure and controls of our existing agreements, we do not see widespread exclusions for the rest of the year as we go forward.\nI think we've been pretty consistent with that, that select clients will move towards biosimilars over the course of the year. Last year, we saw that with Kaiser and Medicaid plans. We've talked about the CVS exclusion for the Humira business. We do see that some select plans may take another approach, which we've contemplated as the year goes on, which is they may move new patients to the biosimilar but maintain the large existing base. That's quite manageable because really only about 14% or 15% of the patients are new patients that cycle into Humira. Overall, that's our perspective. We're confident. Things are tracking in line. We're quite interested in the shift to other mechanisms, which is frankly somewhat anticipated, but maybe operating a little higher than we thought.\nWe still believe that a significant majority of Humira will sit at parity lives in 2024. Oh, the tail. Okay. So the tail, we're going to be negotiating 2025. And what we've highlighted is we are going to watch exactly how the interchangeables play out. We think we've got a good understanding of that. And so it'll probably become more apparent as we move through 2025 where that tail may sit. And we've highlighted that it may start to emerge in 2025 and probably be much more visible by 2026. And that's going to ultimately depend on how, over the course of 2025, the price volume fully plays out in the marketplace.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nAnd Chris, this is Rob. On your question regarding the guidance for this year, I think it's important to note, yes, we've said the vast majority of the erosion is price. We've talked about that dynamic.\nIf you think about H1, H2, we have the annualization impact given the mid-year step up in rebates last year. So that annualization impact comes through in the H1. So you'd expect price erosion to be greater in the H1 or the H2. But at the same time, we did contemplate volume erosion because we were very well aware of the CVS contract. We gave you that guidance. And so we have contemplated that volume erosion, but that's more of a H2 versus H1, as well as the potential for we knew with an interchangeable coming in, there could be some marginal amount of volume pickup there. So we did put in volume erosion in our guidance, but the vast majority of it is price. But I don't want investors to think that we didn't put any volume into our guidance.\nWe were very well aware of the CVS contract, and I think we made some prudent assumptions on potentially other impacts. But overall, we're still tracking in line with that guidance.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions, and congrats, Derek, and best of luck to Rob in the new role. Just wondering if you could maybe frame a little bit for us the opportunity for Skyrizi and UC versus Crohn's disease. I think last time we heard from J&J, Crohn's represented about $7 billion of Stelara sales. Obviously, you guys have made decent inroads there based on your comments, but just wondering how to think about the dollar opportunity and also of colitis.\nAnd then when you were talking through some of the latest Rinvoq data, I was just wondering if there's an opportunity down the road as you generate more clinical data, but also commercial data to potentially revisit the restrictions on line of therapy on the label at some point, or if we shouldn't think about that as a possibility. Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Thanks, Terence. It's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So Crohn's is larger than and then UC. I mean, if you look at the overall market or revenue, I think it's 65%-70%. So Crohn's is very, very significant. Having said that, ulcerative colitis is a multi-billion dollar opportunity for us. It's still a very, very underpenetrated and substantial indication. So it's weighted about 65-35, 70-30, but still, I wouldn't underestimate what ulcerative colitis means.\nAnd I think I would add, in concert with my prepared remarks, we've seen very, very significant acceleration into frontline Crohn's disease with Skyrizi. And what's remarkable, we studied a very, very difficult population in ulcerative colitis, but we still had a substantial amount of naive patients. And the performance in that naive population is exceptional. I mean, it is at the very, very top of the league table in terms of overall ability to get to endoscopic clearance and symptom control. And so we like that setup because, obviously, we have exactly the same representatives who are establishing the Crohn's indication in frontline. And we know that we can bring UC very fast afterwards when we get the approval this year.\nIt's a substantial global opportunity, not the size that we'll see over the LRP with Crohn's, but still one of our largest opportunities that we have in the category. I'll ask Roopal, based on the safety data he highlighted, to comment on the second question.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Thank you. The data we keep generating continues to at least drive confidence for sure that the original phase 3s that came out with their safety profile, and what we continue to learn even with longer-term data, even in more high-risk patients, confirms what we've always seen. That will continue to drive confidence, I think, with our clinicians.\nNow, from a health authority standpoint, I think that the position there is that you have this ORAL Surveillance study with tofacitinib, and they're going to apply those findings to the other assets in a similar class, probably until there's another outcome study to sort of argue against that. And that's kind of how we see it. Now, that's in the U.S. I would say globally, there's still an opportunity for many jurisdictions where JAK inhibitors can be at parity. So you might start seeing some more movement there in earlier lines. But as Jeff stated in his prepared remarks, the second line and even third line of many of these indications continues to grow as people now have options where in the past, if all you had was a TNF, maybe you were cycling.\nBut now that you know that there's other therapies, you're starting to see people break sooner. So I think that that second and third line is still a huge opportunity and will continue to grow with this emerging data. And Terence, it's Jeff again. One more comment. I mentioned how we're excited about the naive position for both Skyrizi, CD, and UC coming. But what's also nice is those same representatives are in the office and are able to highlight basically a one-two punch where you use Skyrizi first in earlier lines based on this exquisite data, and then obviously for later lines, you can use Rinvoq. And so we actually see in the marketplace that that combination and that positioning is allowing us right now in real time capturing almost towards 40% of all in-play share with Skyrizi first and Rinvoq second.\nSo it's an encouraging position as we fill out that portfolio.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back on the prior commentary around some of that TRX data. And I guess the overarching question is, is that, I guess, appropriately kind of capturing all the volume you're really seeing? I mean, there's clearly, with your part of your agreement with CVS and the Cordavis there, there is the potential for some Humira volume to potentially be shifting there. Is that being captured by TRX? So I guess any commentary there and sort of the accuracy of that data that we're all seeing.\nAnd then maybe if you just go back and wanted to circle back on the EPS commentary on 2025, sort of the way you frame that growth, is that sort of ex IP R&D? Any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, it's a great question. So it's early, but we believe the data is accurate. I mean, if you look at the first two weeks to give you some sense, and this is inclusive of the Cordavis Humira, there was a downdraft of about 13,000 prescriptions for Humira from baseline. And the biosimilars captured about 10,000, which was primarily the Cordavis Hyrimoz. So there's 3,000 prescriptions or over 20% that we can see in our data moving to other mechanisms of action, including our Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And again, it's very logical because this is just not a one-to-one type of switch.\nThese physicians are interviewing and discussing with patients their care path forward. So we think that clearly some are moving to other mechanisms. We've seen that in other analogs as well. We believe the data is accurate. Again, it's early. We're going to continue to monitor it. Where that ultimately lands, we'll have to see. Again, I want to reiterate the pure Humira downdraft is in line with what we assumed, and we are seeing this other market behavior that's taking place.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nCarter, this is Rob. Just to clarify my earlier comments. Yes, it is ex-IP R&D. We always guide to ex-IP R&D. What I was trying to highlight is you should expect robust revenue growth in 2025, and that growth accelerating in 2026 and beyond, given that Part D benefit redesign impact in 2025.\nGiven that operating margin will expand, you typically would expect our earnings to go faster than our revenue. That is generally true with the one exception in 2025 being that we will have an annualization impact from that interest expense. We will still deliver as a very solid earnings growth. But as you model it, just keep in mind that while you'd expect typically earnings to outpace revenue growth given expanding operating margin, you do have that dynamic in 2025 that's important for your modeling.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Simon Baker with Redburn Atlantic. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Baker\n\nResearch Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThank you for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I may.\nJust going back to Humira, but in a slightly broader sense, there's been a degree of political noise around the role of PBMs in blocking or rather than assisting biosimilar uptake. I just wonder if you expect that to come to anything in terms of structural changes within the market. Then secondly, on Rinvoq and the level up data, I wonder how you see the competitive dynamics evolving in that space. Is this about switches or is this about market expansion? I ask because this morning, Sanofi said that they welcome competition as a way of expanding the number of people treated in an area that's still relatively unpenetrated. So I just wonder how you see the opportunity commercially. Thanks so much.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Thank you for the questions. It's Jeff again. I would say that we're not anticipating a wholesale restructure of the PBM industry, for example.\nI mean, we certainly think that there's a very reasonable chance of sort of transparency reform, exactly how some of the economics are working, maybe transparencies to the government or downstream to the clients. That's very possible. But a major wholesale change, we don't see that happening in the near term. Obviously, we're continuing to monitor that and would make adjustments as we might need to. Regarding your atopic dermatitis question, I think the answer is really a bit of both. I think, as we've highlighted before, the market here is exceptional in terms of the low bio penetration or oral and bio penetration. It's really only about 4% or 5%. So I think Sanofi's comments are very well timed. I mean, this marketplace is going to grow significantly as this innovation is able to be delivered to the global population with this very serious disease.\nBut we also think this LEVEL UP study is good for our market share penetration. I'll give you some perspective. Our U.S. market share is lower. It's around 9%. So typically, where our countries have been able to highlight more direct comparisons, we couldn't do that because of the starting dose I highlighted. We see that most of our international affiliates have market shares in the mid-teens, in some cases in the low 20s. So the ability to bring a comparative study that's directly linked to the U.S. label and show the physicians how you can get to higher levels of control. Really, patients, they want no disease on their skin, and they really don't want itch if they can get there. That's what we studied in LEVEL UP.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nSo we think it's certainly going to help with both market expansion and, in particular, around the world with our ability to capture some more share. So I hope that helps.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Simon. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nTimothy Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much. I have questions on contracting for Skyrizi in 2025. How many lives do you already have locked up through your general multi-year contracting? And then do you continue to think that the availability of cheap versions of Humira, either brand or biosimilar, won't lead to any increase in step edits on Skyrizi? Under the idea that while Skyrizi is better, something like Humira or biosimilar Stelara might be just fine, that same argument can be made in the statin category. For example, Crestor is the best. Zocor might do just fine. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nI think we'll probably pass on the number of lives locked up. I mean, we are confident given the market position, Tim, of Skyrizi and Rinvoq. I think, in particular, around the momentum that we have across the Skyrizi indications, that we're going to have very favorable access in 2025 and beyond. I think the other thing that we've highlighted is I'm very pleased with how the adoption of Skyrizi is going in IBD. I mean, it's very, very clear that we're taking significant share from Stelara, and the doctors are voting with their pen or their basically electronic prescribing because the ability to get these very sensitive patients under significant control. The world's really never seen anything like this sequence trial in terms of the ability to control the most difficult aspect of this challenging disease.\nSo as time goes by, we think that differentiation is going to aid us significantly as we think about the formulary positions relative to not only Humira, but also to Stelara.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\n\nLuisa Hector\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Berenberg\n\nThank you very much for taking my question. It's on Elahere. I wonder whether you might be able to tell us the full quarter of sales and then any commentary around penetration rate of Elahere and how much off-label use you think may be happening with the guideline inclusion. Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSure. Thanks, Luisa. It's Scott. With respect to the Elahere full quarter of sales, so we closed mid-year in February. Prior to that, there were, according to what we've seen, approximately, just let me just double-check here, $70 million. I'm sorry. $110 million in the full quarter, $113 million in the full quarter.\nIt's Jeff. What we also see in the marketplace, a big catalyst that we saw in the first quarter, was the movement from the accelerated approval to the full approval that Roopal highlighted with the MIRASOL data. So we were rapidly able to basically integrate that into all the material of the medical liaisons and certainly the account managers and sales folks. And having that definitive table in the label and the ability to go deeper into our call plan is going to be very positive to continue the growth rates through the rest of the year. In terms of off-label, that's difficult to say. We think that the majority of the sales thus far are in that platinum-resistant population. However, the guidelines do allow for reimbursement with different levels of FR-alpha, some of the updates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks.\nSo we'll continue to monitor it, but there's certainly significant headroom in terms of the populations that are coming in terms of the ovarian cancer marketplace.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Luisa. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThanks. Good morning. When looking at the strong performance of the Neuro franchise of Vraylar and Migraine in particular, talk about the competitive dynamics there in those markets and how did the growth tenets impact you in Q1 versus what you expected, and how should that trend for the rest of the year? And then with respect to Cerevel, just your confidence that it will still close by mid-year and how FTC is viewing the schizophrenia market and how much overlap there might be between Emraclidine and Vraylar, just the latest thinking on that based on your conversations with FTC. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi. It's Jeff. I'll take the competitiveness comment in terms of what we're looking at. We're very pleased with the competitiveness, our ability to gain market share in these segments. I'll start off with migraine. We continue to be the new-to-brand share leader in Botox for chronic migraine, and we see that Qulipta is accelerating significantly. So Qulipta is now the leading preventative agent. And what's nice is there's very little interaction with Botox because if you're an injector, you use Botox. If you're not an injector, you have access to a fantastic drug with Qulipta. So Qulipta is really clearly taking over the market leadership position among the injectable and the oral CGRPs. Ubrelvy continues to have a very meaningful and substantial lead over the main competitor, Nurtec, and we are seeing some increased penetration into the larger triptan segment, which is key to our long-term growth.\nVraylar continues to perform very well, ongoing market growth. It's really because we have, if we look at our perceptions, Gary, of our key prescribers, you're at the very, very top of the table, the lead table in terms of perceptions around the efficacy around adjunctive major depression, which is our most recent indication, and we have probably the best scope of indications for bipolar I. So both of those are allowing us to continue to gain share. We're in a pretty good position. We also feel that the gross to net, our vouchers, our copay, which sometimes can get a little funky in Q1, we have strong controls there, and we're seeing a lot of stability. Overall, those businesses are performing very well.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nGary, I'll take your question. This is Rob. I'll take your question on the FTC.\nWe are working closely with the agency on their additional requests. I mean, keep in mind that we do not have any overlapping MOAs with Cerevel. Vraylar's share in schizophrenia is very low. The vast majority of Vraylar sales comes from the bipolar and MDD indications. In the case of Tavapadon, it will serve the early Parkinson's segment, which Duodopa and Vyalev do not participate in. So we don't have any concerns with the merits of the transaction and continue to expect closing it in the middle of the year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. I apologize in advance for asking you to clarify on Humira, but you mentioned several times that things are playing out as planned.\nBut in the prepared remarks, you said U.S. erosion played out slightly better than you thought in Q1. So is the conclusion that whatever was better is temporary? You also mentioned volume pressure, but offset by price benefit. Can you quantify that? But when you sum it all up, it sounds like you expect volumes to underperform the expectations you set three months ago. And is that in part maybe due to the Accredo news from yesterday? So that's a long question, but that's only one question. The second question is curious if the FDA has contacted AbbVie about the potential safety issues with Emraclidine post the competitor issue with convulsions and rabbits. And have you seen this with your agent? Thank you.\n\nJeffrey Stewart\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah. So it's Jeff. So I'll try to take that. So the first part was the first quarter.\nI mean, it was marginally better in terms of overall performance because we didn't see, obviously, we didn't see any volume disruption until Q1. Now, when you look at Q1 and we look after three weeks, we look at our model in terms of the expectation around retention of Humira with the CVS formulary, that's largely tracking in line with what our expectations were, with a bit of the surprise that some of that Humira is not going to the biosimilar, as I mentioned, is going to other mechanisms, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq. So overall, as we look to the balance of really the first quarter, what we're seeing play out in the second quarter, and look to the full year, our commentary, and I'll ask Rob to highlight if he has anything to add, is very much in line with what we've guided at the beginning of the year.\nSo no material change in what we're seeing in the marketplace.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nYeah. This is Rob. I'll confirm that, what Jeff is saying. I mean, it's tracking in line with our expectations. We are not saying that volume is worse than we originally guided. We're saying this is tracking in line with our expectations. We've tried to characterize for you the price versus volume dynamics, obviously saying the price erosion is the vast majority of the decline, but there is volume, and it's tracking exactly as we anticipated. So there isn't an additional downside here. And as Jeff mentioned, we did have slightly better performance in Q1, but again, it was, I mean, I think to the tune of $30-$40 million on this book of business, not overly material, but ahead of the initial expectation.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nAnd hey, Steve, it's Roopal. I can take the next question.\nWe did a thorough diligence. When we look at data sets that offer clinical data, obviously, we do a deep dive there. Also look at blinded data, but we also do a deep dive looking at toxicology, animal tox in particular. We didn't observe anything that was consistent with what has been described thus far. As I mentioned, when we look at blinded safety data, either from the 1B or the current pivotals that are running, we don't see an adverse event like this that would be related. As far as we know, no health authority has reached out to ask any further questions about this. Hey, Steve, this is Rob. I'm going to come back to your previous question, and maybe I understand where the confusion could be. That one-time price benefit is a year-over-year dynamic. It was contemplated in our guidance.\nWhen you have a formulary change, you essentially have those rebates go away, and you recognize that. That was part of our guidance. That was not a benefit versus our guidance. That's a benefit in the year-over-year. So you look at Scott guided to, I think it was 32% erosion in Q2, which is lower than it was around 40% in Q1. So naturally, you'd wonder why would you have less erosion. Well, there's that year-over-year dynamic, but that was how we planned the year. We anticipated this because we knew about the change that was coming on 1 April. So I don't want you to interpret that as a benefit versus our guidance. That's a benefit in the year-over-year calculation.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nTrung Huynh\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, guys. Trung Huynh from UBS.\nCongratulations, Rick, on the next chapter of your life and role for moving AbbVie forward. Again, on biosimilar Humira, in your remarks, you mentioned post the expected CVS contract, there was a step up in price for Humira. Is that simply because you were giving away more price for CVS at the contract at the time? And you mentioned additional contracts moving to biosimilar like CVS this year. Are there any meaningful contracts here that you can flag so we're not surprised? And is it possible we could see actually a pricing increase by year-end because of this? Thanks very much.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nTrung, this is Scott. I'll start with your question regarding the price benefit. So in my remarks, I indicated that with the formulary change in CVS and the volume step down we saw there, that there's a one-time price benefit associated with that.\nAnd you can think of this as we have the volume declines, that volume had been associated with price that we would have been paying in terms of rebate. Those rebates will no longer be paid. Therefore, there's a one-time price benefit associated with that initial step down in the quarter. So that's what that relates to. Yeah. And in terms of what we see going forward, as I highlighted, we don't see a significant exclusionary action where Humira would be removed from a formulary going forward. We did plan for, obviously, that smaller plans may make some adjustments to their formularies. That's all within the volume degradation and the pricing dynamics that we put into our guidance.\nAnd as I mentioned in one of the comments, some of the payers, not super large, would maybe consider this idea of starting new patients on the biosimilars versus maintaining all the existing patients on Humira. So if you were to see that, you shouldn't be surprised about that. And that would be within the contemplated approaches that we're taking as we look across Q2 2024 with our knowledge of what's happening in the marketplace.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung. Operator, we have time for one final question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. And our final question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nEvan Seigerman\n\nManaging Director and Head of Healthcare Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi guys. Thank you so much for taking my question. On the aesthetics business, maybe talk to me about some of the dynamics you're seeing in China. I know that there's a lot of macro headwinds, and this is a pretty big part of your business.\nThen a bit of housekeeping on Skyrizi: last quarter, you disclosed a $1.9 billion cash payment for royalties. Can you provide us any color on what this quarter's royalty was? And I believe that was for the full year-last-year, but maybe just for this quarter. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSVP and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi. This is Carrie. I'll address your question on aesthetics in China. And we do expect economic headwinds that we're seeing in China to persist over the near term, with the China aesthetics market flat overall for 2024. So the way to think about it is to expect negative market until the recovery starts to begin in the second half of 2024. China does remain a very important market for our aesthetics business.\nAnd as the market there starts to recover, we will continue to invest in consumer activation, injector training, and continue to launch new products in this important market.\n\nScott Reents\n\nExecutive Vice President and CFO, AbbVie\n\nHi. It's Scott. So you're right. With respect to the Skyrizi royalty payments, so you have to remember that these are on a bit of a lag, so they don't track each quarter sales. But the $400 million was the amount in the first quarter that we paid in cash payment.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSVP, Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nWell, thanks, Evan. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes today's conference.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2024, with first-quarter results exceeding our expectations. Before we discuss our performance in more detail, I'd like to share my perspective on the planned CEO transition that was announced earlier this year. After serving more than 11 years as AbbVie's first CEO, I have decided to retire from the role effective 1 July 2024 and will continue to serve AbbVie as Executive Chairman of the Board. As you've heard me say before, it is important that we choose the right time to make this critical leadership transition.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSVP and CMO, Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nThe Board and I have been long planning for my eventual succession, and now is the opportune time to move forward with the transition as our business is performing very well and is in a strong position for the long term. We are successfully navigating the Humira US loss of exclusivity. We have built an outstanding company culture, an important priority, and competitive advantage, and our productive R&D engine, which has yielded numerous innovative new medicines for patients, will continue to fuel our robust pipeline."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business, excluding HUMIRA, which delivered full-year sales growth of more than 8% with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the fourth quarter.\nThe strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but has also supported continued investment in our business for long-term growth. These investments include higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be raised substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like 383 and multiple myeloma 400.\nOur next generation ADC for several solid tumor types and Lutikizumab for HS as well as inflammatory bowel disease, the proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with a pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend, which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%.\nIn summary, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024, including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US HUMIRA loss of exclusivity, driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Rick. Today we reported another strong quarter and highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations.\nAs it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex-HUMIRA growth platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio we have several key brands including SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY, and QULIPTA, which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year, driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly underpenetrated market.\nSecond, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for SKYRIZI in UC, 951 in the US, and potentially accelerated approval for EPKINLY in third-line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for Bonti, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\nAnd third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year.\nToday we are also reaffirming our long term sales outlook which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024. We now anticipate SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027, with robust growth continuing into the next decade.\nThis updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for SKYRIZI to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis, where we are the clear market leader, as well as strong uptake in IBD. We expect RINVOQ to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of RINVOQ's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for RINVOQ, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars.\nOur updated forecast also includes higher estimates for UBRELVY and QULIPTA. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long term forecast for aesthetics, VRAYLAR, and 951 remain unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio and our long term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. SKYRIZI total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. RINVOQ total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8% on a full year basis. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year over year. As Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in play share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share. Just today, for example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in Crohn's disease.\nThese two treatments together are already capturing roughly 1/3 of the in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for RINVOQ, and we anticipate launching SKYRIZI for this indication later this year. So significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, SKYRIZI is capturing roughly half of the in-play psoriasis patients in the US biologics market relative to a total prescription share which is in the mid-30s%. RINVOQ is capturing high-teens in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market while total share is in the high-single digits.\nSimilarly, in rheumatoid arthritis, RINVOQ is capturing mid-teens in patient share while total share is roughly 7%. So again we see substantial headroom for share gains. In addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro, plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for RINVOQ across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s.\nTurning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion, down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the US played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the US we have once again secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA in 2024. While there will be some step down in coverage year over year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of US patient lives.\nTurning now to Oncology where total revenues were $1.5 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $903 million, down 19% reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for EPKINLY and third-line plus DLBCL have been encouraging with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe, and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add ELAHERE to our portfolio. ELAHERE is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the US market.\nI look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie and Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors.\nIn neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter. Total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. VRAYLAR continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago, and our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both UBRELVY and QULIPTA this year, including the expansion of QULIPTA, the only once daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine into the international markets. Based on the strong momentum.\nWe have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from UBRELVY and QULIPTA combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. And lastly, we recently launched 951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the US later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease and a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.\nSo overall I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024. With that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\nCarrie.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Fourth quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the US, aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth quarter US Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the US facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants.\nUS JUVÉDERM sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of VOLUX and SKINVIVE, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the US filler market recovery trails that of toxins but is continuing to show improvement as year-over-year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our US aesthetics portfolio. We expect full-year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets.\nInternationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions, and growth benefited from the impact of China's COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results, consistent with what we experienced in the US. The economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions.\nLooking to the long term, aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration, and we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation. As such, we anticipate aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Carrie. In 2023 we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive top line results for Lutikizumab, our anti IL1 alpha beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase II study, Lutikizumab demonstrated higher high score 50 and high score 75 measures as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients were inadequate responders to anti TNF therapy and 70% of the patients were Hurley Stage 3, which is the most advanced stage of the disease.\nBased on these results, we plan to begin a Phase III program in HS later this year. We also plan to evaluate Lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. In these diseases, patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNFs and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe Lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with Lutikizumab and SKYRIZI as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase II studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year.\nOur regulatory applications are under review for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once SKYRIZI is approved in UC along with RINVOQ, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well positioned with an industry leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nWe continue to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for RINVOQ, with Phase III studies underway and five new indications: giant cell arteritis, lupus, HS, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year.\nMoving to oncology where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase III Verona trial in treatment naive higher risk MDS patients with regulatory submissions and approvals anticipated in 2025 for EPKINLY. We anticipate regulatory approvals in third line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase III studies in 2024, including studies in second line DLBCL, and frontline follicular lymphoma. At the recent ASH meeting we presented new data for our BCMA x CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma.\nABBV-383 is engineered for high-affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low-affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T-cell-engaging BCMA-based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy.\nWe're very encouraged by the data emerging from our phase 1b study, which show treatment with 383 is yielding deep, durable responses with a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple myeloma while potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment, all attributes which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase III monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year, and we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive top-line results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 Luminosity study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.\nTeliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, and overall survival with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval and we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months pending alignment with the FDA. Our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400 which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V but has a proprietary Topo 1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index.\nWe remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer, and gastroesophageal cohorts from our Phase 1 study, and based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a Phase III study later this year in third-line CRC.\nWe also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase II study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase II studies this year, including front-line HCC, front-line lung cancer, and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in Q2. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development.\n951 delivers significant improvements in off time and on time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa, and it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US once approved. In our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox and platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year, and we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for Bonti, our rapid-onset short-acting novel toxin.\nFollowing completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organizations once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthen our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. I'm very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2023. We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense.\nTotal net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex HUMIRA growth platform.\nThe adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales.\nAdjusted net interest expense was $363 million. The adjusted tax rate was 17.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and $11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note, this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year.\nWe expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth at current rates. We expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including HUMIRA sales of $9.6 billion, including US erosion of roughly 36%, SKYRIZI revenue of $10.5 billion reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market share performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD, and RINVOQ sales of $5.5 billion, reflecting growth of nearly 40%. With continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications on a full year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will be modestly offset by low single-digit negative net price.\nIn oncology, we expect sales of $5.7 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.9 billion and Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion as well as contributions from EPKINLY, and partial year sales from ELAHERE. For aesthetics, we expect sales of $5.7 billion including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid single digit revenue growth from JUVÉDERM. For neuroscience, we expect revenue of $8.9 billion representing growth of more than 15% including VRAYLAR sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion, and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care, we expect sales of $2.2 billion.\nMoving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions.\nWe forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023.\nTurning to Q1, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for our key therapeutic areas: immunology sales of $5.1 billion, including SKYRIZI sales of $1.9 billion and RINVOQ revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical first quarter seasonality, as well as low single-digit unfavorable net price. We expect HUMIRA global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion.\nWe also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million.\nWe are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and 2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nFinally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully support.\nA strong and growing dividend, which we have increased by more than 285% since inception, continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio.\nIn closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. We'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the first question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. Just looking for a little bit more color on the longer term immunology outlook. You're targeting $27 billion plus by 2027 and highlighting growth from there. I guess my question was just, can you elaborate on how mature the existing indications for these products are going to be by 2027 and what type of growth can we anticipate longer term? And maybe as part of that, it seems like from the comments that the growth beyond $27 billion is more skewed towards RINVOQ given the new indications, but just getting a sense of, like, is it balanced RINVOQ and SKYRIZI or has it become more of a RINVOQ driven franchise in terms of the growth drivers over time? Thanks so much.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Chris, it's Jeff. Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your question, so we can see historically actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the biopenetration of these big indications, and there still remains significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to.\nBe exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals. Absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis, still even in the US, is about 15%. It's relatively modest atopic dermatitis. The penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD. And I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD that's somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those, and then we can see clearly as these markets developed, and I've highlighted this before, that you see line of therapy expansion. So you know, first line becomes less and less important as you move towards second and third line over time. And right now IBD is a big story about that that we calculate into our long-term estimates because it's still largely, despite the severity, a frontline oriented market because physicians just kind of hang on to their frontline agents.\nThat's going to change quite dramatically. We believe over this midterm and even in the long term perspective, we have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable, and will have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around biopenetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share. We have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates, and we're really in the sort of the low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share that will build up and catch up to that pricing. I think we talked a little bit. We're not going to give detailed pricing, but certainly you can see based on Scott's comments that the idea of a high CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we contemplated.\nSo we believe that there's significant room for growth even past 27.\nEspecially as we'll have more RINVOQ indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nChris, this is Rob. I'll just add, think about the markets. The rheum market is growing low single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens, and IBD is growing high single digits. So these are very strong markets. They will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into the early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct given that we would expect up to five new indications for RINVOQ. If you look at the rate of growth RINVOQ vs. SKYRIZI, I think it's reasonable to assume that RINVOQ would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications. But both will grow very nicely.\nSo I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies, which were in book a little bit higher because of the new indications.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on succession planning and timing. We've been fielding that question from number of investors recently. Given you're now past the HUMIRA LOE and position the company very well here given SKYRIZI and RINVOQ commercial success and also some of the recent pipeline build out. And then the second question I have is on a pipeline on Lutikizumab. I know you guys have highlighted this. Not a lot of focus from the investor side yet. Maybe you could just talk about the size of the commercial opportunity in HS and then why you're confident that that Phase II HS data will translate into success in the IBD side. Thank you.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nAll right, Terence, this is Rick. So I'll cover the first one. I guess what I would say is I have nothing new to report today, but what I'd indicate is, you know, we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make this transition. That criteria is the same when we believe that we are comfortable. We've navigated the LOE and the rest of the business is performing at a high level. That's the point which we want to make the transition because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here. That's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use.\nIn order to make the decision with the board, I would say the board's been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making at the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before. At the next regularly scheduled board meeting, I would make a recommendation to the board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors.\nWhat you can expect when you get that announcement is that we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future, in all likelihood four to six months in the future. The purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. That will take four or five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the board, that I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time. The purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time.\nSo, I think it's a very well-thought-out, I think, very well-managed process, and I think that's what you can expect going forward.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nTerence, this is Jeff. I'll start off and have Roopal address the second part of your second question. So, you know, we established many years ago now this HS market with the approval of HUMIRA, and we thought it was a relatively small market, and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There's a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS. It's already a multi-billion dollar category, and we think it's going to continue to expand. I say that because we can see that, like, like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So everyone sort of holds on HUMIRA as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. So we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into the space.\nAnd certainly we're very excited about Lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge.\nIn the clinic. So it's a significant commercial opportunity. And I would say that when we look back over all the HUMIRA indications over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to a billion-dollar-plus business. So it's an exciting opportunity both commercially, and certainly for patients. Roopal can address your comment on IBD.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, Terence. You know, part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with HUMIRA. As Jeff was discussing where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS, we saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with IL-1 beta. So we think we have that opportunity with Lutikizumab because it also covers IL-1 beta. And we have two shots at this. Right? One is to go specifically and look at a biomarker-driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression.\nThe other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like SKYRIZI which has high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's, what we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination. A biomarker approach and a combo approach are insights from HUMIRA and preclinical or.\nBiopsy-based insights that we have externally and internally.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nHead of Global Healthcare and Managing Director of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, many thanks.\ncouple of questions. One, given AbbVie's strength in market access and managed markets, I'd be curious the extent of future contagion from the IRA mediated price cuts on the Medicare book spilling over onto the commercial book of business. How much of concern do you think this is given the payers are basically the same? And then second question on Lutikizumab, if I remember from the Canakinumab trials secondary to neutropenia there was an increase in fatal infections. If you're laying this on top of another immunosuppressive, how are you thinking about the safety concerns in these IBD patients?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Andrew, thanks for your question. It's Jeff. And we think that the, particularly the negotiation aspects of the IRA will be very contained on the Medicare side. And as you can imagine with government programs over the years when we have discussion with payers, you know, they'll often say things over, well we know what the FSS price is for the VA or you know, the mandated discounts and supplemental discounts in the Medicaid channel. But we think those are really government actions and government rules. And so we see that the market we believe will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. So that's how we view the world.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll talk about Lutikizumab and your question around neutrophils. Yeah, we do see an impact on neutrophils. It's dose driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit risk. Because today in those disease states, despite the success that we've seen with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy. Not every patient is getting into remission though high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety. And thus far in the HS trial, even at the highest dose, we've seen very little infections.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Reasearch, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I just want to go back to the ImmunoGen acquisition and the comments you made before. Can you talk a little bit about the plans to move?\nThe drug into.\nEarly lines of ovarian cancer?\nYou talked about maintenance setting, but more.\nWe are reading it.\nI mean, in first-line maintenance, the PFS and OS tends to be really long.\nCould you talk a little bit about the strategy there and how do?\nYou overcome the existing OS benefit that these drugs provide?\nThank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi Mohit, it's Roopal. I'll take that. So I think as you've seen in resistance, we've seen the overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far. And to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also.\nPart of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population; resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is we've seen encouraging data in medium expressors of FR Alpha, and those are approximately 30% of the patients; high is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple things, insights that we've seen. One is we've seen ELAHERE been able to combine at full dose with carboplatin. So that's encouraging. That gives you an opportunity to up front combine and then, as you stated, maintain on ELAHERE or with ELAHERE plus Bev. So the other approaches that we would do getting the earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy, and then we see patients that go on to Bev.\nWe can combine with Bev at that time point and we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors which is about the other half of the patient populations which are HRD deficient. So taken all together, we see there's an opportunity. Now the PFS is going to be a little bit longer along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for. We'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, this is Dan Crouzet on for Vamil. Thanks for taking my question. So my question's on HUMIRA. I was curious, given the recent performance the company has had with the erosion since the introduction of biosimilars. I was wondering if you can now provide maybe a better sense around the company's expectations on HUMIRA's longer term tail revenues in both the US and ex-US markets. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So we do expect that in the US the tail will start to emerge in the 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands and ultimately what does contracting look like next year. So I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year, but it's certainly possible something we would do either in 2025 or 2026. As it relates to international, you're seeing I think this year a step down of about $400 million. Half of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico. We're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas.\nSo not really specific to biosimilars. And then, you know, the other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ as these newer agents elevate standard of care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so probably the best way to think about international would be, you know, if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves, and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific. I think we need to see, really, how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars before we can really give you more color. But we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Dan. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Research Analyst and US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two on the neuroscience portfolio, I guess first on ABBV-951. How should we think about that? Is that more sort of around growing the overall pie of device aided therapies versus taking share from apomorphine and the gels, and then maybe looking a little bit longer term, AbbVie has sort of three Phase II Alzheimer's studies that are going to read out later this year, by early next year, fully acknowledging the commercial challenges by the players in the market today and that some of these targets are now validated. How should investors think about.\nThese assets either individually or collectively and your level of excitement? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So what we look at when we see this market at a macro level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medications. So oral Sinemet, ok. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals and sometimes at the end of it they're taking, you know, 12 pills a day. Very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief. You either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery, or our own Duopa, which is a GI surgery.\nSo the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone because you don't have, you know, it's a sub Q so a new market segment that starts to emerge before, you know, bigger interventions like DBS or Duopa, and obviously the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan where we launched late last year, and also in Germany in some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing, titration, and the pump is much smaller.\nAnd again it's a sub Q injection that you move around every three days. It's a nice opportunity for the company.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nAnd maybe I'll talk about the other assets that you mentioned in Alzheimer's first 916. That's our a beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far, that the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing, potentially higher potency, if that holds, and we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we're looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say end of this year, early next year, I think that that would be quite exciting because it would be a differentiated profile, again, a better convenience and potentially better benefit risk profile. So that's 916, 552 is our SV2A, that's.\nOur oral medication in cognition that's currently in phase two. We anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now that one is being studied in a setting where a patient can be on a therapy already like an Aricept or on nothing. We would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others, including other neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimer's. The third one I'll mention is around Imraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. The goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis. Of the six million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis.\nSo with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimer's. Because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this, but more to come, end of this year and into next year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from.\nYour line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks for the question. Just on the reaffirmed long-term guide, can I clarify if the Cerevel and ImmunoGen deals are in this 2029 guide given? You included them in the 2024 guide and you upped SKYRIZI and RINVOQ by $6 billion, Migraine by $1 billion. If these are the pushes, what are the pulls in reaffirming that long-term guidance?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll take that question. Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide. The thing to keep in mind is, you know, high single digits. When you think about the range that could represent, you know, that's around $10 billion, you know, between the low end of the high single digits and the high end of the high single digits. And so there aren't any pulls. What we've updated as we walked you through it is we've increased the oral CGRP peak revenue, we've increased SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, and we've reaffirmed the other. So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty, pretty wide range. If you look at street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter. About $3 billion in 2029.\nIt's nice to see that upward movement, but it's still below what we expect. If you think that growth rate for the street is just under 5%, we expect high single digits. And so even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high single digits. But keep in mind it's a pretty wide range and it would be regardless industry leading growth. And we're set up very well to continue delivering a very strong growth and we're setting ourselves very well to grow very nicely in the next decade as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nSenior Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThanks.\nGood morning.\nFirst, on aesthetics, could you talk?\nBit more, why you're confident in what seems to be a pretty decent return to growth in 2024? So how much of a headwind could China be offsetting the US growth? And what are other regions? Will you be getting somewhat of a lift this year? Just talk about the dynamics on that front.\nOh, and then secondly, just, you know, as you return to more robust revenue growth in 2025, what are reasonable expectations for operating margins directionally in 2025? You know, can that expand at all or is it more likely to be depressed from the ImmunoGen and Cerevel deals? Just give us some directional way to think about that for next year. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll take your first question on aesthetics and the aesthetics market recovery. So I'll start with the US and we have started to see the US toxin market recover at the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue and for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers in the US, in Q4 after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest, positive growth for 2024.\nAs we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here in terms of China. We do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near term with China. We expect the China aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in H1 2024 until the China market starts to recover in H2 2024. We expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions, including Japan, which has become an important market for aesthetics, and areas of Latin America like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market.\nIt's also important to note in terms of Q1 of 2024, in terms of our guidance there, that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds, but also a difficult year over year comp in Q1 because recall in Q1 of 2023 there was the post pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in the US, China, and other parts of the world playing out in 2024.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Rob to build on the aesthetic story I said in the past. To get to our guidance of greater than nine billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high single digits on average. As Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year, and we will, but it's not going to be a normal year. We'll see a ramping, and we also have a slowdown in China. But despite that, we're still delivering high single digit growth. Given how underpenetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. Then on top of that, we have several innovations that will further support that growth. I've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few hundred million dollars each.\nOur novel short-acting toxin Bonti has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our regenerative fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide. I have seen consensus estimates at $8 billion for 2029, but we're very confident in our guidance of greater than $9 billion by that period.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Scott. I'll take your question regarding operating margin expansion. So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand and will continue to expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be relatively steady over several years. I would, though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's where we'll hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions in ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full year at that point in time. But at a full year impact, we see that expansion.\nI do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin, and certainly with the future expansion, we'll continue to have that and only grow that position.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Two questions. Is the current tax rate fully reflecting likely tax changes in the US and outside the US? So it represents the high water mark for the foreseeable future. Previously the company spoke to a 16% tax rate and we're pretty much there. So I'm wondering if the increases are kind of behind us. And then Rick, a slightly different kind of question, but there are clear obvious reasons such as the success of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. But I'm curious if you would share with us a few of the externally less visible factors that are leading to AbbVie's success traversing the HUMIRA patent expiration that your pharma peers missed when dealing with their own pressures. I would assume contracting, formulary, management, allocation of overhead are all part of it. But what would you be willing to share with us? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve. This is Scott. I'll start with your tax rate question. So with respect to the tax rate, we're essentially flat, between this year and last year, 15.7%. We do see that tax rate over the three-year period, including this year, increasing about 1% on average. Now that's not going to be 1% per year. What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase, the GILTI rate in particular will increase. So we see that over a three-year period, about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD and some of these OECD minimum taxes and other things.\nI would say the one thing it does not include, you saw just this week the House passed a tax bill that includes a provision regarding the R&D expensing. If that bill were to pass as it's written, we would see a slight step down in our tax rate, about 80 basis points from the impact of that on an ongoing basis.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, this is Rick. I think if you step back and you look over the last, I'd say 10 years, we were trying to develop a strategy that we fundamentally believe would allow us to be able to offset the HUMIRA LOE and continue to deliver top-tier financial performance as we have for the past 10 years. That was the whole objective, and we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so we as an executive team focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets?\nI think, AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional, in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand.\nThe patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by.\nAccess to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things, I think, to end up with the kind of success that we see with assets like SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. But it also takes, I think, a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. And I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on RINVOQ was a great example. But look at where RINVOQ is growing now.\nDespite that label change many would not have predicted. Migraine was a very challenging market for a period of time. Look at how we've operated with UBRELVY and QULIPTA and the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets. Neuroscience, very different kind of market with VRAYLAR. That's all about trying to grow market share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so we're good at that. And I think that is the other thing I'd say is I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry, but we produced a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now, having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D.\nAs I said in my comments, we did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the HUMIRA LOE, and we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we have some assets that have very, very significant opportunities, like 383, like 400, and several others that are going to require large Phase III, multiple large Phase III studies to be able to get the kind of label that we need. That's another thing I'd say we're good at, understanding how you have a competitive label and building your clinical programs to get that. So I think it requires all of those things. I don't think there's one magic formula. I think those are the kinds of things that we have honed here at AbbVie as an executive team, and we execute very well against those.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from Evan Segerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, guys.\nMalcolm on for Evan. I wanted to.\nAsk, thinking about the upcoming approval for.\nSKYRIZI in UC, how is management thinking about how that may or may not impact RINVOQ sales? Obviously, combined, AbbVie offers an impressive suite of inflammatory assets.\nWhat is the expectation of cannibalism?\nAcross these assets potentially? Thanks.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. I'll take that one. You know, we've learned a lot from watching SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in Crohn's. And to Rick's point, look, we're very careful about how we position these assets, you know, how we basically represent them with our medical teams and our commercial teams. And so what we see, certainly in our biggest markets, we see that they're actually complementary positioning. So Rick highlighted the label change.\nRight.\nSo RINVOQ in the US is basically indicated for use after a TNF. So it's basically a later line therapy. SKYRIZI. If you look at the SKYRIZI UC results, it's very, very impressive. We studied some very, very tough patients there, the bio-naive patients. The efficacy is just outstanding. I would say it's best-in-class. So we can see that based on the profile of the agents for many of our representatives, we're able to talk to physicians about the consideration for SKYRIZI frontline and then in later lines RINVOQ. So the cannibalization or the overlap is very manageable and minimal. And what happens is you start to see this very significant build for total AbbVie share because of that complementary positioning. So we're quite confident that we'll be able to navigate this very well, just as we see in the larger Crohn's market.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks for the question. Operator. Next call. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nTim Anderson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst of Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, Wolfe Research\n\nHi, I have a question on obesity.\nDrug impact on AbbVie's aesthetics business. So the uptake of obesity drugs could be a headwind or a tailwind. It's a potential headwind if patients only have so many dollars to spend on aesthetics and they reallocate their out-of-pocket spending away from dermal fillers and toxins towards obesity drugs. Or it's a tailwind if patients using.\nObesity drugs get things like the so.\nCalled Ozempic face and they end up using more toxins than fillers. So what's been the experience thus far, and what do you expect going forward over the next handful of years?\nThank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. So the short answer is we have not seen an impact on our aesthetics business, positive or negative so far. That said, absolutely, our customers and our consumers are participating in this market. We are seeing it integrated into some of these aesthetics practices. And to your point, there are instances where a patient will make a trade off in terms of her share of wallet. But that said, we do see it as a long term tailwind. Anytime people are getting more engaged in their appearance, that's a positive thing for aesthetics. And as we ask our consumers and our customers about it, really what we've learned is that it does reinforce this long term tailwind because the majority of people who engage in these medical weight loss products are more interested in aesthetics afterwards than they were before.\nSo that's really how we see it in terms of that dynamic impacting aesthetics. Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Tim Lugo with William Blair. Your line is open.\n\nTim Lugo\n\nPartner and Group Head of Biotechnology Equity Research, William Blair\n\nThanks for taking the question. After the two announced acquisitions in December, what are the team's thoughts on M&A in 2024? Some of your peers have given guidance on expected deal sizes. Is that something you can provide the street or at least talk about your capacity at this point?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nHi Tim, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So our BD efforts continue to be focused on identifying assets really that can drive growth in the next decade across immunology, oncology, neuroscience, aesthetics, and eye care. We have what we need in our current portfolio to deliver on growth expectations in this decade. So our external efforts are really aimed at early stage opportunities which are typically smaller sized deals. As we look across the growth areas, just think about immunology. SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will drive robust growth into the next decade. So our focus in immunology in terms of BD is really looking for new mechanisms of action that can elevate standard of care whether monotherapy or in combination. I'd say there's a lot of interest in combination in oncology. ImmunoGen really nicely complements our efforts with ADCs.\nIt gives us a head start by buying an entry in the solid tumor space that we're not in today. But in addition to ADCs, we're focused on bispecifics, multispecifics, immuno-oncology agents. We also recently announced a collaboration with Umoja studying in situ CAR-T therapy. So a lot of focus in oncology, but these again would be earlier-stage, smaller-size deals in neuroscience. Several add depth to our neuropsych pipeline, but we also have a focus on migraine and neurodegeneration in eye care. We're extremely excited about the REGENXBIO program and wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. But we continue to look for innovation in glaucoma and retinal disease. So we certainly have an interest there, and then in aesthetics. It's always about looking for innovation that can drive new consumers into our provider's practice. So our BD group is still very active.\nWe certainly have the financial wherewithal to pursue those opportunities to further bolster our pipeline. But those are the areas that we're most interested in.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Tim. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from James Shin with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. I have a question on biosimilars and more competitive with Cadherin-6. How do you feel about Cadherin-6 and FR alpha ADCs interacting, and how do you feel about that market landscape.\nLooks going forward.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nYou know, unfortunately your line is not very clear. Can you maybe try to repeat the question one time?\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nSorry about that.\nAre we hearing better now?\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nIt's still a little echoey, a little bit better, but go ahead.\n\nJames Shin\n\nDirector of Biopharma Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay.\nI was asking about Cadherin-6 and the competitive dynamics in ovarian cancer.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nYeah, unfortunately, it's just not coming through clearly. Happy to address the question following the call. Apologies for that, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the next question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Risinger\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nYes, thanks very much and congrats on.\nThe long-term updates.\nSo with respect to the Alzheimer's commentary.\nA product was left out, the TREM2-AL002, which has an estimated primary completion in September. If you could comment on that as well, that would be helpful. And then with respect to the GILTI.\nTax change that's coming, could you please provide some more color on that, including the timing and the potential impact? Thanks very much.\n\nTom Hudson\n\nSenior Vice President, and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Tom Hudson. I'll answer the question. The first question. Yes, we do have a partner program with Alector on the TREM2 target. TREM2 was identified in Alzheimer's disease through genetic studies several years ago. Very strong link. We have a program to modulate a neuroinflammatory response in AD. All patients are enrolled in the Phase II. We won't have data later this year. So again, it's an early clinical development, but we will expect to see key data later.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSure.\nThis is Scott regarding the GILTI tax. So this is the US tax, the foreign minimum tax on foreign earnings that the US supplies. That tax rate today is at 10.5%. It's going to move up to 13.1%. A little bit more than that. That will occur. The implementation date's a little bit mixed because it depends on fiscal year ends of legal entities. But let's call it 2026 is when we can look at that. And only part of our income is subject to that rate. So I would say that's approximately a 1.5% impact to our tax rate that you would see. And that's baked into my 1% on average over the next three years.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, David. Operator, we have time for one final question.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, final question is Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\n\nLuisa Hector\n\nHead of Global Pharmaceutical Equity Research, Berenberg\n\nThank you for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the Part D restructure and IRA. So you have a number of drugs that are likely to be impacted by this, and obviously you talk about your strong rebound in 2025. So I'd just love to hear your thoughts on how that restructure will impact and to what extent that is already baked into your expectations of the rebound. And maybe just to check, have you now received the initial offer from CMS on IMBRUVICA? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, thank you Luisa. It's Jeff. You know we have contemplated in our planning and long term guidance both the Part D redesign and of course the IRA impacts based on our projections over when some of our drugs might be negotiated to give you some color on the Part D redesign. We have clearly a very good visibility over the pricing dynamics that will take place. As you say, many of our brands basically will be under the catastrophic redesign component. Now we've also understood based on one of the policy items, which is the cap and spread. We've also countered some of that price with volume offsets based on patients having the ability to acquire these. Now that volume does not fully offset the pricing impact. But suffice it to say that that's been very much contemplated into that.\nI'll let Rob comment over how that sort of feeds into the growth rates.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nLuisa, you ask a very good question. This is Rob, you know, clearly, and we have contemplated that in the high single-digit CAGR, the impacts of IRA. But as you think about, you know, the annual progression, it is important to note that Part D benefit redesign starts in 2025. So that is certainly something you should consider for modeling of annual sales. I mean that impact by itself on a net basis could be worth a few points of growth. As Jeff mentioned, it's a higher cost share with an offset in volume. We have studied the improvement in abandonment rates as we look at the low-income subsidy part of Part D, which doesn't have the out-of-pocket burden that the standard benefit does.\nWhen we compare the abandonment rates and as you address this issue of out of pocket burden, we would expect the abandonment rates to improve across Medicare Part D, but not enough to fully offset the higher cost share. That was something we certainly contemplated. As you think about the progression of growth, you know, the rate of growth will accelerate, you know, starting next year through 2029. So we'll deliver a high single digit CAGR. It's important to note that in 2025 you do have that beginning of Part D benefit redesign which adds, I'd say a couple points of growth headwind that will still allow us to deliver robust growth, but it won't, you know, you shouldn't think about the same amount of growth every year. It's going to accelerate over the long.\nRange plan.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nAnd then this is Rick on the IMBRUVICA price. Yes, we have received the initial offer on IMBRUVICA recently. As you know, there's a process that CMS is going through here to set pricing.\nBecause none of us have any experience with this, we don't know exactly how that process will proceed. There will be some back and forth between the manufacturer and CMS. CMS has indicated that they'll have the final price by 1 September.\nIt's certainly premature for us to talk about the price now because it's not the final price. I don't know that we'll know the final price until very close to the point at which they are prepared to publish that price, having not had any experience here. So I wouldn't anticipate we would get any updates until either that date or very close to that date.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Luisa. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nThank you.\nThat concludes today.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nSam.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSam.\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the AbbVie Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only into the question and answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. Today's call is also being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics; and Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Chief Medical Officer, Global Therapeutics. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer, Global Research. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. In addition to the news release issued this morning, we have also posted slides on our website at investors.abbvie.com that supplement some of the content we'll be covering this morning. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our performance this quarter tops off another excellent year for AbbVie with results well above our initial expectations. I'm particularly pleased with the performance of our growth platform, the base business excluding HUMIRA, which delivered full-year sales growth of more than 8% with revenue growth accelerating to more than 15% in the Fourth Quarter. The strength of our diversified growth platform has not only enabled us to successfully absorb the largest loss of exclusivity event to date across our industry, but has also supported continued investment in our business for long-term growth.\nThese investments include higher adjusted R&D expense, which was increased by nearly $600 million in 2023 and will be raised substantially again in 2024 to support several promising pipeline programs like ABBV-383 for multiple myeloma, ABBV-400, our next-generation ADC for several solid tumor types, and Lutikizumab for HS as well as inflammatory bowel disease. The proposed acquisition of ImmunoGen and their portfolio of ADCs accelerating our entry into the solid tumor space and strengthening our oncology pipeline, as well as the proposed acquisition of Cerevel, a unique opportunity to augment our presence in neuroscience with a pipeline of differentiated assets. We also increased our quarterly dividend, which we announced in October. Since our inception, we have grown our dividend by more than 285%.\nIn summary, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we have considerable momentum heading into 2024. Including an expected return to operational sales growth just one year following the US HUMIRA loss of exclusivity driven by our growth platform. We remain confident in our long-term outlook including a return to robust growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nRob, thank you, Rick. Today we reported another strong quarter and highly productive year for AbbVie. We delivered full-year adjusted earnings per share of $11.11, which is $0.63 above our initial guidance midpoint. Excluding the impact of IPR&D expense, total net revenues were $54.3 billion, roughly $2.3 billion ahead of our initial guidance. Most importantly, each of our five key growth areas outperformed our initial expectations.\nAs it pertains to AbbVie's near-term outlook, we are focused on three key priorities. First, driving strong performance of our ex-HUMIRA growth platform. This platform is the critical driver of our return to robust growth in 2025 and beyond. In our therapeutic portfolio, we have several key brands including SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, VRAYLAR, UBRELVY, and QULIPTA which are each expected to contribute double-digit sales growth in 2024. We also expect meaningful growth for aesthetics this year. Driven by improving market trends in the US and continued execution across our international business. We are well positioned to drive strong long-term growth in this highly underpenetrated market.\nSecond, we are focused on prioritizing investment in our pipeline which encompasses numerous opportunities to elevate the standard of care for patients. We anticipate updates this year from several important R&D programs including approvals for SKYRIZI in UC, 951 in the US, and potentially accelerated approval for EPKINLY in third-line plus follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate regulatory submissions for BoNT, our novel short-acting toxin, and potentially Teliso-V in advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.\nAnd third, we are focused on closing and integrating ImmunoGen and Cerevel. These two exciting opportunities represent substantial sources of revenue growth well into the next decade. We remain on track with the anticipated closing of both deals in the middle of the year.\nToday we are also reaffirming our long-term sales outlook, which includes a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR through the end of the decade. Included in this outlook is an updated forecast for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ based on the impressive growth of both therapies, which we expect will collectively generate approximately $16 billion of revenue in 2024. We now anticipate SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will collectively exceed more than $27 billion in sales by 2027 with robust growth continuing into the next decade.\nThis updated forecast reflects an increase of more than $6 billion in revenue compared to our prior 2027 guidance. We expect global sales for SKYRIZI to reach more than $17 billion in 2027, reflecting continued share capture in psoriasis where we are the clear market leader as well as strong uptake in IBD, and we expect RINVOQ to achieve more than $10 billion of global sales in 2027, reflecting continued market growth and share momentum across each of RINVOQ's approved indications, including four in rheumatology, two in IBD, and atopic dermatitis. This forecast comprehends modest contributions from several new disease areas for RINVOQ, which we anticipate will be launching in the second half of the decade. These new indications have a collective peak sales potential of several billion dollars.\nOur updated forecast also includes higher estimates for UBRELVY and QULIPTA. We now expect total oral CGRP peak revenue of more than $3 billion, reflecting an increase of more than $1 billion. Our previously issued long-term forecast for aesthetics, VRAYLAR, and 951 remains unchanged. In summary, this is an exciting time for AbbVie. We are demonstrating outstanding execution across our portfolio, and our long-term outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nJeff, thank you, Rob. I'll start with the quarterly results for Immunology, which delivered total revenues of more than $6.9 billion, exceeding our expectations. SKYRIZI total sales were approximately $2.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of 51.6%. RINVOQ total sales were more than $1.2 billion, reflecting operational growth of 62.8%. On a full year basis, SKYRIZI and RINVOQ delivered more than $11.7 billion in total combined revenue, an impressive increase of $4 billion year over year. And as Rob just described, we see substantial room for continued growth across each of their currently approved indications. You can get a good sense for this momentum by looking at the relationship between the current in play share, which includes new and switching patients, and the total prescription share. Just today, for example, our performance in IBD has been very strong for both SKYRIZI and RINVOQ in Crohn's disease.\nThese two treatments together are already capturing roughly 1/3 of the in-play patients across all lines of therapy in the United States, while their combined total prescription share is only in the mid-single digits. You see a similar trend happening in ulcerative colitis for RINVOQ, and we anticipate launching SKYRIZI for this indication later this year, so significant opportunity remains for revenue inflection in IBD, especially given their respective efficacy, safety, and dosing profiles. Across some of the other notable indications, SKYRIZI is capturing roughly 1/2 of the in-play psoriasis patients in the US biologic market relative to a total prescription share which is in the mid-30s%. RINVOQ is capturing high teens% in-play share in the atopic dermatitis market while total share is in the high single digits%.\nSimilarly in rheumatoid arthritis RINVOQ is capturing mid-teens in patient share while total share is roughly 7%. So again we see substantial headroom for share gains. In addition to the typical robust market growth across rheum, derm, and gastro, plus, we are planning to have up to five additional indications for RINVOQ across several sizable markets that will potentially provide another significant revenue inflection in the second half of this decade and into the 2030s. Turning now to HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of $3.3 billion down 40.8% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the US played out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets continues to trend better than expected. In the US we have once again secured broad formulary access for HUMIRA in 2024.\nWhile there will be some step down in coverage year over year, we will still have parity access to biosimilars for the vast majority of US patient lives.\nTurning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. IMBRUVICA global revenues were $903 million, down 19%, reflecting continued pressure in new patient starts. Venclexta global sales were $589 million, up 13.7%, on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The early prescription trends for EPKINLY in third-line plus DLBCL have been encouraging, with commercialization now underway in the US, Europe, and Japan. We also anticipate the potential label expansion for follicular lymphoma later this year. Lastly, we have two new and exciting opportunities in oncology. Pending completion of the transaction, we will add ELAHERE to our portfolio. ELAHERE is a first-in-class ADC therapy approved for ovarian cancer, which is already demonstrating impressive uptake in the US market.\nI look forward to welcoming the ImmunoGen commercial team to AbbVie and Teliso-V, another novel ADC which has demonstrated very promising data in lung cancer. Teliso-V would further expand our scale and growth potential in solid tumors.\nIn neuroscience, our second largest therapeutic area, total full-year revenues were more than $7.7 billion, reflecting impressive absolute sales growth of nearly $1.2 billion in the quarter. Total revenues were approximately $2.1 billion, up 22.4% on an operational basis. VRAYLAR continues to demonstrate robust growth. Global sales of $789 million were up nearly 40%. We continue to see significant momentum in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder just over a year ago, and our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $348 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 40%. We anticipate continued robust demand for both UBRELVY and QULIPTA this year, including the expansion of QULIPTA, the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, into the international markets.\nBased on the strong momentum, we have raised the outlook for our CGRP portfolio and now expect total peak sales from UBRELVY and QULIPTA combined to exceed $3 billion. Total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $776 million, up 6.7% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. Lastly, we recently launched ABBV-951 in both Japan and Europe, and we are pursuing commercial approval in the US later this year. This treatment represents a potentially transformative next generation therapy for advanced patients, Parkinson's disease, and a $1 billion plus peak sales opportunity.\nSo overall I'm extremely pleased with the commercial execution across our diversified portfolio, especially the growth platform which is demonstrating very strong momentum as we head into 2024. With that I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics.\nCarrie.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Jeff. Fourth Quarter global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.4 billion, an operational increase of 6.9%. In the US, aesthetic sales of $884 million increased 5.7%, marked by accelerating market growth and strong key product performance. Fourth Quarter US Botox Cosmetic sales were $453 million, an increase of 7.3%. We continue to see sustained momentum in the recovery of the US facial toxin market, which was a primary driver of growth in the fourth quarter. Botox Cosmetic remains the clear market leader with strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants.\nUS JUVÉDERM sales were $156 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of more than 20% versus the prior year. This robust growth was driven by the strong launches of VOLUX and SKINVIVE, which continue to drive new consumers and greater penetration in the dermal filler category. Consistent with our expectations, the US Filler market recovery trails out of toxins but is continuing to show improvement as year over year growth was roughly flat in the fourth quarter. As we look at 2024, we are pleased with the momentum of our US aesthetics portfolio. We expect full year sales growth as our market leadership positions us very well from a competitive perspective, and we anticipate continued recovery in both toxin and filler markets.\nInternationally, fourth quarter aesthetic sales were $487 million, representing an operational increase of 9%. We experienced strong performance in most regions, and growth benefited from the impact of China's post-COVID lockdowns in late 2022. Within China, the softening economic conditions that emerged in the third quarter continued to impact results consistent with what we experienced in the US. The economic slowdown has impacted fillers more than toxins based upon their relatively higher price. We anticipate economic headwinds will continue in China over the near term, balanced against our expectations for continued strong performance in other international regions. Looking to the long term, aesthetics remains an area with very low market penetration, and we have demonstrated our ability to drive growth through investments in our customers, consumers, and innovation.\nAs such, we anticipate aesthetics will be a strong growth portfolio for years to come and remain confident in our ability to deliver more than $9 billion of sales by the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Roopal.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Carrie. In 2023 we saw significant evolution of our pipeline with multiple data readouts, regulatory submissions, and approvals as well as expansion of our R&D efforts with the announced ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We expect to continue this progress with numerous important clinical and regulatory milestones anticipated this year. In immunology, we recently announced positive top line results for Lutikizumab, our anti-IL-1 alpha/beta bispecific being evaluated in hidradenitis suppurativa. In the Phase II study, Lutikizumab demonstrated higher HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 measures as well as improvement in skin pain compared to placebo. These are very impressive results considering all patients were inadequate responders to anti-TNF therapy and 70% of the patients were Hurley Stage 3, which is the most advanced stage of the disease. Based on these results, we plan to begin a Phase III program in HS later this year.\nWe also plan to evaluate Lutikizumab in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's given the role that IL-1 likely plays in these diseases. Patients with UC who have an IL-1 beta signature have shown resistance to anti-TNFs and other biologics, providing strong rationale for a potential biomarker approach. Additionally, we believe Lutikizumab has the potential to be used in combinations to provide transformational levels of efficacy in IBD. We plan to evaluate combo approaches with Lutikizumab and SKYRIZI, as well as with other pipeline assets in Crohn's. Our Phase II studies in IBD are expected to begin later this year.\nOur regulatory applications are under review for SKYRIZI in ulcerative colitis with approval decisions expected in the US and Europe later this year. Once SKYRIZI is approved in UC along with RINVOQ, we will have two assets with different mechanisms of action in IBD, both offering very high levels of efficacy. AbbVie will be very well positioned with an industry leading suite of treatment options for patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\nWe continue to make very good progress with the second wave of development programs for RINVOQ with Phase III studies underway in five new indications: giant cell arteritis, lupus, HS, alopecia areata, and vitiligo. We anticipate data readouts for these programs over the next three years, beginning with data from our GCA study this year.\nMoving to oncology where we continue to make very good progress across our heme and solid tumor programs. In the area of hematologic oncology, we'll see data in the second half of this year from the Venclexta Phase III Verona trial in treatment naive higher risk MDS patients with regulatory submissions and approvals anticipated in 2025 for EPKINLY. We anticipate regulatory approvals in third line or greater follicular lymphoma later this year in both the US and Europe. We also expect to begin several new Phase III studies in 2024 including studies in second line DLBCL and frontline follicular lymphoma.\nAt the recent ASH meeting, we presented new data for our BCMA x CD3 bispecific ABBV-383 in multiple myeloma. 383 is engineered for high affinity binding to BCMA on malignant cells and low affinity binding to a unique CD3 epitope on T cells, which has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse events associated with other T cell engaging BCMA based therapies while preserving high levels of efficacy.\nWe're very encouraged by the data emerging from our Phase 1B study, which show treatment with ABBV-383 is yielding deep and durable responses with a lower incidence and severity of CRS. With this profile, we believe 383 can be a highly effective and tolerable treatment for multiple multiple myeloma while potentially allowing for outpatient administration, limited or no step-up dosing, and monthly administration from the beginning of treatment, all attributes which would make it very appealing to both patients and physicians. We remain on track to begin a Phase III monotherapy study in third-line multiple myeloma this year, and we plan to begin combination trials in earlier lines of therapy in 2025. In the area of solid tumors, we recently announced positive top-line results from the Teliso-V Phase 2 Luminosity study in previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.\nTeliso-V demonstrated strong clinical benefits across key endpoints including overall response rate, duration of response, and overall survival with a tolerable safety profile. We believe these results have the potential to support accelerated approval and we plan to discuss the data with regulators in the coming months pending alignment with the FDA. Our submission is planned for the second half of this year. We're also making good progress with our next generation c-Met ADC ABBV-400, which utilizes the same c-Met blocking antibody as Teliso-V but has a proprietary Topo 1 warhead to afford deeper and more durable responses with an improved therapeutic index.\nWe remain on track to see data this year from the non-small cell lung cancer, and gastroesophageal cohorts from our phase one study, and based on the progress we're making in our colorectal program, we plan to begin a phase three study later this year in third-line CRC.\nWe also continue to make very good progress with our anti-GARP antibody ABBV-151. Our Phase II study in second-line hepatocellular carcinoma is underway, and we plan to begin several additional Phase II studies this year, including front-line HCC, front-line lung cancer, and metastatic urothelial cancer. We look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature. Now moving to neuroscience, where we recently announced the European launch of ABBV-951 for patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. We also recently provided our complete response submission to the FDA for 951 with an approval decision anticipated in Q2. Our novel subcutaneous levodopa carbidopa delivery system has the potential to offer meaningful benefits over current treatment options and others that are in development.\n951 delivers significant improvements in off time on time with a less invasive non-surgical system. It can deliver high levodopa doses similar to the amount provided by Duopa, and it doesn't require combination with oral drugs to achieve high efficacy. 951 also provides a full 24-hour benefit, which should result in less morning akinesia. We're extremely excited to bring this transformative therapeutic option to patients in Europe and the US. Once approved in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application in the US for Botox and Platysma prominence. We anticipate an approval decision in the second half of this year, and we remain on track to complete the remaining CMC work this year for Bonti, our rapid-onset, short-acting novel toxin.\nFollowing completion of the remaining work, we plan to submit our regulatory application in the second half of the year with approval anticipated near the end of 2025. So in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous regulatory and clinical milestones again in 2024. I also look forward to integrating the ImmunoGen and Cerevel teams and pipeline assets into our R&D organizations once those transactions close this year. These two transactions significantly strengthen our oncology and neuroscience pipelines with the addition of several novel assets that have the potential to become innovative new therapies for many patients. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nThank you, Roopal. I'm very pleased with AbbVie's strong performance in 2023. We have substantial momentum across the portfolio to support our long term growth outlook. Starting with our fourth quarter results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.79, which is $0.05 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense.\nTotal net revenues were $14.3 billion, $300 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.4%. Most notably, these results reflect 15.3% sales growth from our ex-HUMIRA growth platform.\nThe adjusted operating margin ratio was 43.8% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.9% of sales, adjusted R&D expense of 13.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 2% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.7% of sales.\nAdjusted net interest expense was $363 million. The adjusted tax rate was 17.2%.\nTurning to our financial outlook for 2024, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance is between $11.05 and 11.25. This earnings per share guidance includes dilution related to the ImmunoGen and Cerevel acquisitions of $0.32, which assumes closing in the middle of the year. Please note this guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred throughout the year.\nWe expect total net revenues of approximately $54.2 billion, reflecting a return to modest operational growth at current rates. We expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This revenue forecast contemplates the following approximate assumptions for our key products and therapeutic areas. We expect global immunology sales of $25.6 billion, including HUMIRA sales of $9.6 billion including US erosion of roughly 36%, SKYRIZI revenue of $10.5 billion reflecting growth of more than $2.7 billion due to strong market share performance in psoriasis as well as robust uptake in IBD, and RINVOQ sales of $5.5 billion reflecting growth of nearly 40%. With continued market growth and share momentum across all approved indications.\nOn a full year basis, we anticipate that our strong volume growth for SKYRIZI and RINVOQ will be modestly offset by low single digit negative net price.\nIn oncology we expect sales of $5.7 billion including IMBRUVICA revenue of $2.9 billion and then Venclexta sales of $2.4 billion as well as contributions from EPKINLY and partial year sales from ELAHERE. For aesthetics we expect sales of $5.7 billion including $2.9 billion from Botox Cosmetic and mid single digit revenue growth from JUVÉDERM. For Neuroscience we expect revenue of $8.9 billion representing growth of more than 15% including VRAYLAR sales of $3.4 billion, Botox Therapeutic sales of $3.2 billion and total oral CGRP revenue of $1.6 billion. For eye care we expect sales of $2.2 billion.\nMoving to the P&L for 2024, we are forecasting full year adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 14% of sales, adjusted SG&A expense of 23.5% of sales, and adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 46.5% of sales. We expect adjusted net interest expense of $2.1 billion, which includes the partial year cost in 2024 to finance the ImmunoGen and Cerevel transactions. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.7%. Finally, we expect share count to be roughly flat to 2023.\nTurning to Q1, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $11.9 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on sales growth.\nThis revenue forecast comprehends the following approximate assumptions for key therapeutic areas, immunology sales of $5.1 billion.\nIncluding SKYRIZI sales of $1.9 billion and RINVOQ revenue of $1 billion. These estimates reflect typical Q1 seasonality as well as low single-digit unfavorable net price. We expect HUMIRA global revenue of $2.2 billion, including US sales of $1.7 billion.\nWe also anticipate oncology revenue just above $1.3 billion, aesthetic sales of $1.3 billion, neuroscience revenue of $1.9 billion, and eye care sales of $600 million.\nWe are forecasting an adjusted gross margin of approximately 83.5% of sales and an adjusted operating margin ratio of roughly 44.5% of sales. We also model a non-GAAP tax rate of 14.8%.\nWe expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.30 and 2.34. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nFinally, AbbVie's strong business performance and outlook continues to support our capital allocation priorities. Our cash balance at the end of December was $12.8 billion and we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $18 billion in 2024, which includes roughly $1.9 billion in SKYRIZI royalty payments. The strong free cash flow will fully.\nSupport.\nA strong and growing dividend which we have increased by more than 285% since inception. Continued debt repayment, where we expect to pay down approximately $7 billion of maturities this year, and also provides capacity for continued business development to further augment our portfolio.\nIn closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results and our financial outlook remains very strong. We'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, first question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, the first question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nChris Schott\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat.\nThanks so much for the questions.\nJust looking for a little bit more color on the longer term immunology outlook. You're targeting $27 billion plus by 2027 and highlighting growth from there. I guess my question was just can you elaborate on how mature the existing indications these products are going to be by 2027 and what type of growth can we anticipate longer term?\nMaybe as part of that it.\nSeems like from the comments that the growth beyond 27 is more skewed towards RINVOQ given the new indications, but just getting a sense of like is it balanced RINVOQ and SKYRIZI or has it become more of a RINVOQ driven franchise in terms of the growth drivers over time? Thanks so much.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Chris, it's Jeff. Maybe I'll walk through a little bit of the process there and answer your question so we can see, historically, actuals and sort of fast forward in terms of the first thing we look at is the bio penetration of these big indications, and there still remains significant headroom in terms of the ability for moderate to severe patients with these diseases to continue to.\nBe exposed to these biologics and these advanced orals. Absolutely. And we can see for sure that psoriasis, still even in the US, is about 15%. It's relatively modest. Atopic dermatitis, the penetration rate is only about 7%. And then you have higher penetrated markets like IBD. And I'll talk about what's interesting about IBD that's somewhere in the 40% or 50% range across those. And then we can see clearly as these markets developed, and I've highlighted this before, that you see line of therapy expansion. So you know, first line becomes less and less important as you move towards second and third line over time. And right now IBD is a big story about that that we calculate into our long-term estimates because it's still largely, despite the severity, a frontline oriented market because physicians just kind of hang on to their frontline agents.\nThat's going to change quite dramatically, I believe, over this midterm. Even in the long term perspective, we have a good peg on the market growth rates. Many of these market growth rates are very significant, very stable, and will have good growth rates going into the next decade because of these dynamics around biopenetration and line of therapy expansion. I highlighted in my remarks around share. We have a very good competitive position, very high capture rates, and we're really in the sort of the low end of the range in terms of the total prescription share that will feed up and catch up to that pricing.\nI think we talked a little bit, we're not going to give detailed pricing but certainly you can see based on Scott's comments that, you know, the idea of a high single-digit CAGR on high single-digit pricing is not something we'd contemplated. So we believe that there's significant room for growth even past 27, especially as we'll have more RINVOQ indications coming that we've talked through. So we think that we're going to see robust growth based on our share capture and also how dynamic these markets are into the next decade.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nChris, this is Rob. I'll just add, you know, think about the markets. The rheum market is growing low single digits, atopic dermatitis is growing mid-teens, and IBD is growing high single digits. So these, they're very strong markets. They will continue to be strong markets for us. And we're also seeing, as Jeff mentioned, there's a lot of headroom in terms of share capture. So we do expect that robust growth to continue beyond 2027 into the early part of the next decade. I think your observation is correct given that we would expect up to five new indications for RINVOQ. If you look at the rate of growth RINVOQ versus SKYRIZI, I think it's reasonable to assume that RINVOQ would have a higher rate of growth given the new indications. But both will grow very nicely.\nSo I would certainly encourage you to look at more robust expectations for both therapies with RINVOQ a little bit higher because of the new indications.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nTerence Flynn\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two for me. Rick, I was just wondering if you could give us an update on succession planning and timing. We've been fielding that question from a number of investors recently. Given you're now past the HUMIRA LOE and position the company very well here given SKYRIZI and RINVOQ commercial and also some of the recent pipeline build out. And then the second question I have on a pipeline on Lutikizumab. I know you guys have highlighted this. Not a lot of focus from the investor side yet. Maybe you could just talk about the size of the commercial opportunity in HS and then why you're confident that that Phase II HS data will translate into success in the IBD side. Thank you.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nAll right, Terence, this is Rick. So I'll cover the first one. I guess what I would say is I have nothing new to report today. But what I'd indicate is we've talked about the criteria that we're going to use to make the decision when we're going to make this transition. That criteria is the same when we believe that we are comfortable. We've navigated the LOE and the rest of the business is performing at a high level. That's the point which we want to make the transition because we think that's the best time to be able to transition the CEO position. So I understand there's a lot of interest from investors here. That's logical and clear. Maybe what I can do is give you a little better perspective on the process that we're going to use.\nIn order to make the decision with the board, I would say the board's been actively involved for the last four or five years with a lot of emphasis around ensuring that our internal candidate would get the experiences that we thought were needed prior to making the transition. I can tell you from my perspective, that's gone extremely well. We have regularly scheduled board meetings several times a year where we specifically talk about succession and the progress that we're making at the point at which the business has achieved that criteria that I described before. At the next regularly scheduled board meeting, then I would make a recommendation to the board that this is the proper time to be able to make the transition. The board would vote on that recommendation. At the end of that vote, we would send out an announcement to investors.\nWhat you can expect when you get that announcement is that we would make an announcement that we were going to make the transition out at some point in the future. In all likelihood, four to six months in the future. The purpose of that is to make the final transition between myself and that person. That will take four or five months in order to be able to do that. I would say it's also very likely at that time, based on the discussions I've been having with the board, is that I will be named the Executive Chair for a period of time. The purpose of that will be to make the transition of the full position over a period of time.\nSo, I think it's a very well thought out, I think very well managed process, and I think that's what you can expect going forward.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nTerence, this is Jeff. I'll start off and have Roopal address the second part of your second part. So, you know, we established, you know, many years ago now this HS market with the approval of HUMIRA, and we thought it was a relatively small market and it turned out to be quite a surprise. There's a significant amount of patients around the world that suffer from HS. It's already a multi-billion-dollar category and we think it's going to continue to expand. I say that because we can see that, like IBD, there's just some new approvals just coming. So, everyone sort of holds on HUMIRA as long as they can if they're exposed to a biologic. And so we see the same dynamic as you start to see IL-17s come into the space.\nCertainly we're very excited about Lutikizumab because of the profile that we're seeing emerge.\nIn the clinic. It's a significant commercial opportunity. I would say that when we look back over all the HUMIRA indications over the last decade or more, HS was one of the most rapid indications that moved to a $1 billion-plus business. It's an exciting opportunity both commercially and certainly for patients. Roopal can address your comment on IBD?\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nYeah. Hi, Terence. You know, part of it starts, I would say, almost 15 years ago with our insights in Crohn's disease with HUMIRA. As Jeff was discussing where we started to see efficacy in patients that had HS, we saw a good amount of overlap between Crohn's and HS. So that's part of it. Now that doesn't really pan out for IL-17, but what we've observed with IL-1 beta in particular is that our internal data and external data do show elevated expression signals with IL-1 beta. So we think we have that opportunity with Lutikizumab because it also covers IL-1 beta. And we have two shots at this. Right. One is to go specifically and look at a biomarker driven targeted profile where we would be able to distinguish which patients actually have that higher expression.\nAnd the other approach, which we maybe weren't talking about years ago because we didn't have a product like SKYRIZI, which has high efficacy and very strong safety profile in Crohn's. What we have now is the opportunity to also look at in combination. So a biomarker approach and a combo approach are insights from HUMIRA and preclinical or.\nBiopsy-based insights that we have externally and internally.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Andrew Baum with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Baum\n\nHead of Global Healthcare and Managing Director of Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, many thanks.\nA couple of questions. One given in market access and managed markets. I'd be curious the extent of future contagion from HUMIRA IRA mediated price cuts on the Medicare book, spilling over onto the commercial book of business. How much of concern do you think this is given the payers are basically the same.\nAnd then second question on Lutikizumab, if.\nI remember from the Canakinumab trial, secondary to neutropenia, there was an increase in fatal infections. If you're laying this on top of another immunosuppressive, how are you thinking about the safety concerns in these IBD patients?\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi Andrew, thanks for your question. It's Jeff. We think that, particularly, the negotiation aspects of the IRA will be very contained on the Medicare side. As you can imagine, you know, with government programs over the years, when we have discussion with payers, you know, they'll often say things over, well, we know what the FSS price is for the VA or you know, the mandated discounts and supplemental discounts in the Medicaid channel. But we think those are really government actions and government rules. So we see that the market, we believe, will play out largely like it has with the other government channels, that it's a unique dynamic in terms of essentially a forced negotiation that we think will be contained largely in the Medicare space. That's how we view the world.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll talk about Lutikizumab and your question around neutrophils. Yeah, we do see an impact on neutrophils. It's dose driven. However, I think we think about inflammatory bowel disease, probably lupus, others to have a different tolerance for benefit risk. Because today in those disease states, despite the success that we've seen with SKYRIZI and RINVOQ, there's still substantial headroom to lead to more transformational efficacy. Not every patient is getting into remission, though, high levels, not every patient. So we still believe that a combo can get to that and break that efficacy threshold. The other opportunity there is, what we'll do with the combination is obviously optimize the dose to assure safety. And thus far in the HS trial, even at the highest dose, we've seen very little infections.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Andrew. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMohit Bansal\n\nManaging Director and Co-Head of Therapeutics Reasearch, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat.\nThank you very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I just want to go back to the ImmunoGen acquisition and the comments you made before. Can you talk a little bit about the plans to move?\nELAHERE into early lines of ovarian cancer?\nYou talked about maintenance setting, but more.\nWe are reading it.\nI mean, in first line maintenance the PFS and OS tends to be really long.\nCould you talk a little bit about the strategy there and how do?\nYou overcome the existing OS benefit that these drugs provide?\nThank you.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nHi Mohit, it's Roopal. I'll take that. So I think as you've seen in resistance, we've seen the overall survival benefit, a very substantial one, unprecedented thus far and to your point, the plan is to move into earlier lines of therapy. Secondly, it's also.\nPart of the strategy to move into sensitive populations, which is around 55% of the population. Resistance is around 45%. And then the third aspect is we've seen encouraging data in medium expressors of FR Alpha, and those are approximately 30% of the patients. High is around 35%. So those are the three strategies to go forward. Now how do we get into earlier lines of therapy? Well, a couple things insights that we've seen. One is we've seen ELAHERE been able to combine at full dose with carboplatin. So that's encouraging. That gives you an opportunity to up front combine and then as you stated maintain on ELAHERE or with ELAHERE plus Bev. So the other approaches that we would do getting the earlier line of maintenance is have that upfront therapy and then we see patients that go on to Bev.\nWe can combine with BEV at that time point, and we'll be looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors, which is about the other half of the patient populations, which are HRD deficient. So, taken all together, we see there's an opportunity. Now the PFS is going to be a little bit longer along with OS. So that is something that we're planning for. We'll start these studies as soon as possible, but they will read out in the later part of the decade and into 2030.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Mohit. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHi, this is Dan Crouzet on for Vamil. Thanks for taking my question. So my question's on HUMIRA. I was curious given the recent performance of companies has had with the erosion since the introduction of biosimilars. I was wondering if you can now provide maybe a better sense around the company's expectations on HUMIRA's longer term tail revenues in both the US and ex US markets. Thank you.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nHi, it's Rob. I'll take that question. So we do expect that in the US the tail will start to emerge in the 2025 or 2026 timeframe. Keep in mind 2024 is the first full year for US biosimilars. We'll have to see what happens with volume uptake this year and also where interchangeability lands and ultimately what does contracting look like next year. So I wouldn't expect us to quantify the tail this year, but it's certainly possible something we would do either in 2025 or 2026 as it relates to international. You're seeing I think this year a step down of about $400 million.\nHalf of that is really the last wave of markets like Canada, Puerto Rico. We're seeing, I'd say, some incremental erosion we would expect this year. And then the other half would be your typical international price erosion you see across therapeutic areas. So not really specific to biosimilars. And then.\nThe other quarter of it would be what we're seeing is just the strength of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. As these newer agents elevate standard of care, you see some share go to those newer agents. And so probably the best way to think about international would be if you want to adjust for half of the erosion this year as being more of the final waves and then you get a sense of what could potentially be the ongoing beyond that. But we'll be more specific. I think we need to see really how the US plays out with this being the first full year for biosimilars before we can really give you more color. But we're very, very pleased with the progress we've made so far.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Dan. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nCarter Gould\n\nSenior Research Analyst and US Biopharma Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Two on the neuroscience portfolio. I guess first on 951, how should we think about that? Is that more sort of around growing the overall pie of device-aided therapies versus taking share from apomorphine and gels? And then maybe looking a little bit longer term, AbbVie has sort of three Phase II Alzheimer's studies that are going to read out later this year, by early next year, fully acknowledging the commercial challenges by the players in the market today and that some of these targets are now validated. How should investors think about.\nThese assets, either individually or collectively, and your level of excitement? Thank you.\n\nJeff Stewart\n\nEVP and Chief Commercial Officer, AbbVie\n\nYeah, hi, it's Jeff. I'll take the first question. So what we look at when we see this market at a macro level, you have a significant number of patients, 85% of patients are just on these oral medications, so oral Sinemet. And they essentially need to consume more and more and more orals. And sometimes at the end of it, they're taking 12 pills a day. Very, very difficult to manage. But then they're faced with a very difficult decision which we kind of call like a surgical barrier. And that surgical barrier is to get any sort of more advanced relief. You either have to think about deep brain stimulation, which is a brain surgery, or our own Duopa, which is a GI surgery.\nSo the way we see this market developing is we see that 951 starts to establish a very nice transition zone because you don't have. It's a sub Q. So a new market segment that starts to emerge before.\nBigger interventions like DBS or Duopa and obviously the ability to basically move quicker to more relief from these chronic oral basically over treatment. So that's how we see it. And as Roopal highlighted, we're seeing some very nice uptake in Japan, where we launched late last year, and also in Germany in some of the first European launches. So that's how the market is exactly playing out. We're establishing essentially a new high efficacy category here with 24 hours of ongoing relief. You can do super specific dosing, titration, and the pump is much smaller. And again, it's a sub Q injection that you move around every three days. So it's a nice opportunity for the company.\n\nRoopal Thakkar\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Global Therapeutics, AbbVie\n\nMaybe I'll talk about the other assets that you mentioned in Alzheimer's first, 916, that's our A beta antibody. What we like about that one thus far is that the profile we've seen is a long half-life, which would be good to space out dosing, potentially higher potency, if that holds. And we see robust reductions in beta amyloid that could allow for subcutaneous dosing that's spaced apart. And the other thing we're looking at is potentially lower ARIA. So if we see those three things over the course, I would say end of this year, early next year, I think that that would be quite exciting because it would be a differentiated profile, again, a better convenience and potentially better benefit-risk profile. So that's 916, 552 is our SV2A, that's.\nOur oral medication in cognition that's currently in Phase II. We anticipate readout at the end of this year, early next year. Now that one is being studied in a setting where a patient can be on a therapy already like an Aricept or on nothing. We would use the typical ADAS-Cog assessments along with a variety of others, including other neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression. So that's another nice one that could combine with a variety of different assets in Alzheimer's. The third one I'll mention is around Imraclidine, which comes from Cerevel. They are at early stages right now in elderly patients. The goal there would be an Alzheimer's disease psychosis.\nOf the 6 million or so diagnoses, I would say around 40% of these patients present with symptoms of psychosis, so with all the therapies that are in the clinic, we think we have a very nice complementary suite of options that could address numerous symptoms of Alzheimer's because it won't be just one therapy that's going to solve this, but more to come end of this year and into next year.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Carter. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from.\nYour line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThanks for the question. Just on the reaffirmed long-term guide, can I clarify if the Cerevel and ImmunoGen deals are in this 2029 guide given you included them in the 2024 guide and you upped SKYRIZI and RINVOQ by $6 billion, migraine by $1 billion? If these are the pushes, what are the pulls in reaffirming that long-term guidance?\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nThis is Rob. I'll take that question. Yes, we did include ImmunoGen and Cerevel in our long-term guide. The thing to keep in mind is, you know, high single digits. When you think about the range that could represent, you know, that's around $10 billion, you know, between the low end of the high single digits and the high end of the high single digits. And so there aren't any pulls. What we've updated as we walked you through it is we've increased the oral CGRP peak revenue, we've increased SKYRIZI, RINVOQ, and we've reaffirmed the other. So there's nothing that we took down. But just keep in mind that you've got a pretty wide range. If you look at street consensus, we're encouraged that it continues to move up. It has moved up over the course of the last quarter, about $3 billion in 2029.\nIt's nice to see that upward movement, but it's still below what we expect. If you think that growth rate for the street is just under 5%, we expect high single digits. So even with this update, as well as ImmunoGen and Cerevel, we're still high single digits. But keep in mind it's a pretty wide range, and it would be regardless, industry-leading growth. We're set up very well to continue delivering a very strong growth, and we're setting ourselves very well to grow very nicely in the next decade as well.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Trung. Operator. Next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGary Nachman\n\nSenior Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThanks and good morning.\nFirst, on aesthetics, could you talk?\nbit more on why you're confident in what seems to be a pretty decent return to growth in 2024. So how much of a headwind could China be offsetting the US growth? And what are other regions? Will you be getting some sort of a lift this year? Just talk about the dynamics on that front.\nOh, and then secondly, just as you return to more robust revenue growth in 2025, what are reasonable expectations for operating margins directionally in 2025? Can that expand at all or is it more likely to be depressed from the ImmunoGen and Cerevel deals? Just give us some directional way to think about that for next year. Thank you.\n\nCarrie Strom\n\nSenior Vice President and President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie\n\nHi, this is Carrie. I'll take your first question on aesthetics and the aesthetics market recovery. So I'll start with the US, and we have started to see the US toxin market recover at the end of 2023. We expect that recovery to continue, and for the market growth for toxins to continue to improve in 2024. For fillers in the US in Q4, after multiple quarters of decline, the filler market in the US was somewhat flat. And so that dynamic of the filler market recovery lagging the toxin market recovery is playing out. And we do expect that recovery on fillers to also continue to a lesser degree than toxins, more of a modest growth, positive growth for 2024. And as we look at the beginning of the year here in 2024, we are seeing our patient demand metrics and Google metrics really supporting our expectations here.\nIn terms of China, we do expect the economic headwinds that we saw beginning mid-year 2023 to continue in the near term with China, and we expect the China aesthetics market to be flat overall in 2024. That would look like negative market in the first half of the year until the China market starts to recover in the second half of 2024. We expect that China performance to be balanced against expectations for strong performance in other international regions including Japan, which has become an important market for aesthetics, and areas of Latin America like Brazil, which is a highly aesthetically oriented market.\nIt's also important to note, in terms of Q1 2024 in terms of our guidance there, that the growth in the US will be offset by that international decline, specifically in China. So not only the China economic headwinds but also a difficult year-over-year comp increase in Q1, because recall in Q1 2023 there was the post-pandemic reopening in China. So that's really how we see the market growth factors in the US, China, and other parts of the world playing out in 2024.\n\nRob Michael\n\nPresident and COO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Rob to build on the aesthetic story. I've said in the past to get to our guidance of greater than $9 billion, we need to deliver annual growth of high single digits on average. And as Carrie just walked you through, we haven't quite seen the recovery for the fillers market yet this year and we will, but it's not going to be a normal year. We'll see a ramping and we also have a slowdown in China. But despite that we're still delivering high single digit growth. And given how underpenetrated these markets are, we can drive that market growth that's required to achieve the long-term guidance. And then on top of that we have several innovations that will further support that growth.\nI've said this before, but the masseter and platysma indications for Botox will add a few hundred million dollars each. Our novel short acting toxin Bonti has the potential to activate new patients who have not started toxin due to fear of an unnatural look. So that could drive an inflection in market growth and market share. And then our regenerative fillers pipeline is really aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. So we have several avenues to get to our greater than $9 billion guide. I have seen consensus estimates at $8 billion for 2029, but we're very confident in our guidance of greater than $9 billion by that period.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nGary, this is Scott. I'll take your question regarding operating margin expansion. So for 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've guided to 46.5%. When we do return to robust growth in 2025, we do see that operating margin will expand and will continue expand as we grow through the decade. I think that when we think about the pace of that expansion, it will be relatively steady over several years. I would though, if you're modeling that, I would kind of peak it out at around 50%. I think that's what will hit a peak at the operating margin. But we do see expansion both in 2025 on that return to robust growth, including the impact of the two transactions, ImmunoGen and Cerevel, which should presumably be a full year at that point time. But at a full year impact, we see that expansion.\nI do think it's worth noting, even at our current levels, we have industry-leading operating margin, and certainly with the future expansion, we'll continue to have that and only grow that position.\n\nLiz Shea\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations, AbbVie\n\nThanks, Gary. Operator, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Scala\n\nPharmaceutical Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you very much. Two questions. Is the current tax rate fully reflecting likely tax changes in the US and outside the US so it represents the high water mark for the foreseeable future? Previously the company spoke to a 16% tax rate and we're pretty much there. So I'm wondering if the increases are kind of behind us. And then Rick, a slightly different kind of question, but there are clear obvious reasons such as the success of SKYRIZI and RINVOQ. But I'm curious if you would share with us a few of the externally less visible factors that are leading to AbbVie's success traversing the HUMIRA patent expiration that your pharma peers missed when dealing with their own pressures. I would assume contracting, formulary, management, and allocation of overhead are all part of it. But what would you be willing to share with us? Thank you.\n\nScott Reents\n\nEVP and CFO, AbbVie\n\nSteve.\nThis is Scott. I'll start with your tax rate question. So with respect to the tax rate, we are essentially flat from between this year and last year at 15.7%. We do see that tax rate over the three year period, including this year, increasing about 1% on average. Now that's not going to be 1% per year. What you'll see is a step up in a couple of years when the US tax rates do increase, the GILTI rate in particular will increase. So we see that over a three year period, about 1% per year on average. That does include all the impacts of a number of things going on globally with the OECD, and some of these OECD minimum taxes, and other things.\nI would say the one thing it does not include. You saw just this week the House passed a tax bill that includes a provision regarding the R&D expensing. So if that bill were to pass as it's written, we would see a slight step down in our tax rate about 80 basis points from the impact of that on an ongoing basis.\n\nRick Gonzalez\n\nChairman and CEO, AbbVie\n\nSteve, this is Rick. I think if you step back and you look over the last, I'd say 10 years, we were trying to develop a strategy that we fundamentally believe would allow us to be able to offset the HUMIRA LOE and continue to deliver top-tier financial performance as we have for the past 10 years. That was the whole objective, and we knew we had to build a very diversified growth platform in order to be able to do that, to be able to absorb that impact and return to growth as rapidly as possible. And so we, as an executive team, focused a lot of energy around how do we do that, how do we build it, how do we do it in the right markets?\nYou know, I think AbbVie, I'm obviously biased, I guess, but I would say our commercial execution has always been exceptional, in my opinion. We understand the markets we're in extremely well. We understand the competitive environment that we compete in those markets extremely well. We understand.\nThe patient journey and how that patient journey is affected by.\nAccess to medicines to ensure that patients can get their medicines routinely and be able to get the benefit of those medicines. It takes all of those things, I think, to end up with the kind of success that we see with assets like SKYRIZI, RINVOQ. But it also takes, I think, a company that is very good at what I describe as read and react. There are always challenges in businesses as big and as complex as this. I think the difference between companies that can continue to perform at the top tier year in and year out is they're good at seeing issues and then quickly reacting to how they're going to either offset those or deal with those. We had many of those examples. I'd say the label change on RINVOQ was a great example, but look at where RINVOQ is growing now.\nDespite that label change, many would not have predicted that migraine was a very challenging market for a period of time. Look at how we've operated with UBRELVY and QULIPTA and the kind of success we've seen against the competitors in those markets.\nNeuroscience, very different kind of market with VRAYLAR, that's all about trying to grow market share and expand your position there with a very good asset. And so we're good at that. And I think that is the real differentiator. The other thing I'd say is I think we have been very efficient at our R&D investment. We obviously don't have the largest R&D investment in the industry, but we produce a tremendous amount of return against that R&D investment. Now, having said that, as we go forward, we know we need to increase R&D.\nAs I said in my comments, we did a fairly significant increase last year despite dealing with the HUMIRA LOE, and we're going to do another fairly significant increase this year because we have some assets that have very, very significant opportunities, like 383 and like 400, and several others that are going to require large Phase III more."

Welcome to the AbbVie Q4 2023 earnings conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of this call. You may ask a question by pressing star one on your phone. I would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nGood morning and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer, Scott Reents, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan Aesthetics, and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer. Before we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\n\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. AbVie continues to perform exceptionally well. We once again delivered an excellent quarter with results ahead of our expectations. We are now several quarters into the US biosimilar event for Humira and continue to effectively manage erosion. We've been able to maintain significant volume with the majority of the impact to date driven by lower price. Importantly, our growth platform, the base business excluding Humira, which includes a well-diversified portfolio with multiple leading products in highly attractive markets across immunology, neuroscience, oncology, and aesthetics, continues to demonstrate robust performance and outperform expectations. This platform, which is the critical driver in our return to rapid growth in 2025 and beyond, delivered strong double-digit revenue growth this quarter, a considerable acceleration from the first half of this year.\n\nWe anticipate this platform, which is led by Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Vraylar, and Botox, will continue to drive significant revenue growth going forward. At the same time, we have several promising R&D programs with the potential to contribute meaningfully in the latter part of this decade and into the 2030s. This includes next-generation approaches in immunology, a focus on bispecifics, ADCs, and novel IO in oncology, as well as innovative therapies to potentially treat a range of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. In summary, I'm extremely pleased with the continued strong momentum and execution across our business. The growth platform is substantially outperforming our expectations, giving us the confidence to once again raise our financial outlook, including upgraded guidance for full-year earnings, which Rob will share momentarily.\n\nIn further underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend, which we have grown by more than 285% since our inception. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?\n\nThank you, Rick. Our results once again demonstrate the strength of our broad portfolio and support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance. The performance of our ex-Humira growth platform continues to be very strong, with revenue growth above 12% this quarter, including more than 50% growth from both Skyrizi and Rinvoq, our best-in-category immunology medicines. We continue to anticipate that these two products will collectively exceed Humira peak revenues by 2027, with robust growth expected into the next decade. Neuroscience also delivered strong performance, with operational sales growth of more than 20% this quarter, driven by our leading portfolio for migraine and psychiatric conditions. And lastly, aesthetics performance was highlighted by the return to growth of the US toxin market.\n\nThis outstanding execution across our well-diversified portfolio gives us the confidence to once again raise our near-term financial outlook. We are increasing our full-year revenue guidance by $600 million and have now raised total revenue by $2 billion since our initial guidance in February, including more than $1.4 billion from our ex-Humira growth platform. As a result, we are also raising our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted EPS between $11.19 and 11.23. Given the strong momentum of our growth platform, which is significantly outperforming our expectations this year, we are now raising the floor guidance for 2024 adjusted EPS to $11, which is $0.30 better than our previous expectations. This floor guidance continues to exclude any impact from IPR&D expense. As is our typical practice, we'll provide our formal EPS guidance range for 2024 on the Q4 call.\n\nFinally, today we are announcing a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.48 to $1.55, beginning with a dividend payable in February 2024. Since inception, we have grown our quarterly dividend by more than 285%. In summary, I'm very pleased with the strong execution across our portfolio. We remain confident in our long-term outlook, including a return to robust revenue growth in 2025 with a high single-digit CAGR to the end of the decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff? Thank you, Rob. We once again delivered strong results across our therapeutic portfolio this quarter. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of nearly $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi and Rinvoq continue to demonstrate impressive growth and are now on pace to deliver approximately $11.6 billion in combined sales this year.\n\nThis performance is especially encouraging, recognizing that we are still in the early launch phase for both assets in IBD, an area of high unmet need where we are very competitively positioned with two complementary assets, each having generated strong response rates and durable remission across our development programs. Skyrizi total sales were $2.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 50%. This robust performance includes further share gains in psoriasis, where we remain the clear market leader, capturing roughly 1/3 of the total prescriptions in the US biologic market and approximately 50% of in-play patients who are either new to therapy or switching. Increasing momentum in psoriatic arthritis, where Skyrizi is now the leading in-play biologic therapy in the US dermatology segment, as well as continued rapid uptake in Crohn's disease, where we are capturing roughly 1/4 of in-play patients.\n\nImportantly, we recently announced positive results from Sequence, the ninth and perhaps the most impactful head-to-head study across our development program for Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Sequence is a phase 3 head-to-head study in Crohn's, which demonstrated Skyrizi's superiority versus Stelara across key efficacy parameters, including impressive statistically significant differences in both clinical and endoscopic remission. The detailed data from this trial were presented earlier this month, and we plan to share the findings more broadly now via our medical personnel and representatives in the field. We anticipate these strong head-to-head results will clearly support Skyrizi as the best-in-category therapy for Crohn's, which is important for continued rapid share capture. So based on this very positive data, as well as our continued momentum, we will be once again raising the full-year sales outlook for Skyrizi.\n\nMoving now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $1.1 billion, reflecting operational growth of nearly 60% with increasing prescriptions across each of the approved indications. In particular, I'm very excited about Rinvoq's growth potential in gastroenterology, where uptake is exceeding our expectations. In ulcerative colitis, Rinvoq is now capturing more than 25% total in-play patient share in the US second-line plus setting, nearly at parity to the current market-leading therapy. In Crohn's disease, Rinvoq is ramping very significantly. The inflection we are seeing is even faster when compared to our timeline launch in UC just last year. Given this impressive momentum in IBD, we will now be raising our full-year sales outlook for Rinvoq. Global Humira sales were more than $3.5 billion, down 36.2% due to biosimilar competition. The erosion impact in the US.\n\nplayed out largely in line with our expectations this quarter, while performance across our international markets is trending better than expected. Turning now to oncology, where total revenues were $1.5 billion. In Imbruvica, global revenues were $908 million, down 20% and consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $590 million, up 14% on an operational basis, with strong demand for both CLL and AML across our key countries. The US launch of Epkinli in third-line plus DLBCL is also tracking well, with commercialization also now underway in Europe and Japan following the recent respective approvals. In neuroscience, total revenues were more than $2 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. Vraylar continues to demonstrate robust growth.\n\nGlobal sales of $751 million were up 35.4%, and we have seen a significant uplift in new prescriptions across all indications following the approval as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder late last year. Our leading oral CGRP portfolio for migraine contributed $365 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of nearly 65% as we continue to see strong demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. Atogepant was also recently approved as a new therapy in Europe, branded as Aquipta, where it is the only once-daily oral CGRP for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine, further strengthening our competitive product profile and long-term growth opportunity. Lastly, total Botox Therapeutic global sales were $748 million, up 7.4% on an operational basis, reflecting momentum in chronic migraine, as well as other approved indications.\n\nSo overall, I'm extremely pleased with commercial execution across the therapeutic portfolio, especially with our growth platform, which is demonstrating strong revenue growth. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nThank you, Jeff. Q3 global aesthetic sales were approximately $1.2 billion, an operational decline of 4%. In the US, aesthetic sales of $759 million were roughly flat to last year, as growth for Botox Cosmetic was offset by declines in other brands that continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures. US Botox Cosmetic sales were $388 million, an increase of 5%. We are beginning to see a recovery in the US toxin market, which posted positive year-over-year growth in the Q3 following three consecutive quarters of declines due to economic pressures. Botox continues to perform very well despite increasing competition. It remains the clear market leader with a strong and stable share, and we have seen little to no share impact from new competitive entrants. US\n\nJuvederm sales were $116 million in Q3, a decline of 6.4% versus prior year, as recovery in the facial filler market continues to lag the cosmetic toxin market. The filler market is improving, however. As a higher-priced, more deferrable procedure relative to toxins, this segment of the aesthetics market continues to be suppressed by lower consumer spending. In Q3, the US facial filler market was down low teens % compared to the prior year. Juvederm remains the market-leading facial filler in the US, and share was stable in the quarter. While the US facial injectable markets continue to be impacted by lower consumer spending in this inflationary environment, we are seeing signs of stabilization and even a return to growth in the cosmetic toxin segment. This gives us confidence in a stable to improving outlook in the US as we end this year and enter 2024.\n\nInternationally, Q3 aesthetic sales were $480 million, representing an operational decline of 9.7%. As anticipated, year-over-year performance in the quarter was impacted by a shipment timing benefit we experienced in Q3 of last year. Results were also impacted by softening economic conditions across major international aesthetic markets, primarily China. Despite the economic pressures that are currently impacting our aesthetics portfolio, we remain very confident in its long-term growth outlook. In September, we began launching SkinVive in the US, and in the next few years, we plan to launch new indications for Botox in the lower face segment and our novel fast-onset, short-duration toxin, BoNT/E. In addition to our R&D programs, we have a robust ALI technology pipeline, which will bring new tech products into the US market to help our customers acquire, retain, and cross-sell more aesthetics patients.\n\nOur strong leadership positions in both cosmetic toxins and facial fillers, combined with the significant investments we're making to drive market acceleration, will position us for strong growth going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThank you, Carrie. In immunology, we had two important milestones in Q3 for Skyrizi in inflammatory bowel disease. Following completion of the phase 3 maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis, we submitted our regulatory applications for Skyrizi in this indication in the US and Europe, with approvals anticipated in 2024. We also recently presented results from the Sequence head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Stelara in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. We're extremely pleased with how Skyrizi performed in this study, which enrolled very difficult-to-treat patients who all failed anti-TNF therapy. Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial, demonstrating clear superiority to Stelara on all endpoints at week 48, with a more than doubling of effect in endoscopic remission at 32% of Skyrizi versus 16% for Stelara, and endoscopic response at 45% versus 22% for Stelara.\n\nFurthermore, steroid-free clinical remission was 61% for Skyrizi versus 40% for Stelara. So these compelling head-to-head Crohn's data, combined with the additional indication approval for ulcerative colitis expected next year, will further position Skyrizi as a highly effective, durable, safe, and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease. We continue to make very good progress with the second wave of Rinvoq development programs as well. In addition to the ongoing phase 3 programs in GCA, lupus, and HS, we recently began the phase 3 program for Rinvoq in alopecia areata. We also recently announced positive top-line results from a phase 2 study for Rinvoq in vitiligo. In this study, Rinvoq met the primary and all secondary endpoints at week 24, demonstrating a significant improvement in both facial and total body vitiligo scoring measures compared to placebo.\n\nImportantly, these results continued to improve through week 52 of the study, illustrating Rinvoq's potential to provide significant skin repigmentation to patients suffering from vitiligo. Based on these results, we're advancing Rinvoq to phase 3 in this indication, with studies expected to begin soon. Moving to oncology, where in the quarter we received approval in Europe and Japan for epcoritamab as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who have received two or more systemic therapies. These approvals represent important regulatory milestones for epcoritamab, and we look forward to bringing this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients in these international markets. We also continue to make good progress with the development programs in earlier lines of DLBCL and follicular lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature.\n\nIn our Venclexta multiple myeloma program, we recently announced top-line results for the phase 3 CANOVA trial evaluating Venclexta plus dexamethasone compared to pomalidomide in relapsed refractory patients with a t(11;14) mutation. In the study, the primary endpoint of IRC-assessed PFS was longer with Venclexta versus pomalidomide, but did not meet statistical significance. The Venclexta combination also resulted in numerically higher response rates and longer overall survival compared to pomalidomide. While the differences in efficacy measures were not statistically significant, we believe the totality of the data shows a benefit with the Venclexta combination, and we plan to discuss the results with regulatory agencies. We'll provide updates on the program as they become available. Beyond Venclexta, we have several exciting multiple myeloma programs emerging from our earlier stage pipeline.\n\nWe continue to make good progress with our BCMA CD3 bispecific ABV-383, where we're nearing completion of the dose optimization work and are on track to begin Phase 3 studies in the first half of next year. At an upcoming medical meeting, we plan to present updated Phase 1 efficacy and safety results, as well as monthly administration dose data. We're also making good progress with our next generation BCL-2 inhibitor ABV-453, which is currently in Phase 1 studies, and we'll provide updates as the data become available. Now moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter we received approval for Aquipta in Europe, which is now the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently announced top-line results from a second Phase 3 study evaluating Botox in platysma prominence.\n\nSimilar to results from the first phase 3 study, all primary and secondary endpoints were met, with Botox demonstrating a significant reduction in platysma prominence and vertical neck bands. We anticipate a regulatory submission in the US near the end of the year. In addition to indication expansion for Botox, we continue to advance our novel toxin pipeline. We recently announced positive top-line results from two phase 3 trials evaluating BoNT/E, our rapid-onset, short-acting novel toxin in glabellar lines. BoNT/E performed very well in both studies, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints compared to placebo. BoNT/E was well tolerated, and no safety concerns were identified. We're very pleased with these results, which demonstrate this toxin's rapid onset of action and short duration of effect.\n\nPatients treated with BoNT/E showed an improvement in glabellar lines as early as eight hours following injection and a duration of effect of two to three weeks. This highly differentiated clinical profile could offer patients a novel option compared to currently available neurotoxins. We plan to complete the remaining development work over the course of the next few quarters and anticipate submitting our regulatory applications in the second half of next year. So in summary, we continue to make good progress across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to several more important milestones in the remainder of this year, including phase two data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support an accelerated approval. Phase two proof of concept data for our anti-IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody lutikizumab in hidradenitis suppurativa.\n\nRegulatory approval in Europe for ABV-951, our novel subcutaneous levodopa/carbidopa delivery system for advanced Parkinson's disease. We also plan to submit updated 951 data in the US near the end of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nThank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the momentum of our business. The strong performance we are demonstrating from our immunology Growth platform continues to support AbbVie's long-term growth outlook. Starting with our Q3 results, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.95, which is $0.14 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.04 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $13.9 billion, roughly $225 million ahead of our guidance, and down 5.8% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.2% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Importantly, these results reflect double-digit sales growth from our immunology Growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 46.7% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 83.5% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.4% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 0.5% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.9% of sales.\n\nNet interest expense was $398 million. The adjusted tax rate was 15.7%. Turning to our financial outlook, we are raising the midpoint of our full-year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.25 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $11.19 and $11.23. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the fourth quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $54 billion, an increase of $600 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.5% unfavorable impact on full-year sales growth. The updated revenue forecast contemplates a full-year sales increase of $300 million, roughly split evenly between Skyrizi and Rinvoq, reflecting strong uptake in IBD. The remaining $300 million full-year sales increase is primarily attributed to better-than-expected performance of international Humira and Restasis.\n\nMoving to the P&L, we continue to forecast an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales. We now expect adjusted net interest expense of roughly $1.7 billion. We forecast our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 15.5%, reflecting IPR&D occurred through the third quarter. Turning to the fourth quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $14 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.87 and $2.91. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter. Finally, AbbVie's strong business performance continues to support our capital allocation priorities. We generated more than $16.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow, which is net of approximately $1.1 billion of Skyrizi royalty payments in the first nine months of the year.\n\nOur cash balance at the end of September was approximately $13.3 billion. Underscoring our confidence in AbbVie's long-term outlook, today we announced a 4.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with a dividend payment in February 2024. We remain on track to achieve, by the end of this year, $34 billion of cumulative debt paydown since the Allergan transaction, maintaining a net leverage ratio around 1.8 times. In closing, AbbVie has once again delivered outstanding results, and our financial outlook remains very strong. With that, I'll turn the call over to Liz.\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one or two. Operator, we'll take the first question, please.\n\nYes. Our first question comes from Chris Shibutani with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nThank you very much. Good morning. The 2024 earnings guidance, it seemed as if you were quite confident heading in that $11 floor. As we await further details from top-line and other margin structures, can you maybe identify some of the key push pulls that actually gave you that conviction to go to $11 and where directionally we should be thinking about the source of further growth on the forward? Thank you.\n\nHi, Chris. It's Rob. I'll take that question. So since we provided that guidance in February, recall we gave the $10.70 EPS floor to really help investors model earnings regardless of whether the trough occurred in 2023 or 2024. We've raised growth platform sales by $1.4 billion covering immunology, neuroscience, and aesthetics. We're seeing the IBD indications for Skyrizi and Rinvoq ramp very nicely, and we continue to capture more share in their other indications. Both Vraylar and our migraine portfolio have outperformed our share forecast, and the strong recovery of Botox has led us to raise guidance for aesthetics twice this year. So given the clear overperformance of the growth platform, we decided to raise the floor to $11 ex IPR&D.\n\nWe hope this provides investors with a view of the low end of the 2024 guidance range and also confirms that 2024 will indeed be the trough year. Given that we expect to deliver a high single-digit CAGR from 2024 to the end of the decade, it should allow investors to value the company with a better growth multiple.\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Mohit Bansal with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have a question regarding aesthetics. So it seems like you are keeping the guidance here. So the first part of the question is, it seems like across the board there is a 10% quarter-over-quarter decline on all the products. Can you help us understand what's happening sequentially? And then if you are keeping the guidance, it seems like there would be quite a bump in Q4. So how should we think about that?\n\nMaybe I'll start. This is Rob. I'll start with your question. So one thing to keep in mind is that we mentioned in the last call that we had some dynamics in the international market when you look at the growth rates where we had more difficult comparison because of some of the stocking that occurred in the prior year. So that's something to keep in mind. We also do have a certain amount of seasonality that occurs in our business in the US in particular. So those are things to keep in mind. I'd say as we look at it, we're very encouraged by the return to growth of the US toxin market. Botox is performing very well, and we're certainly doing a very nice job maintaining our share position despite competitive pressure. So I'd say we're very pleased there.\n\nI'd say on fillers, what we're seeing is probably more of a lag in the recovery. We've studied this market historically. We do tend to see a lag, and that's really relative to, if you think about, the price point for fillers versus toxins. It's natural to assume that the recovery will take a little bit longer. So we are seeing that recovery take a little bit longer. We're still very, very encouraged by the trends we're seeing. We're very excited about the new fillers we've launched, both SkinVive and Volux. We're starting to see some nice share momentum come from those new introductions. So from that standpoint, we feel very good.\n\nThen as we've been monitoring the situation in China, as all of you, I'm sure, have been watching very carefully, we saw, as you recall, a very strong recovery in the first half of the year. We've seen it moderate, and we're keeping a close eye on that. That's something we're obviously paying a lot of attention to. Now we look at the rest of the international business. It's growing nicely. As I think about the guidance for this year, I'd say we're fairly close. I'm not overly concerned. We don't adjust guidance for ±$100 million. If it was greater than that, we would consider it. That's something to keep in mind. But as we look at the long-term outlook for this business, we're very confident. If you think about the US.\n\nneurotoxins market, it's historically grown in the mid-teens, and it's still heavily underpenetrated in the low single digits. Market growth is really the key to deliver on our long-term outlook. We've seen this market rebound very strongly following a period of economic pressure, and we've demonstrated time and again that we can increase new patient starts through our promotional efforts. Something I think probably isn't appreciated is that we do have several innovations that can accelerate that growth. I mean, you think about the masseter and platysma indications for Botox. Those can each add a few hundred million dollars. Our novel short-acting toxin, BoNT/E, has the potential to activate new patients. That could really drive an inflection in market growth. As you think about one of the biggest barriers for new patients, it is fear of an unnatural look.\n\nThe short-acting toxin opportunity is a great way to unlock that. Then if you look at our regenerative fillers pipeline, those are aimed at providing both short- and long-term treatment benefits for consumers. As I mentioned, we're also very excited about the new fillers we launched, both SkinVive and Volux. With this business, you see us go through some cycles with economic pressure, but over the long term, we feel very confident that we can certainly deliver very robust growth and deliver on that greater than $9 billion expectation for 2029.\n\nMohit, this is Rick. The other thing, if you're looking at it sequentially, you have to keep in mind is we do Botox Therapeutic in the Q4. So that elevates revenue in the Q4, and that occurs every year. So if you're looking at Q3 to Q4 and trying to understand why is there a big step up, part of that step up is that.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Mohit. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Chris Schott with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. Just maybe a two-parter really focused on immunology for 2024. So maybe first on Skyrizi and Rinvoq, I guess with more of the 2024 formulary discussions complete, we're seeing some great volume trends. But are you still comfortable that we should expect more normalized price erosion for those two products versus the high single digits we're seeing this year? And then the second one was on Humira for 2024. I think, Rob, you might have commented last quarter on your comfort with where consensus sits. And again, maybe similar question with maybe more color about formulary for next year. Is that something you're still comfortable? And just how should we think about dynamics there? Thank you.\n\nYeah. Thank you, Chris and Shea. I'll take the first question. Yeah, we're very comfortable as we see things start to evolve and close here as we move into 2024. I mean, if you think about all the indications that we've had, seven over the last 18 months. I highlighted in my remarks nine head-to-head trials. We're just in a very, very nice position for Skyrizi and Rinvoq as we move into 2024 to continue some very strong momentum that we're seeing in the actual. So quite confident in terms of how we're looking at that. And to your key point there on the price, we continue to see that we're not going to have a repeat of what we saw this year. And remember the background there were those seven indications that came very fast, all on top of each other.\n\nAnd so that was the root cause of those concessions that won't repeat. Next year, we have really one more big indication, not seven, and that's Skyrizi UC that Tom highlighted. So we'll see the normalized price erosion more in line with industry norms versus what we saw this year.\n\nAnd then, Chris, this is Rob on Humira. I think if you think about the annualization rebates that, given the rebates that increased in the second half of this year, so you have an annualization impact and the additional rebates to secure preferred access next year, really price should be the main driver of the erosion in 2024. I mean, volume will have an impact, particularly in WAC-sensitive accounts, but price will make up the vast majority of the erosion next year. And while we're not giving 2024 guidance today, as you've mentioned, Chris, I've highlighted the average. It was about $7 billion when I mentioned that, was a reasonable expectation for US Humira next year. Now, there are a few analysts who have forecasted US Humira above $8 billion next year, which is just not a reasonable expectation given the price dynamic.\n\nThanks, Chris. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for taking the question. Obviously, you guys are very well positioned coming out of the Humira LOE in terms of the growth franchise, but I think there's also a focus from investors on maybe bolstering the pipeline. So as you guys think about M&A and business development, maybe you could just walk us through your latest thoughts and anything in terms of therapeutic areas of interest and stage of development. Thank you.\n\nOkay. Terence, this is Rick. I'll cover that question for you. Yeah, I think as we look at the business, as Rob indicated, we're extremely comfortable with how the growth platform is performing, and I'd say how we're managing the biosimilar erosion, which gives us a lot of confidence that we can deliver this high single digit going forward from 2025 going forward through the end of the decade. So I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at, and we're in a fortunate position from that standpoint. There are many companies in our sector who need to go out and do lots of BD to be able to drive the growth that they're trying to achieve. We're not in that position.\n\nSo I'd say the bulk of what we're looking at is we're looking to add assets that could give us incremental pipeline and revenue growth towards the end of this decade and into the '30s. That's what the bulk of our focus is on. I'd say if I look at AbbVie's track record, certainly BD has been a critical part of how we've grown this company over the last 11 years. I'd say for the most part, we have done a pretty good job. When we acquire assets and bring them in, we can make them perform quite well. Skyrizi is a good example of that. Certainly, Allergan was another good example of that, and there are many others. So I'd say we value BD as a very important tool in how we should grow the business and how we should position our leadership positions in these franchises.\n\nOur primary focus is within the franchises that we're operating in. So let's take immunology as an example. I would say our greatest focus in immunology is to continue to add additional mechanisms, in particular, that could be used in combination in order to create deeper levels of clinical response in areas like IBD, rheumatology, and other areas. So we continue to look for those. We have several already that are in development now, like LUDI, like RIPK-1, and several others in our pipeline. But we're continuing to look for additional assets that we could add to that. And like I said, especially focused on combination therapy because we think that is the way to get much deeper clinical remission or responses in those patients who aren't responding to things like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which obviously perform exceptionally well. So that's a big area. Oncology is another big area.\n\nWe have a high level of interest in next-generation CAR-T technology. We have a high level of interest in T-cell engagers beyond our BCMA product. I think as we look at that asset continue to develop, we are very convinced it has a best-in-class profile. And it shows us that for the right indications, T-cell engagers can be extremely effective. And they're much easier to use and can be much more broadly brought to patients than CAR-Ts, at least the current version of CAR-Ts. So I'd say that's an area that we have a high level of interest. In psychiatry, we're interested in additional assets in anxiety, mood, and a variety of other assets, but that gives you some feel for it. And we obviously have the financial wherewithal to go out and do transactions. We need to make sure we find the right transaction.\n\nIt's a value-enhancing asset for the company. When we find them, we will act on them, and we will act on them quickly.\n\nThanks, Terence. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Tim Anderson with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nHi. Thanks for taking our question. This is Alice Nettleton. I'm for Tim Anderson. A question on obesity and its interface with immunology and a lot of other drug categories, frankly. Are you aware that payers have to cover obesity medicines? And if that's correct, it's a big expense, and payers will be looking for offsets. One offset would be for payers to squeeze other therapeutic areas as hard as they can. An example could be immunology, where there's now a really good product, your own Humira, at a much lower price. So we're wondering how much payers might start to force a step edit for products like Skyrizi. It's a relevant question because yesterday, one of the issues Bristol noted with its Sotyktu product is step edits, and they cite biosimilar Humira as the reason. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Hi. Thank you for the question. It's Jeff. And I think you've got to take a step back regardless of the obesity issues and think about the overall strategy that we pursued, which was one of fundamental distinction. And I'll take your point over some of these head-to-head trials, and there's nine of them, right? So if you take Skyrizi, just in psoriasis, we have gross superiority versus every mechanism in the category. So a head-to-head of gross superiority versus Humira, versus the leading IL-17 Cosentyx, versus the oral Otezla. And we also have versus Stelara. So fundamentally, when payers think about stepping or not stepping or how they would think about that, there's a medical dynamic there. And that distinctiveness that we have across our program is very, very important to help manage maybe the urge of the payers to think of formulary structures like that.\n\nIf you think about your comments that you heard yesterday or the day before, that's a very different dynamic. I mean, if you're not that different or you have the same efficacy as a Humira, it's not going to go that well on some of these formularies. And so I think you got to take a step back and look at the fundamental distinctiveness that we have on both Skyrizi and Rinvoq. And I think my last comment would be, let's take Rinvoq, which is growing very fast, 60%, okay? All of that is in the second-line plus setting. So from a strategic standpoint, it's already stepped. And so when you take a look at those dynamics, we remain quite confident that as we rely on the power of raising the standard of care, that will help us navigate any of these scenarios, whether it's related to obesity or not.\n\nThanks, Alice. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOur next question comes from Vamil Divan with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me. I'm in transit right now. But the two questions I have, actually, one is maybe building on Terence's question around business development boost in the pipeline. I think we get a lot of other questions just around sort of maybe underappreciated assets within your pipeline. So I don't know if you can maybe just comment on that and if there's a couple of assets that you point out that you think people are overlooking or there might be some underappreciated upside. And then the second one is just on this charge you took today or this quarter on Imbruvica regarding the Medicare drug pricing program. And obviously, I understand why you did it. I'm curious on the amount and the timing.\n\nSo why did you do it now as opposed to maybe waiting to see how the lawsuits play out or the negotiation process plays out? And then in terms of the amount or how, what your assumptions were, as much as you can share, obviously, there's competitive dynamics here, too, but sort of what you're assuming around the impact that this program would have on the pricing of Imbruvica and doing a derisking thinking.\n\nAll right, Bombal, this is Rick. I'll take the first question, and then Scott will take the second question. So on the pipeline, I think as I look at the pipeline and how we built the pipeline and how it's playing out, I don't know that I would call it underappreciated because you don't necessarily have access to all the data that we have on some of these programs. But we obviously invested significantly over the last several years in rapidly developing the indications for Rinvoq and Skyrizi. And a lot of our focus had been built around that. But in parallel, we were advancing a number of other programs along the way. And I would say the investment that we made on Skyrizi and Rinvoq are pretty clear, the kind of return that we are getting for those assets. I mean, they're growing at a phenomenal rate.\n\nIn fact, in the not-too-distant future, the combination of those two products on a running-rate basis will be larger than Humira to give you some idea of how rapidly those products are growing and how large they are. But if I look at our pipeline, the real meaningful programs that we have in our pipeline that will be true needle movers for the company, there are several of them that are advancing now that I think we have a high level of confidence in. ABV-400, our Topo Warhead platform with our c-Met version of that. We're seeing very encouraging data in CRC. We'll follow that with non-small cell lung cancer. And that platform is demonstrating to us that it is a broad-based platform that we can expand to a number of other areas. And that should be a fairly significant opportunity for us going forward.\n\nLater, sort of the 2027, 2028 kinds of timeframe, I think is when it will have meaningful benefit playthrough. And then I'd say the second one is 383, our BCMA bispecific. As we indicated earlier, we're seeing more and more data out of that program that clearly tells us this has a best-in-class profile, high levels of efficacy, and very good safety and very convenient dosing. We think it has that ideal profile to be able to enter this market. And as you know, multiple myeloma is a very large market. There are very significant products in this market. So those are two opportunities. I would also say 916 and some of our TAO programs are also exciting programs that are running in parallel to these. We'll be getting more data on those next year. And I think those have significant opportunities as well.\n\nThe third program I'd talk about is in our eye care business. It's our REGENXBIO program for both wet AMD and diabetic retinopathy. We're seeing some very, very encouraging data out of that program. And that could be a nice opportunity for us as well. And it continues to advance well. So there are a number of important programs that you'll start to see more and more data as we go through 2024 and into 2025 that I think will give the market an opportunity to be able to better assess those. Bansal, this is Scott with respect to your question on the Imbruvica charge. So I think a couple of things.\n\nAs we have signaled in some of our regulatory filings, our last 10-Q, for instance, we had indicated that if Imbruvica were to be selected in the negotiation process under the Inflation Reduction Act, that there would likely trigger an impairment. And so we had anticipated that this would be happening. And so the timing really relates to the fact that under the rules, you have to look at the fair value of that intangible asset with respect to future cash flows. And so the accounting rules would require that we would make that analysis upon selection as we had kind of previewed in our filings. And so we went through the process under that triggering event to determine what the impairment should be. And I would say that when you look at that impairment, the magnitude of the impairment is driven by a number of factors.\n\nBut really, one of the biggest factors that you're seeing there is it requires you to discount the future cash flows. So as we calculated the future cash flows, looked at what we had assumed was a reasonable assumption on the price, we discount those back. And so that creates part of the magnitude of this adjustment. In terms of the negotiated price that we assumed, I think we're in the middle of these negotiations, and it really wouldn't be appropriate for us to talk about what that is. But we looked at a number of factors, and we think that process is going to play out. Certainly, we will see on 1 February in a private conversation with CMS what they anticipate, at least an initial thought on price. But it won't be finalized until 1 September of next year.\n\nWe will see what that price is as the process plays out.\n\nThanks, Bombal. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Steve Scala with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nThank you very much. I have two questions and one clarification. First, the clarification is the base year for the high single-digit revenue growth to the end of the decade: is the base year 2023 or, excuse me, 2024 or 2025? I think it's 2025, but maybe you can clarify that. Second, given AbbVie's stated interest in building the oncology business, I assume that AbbVie took a hard look at the ADC deal that Merck signed with Daiichi. I'm just curious what about it didn't you like? Was it the profile of the products? Was it the price? Or do you feel you have everything you need already? And then the last question is, at least one other company has changed its tax rate guidance stemming from a recent IRS document clarifying Section 174 tax legislation. Do you have any perspective on this update and why it doesn't impact AbbVie?\n\nThank you.\n\nSteve, this is Rob. I'll take your first question. The base year is 2024. If you think about it, we signaled that we expect to return a robust growth in 2025. That high single-digit CAGR really would pick up that first year of robust growth of 2025. If you start in 2025, you'd miss that year of growth. Our intention has always been 2024 is a base year, and that high single-digit CAGR starts from 2024 to the end of the decade. Okay. Steve, this is Rick. I'll take the second question. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on whether we looked at that same transaction. That probably wouldn't be appropriate. What I can tell you is we knew it was there. Maybe that gives you some idea of our perspective on it.\n\nBut the reality is, we believe we have what we need with 400. We believe that platform, and we own that platform. We developed it internally. It gives us everything that we need in that area. And so, it wasn't something that we were looking at. And Scott?\n\nYeah. Hey, it's Scott. So with respect to the tax legislation, I certainly can talk about what our facts are. But when we've looked at, certainly, this results out of tax reform legislation a few years ago, the tax rules, there's always a little bit of uncertainty. And what happened this quarter, there was guidance that came out that I would say clarified a certain approach and treatment. Prior to that guidance, though, there was a little bit of a diversity of opinion amongst advisors and ourselves as to how we might implement. So I would tell you that we were already implementing consistent with how that guidance ultimately came out. And that's why you're not seeing any impact to us on our tax rate.\n\nThanks, Steve. Operator, next question, please.\n\nNext question comes from Gary Nachman with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. So first, back to the trough raise in 2024, how are you thinking about spending levels for both SG&A and R&D into the trough year next year to set up for growth in 2025 and beyond? And do you have a better sense of where the operating margin might end up next year? And then secondly, Skyrizi and Rinvoq have been doing very well in the IBD indications. Talk about how much headroom you see for those products and you see in Crohn's with that landscape likely getting more competitive in the coming years. And any updated thoughts on 2025 guidance for those products? Thank you.\n\nHi, Gary. It's Scott. I'll start with your question regarding operating margin. So when we've looked at the operating margins we've talked about in the past, for 2023 and 2024, we had talked about those being very, very similar. So when you think about the operating margins that we've talked about for this year and next year, it's really in that 46% to 47% range. This year, our guidance is 46.5%. We would expect operating margin in 2024 to be very similar to what we're seeing this year. Then I think as a result, roughly the gross margin is going to be in line in 2024 with what we're seeing this year as well as the expense profile. So very consistent with this year. Of course, we'll refine that when we come out with guidance.\n\nYeah. And this is Jeff. I'll highlight your comment on the headspace and IBD. I mean, the IBD market is very, very attractive. If we think back historically, we were always, frankly, a little surprised at how fast Humira back in the day grew when we started to achieve the UC and the Crohn's indications. And again, I would say we're very, very pleasantly encouraged about the momentum. The momentum is very, very significant. So there is significant headroom. And what we see in the market dynamic is that, unlike what you might think, that patients would always want to rotate off of their medications because of the severity of the disease, actually, physicians haven't been able to really move the market very much over the years simply because it's very dangerous to try to go to another drug that hasn't provided any increase in benefit for those patients.\n\nIt puts those patients at risk. So when you look at what Tom had highlighted, our ability with two complementary assets, for example, in the US, Skyrizi position in the early lines, Rinvoq position in later lines, both of which have exceptional performance criteria versus the market, that gives us a lot of confidence. The other thing that gives us a lot of confidence because there will be more competitive entries in the future is we think our profiles are going to hold up exceptionally well. And then there's the commercial executional component. In most of the countries around the world, we have dual sales forces that basically will carry two products with four big indications. So our ability to compete in the market for share, even as it gets a little more competitive over time, is still going to be very, very strong.\n\nSo lots of headroom in the market, lots of unmet need in the market. We believe we have the best position in the market for the foreseeable future.\n\nGary, this is Rob. On your question regarding the 2025 guide, we do periodically update the long-term guidance for our portfolio. We're obviously very pleased with the momentum we're seeing both from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, particularly in IBD. If you recall, last time we provided guidance for Skyrizi, we had about $2.5 billion of revenue in IBD in 2025. It was $1.8 billion for Rinvoq. Those are obviously ramping very nicely. We have a lot of confidence. We periodically update that guidance. We'll find the right time to provide a holistic update to our long-term guide. But clearly, the momentum is there. The street reflects that too. I mean, if I look at consensus now for Skyrizi, I think it's around $11 billion. So it's $1 billion higher than our 2025 guide. So I think the market's recognizing the strong momentum.\n\nWe'll update that long-term guide holistically at the appropriate time.\n\nNext question, please.\n\nNext question comes from Luisa Hector with Berenberg. Your line is open.\n\nHi, there. Thank you for taking my question. To continue with IBD, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the AbbVie pipeline emerging behind Skyrizi and Rinvoq and how we think about that and maybe potential combinations with Skyrizi. With a recent competitor launch in psoriasis with a label where the FDA has asked for mention of TNF safety warnings, I wondered whether the FDA has mentioned anything to you about the review of label in that regard. Thank you.\n\nHi, it's Roopal. I'll take the IBD question. So you've heard already some mention of lutikizumab. That's our IL-1 alpha beta bispecific antibody. That's an in-house antibody. And we have observed data where there's resistance to anti-TNF and other biologics with patients with an IL-1 beta signal. So we'll be entering into ulcerative colitis looking at a potential biomarker approach. But in addition to that, we'll also be looking at a set of combinations as was already mentioned. For example, with Skyrizi, we have lutikizumab. We have other agents as well. RIPK-1 was also mentioned. There's also some partnerships that we have. GLP-2 is another mechanism we're interested in. And another one I'll mention is an IL-2 mutein. All of these are under assessment.\n\nAnd we do believe either you find a biomarker approach where you can see the high efficacy, or if you want to see real transformational efficacy, you're going to have to go with a combination approach. So those are the assets we'll be looking at. Now, moving on to the question, I think it was around depression and suicidal ideation, if I heard it correctly. This was in an IL-17 class agent that was recently approved. We've also observed a similar warning and precaution previously also in the IL-17 class. In fact, that previous asset, in fact, had a REMS in place. Remember, Skyrizi is an anti-IL-23, very different class. And to date, with all the data that's been generated across numerous indications, we don't see that type of signal at all, nor do we have any of that in our label.\n\nAs we look at psoriasis therapy, that particular agent that's been mentioned has been available in Europe. Our physicians really don't tell us that there's much of an uptake there. So Skyrizi continues to perform well. Also, our label does not have the high rate of fungal infections that have been observed with a new one in the IL-17 class. And also, we've talked a lot about IBD. Skyrizi doesn't also lead to IBD, which is another risk for the IL-17 class. And also, with our dosing regimen, you get it at zero in week four, and then it's quarterly after that. With the new one, I think there's five doses that are required, then potentially every eight weeks or in heavier patients every four weeks. So we're very confident in Skyrizi's position across indications, especially in psoriasis.\n\nThanks, Luisa. Operator, next question, please.\n\nNext question comes from David Risinger with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.\n\nYes. Thanks very much. So I'll expand upon your vision for oncology. Clearly, the company has compelling assets. But in light of an increasingly complex and competitive oncology landscape, could you just paint a picture of how you see your portfolio evolving and opportunities to acquire assets when it may be difficult to see what's around the corner from, let's say, an emerging oncology competitor in three to four years? Thanks very much.\n\nHi, this is Tom Hudson. We've been sort of, when we talk about ABV-400, we're also talking about going to a different space than lung and breast where there's a lot of competition, like colon cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas. So c-Met is a target that's expressed in many other tumors. And that's why we've developed this with Topo Warhead, so we can go to a broader set of tumors. And that's where we're seeing the very good data with the ABV-400. Even unselected patient population, third line plus, we saw 22% response versus 2% to 3%. What's also interesting about this is it's not just for colon cancer, but most chemos, most treatments in GI tumors have a lot of toxicity, a lot of diarrhea. And one of the things that excited the clinicians about this program is actually the very low rate of diarrhea.\n\nSo it makes that not only can we see some efficacy in third line, but it sees we can move to earlier lines, and combine with other therapies, and have a higher efficacy. So there's a lot of unmet need in GI tumors. And so this data, again, we're going to have more data in our next cohort at the end of this year in CRC. We'll have different doses. And we'll also have potential cutoffs of biomarkers. So we're moving very well. But to actually in a big space in GI tumors, as I mentioned, even our GARP program, also where we've shown the best data is in liver cancer, where c-Met's also expressed. We have opportunities to go explore places where there's a big unmet need, and the competition is not the same.\n\nNow, the other targets, because we talked about Topo platform, we have others, 706, which is already in the clinic with CEST-6. Next year, we'll be going to two other indications for which there's less competition in terms of ADC space. So our strategy is actually to go and bring this as an offering to a lot more cancer patients. I'll start there. I'll stop there. Oh, and then maybe in Heme? Roopal.\n\nIt's Roopal. Thank you. Let me add on a little bit. I think you may be also reflecting on some of the ESMO data that came out. I will mention lung a little bit. We still see an opportunity with Teliso-V. We're going to get data later this year. But what we've already observed is 50% ORRs in a biomarker-selected population in the EGFR wild type. If you look at some of the data that has come out, the ORRs are probably right around 20% to 30%. We don't have all the breakdown of all the different lung subtypes. But one approach is to use a biomarker and then select the patient population rather than going so broadly. That was observed at ESMO.\n\nThe other thing I would say reflecting on the data that came out, if you looked at EGFR mutants in lung, you see some higher levels of efficacy either in the front line or second line in that space. But that comes at a cost. That's a chemo-like adverse event profile. And those are things like nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, alopecia, fatigue. These are things that you may see slight increases in efficacy, but clearly, patients don't want that. And as Tom was mentioning with our platform and including Teliso-V, we have an opportunity there in the mutant side to combine with osimertinib, which has a nice profile. And those mutant patients, when they progress, half of them have highly expressed c-Met. So that's where a combo looks good. And then we're also seeing 50% ORR in that segment as well.\n\nWe have a plan to get into phase 3 in that next year. Then as we think about heme, we spoke about 383, which we feel has best-in-class potential. One of the things that we're observing with that one is the high level of efficacy. With CRS, we're driving down past grade 3 and now driving down to get past grade 2. So that enables a potential where you may not need hospitalization. What you see now with the BCMA dual engagers is not just hospitalization, but a REMS. What we would add to that is dose spacing potentially every other month. So that one is a very nice profile. We're moving into phase 3 with that one. We continue to conduct a variety of combinations there so we can move into earlier lines of therapy in multiple myeloma.\n\nWe are still moving into earlier lines in Phase 3s with Epkinli in heme, which is another dual engager. We have an asset called 453, which is our next-gen BCL-2 blocker. And then we have a BTK degrader called 101 that's also in clinic. So quite a comprehensive approach across oncology.\n\nThanks, David. Operator, next question, please.\n\nYes. Our next question comes from Jeff Meacham with Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nHi, guys. Morning. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple of quick ones. One on immunology. So do you guys have evaluated the impact from Humira biosimilars beyond even 25? Is it your view that tail revenues are likely to be better than you initially modeled? And what, if anything, do Stelara, the delay in Stelara biosimilars, impact this? And the second question, just on capital deployment, you've just given your higher guidance. I know you guys just raised the dividend, but would you also say that the deal capacity is higher? I know you recently raised kind of an M&A range and wondering if that's even going higher. Thank you.\n\nYeah. Hi, it's Jeff. It's Jeff here. We continue to study the tail. I mean, it's something that we look very closely at. We continue to think that the Humira tail will emerge sometime in 2025 or 2026. That's looking at some of the international analogs, how we think we see pricing may move. I mean, the one thing that we do believe is that you're not going to have a small molecule-like tail, which is virtually nothing. There's going to be a subsegment of patients that are going to stay on Humira. It's going to be modest, whether it's low price or low volume. But it'll be there, even in an interchangeable world. We don't necessarily believe that since we've outperformed here in volume in 2023, that that's going to fundamentally change our view on the tail at this point. Again, we're still highlighting that.\n\nIn terms of Stelara, obviously, we think in the US that will not come until, and I think it was recently confirmed this week, until sometime in 2025. And so overall, we think that's a modest net positive for AbbVie in terms of how that may play out. But that's not the primary driver of our strategy. Our primary driver of the strategy is how distinctive we are across our indications with Skyrizi versus Stelara, which I've already highlighted. So hope that helps. And Jeff, this is Rob. You're right. We did lift the cap. We had put that $2 billion BD cap in place while we were rapidly paying down debt. And we lifted that at the beginning of this year because we essentially, by the end of this year, we're going to have paid off all the incremental financing from the Allergan transaction.\n\nAs Scott mentioned, our net leverage ratio is around 1.8 times. I have said previously that as long as we have a path back to two times net leverage in two to three years, that's the way we're thinking about balance sheet capacity. As we look at it, there's nothing from a balance sheet capacity standpoint that would limit us today from pursuing the opportunities we'd be interested in. That's not a limiting factor. To the extent that we continue to raise guidance and perform more strongly, that just means there's even more capacity. But at this point, that's not a rate limiter for the types of opportunities we'd be interested in.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Operator, next question, please.\n\nOur next question comes from Evan Seigerman with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nHi, all. Thank you so much for the question and congrats on the progress. So I just wanted to touch on the dividend growth. So at first glance, it seems that your dividend growth, while impressive, is slowing a bit relative to other recent periods. Maybe you could help us understand kind of what's driving this dynamic at play. Is it concerns around near-term performance of key products, Humira erosion continuing next year, or are you preserving capital for use elsewhere? Maybe some color on that would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nSo Evan, it's Rob. If you think about it, we're delivering dividend growth both in 2023 and 2024 while earnings are not growing, right? So then you look at the payout ratio we're at; we're going to be in the mid-50s. We have said that over the long term, if you look at just across the industry as well, I'd say a good target is in the, say, the mid- to high 40% payout ratio, which would mean that during this period where you see your payout ratio go up in the future, we're very committed to growing the dividend. We'll continue to grow the dividend. But we would expect then earnings would grow faster than dividend increases. So I would say we've gone through this period for a couple of years where we are still delivering a very nice dividend growth despite earnings declining.\n\nBut given our commitment to that dividend, we're going to continue growing it. We'll likely see it step up from here, but not at the same rate as earnings growth because that payout ratio right now will be sitting in the mid-50s. So that's the way we think about it. Over the long term, we want to deliver a healthy, sustainable, growing dividend. And so we have a long view on this. And we are committed to delivering that growth to investors. And so that's the way we're thinking about it. We're going through a period of a couple of years here where earnings aren't growing. And then when we see us return a robust growth, we'll step up that dividend again. But that's a dynamic that we're balancing here.\n\nThanks, Evan. Operator, we have time for one final question.\n\nYes. Our last question comes from Trung Huynh with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nHi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I've got two. Just one, a confirmation on the trough, and then one on aesthetics. So on the trough in 2024, you mentioned that costs, you'll have the same margin in 2024 as 2023. So is it going to be a trough year on sales rather than the trough being driven by costs? And then second, again, just lots of noise on GLP-1s impacting aesthetics. You've commented before on fillers and Ozempic face in the past, but there's potential impact on body sculpting. Is this actually anything that you're seeing coming through yet in the sales? And overall, is this trend a net positive or a net negative for you? Thanks very much.\n\nTrung, this is Rob. Clearly, we've communicated a floor for earnings. Scott previously mentioned that expect a similar level of operating margin year over year. So you can model the sales accordingly. It should be fairly clear. Operating margin profile. Operating margin profile, yes. So we said the 46% to 47% is the way to think about operating margin profile in 2023 and 2024. We've given you the $11 EPS IPR&D as a floor for next year. So I would suggest using those parameters to model revenue. Carrie?\n\nHi, this is Carrie. For your question around the weight loss products and the impact on the aesthetics business, I mean, as we look at the long-term view of this market, we continue to think that anything that gets a subset of patients engaged in their appearance, which these weight loss products can do, that is a positive tailwind for our business. We hear that from our customers. Many of our customers are bringing these GLP-1s into their practice. They see it as a natural opportunity to cross-sell. Now, that said, in the short term, especially in an environment where discretionary spending is pressured, and there could be trade-offs for higher-priced products such as fillers or body contouring. Now, we're not necessarily seeing that as a driver. Right now, what we're seeing is the broader macroeconomic dynamics.\n\nBut in the short term, that could be a trade-off in terms of share of wallet. But absolutely, in the long term, this is something that is going to help patients get engaged in aesthetics and be an opportunity for cross-selling.\n\nThanks, Trung. That concludes today's conference call. If you'd like to listen to a replay of the call, please visit our website at investors.abbvie.com. Thanks again for joining us.\n\nThank you. And that concludes today's conference. You may all disconnect at this time."

Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, President and Chief Operating Officer; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President, AbbVie and President, Global Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.\nAdditional information about these risks and uncertainties is included in our SEC filings. AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. On today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard A. Gonzalez\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2023 is an important year for AbbVie as we experience Humira biosimilar competition in the U.S. market, and as we execute our long-term diversification growth strategy. Now roughly 7 months into the year, I'm extremely pleased with the progress that we're making against these objectives. .\nThe U.S. Humira biosimilar impact is playing out as projected and slightly better than our planning assumptions. We are competing very effectively with the various biosimilar offerings. We have exceeded our guidance in burst in second quarters with the overachievement predominantly driven by our growth platform, the base portfolio, excluding Humira which, as you know, is the critical driver in our rapid return to growth in 2025 and beyond. To that point, this platform demonstrated operational revenue growth of nearly 8% this quarter with growth expected to further accelerate in the second half of this year. We are also once again raising our full year revenue guidance by $1 billion, which is on top of the $400 million sales increase we delivered in the first quarter for a total overachievement of $1.4 billion. And lastly, we are making good progress with our pipeline, across all stages of development, including recent strong data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis as well as the recent U.S. approvals for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease and Epkinly in relapsed or refractory DLBCL, both important new therapies for patients.\nSo in summary, I'm extremely pleased with the strong momentum and execution across the business. It reinforces our confidence in our ability to return to robust growth in 2025 with high single-digit compounded growth rate to the end of the decade.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?\n\nRobert A. Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick. AbbVie delivered excellent results once again this quarter. We are demonstrating strong execution across our business with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas beating expectations. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint.\nTotal net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance with the vast majority of the beat coming from our ex Humira growth platform. In immunology, Skyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating impressive growth with sales for both therapies up more than 50% versus the prior year. These 2 agents have achieved differentiated clinical profiles, including head-to-head data versus Humira and other novel therapies. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are now collectively approved across 10 large indications, and we are forecasting combined revenue growth of more than $3.5 billion this year. With ongoing programs in several additional disease areas, we expect both Skyrizi and Rinvoq to deliver robust growth into the next decade and significantly exceed Humira peak revenue.\nU.S. Humira is also performing well. The first half erosion coming in better than our expectations due to volume. We have been carefully analyzing the biosimilar marketplace, where the total number of competitors has now expanded to 8. While many of these biosimilars have been added to payer formularies, Humira continues to maintain strong parity access. Based on the volume trends and parity access, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, an improvement of 2 points versus our original guidance.\nNeuroscience is another area that is outperforming expectations. Based on the current run rate, this portfolio is now on pace to add more than $1 billion of incremental revenue this year. with continued strong growth from Vraylar as well as our leading migraine portfolio. In aesthetics, the outlook continues to improve. We delivered positive growth this quarter, driven by strong international performance and stabilizing trends in the U.S. These positive trends give us the confidence to once again raise our full year guidance for aesthetics. And as a clear market leader, we are focused on expanding the aesthetics category with increased commercial investment and continued innovation to support robust long-term growth.\nGiven the strong and balanced performance across our diverse portfolio, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. In closing, our operational execution has been outstanding, and we are very well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'll start with immunology, which delivered total revenues of $6.8 billion, exceeding our expectations. Skyrizi continues to perform exceptionally well. Global sales were approximately $1.9 billion, reflecting very strong operational growth of 51%. Our performance in psoriasis continues to be impressive. Total prescription share in the U.S. biologic market is now at 32%, double the share of the next closest biologic therapy. .\nWhen you consider that Skyrizi is capturing roughly 1 out of 2 every in-play patients, which are either new to therapy or switching, there remains substantial opportunity for continued robust sales growth. And based on the available clinical data we are seeing from emerging competitive therapies in psoriasis, including orals. We feel very confident in Skyrizi's long-term potential with robust sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade. We are also seeing very nice prescription growth in psoriatic arthritis, especially in the U.S. dermatology segment where Skyrizi is approaching the leading new patient biologic market share. Skyrizi's momentum across psoriatic disease is very solid globally as well. with total in-play share leadership in nearly 30 key countries.\nTurning now to IBD, where Skyrizi has demonstrated a very compelling clinical profile, including strong endoscopic data paired with convenient dosing. Uptake in Crohn's disease has been rapid, with total in-play patient share of approximately 25% in the U.S., roughly at parity leadership with Stelara. This uptake is very encouraging for Skyrizi's potential in ulcerative colitis, where we recently reported positive maintenance data with approval and commercialization anticipated next year. Given the momentum we are seeing across all of the approved indications, we will be raising our full year sales outlook for Skyrizi.\nMoving now to Rinvoq which delivered global sales of $918 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 57%. A key element of Rinvoq's success is its strong differentiation. It is now approved across 7 distinct indications, including 4 in rheumatology, 2 in IBD as well as atopic dermatitis. It's the only potent daily oral medication with compelling head-to-head data against multiple novel therapies, including superiority to Humira in RA and Dupixent in AD. It's the only JAK inhibitor now approved to treat both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. And we have established strong and broad commercial access for each of the core diseases with formulary coverage for Crohn's expected to ramp quickly over the next months. As it pertains to Rinvoq's book performance, we are seeing increasing prescriptions across each of the room indications globally, further market share momentum in atopic dermatitis, including now high-teens in-play patient share in the U.S. and robust uptake in IBD, where Rinvoq has demonstrated strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. Rinvoq is now capturing roughly 1 out of every 4 in-play ulcerative colitis patients in the second line plus setting.\nAnd the early data for Crohn's, which launched just in May, also shows a very strong ramp in new patient starts. We remained well positioned for continued momentum in this new indication as the only JAK inhibitor approved to treat Crohn's disease. This level of performance, along with the development of ongoing projects across several other diseases, such as giant cell arteritis and systemic lupus in rheumatology and multiple additional derm indications, reinforces the long-term potential for Rinvoq with strong sales growth expected through the early part of the next decade.\nGlobal Humira sales were $4 billion, down 24.8% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. erosion in the U.S. remains slightly better than our expectations due to volume with the vast majority of the impact this quarter driven by price.\nTurning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were approaching $1.5 billion. Imbruvica global revenues were $907 million, down 20.8%, consistent with our expectations. Venclexta global sales were $571 million, up 15% on an operational basis with strong demand for both CLL and AML, and we are particularly pleased with the international performance here, following continued reimbursement progress in the EU and inclusion in China's national reimbursement list. We also recently received the U.S. approval for Epkinly in third line plus DLBCL further expanding our on-market portfolio in heme onc. Early prescription trends have been encouraging, with a more robust opportunity expected as we progress development in earlier lines of therapy. We also anticipate approval and commercialization in Europe and Japan later this year. In neuroscience, revenues were nearly $1.9 billion, up 14.2% on an operational basis.\nVraylar continues to exceed our expectations. Sales of $658 million were up 33.9% on an operational basis with increasing momentum across all indications following the MDD approval late last year. Within migraine, we remain the clear market leader with unique treatment options for both acute and chronic conditions. Our oral CGRP portfolio contributed $292 million in combined sales this quarter reflecting growth of more than 30% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta.\nLastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $748 million, up 11.3% on an operational basis, reflecting nice momentum in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. This franchise continues to outperform our expectations, and we will be raising our full year guidance for the collective neuroscience portfolio. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance and execution across the therapeutic portfolio with growth expected to accelerate through the second half of the year.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie C. Strom\n\nSenior VP of AbbVie & President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. Second quarter global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.4 billion, up 2.9% on an operational basis with strong performance from our international portfolio offsetting the economic impact in the U.S.\nU.S. aesthetic sales were $829 million, down 6.2%. Our U.S. portfolio continues to perform well from a competitive perspective. And as expected, the aesthetics markets continued to be impacted by lower consumer spending related to inflationary pressures, which weighed on year-over-year growth rates.\nU.S. Botox cosmetic sales were $420 million, a decline of 6.5% versus the prior year. While the U.S. cosmetic toxin market declined low single digits in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis, growth rates improved through the quarter, with June showing a return to positive year-over-year market growth.\nBotox Cosmetic continues to be the clear market leader, maintaining strong and stable share despite new competitive entrants. U.S. Juvederm sales were $125 million, down 14.5% on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see a more pronounced impact from inflationary dynamics on higher-priced, more deferrable procedures such as Filler. The U.S. Filler market declined approximately 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic metrics that we track for the U.S. have largely stabilized. Our consumer market research shows a meaningful recovery from last summer and those intending to get treated with toxins and fillers. Additionally, we have now lapped the beginning of the market downturn, which occurred in the second quarter of last year. Based on these factors, we expect growth rates for the U.S. facial injectables to improve in the second half of this year.\nOur international aesthetics portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with strong results in many key markets. Second quarter sales were $555 million, reflecting operational growth of nearly 20%. The International Botox cosmetic sales of $265 million increased approximately 14% on an operational basis and International Juvederm sales were $243 million, up approximately 28% on an operational basis.\nGrowth in the Asia Pacific region, particularly robust as aesthetic treatment rates in China have fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. We continue to anticipate strong normalized growth through the remainder of the year in China. We are very pleased with the strong performance of our international aesthetics portfolio over the first half of the year and continue to expect similarly strong results in the second half. In the third quarter, we will be facing a challenging year-over-year comparison due to a shipment timing benefit we saw in the third quarter of 2022. This is expected to result in relatively flat growth for our international portfolio in the third quarter.\nOn a full year basis, we expect our international aesthetics sales to grow high single digits. We continue to invest to drive future growth for our aesthetics portfolio with a focus on enhanced promotional activities improve digital products and services through our Alle platform, sales force expansion and injector training. We continue to invest in our pipeline as well. and we remain committed to a regular cadence of new product introductions and indication expansions for Botox cosmetic in Juvederm. We recently announced the FDA approval of SkinVive the first hyaluronic acid filler in the U.S. for improved skin smoothness of the cheeks, which, along with the recently launched Volux filler for jawline contouring will help sustain our leadership position in the U.S. filler market. Our investments will allow us to maintain a strong leadership position in the highly underpenetrated and rapidly growing global aesthetics markets. We remain very confident in the long-term outlook for our aesthetics portfolio and continue to expect to deliver greater than $9 billion in 2029. In the near term, the improving aesthetics outlook in the U.S. and continued robust international performance gives us confidence to once again raise our full year aesthetics guidance with an expectation for continued operational growth over the back half of the year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas J. Hudson\n\nSenior VP of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline over the quarter. We had a substantial amount of activity across our R&D pipeline, resulting in new approvals and advancements of several programs.\nIn immunology, we received FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, marking its seventh FDA approval across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. In our Crohn's development program, Rinvoq demonstrated a very rapid and strong impact on symptoms as well as endoscopic improvement. Given its strong benefit risk profile, we believe Rinvoq will be an important new medicine for patients suffering from moderate to severe Crohn's disease. While Crohn's disease approval marks the completion of the core indications, we believe revokes the potential to become a highly effective therapy in several additional important diseases. We recently began Phase III studies for Rinvoq in systemic lupus, a hidradenitis, suprativa, and we remain on track to begin Phase III studies in alopecia areata later this year. We'll also see later this year from a Phase II study in vitiligo, which could support advancement to Phase III in this indication as well.\nMoving to Skyrizi, where in the quarter, we announced positive top line results from our Phase III maintenance trial in ulcerative colitis. In this study, Skyrizi met the primary and key secondary end points at week 52 compared to the withdrawal arm, demonstrating that patients continuing treatment with Skyrizi maintain high levels of clinical remission as well as more stringent endpoints such as endoscopic improvement, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement and steroid-free remission. It's important to note that approximately 75% of the patients in this study had failed advanced therapy, including not only anti-TNFs, but also other biologics, JAK inhibitors and S1P modulators. This represents a very difficult-to-treat population in ulcerative colitis. Skyrizi's strong performance in patients with and without failure to advanced therapies including patients who were naive to advanced therapy demonstrate its utility across the spectrum of moderate to severe UC patients. We remain on track to submit our regulatory applications in the third quarter with approvals anticipated in 2024.\nWe also recently published results from a head-to-head trial comparing Skyrizi to Otezla in patients with moderate psoriasis with Skyrizi demonstrating clear superiority to Otezla on all primary and ranked secondary endpoints at week 16 and 52. At week 52 of this study, of patients achieved absolute skin clearance as measured by PASI 100 an SPGA clear compared to just 3% for Otezla, underscoring Skyrizi's ability to drive very high and durable responses in these moderate patients.\nIn addition to higher clinical efficacy outcomes, the patients treat with Skyrizi which is a self-injectable administered quarterly reported improvements in health-related quality of life measures and greater treatment satisfaction compared to those treated with Otezla, which is an oral administered twice daily. Additionally, Skyrizi demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability compared to Otezla. The rates of adverse events, including serious and severe AEs were numerically higher with Otezla than with Skyrizi treatment. Previous to -- similar to previous studies, Otezla treatment was associated with high rates of gastrointestinal distress such as nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, which resulted in a 7% discontinuation rate in the first 16 weeks of treatment compared to no discontinuations for Skyrizi patients. We're incredibly pleased with these results, which further underscores Skyrizi's position as the best in category treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis, providing very high efficacy, durable responses a safe and tolerable profile and convenient quarterly administration.\nIn oncology, we received accelerated approval in the U.S. for Epkinly as a monotherapy treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who had received 2 or more systemic therapies. We also recently received positive CHMP opinion with an approval decision in Europe expected later this year. DLBCL is a very aggressive disease where later-line patients have limited options. We're extremely excited to bring this new subcutaneous treatment option to patients. In the quarter, we also announced positive top line results from the follicular lymphoma cohort of a Phase II trial evaluating Epkinly in patients who have received at least 2 prior lines of therapy. In this study, Epkinly performed very well as a monotherapy, demonstrating an overall response rate of 82%. We are pleased these results and plan to discuss these data with regulatory agencies about the potential to support a submission for accelerated approval. Beyond the mid-stage studies supporting accelerated approvals in later lines of therapy. We also have Phase III trials ongoing in earlier lines of DLBCL and for lymphoma, and we look forward to providing updates on these programs as the data mature.\nIn our navitoclax program, we recently saw top line results from the Phase III TRANSFORM 1 trial, evaluating navitoclax in combination with ruxolitinib in for patients with treatment naive myelofibrosis. This study met the primary endpoint at week 24, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients who achieved complete volume reduction of at least 35% compared to rux plus placebo. For the primary endpoint, the navitoclax combination showed a doubling of improvement over rux alone with 63% of patients on the navitoclax combination achieving SVR35 compared to 32% in the rux plus placebo combination. In this study, the navitoclax combination did not achieve the first ranked secondary endpoint, which was improvement in total symptom score at week 24. We additional follow-up data on SVR and TSS as well as other endpoints are expected in the fourth quarter of this year. We plan to wait for these more mature data before engaging with regulatory agencies in order to have a more comprehensive picture of the patient's clinical response and clinical benefit that navitoclax can provide.\nLooking to the remainder of this year. We remain on track for several additional data readouts from our late-stage oncolograms, including Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients with t(114) mutation. As a reminder, this is an event-driven study, and we're just waiting -- we're waiting for just a handful of remaining events. So we'd expect to have these data in-house in the coming months. And we remain on track to see Phase II data for Teliso-V in second-line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in the fourth quarter. We're also making very good progress with several earlier line, earlier stage solid tumor programs. We recently initiated a Phase II study for ABBV-151, our anti-GARP antibody in hepatocellular carcinoma and plan to begin Phase II in several additional solid tumors over the course of the next 12 months.\nAt the recent ASCO meeting, we presented promising initial results from a Phase I study evaluating our next-generation c-Met ADC, ABBV-400 in several advanced solid tumor types. We're seeing responses across multiple tumors, indicating broad activity. Results in late-line colorectal patients were particularly encouraging, where monotherapy treatment with 400 resulted in a confirmed overall response rate of 22% well in excess of standard of care, which is typically less than 2% to 3%. We're also encouraged by the doability of response seen in these early results. These patients had an average of 5 prior lines of therapy, so this level of efficacy is very encouraging. Based on these results, we plan to start our Phase II program later this year, beginning with a second line colorectal cancer study.\nNow moving to neuroscience, where in the quarter, we received a positive CHMP opinion recommending approval of atogepant for migraine prevention. We anticipate a decision in the coming months. And if approved, atogepant would be the only oral CGRP antagonist approved in Europe for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. This is a debilitating condition that impacts tens of millions of people, and we look forward to making this new oral treatment option available to patients once approved. Also in the area of neuroscience, ABBV-916, our Abeta antibody for Alzheimer's disease is rapidly advancing to dose escalation studies. This antibody is demonstrating a long half-life and very low antidrug antibodies, both important attributes to achieve a best-in-class profile for our Abeta antibody. Dose selection in Phase II is expected to begin early next year. And lastly, in our aesthetics pipeline, we recently submitted our regulatory application for Botox in masseter muscle prominence in China, which is the initial focus for our program given the prevalence of masseter muscle prominence in Asian populations and a significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options.\nIn our platisima prominence program for Botox, we remain on track to see data from 2 additional Phase III studies later this year with our regulatory submission in the U.S. expected near the end of the year. So in summary, we had a very productive first half of the year across all stages and therapeutic areas of our pipeline, and we look forward to the second half of 2023 with several important clinical and regulatory milestones.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nChristopher Thomas Schott\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Securities LLC\n\nThank you, Tom. I'm very pleased with the performance and outlook of the business, including the strong momentum from our ex-Humira growth plan.\nStarting with our second quarter results. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.91, which is $0.11 above our guidance midpoint. These results include a $0.15 unfavorable impact from acquired IP R&D expense. Total net revenues were nearly $13.9 billion, more than $350 million ahead of our guidance and down 4.2% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.\nImportantly, these results reflect high single-digit sales growth from our growth platform. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 47% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 12.5% of sales, acquired IP R&D expense of 2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 23.2% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million, the adjusted tax rate was 15.8%.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.23 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.90 and $11.10. This guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred beyond the second quarter. We now expect total net revenues of approximately $53.4 billion, an increase of $1 billion. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions with more than half of the sales improvement attributed to our ex-Humira growth platform.\nWe now expect Skyrizi global sales of approximately $7.6 billion, an increase of $200 million due to continued strong performance across all approved indications. We now expect neuroscience sales of approximately $7.7 billion, an increase of $300 million, reflecting robust prescription growth for Vraylar following the MDD approval as well as better-than-expected performance of Botox Therapeutics and Qulipta. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.4 billion, an increase of $100 million, primarily reflecting momentum from Botox Cosmetic. Lastly, we now anticipate U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 35%, resulting in a sales guidance increase of $400 million based on volume trends and strong parity access.\nMoving to the P&L. We continue to anticipate adjusted gross margin of 84% of sales and now expect adjusted R&D expense of $6.9 billion, SG&A expense of $12.7 billion and an adjusted operating margin ratio of approximately 46.5% of sales.\nTurning to the third quarter. We anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.7 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of approximately 40%. And rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on sales growth. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.80 and $2.90. This guidance does not include acquired IP R&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nIn closing, AbbVie has once again delivered strong top and bottom line performance, and we are very pleased with the momentum of the business heading into the second half of the year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions in the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 or 2. Operator, we'll take the first question, please."

Welcome to the AbbVie First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Ms. Liz Shea, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thanks for joining us. Also on the call with me today are Rick Gonzalez, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; Rob Michael, Vice Chairman and President; Jeff Stewart, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Scott Reents, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Carrie Strom, Senior Vice President and President, Allergan aesthetics; and Tom Hudson, Senior Vice President, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer. Joining us for the Q&A portion of the call is Roopal Thakkar, Senior Vice President, Development and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Medical Officer.\nBefore we get started, I'll note that some statements we make today may be considered forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. AbbVie cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in our forward-looking statements.

AbbVie undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nOn today's conference call, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand AbbVie's business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard A. Gonzalez\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm extremely pleased with our start to 2023. With first quarter total revenues and adjusted earnings per share both exceeding our expectations. This performance was driven by double-digit sales growth from several key products, including Skyrizi, Rinvoq, Venclexta and Vraylar. Positive momentum from our aesthetics business with strong results internationally and stabilizing consumer trends in the U.S. and in line performance from U.S. Humira where biosimilar erosion is tracking as expected with much of the impact driven by price.\nSince our inception, we have successfully created a well-diversified portfolio with multiple growth platforms in highly attractive markets, including immunology, hematological oncology, neuroscience and aesthetics. Our commercial execution, including the launch of new products and expanded indications has been outstanding, especially across Skyrizi and Rinvoq and recently with Vraylar and MDD. Each of these assets are expected to contribute significant revenue growth over the decade. The breadth and the depth of our R&D pipeline also supports our long-term growth outlook and we anticipate numerous important pipeline milestones over the next 2 years.\nIn summary, we are 1 quarter into the U.S. biosimilar event for Humira and are managing the erosion well. Most importantly, our growth platform is demonstrating strong performance, exceeding our expectations. We are executing well across all aspects of our business and see numerous opportunities for our diverse portfolio to drive long-term growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Rob for additional comments on our business performance. Rob?\n\nRobert A. Michael\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, AbbVie, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rick. We're off to an excellent start in 2023 with each of our 5 key therapeutic areas meeting or exceeding our first quarter expectations, a testament to the strength of our broad portfolio. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, approximately $400 million ahead of our expectations.\nFirst quarter results include continued robust performance from Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which remain on track to contribute more than $11 billion in combined sales this year. Growth rates in the first quarter for both products are consistent with our full year expectations.\nSkyrizi and Rinvoq are demonstrating momentum across all approved indications and we expect to round out their opportunities in IBD later this year. This includes Rinvoq's anticipated U.S. approval in Crohn's disease as well as Skyrizi's European launch in Crohn's and its global regulatory submission in UC.\nWe are also performing exceptionally well in neuroscience. Total net revenues this quarter were nearly $200 million above our guidance with Vraylar sales accelerating following MDD approval and migraine delivering strong growth. As a result, we will be increasing our full year outlook for neuroscience.\nAesthetics is also performing better than expected. We are seeing positive recovery trends in China and some stability in the U.S. market, where we are closely monitoring several economic indicators that correlate with aesthetics procedures, including consumer confidence, personal consumption and Google searches. Although it's still early in the year, these positive trends, especially across our international markets, give us the confidence to increase our full year outlook for aesthetics as well. This continues to be an underpenetrated market with significant growth potential.\nBased on our robust performance this quarter and the continued strong outlook for our business, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share between $10.72 and $11.12.\nIn closing, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of our diverse portfolio. We're off to a strong start to the year, which further reinforces our confidence in the long-term outlook of the business.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for additional comments on our commercial highlights. Jeff?\n\nJeffrey Ryan Stewart\n\nSVP of U.S. Commercial Operations, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Rob. I'm very pleased with the strong commercial execution across our therapeutic portfolio. Immunology delivered total revenues of approximately $5.6 billion with continued robust double-digit growth from Skyrizi and Rinvoq. Skyrizi global sales were nearly $1.4 billion, reflecting operational growth of more than 46%, despite retail inventory destocking in the quarter. Skyrizi is the clear market leader in the U.S. biologic psoriasis market with a total prescription share now at 30%.\nIn psoriasis, Skyrizi has set a very high bar relative to other therapies on the market or in development with differentiated attributes across the categories that physicians and patients deem most important. This includes the rapid onset of action after the first dose, nearly complete skin clearance with multifold higher rates on PASI 90 and PASI 100. High durability of response, which we have demonstrated can increase over time as well as quarterly dosing for maintenance therapy, a convenient alternative to daily oral or more frequently administered injectables. With a nearly 50% U.S. in-play share of new and switching patients, there is substantial room for Skyrizi's continued growth in psoriasis.\nThis best-in-class profile is supporting strong momentum now in psoriatic arthritis with Skyrizi achieving an in-play biologic share of roughly 20% in the U.S. dermatology segment. Skyrizi is also being co-positioned with Rinvoq in the U.S. room segment in PSA where we are seeing increasing utilization among rheumatologists as well. Globally, Skyrizi has achieved in-play psoriatic disease leadership in more than 25 countries and total market share leadership in nearly 20 of those key markets.\nIn Crohn's disease, we are seeing very fast adoption of Skyrizi in the U.S., with a total in-play patient share at approximately 20%, second only to STELARA. Feedback from gastroenterologists is very positive, especially as it relates to Skyrizi's novel dosing and overall clinical profile. We see strong uptake in Japan and Canada as well with the European launch forthcoming.\nWe also recently reported strong induction data for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which Tom will discuss momentarily. Based on the results of that trial, it is increasingly clear that Skyrizi represents a differentiated asset across inflammatory bowel disease and we look forward to bringing this potential new indication to physicians and patients next year.\nTurning now to Rinvoq, which delivered global sales of $686 million, reflecting operational growth of more than 50% despite similar retail inventory destocking in the quarter. I'm very pleased with the performance in rheumatology with total prescriptions increasing across each of the 4 approved indications. Atopic dermatitis is also tracking in line with our expectations. We continue to see market share momentum globally, including in-play patient share increasing to approximately 17% in the U.S.\nWe are very excited about the growth potential in gastroenterology. Rinvoq has set a high bar for efficacy in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, demonstrating strong rates of remission and endoscopic improvement. We're seeing very strong momentum in UC, where adoption has been robust. Rinvoq is now achieving a 23% in-play share in the U.S. second-line plus setting, reflecting an impressive ramp since our launch in UC less than 1 year ago. This accelerated adoption among gastroenterologists is very encouraging for Rinvoq's pending outlook in Crohn's. We are currently launching this indication in the EU, a geography where Rinvoq is the only JAK approved to treat both IBD conditions, and we remain on track for CD approval and commercialization in the U.S. later this quarter with broad formulary access anticipated to ramp quickly over the back half of this year.\nSo we see inflammatory bowel disease continues to be an area of high unmet need. Having 2 novel therapies in IBD with Skyrizi and Rinvoq that each deliver differentiated levels of efficacy is an important step forward for patients. And with these 2 complementary assets, we are very well positioned to compete against other oral or biological agents.\nGlobal Humira sales were approximately $3.5 billion, down 24.3% on an operational basis due to biosimilar competition. Erosion in the U.S. remains in line with our expectations with most of the impact driven by price.\nTurning now to hematologic oncology, where total revenues were $1.4 billion with continued pressure on Imbruvica, partially offset by robust double-digit growth with Venclexta. Imbruvica global revenues were $878 million, down 25.2% due to increasing competition and the cumulative impact of a suppressed market. Venclexta global sales were $538 million, up 17.5% on an operational basis with strong momentum across both AML and CLL.\nIn neuroscience, revenues were approximately $1.7 billion, up 15% on an operational basis. Vraylar is performing exceptionally well. Sales of $561 million were up 31.3% on an operational basis, above our expectations. We are very pleased with the AMDD label and the launch, which has resulted in a significant uplift in total new prescriptions for Vraylar. With a dedicated sales force that calls on both psychiatrists and primary care as well as ramping DTC promotion, we see an opportunity for accelerated growth across all approved indications. And we will be raising our full year guidance for Vraylar accordingly.\nWithin migraine, we remain uniquely positioned with a portfolio to support complete migraine freedom. Our leading oral CGRP therapies contributed $218 million in combined sales this quarter, reflecting growth of more than 45% as we continue to see strong prescription demand for both Ubrelvy and Qulipta. We recently expanded the label for Qulipta, which is now uniquely positioned as the only oral CGRP available as a preventative treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine further strengthening our competitive profile.\nLastly, total Botox Therapeutic sales were $719 million, reflecting strong performance in chronic migraine as well as other approved indications. So overall, I'm extremely pleased with the performance across the therapeutic portfolio.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Carrie for additional comments on aesthetics. Carrie?\n\nCarrie C. Strom\n\nSenior VP of AbbVie & President of Global Allergan Aesthetics, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Jeff. First quarter Global aesthetics sales were approximately $1.3 billion, which came in ahead of our guidance, primarily due to a faster reopening in China as well as a slightly stronger economy in the U.S. versus our planning assumption. In the U.S., aesthetics sales were $777 million, down 8.1% as we continue to see softness in aesthetics procedures related to inflationary dynamics. As a reminder, we saw a very robust performance for our U.S. performance in the first quarter of 2022, which created difficult comparison for growth in the first quarter of this year.\nU.S. Botox Cosmetic sales were $409 million, down slightly on a year-over-year basis. We continue to see a lesser impact from inflationary dynamics on Botox Cosmetic compared to other areas of our aesthetics portfolio due to its relatively lower price point and large install base of loyal repeat consumers.\nThe U.S. cosmetic toxin market was down low single digits in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. Botox Cosmetic continues be the clear market leader and its share of the U.S. toxin market remains stable.\nSales for our U.S. Juvederm collection were down 18% as our dermal filler portfolio continues to be impacted by inflationary pressure on consumer spending. The U.S. filler market was down nearly 20% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis due to the persistent inflationary environment. Our Juvederm collection remains the clear market leader and share was stable in the quarter. The economic pressure on our U.S. dermal filler business is partially offset in the quarter by strong initial uptake for our recently launched Volux filler, which is approved for the improvement of jawline definition. We expect Volux combined with the upcoming launch of our skin quality injectable [ Skinvive ] to support long-term growth for our filler portfolio in the U.S.\nWhile the aesthetics category in the U.S. continues to be challenged due to the fast economy, the key external economic metrics that we track have remained relatively consistent with year-end 2022 levels.\nOur international aesthetics portfolio continues to demonstrate robust growth with strong performance in Japan, which is rapidly growing and China, which is recovering faster than expected. Sales from our international aesthetics portfolio were $523 million, up 7.8% on an operational basis. International Botox Cosmetics sales grew approximately 17.5% operationally, and international Juvederm sales were down approximately 1.4% on an operational basis. China, which is our second largest market, was negatively impacted by COVID in January and February, but experienced a sharp recovery in March. We expect this level of activity to be sustained throughout the remainder of the year.\nRecall, our original guidance assumed we would not reach a full recovery until the second half of this year. And in Japan, which is an underdeveloped market and proving to be very responsive to promotion, we continue to make significant investments in injector training, our field force and consumer education. Overall, we are pleased with how our team has been executing through this dynamic environment and remain encouraged by improving trends internationally and stabilization across our U.S. portfolio. These positive trends and continued strong momentum give us the confidence to increase the full year outlook for our aesthetics business.\nLonger term, we remain extremely confident in our ability to grow the aesthetics business and continue to expect to achieve total sales of more than $9 billion by the end of this decade. Aesthetics continues to be an extremely attractive underpenetrated market and our proven ability to drive consumer demand and develop a strong base of loyal customers as well as bring innovative new products to the market will support robust growth over the long term.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas J. Hudson\n\nSenior VP of Research & Development and Chief Scientific Officer, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Carrie. We've continued to make very good progress with our pipeline to start this year. In immunology, we recently received European approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease, making it the first JAK inhibitor approved for this indication. We continue to anticipate FDA approval for Rinvoq in Crohn's disease next month. We also recently announced positive top line results from our Phase III induction study for Skyrizi in ulcerative colitis, which is a disease with unpredictable symptoms and frequent players making it challenging to manage.\nIn our study, Skyrizi met the primary and all secondary end points demonstrating a very strong impact on the disease as measured by clinical remission, clinical response and endoscopic improvement. We're particularly pleased with Skyrizi's impressive performance on the more stringent measures in this trial with approximately 37% of Skyrizi-treated patients achieving endoscopic improvement compared to 12% of patients on placebo. This level of efficacy has the potential to position Skyrizi as a highly effective therapy, and we believe it will be a welcome new treatment option for physicians and patients once approved. Detailed data from this induction study will be presented at a forthcoming medical meeting. We expect to see data from the Phase III maintenance study in the second quarter with our regulatory submissions planned for the second half of the year.\nIn oncology, we continue to make good progress across all stages of our hematology and solid tumor pipelines. We remain on track for several important regulatory and clinical milestones this year, including regulatory approval for epcoritamab in relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Phase III data from Venclexta's CANOVA trial in relapsed/refractory in multiple myeloma patients with a t(1114) mutation and navitoclax's TRANSFORM-1 trial in frontline myelofibrosis. And Phase II data for Teliso-V in second line plus advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, which has the potential to support a regulatory submission for accelerated approval.\nWe're also beginning to see very encouraging data for our next-generation c-Met ADC, which uses a more potent Topol payload than our Teliso-V ADC. Based on the data we've seen to date for ABBV-400 in our Phase I solid tumor basket study, we plan to expand the program to earlier lines in colorectal cancer as well as evaluate in other tumors where c-Met is expressed, including pancreatic and liver cancer.\nMoving to our neuroscience pipeline, where we've recently received FDA approval for Qulipta as a preventive treatment for patients with chronic migraine, making it the only oral CGRP antagonist approved for prevention of both episodic and chronic migraine. In our Phase III study, Qulipta provided a significant reduction in migraine days as well as significant improvements in function and quality of life in patients with chronic migraine, a common and debilitating disease. As a highly effective oral treatment option, we believe Qulipta will be well positioned in a chronic migraine prevention market. In Europe, we continue to anticipate an approval decision in the third quarter for atogepant as a preventive treatment for patients with both chronic and episodic migraine.\nTurning now to ABBV-951. We announced that we received a complete response letter for our regulatory application in the U.S. The FDA has not asked for additional efficacy or safety studies related to our drug delivery -- drug device delivery system, but rather they have requested additional information regarding the pump as well as updates to instruction for use. We are working to generate the necessary information, and we expect to respond to the CRL later this year with an FDA action anticipated in the first half of '24.\nIn international markets, we've recently received approval for 951 in Japan, and we continue to expect approval in Europe in the fourth quarter of this year.\nIn our early-stage neuroscience pipeline, we recently began Phase I studies of our selective D3 dopamine receptor agonist, ABBV-932. Our experience with Vraylar has highlighted the potential clinical benefit of achieving D3 selectivity, and we believe that a compound that more selectively engages the D3 dopamine receptor has the potential to provide enhanced efficacy. Our program will initially focus on general anxiety disorder with the potential to expand to other neuropsychiatric disorders.\nThe programs under our collaboration with Calico are also progressing well. We now have 4 assets in clinical trials, including 2 PTPN2 inhibitors in Phase I in oncology. Our eIF2B activator for neurodegenerative diseases and an IGF-1 signaling pathway modulator that will be explored in aging-related diseases. Our most advanced program is the eIF2B activator 7262. The first patient was recently enrolled in the HEALEY ALS Platform Trial, a Phase II/III study conducted by the HEALEY Center for ALS at Mass General. This trial is designed to evaluate multiple therapies simultaneously with a goal to accelerate the development of potential breakthrough treatments for ALS.\nNow I'd like to provide a brief update on 2 earlier stage programs in our therapeutic pipeline. In cystic fibrosis, we recently analyzed data from an ongoing proof-of-concept study, evaluating our triple combination therapy. The results from this interim analysis did not meet our criteria for advancing and we are discontinuing our cystic fibrosis program.\nWe also recently reviewed interim data from our exploratory studies for ABBV-154 in PMR in Crohn's disease. Similar to results from the RA study, while we observed efficacy with 154, we also observed some changes in biomarkers that are consistent with systemic steroid exposure at the higher doses. The benefit risk profile does not sufficiently differentiate 154 from other available treatments. So based on the totality of the data across RA, PMR and Crohn's disease studies, we will not be pursuing further development of this asset.\nNow moving to our aesthetics pipeline. We recently saw data from our Phase III studies for Botox in platysma prominence and masseter muscle prominence. In our study for prominent neck muscles, Botox met all primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating a significant reduction in the unwanted appearance of platysma prominence on the neck and jaw line. This was the first of 3 Phase III studies in platysma prominence with data from the 2 remaining trials expected in the second half of the year, followed by regulatory submission in the U.S. near the end of 2023.\nBotox also performed very well in our study for prominent masseter muscles, meeting the primary and all secondary endpoints in the trial. Our program is initially focused on China and other Asian markets as masseter prominence is common in Asian populations and there is significant unmet need for minimally invasive treatment options. Based on the results from this trial, we expect to submit our regulatory application in China in the second half of the year. Once approved, we anticipate high demand for Botox in this novel indication, which will help to further build our portfolio in the lower phase segment.\nSo in summary, we continue to demonstrate significant progress across all stages of our pipeline and anticipate numerous important regulatory and clinical milestones throughout the remainder of 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott T. Reents\n\nSenior VP & CFO, AbbVie Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. I will discuss our most recent financial results and guidance. Starting with our first quarter results, we delivered strong top and bottom line performance. We reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.46, which is $0.10 above our guidance midpoint. These results include an $0.08 unfavorable impact from acquired IPR&D expense. Total net revenues were $12.2 billion, $400 million ahead of our guidance and down 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. The adjusted operating margin ratio was 45% of sales. This includes adjusted gross margin of 84.2% of sales, adjusted R&D investment of 13.6% of sales, acquired IPR&D expense of 1.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense of 24.4% of sales. Net interest expense was $454 million. The adjusted tax rate was 13.7%.\nTurning to our financial outlook. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $10.72 and $11.12. This earning per share guidance does not include an estimate for acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred beyond the first quarter. We now expect net revenues of approximately $52.4 billion, an increase of $400 million. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a modest unfavorable impact on full year sales growth. This guidance includes the following updated assumptions. We now expect Vraylar sales of approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of $200 million, reflecting strong prescription growth following the MDD approval. And for aesthetics, we now expect global revenue of approximately $5.3 billion, reflecting the better-than-expected recovery in China and stable economic trends in the U.S.\nTurning to the second quarter, we anticipate net revenues of approximately $13.5 billion, which includes U.S. Humira erosion of 27%. At current rates, we expect foreign exchange to have a 0.6% unfavorable impact on sales growth. We are forecasting an adjusted operating margin ratio of 48.5% of sales. We are modeling a non-GAAP tax rate of 15.4%. We expect adjusted earnings per share between $2.90 and $3. This guidance does not include acquired IPR&D expense that may be incurred in the quarter.\nIn closing, we are off to an excellent start to the year with strong performance across the portfolio and financial results ahead of our expectations.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz.\n\nElizabeth Shea\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Scott. We will now open the call for questions. In the interest of hearing from as many analysts as possible over the remainder of the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to 1 or 2. Operator, first question, please."

As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Alexia Quadrani, Executive Director and Head of Investor Relations.\nOn today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago, and we also have an earnings presentation which will be made available on our website after the call.

Julie will then provide a brief update on the market position before Angie provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2026.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings.\nThese risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations from non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section on our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Alexia, and to everyone joining this morning, and thank you to our more than 779,000 re-inventors around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients. In fiscal year 2025, we delivered a strong year financially. We significantly elevated our competitive positioning, and we took our next big steps to position us for growth in the age of AI.\nWe grew 7% last year, which was adding $5 billion in revenue, with over $80 billion in bookings, and we did so against a macroeconomic backdrop that did not improve over FY 2024. Of that 7% growth, the majority was organic, and the growth was broad-based across markets, industries, and types of work. We also delivered strong Earnings Per Share growth and generated strong free cash flow, both above our guidance on an adjusted basis, and we returned a significant amount of cash to shareholders, an increase of 7% over FY 2024.\nWe took share at more than 5x our investable basket. How did we do it? We built on the rapid shift in our business we made by the end of FY 2024 to address the challenging market conditions. We then took action to fully capitalize on the competitive advantages we have built over a long period of time to deliver these results. These advantages include our ecosystem partnerships, our breadth of capabilities, our deep and trusted client relationships, our track record of investing in new skills and rotating our business with successive technology revolutions, and, of course, our ability to invest.\nOur strategy for more than a decade has been to be the number one partner for the tech ecosystem, and it's serving us well. Technology is front and center for every client, and in FY 2025, we continue to be the number one partner for all of our top 10 ecosystem partners by revenue. 60% of our revenue is from work that we do with these partners, which grew 9%, outpacing our overall revenue growth in FY 2025.\nThese partners are the world's largest technology tech companies by revenue, and they're seeking deeper and deeper partnerships with us as they look for help to turn their technology into business outcomes and scale the adoption of AI. We continue to be the reinvention partner of choice for our clients. Our deep and long-standing relationships mean we know our clients and their industries inside out.\nOur global footprint and breadth of capability means we can serve more of our clients' needs for large-scale transformations than any other player in the industry. We added 37 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in Q4 alone, bringing us to a record of 129 such bookings for the year, and we finished the year with 305 Diamond clients, our largest relationships. Our early and decisive decision in FY 2023 to invest significantly to become the leader in GenAI with a $3 billion multi-year investment is clearly paying off as we capture this new area of spend for our clients.\nIn FY 2025, we tripled our revenue over FY 2024 from GenAI and increasingly agentic AI to $2.7 billion, and we nearly doubled our GenAI bookings to $5.9 billion. As a reminder, these numbers only reflect revenue and bookings specifically related to advanced AI, which is GenAI, agentic AI, and physical AI, and do not include data, classical AI, or AI used in delivery of our services.\nWe're now going to use the term advanced AI as it encompasses the latest developments that are starting to gain traction. In addition to all we're doing around advanced AI, for over a decade, we have made disciplined inorganic investments to expand our market and fuel organic growth. For example, our capital projects business, which was initially built through several acquisitions around the world, is now a $1.2 billion business for us, and in FY 2025, it grew 49% year-on-year, largely organically.\nWhile delivering these results, we also took the next big steps in our reinvention for the age of AI. We are reinventing what we sell, how we deliver, how we partner, and how we operate Accenture. In short, on the ground, advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do. Let's review our reinvention to date. By definition, every new wave of technology has a time where you have to train and retool. Accenture's core competency is to do that at scale.\nOur clients cannot possibly build all of the expertise they need on their own. They need us to go first and fast. In FY 2023, we had 40,000 AI and data professionals, with roughly 30 people working on a handful of GenAI projects with negligible revenue. Today, we have 77,000 AI and data professionals. We've worked on more than 6,000 advanced AI projects just this year, and we delivered meaningful revenue in FY 2025.\nWe're also in the process of equipping all of our reinventors with the latest AI skills. Over 550,000 of our reinventors are already trained in the fundamentals of GenAI. We've already significantly embedded advanced AI into key platforms like GenWizard so that we are now delivering differently for our clients. We've reinvented our corporate functions to create additional investment capacity, among other benefits, and we'll now increasingly use advanced AI in the next chapter.\nIn FY 2025, we focused our new actions on the ecosystem, our talent strategy, and our growth model. We expanded our partnerships beyond the top 10 in AI and data and created new ones with companies that are becoming critical to many of our clients who also want to work with us to help them scale their relationships, and our revenue is growing in double digits with many of these partners.\nIn FY2026, we expect to increase our headcount overall across our three markets, including in the US and Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business. In addition to continuing to hire world-class talent, in FY 2025, we developed and are implementing a refreshed, robust, three-pronged talent strategy to rotate our workforce. We are investing in upskilling our reinventors, which is our primary strategy.\nWe are exiting on a compressed timeline. People we're reskilling based on our experience is not a viable path for the skills we need, and we're continuously identifying areas of how we operate Accenture to drive more efficiencies, including through AI, in order to create more investment capacity. Finally, our growth model. On 1 September, 2024, we launched reinvention services, which brings all of Accenture's capabilities into a single unit. Nearly 80% of our large deals are multi-service.\nThe model, as we fully roll it out, will make it faster and simpler to sell and deliver everything Accenture offers and to rotate our offerings to embed more AI and data, and equip our people. In summary, I am pleased with our strong results in FY 2025 and our positioning for FY 2026 and beyond. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which were at the top of our guided range,, and completed another strong year for Accenture. Our results reflect a relentless focus to consistently deliver on our shareholder value proposition while investing for long-term market leadership, and reinforce our role as a trusted reinvention partner for our clients and a leader in AI.\nNow, let me summarize a few highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 4.5% in local currency. Excluding the 1.5% impact from our federal business, our revenues grew 6% in Q4, and we continue to take significant market share at more than 5x, reflecting the relevance of our services and the strength of our diversified portfolio and execution. As a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about 1/3 of our addressable market.\nWe use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. Adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to adjusted Q4 results last year. We continue to drive margin expansion while making significant investments in our business and our people.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.03, which represents 9% growth compared to adjusted EPS last year. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.8 billion and returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends this quarter. Before I move on to the details of the quarter, I want to spend a moment on the six-month business optimization program we initiated in Q4, for which we recorded a charge of $615 million and expect to record an additional approximately $250 million in Q1 for a total of approximately $865 million over the period.\nThe business optimization program has two parts: one related to rapid talent rotation that Julie mentioned, which reflects severance associated with headcount reductions that we are making in a compressed timeline, and second, related to the divestiture of two acquisitions that are no longer aligned with our strategic priorities. These actions will result in cost savings, which will be reinvested in our people and our business.\nIn FY 2026, we expect to increase our headcount overall across all three markets, including in the US and in Europe, reflecting the demand we see in our business. Now, let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $21.3 billion for the quarter, representing 6% growth in US dollars and 3% growth in local currency, which is on top of the 24% growth in Q4 of last year.\nOverall book-to-bill was 1.2. Consulting bookings were $8.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.00. Managed services bookings were $12.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $17.6 billion at the top of our guided range, reflecting a 7% increase in US dollars and 4.5% in local currency. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.8 billion, up 6% in US dollars and 3% in local currency.\nManaged services revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8% in US dollars and 6% in local currency, driven by high single-digit growth in technology managed services, which includes application managed services and infrastructure managed services, and mid-single-digit growth in operations. Turning to our geographic markets. In the Americas, revenue grew 5% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, industrials, and software and platforms, partially offset by a decline in public service. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\nExcluding the 3% impact from our federal business, Americas grew 8% in local currency in the quarter. In EMEA, we delivered 3% growth in local currency, led by growth in insurance, life sciences, utilities, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services, partially offset by a decline in public service. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Spain, partially offset by a decline in Italy.\nIn Asia-Pacific, revenues grew 6% in local currency, driven by growth in banking and capital markets, public service, and utilities, partially offset by a decline in energy. Revenue growth was led by Japan and Australia. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.9% compared with 32.5% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.2% compared with 10.7% for the fourth quarter last year.\nGeneral and administrative expense was 6.6% compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that results in Q4 FY 2025 and Q4 FY 2024 include costs associated with business optimization actions, which impacted operating margin, tax rate, and EPS. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 15.1% adjusted operating margin, up 10 basis points compared with adjusted results in Q4 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.9% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 26.2% for the fourth quarter last year.\nAdjusted diluted Earnings Per Share were $3.03 compared with adjusted EPS of $2.79 in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting 9% growth. Days' sales outstanding were 47 days compared to 47 days last quarter, and 46 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.8 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.9 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $108 million.\nOur cash balance at 31 August was $11.5 billion compared with $5 billion at 31 August last year. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 1.6 million shares for $474 million at an average price of $295.45 per share. Also, in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $922 million.\nNow, I'd like to take a moment to summarize the year as we successfully executed our business to deliver or exceed all aspects of our original guidance that we provided last September on an adjusted basis. We delivered bookings of $80.6 billion, with a record 129 quarterly client bookings over $100 million and a book-to-bill of $1.2. Revenues of $69.7 billion for the year reflects growth of 7% in local currency, with nearly $5 billion in incremental revenue added this year.\nOur federal business was a 20 basis point headwind to our overall growth for the year. Consulting revenues were $35.1 billion, up 6% in US dollars and 5% in local currency. Managed services revenues were $34.6 billion, up 9% in both US dollars and in local currency, driven by 10% growth in technology managed services and 6% growth in operations. The following comparisons exclude the impacts of business optimization actions I noted earlier and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating margin of 15.6% was a 10 basis point expansion over our adjusted FY 2024 results. Adjusted Earnings Per Share were $12.93, reflecting 8% growth over adjusted FY 2024 EPS. Free cash flow of $10.9 billion was up 26% year-over-year, reflecting a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.4. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we returned $8.3 billion of cash to shareholders while investing approximately $1.5 billion across 23 acquisitions.\nIn closing, we feel good about how we manage our business while navigating the macro environment in 2025, and now we are laser-focused on executing and delivering fiscal 2026. Back to you, Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Angie. Today, we work across every major market with more than 9,000 clients, including the world's largest companies, 3/4 of the Fortune Global 100 and 500. As we look at the market, we have not seen any meaningful change, positive or negative, in the overall market. We are focused on delivering results regardless of the market conditions by being the most relevant to our clients. Relevance today requires leadership in AI.\nWe're working with companies early in their journey to use AI, which want our help to get them AI-ready and to leverage our assets and platforms to accelerate their ability to deploy AI, as well as to help them do what they can now to use AI, even when they're not fully ready across the enterprise. We also are working with companies far along their journey to be AI-ready and wanting to be the first to change the game with AI, even as its potential is still emerging.\nThe technology itself is new and rapidly changing, so across companies, they need help in understanding the tech landscape. This is where we are in the age of AI. It is very early innings, however you look at it, which means there is massive opportunity ahead for our clients, our ecosystem partners, and us. It is well recognized that advanced AI has taken the mind share of CEOs, the C-suite, and boards faster than any technology development we've seen in the past two decades.\nAt the same time, as reported widely, value realization has been underwhelming for many, and enterprise adoption at scale is slow other than with digital natives. This is why our clients are turning to us. We know that the gap between mind share and faster actual adoption is because the enterprise reinvention required to truly unlock the value of advanced AI is hard and has significant costs.\nThere is a huge difference between how we're all using AI in our individual lives that is incredibly easy and what it takes to use it in an enterprise. The opportunity for AI is at the intersection of business strategy and tech and org readiness. For most companies, the biggest gap between mind share and adoption is tech and org readiness. We're still in the thick of cloud, ERP, and security modernization. Data preparedness is nascent in many companies, and companies grapple with fragmented processes and siloed organizations.\nGenerations of leaders need new skills to understand how AI should inform their business strategy. The workforce needs new skills to use AI, and new talent strategies and related competencies must be developed. Helping clients with all of this work is what is driving our growth, and our pipeline of large-scale transformations continues to grow. We're also starting to see early signals of an inflection point, with more clients looking for true enterprise-wide plans and activation and seeking out our successful experience with scaling in enterprises and at Accenture.\nTwo years into this AI journey, we also are seeing a pattern in how AI can expand our opportunities with our clients. As some companies are making progress in creating AI readiness, it leads to even more work. Long-standing partnerships are deepening, and the demand for transformation is accelerating. For example, take a major financial services client we've worked with for over a decade. Their reinvention began with digital operations and cloud modernization.\nNow they've asked us to modernize their data estate, the foundation for scaling AI across the enterprise, from the contact center, marketing, finance, and the trading floor. As we begin to implement AI into many facets of their business, our relationship continues to grow as we retire legacy systems, transform core functions like HR, and risk, and build AI-centric capabilities to keep them ahead of shifting customer expectations.\nThis has meaningfully expanded the amount of work we do for this client, and in fact, over the past five years, the value of our contract has more than doubled. We're seeing more stories like this across our portfolio, where AI is extending across the enterprise and adjacent work is following. Our contracts are expanding, and our client relationships are compounding, creating a powerful, sustainable growth engine for Accenture.\nBuilding the Digital core remains our biggest growth driver. Only now, our clients understand that Accenture is bringing even more capabilities because we understand how the Digital core will enable them to use Advanced AI, and Advanced AI is now a new catalyst for doing the large-scale transformations of the Digital core in the first place. Taking an industry lens, let's look at banking. In banking, investment in Digital core modernization remains strong, with Cloud adoption accelerating as AI demand grows.\nHere's what it looks like in practice, and I'm particularly proud of this work because the scale is frankly breathtaking, and we were trusted by this client with mission-critical work. The Bank of England's Real-Time Gross Settlement Service, which lies at the heart of most electronic payments in the UK, was rebuilt on a modern digital core using private cloud and end-to-end automation. This upgrade improved security, reliability, speed, and scale.\nThe system now offers faster onboarding and secure APIs, giving more financial institutions safe access. It processes about $1 trillion in transactions every day, and in its first five months up to today, has handled 22.5 million transactions worth $110 trillion. For people, that means big payments like buying a home go through quickly and safely. This modernization strengthens a national platform, reducing risk and creating a trusted foundation for innovation.\nNow the system is ready for what's next, even the potential for the market adopting AI-driven payment services. Now let's take a horizontal lens across industries with security. Security is essential to a digital core, which is reflected in our 16% growth for the year. We're seeing increased demand for advanced cyber protection and more integrated intelligent security solutions that can fully harness AI's potential and keep pace with emerging threats.\nTo further strengthen our position, in the past quarter, we agreed to acquire CyberCX, our largest cybersecurity acquisition to date, which helps us in geographic expansion, bringing approximately 1,400 specialists in APAC and also bringing AI-powered security platforms, which are applicable globally. We also acquired IAM Concepts, a Canadian identity security specialist serving critical infrastructure, expanding the depth and regional reach of our managed security and identity capabilities that underpin secure AI adoption.\nNow let's look through the lens of our unique industry functional process and talent and org capabilities. These, coupled with our technology expertise, are making a difference to our clients. And these next two examples also demonstrate the pattern we're seeing in expanding our relationships due to advanced AI. Ecolab, a global sustainability leader, has been a client for 15 years.\nThree years ago, we partnered with Ecolab to lay the foundation for their growth transformation, One Ecolab, bringing the company together as one team to better serve customers, drive cross-sell and upsell, and improve operational efficiency. A year into that journey, we started working with Ecolab and its leadership to accelerate value with AI. Instead of executing one-off use cases, we redesigned the entire lead-to-cash process, the steps from generating a lead to collecting payment using nine scaled agentic AI agents.\nThese agents clean core data, resolve billing errors, and automatically match customer payments to the right billing invoices. In cash application alone, work that used to be 100% manual is now about 60% automated, reducing errors and speeding up processes. By using AI to streamline operations, Ecolab is on a path to deliver an estimated 5%-7% sales growth and 20% operating income margin without increasing costs at the same pace.\nBig picture, it supports the company's mission to deliver water, hygiene, and infection prevention solutions to more customers worldwide. We're partnering with a leading energy company, which has been a client for nearly two decades, to reinvent field operations with cloud, data, and GenAI. The challenge was scale, safety, cost, and sustainability, running thousands of wells with fragmented data and a leaner field workforce.\nWe unified data from more than 25 legacy systems into a single cloud-based digital core. On top of that, we built AI-powered scaled digital twins that monitor, optimize, and control the field in real time using our Accenture Industrial Intelligence Suite solution. That live view speeds decisions and improves safety, often without sending a technician on-site, while emissions are continuously monitored for compliance.\nThis solution is expected to reduce lost production by up to 2%-4%, increase productivity by up to 28%, and decrease costs by up to 22%. Field exposure and unplanned visits are also reduced, and emissions are expected to be lower. People can now focus on higher value work, and the business can respond faster to a changing energy landscape. Our scaled examples set the North Star.\nHere's an example of how our clients are starting to work with us for broader AI adoption across multiple areas to enable their business strategy. We've partnered with UOB, a leading bank in ASEAN, for nearly two decades on various initiatives, including multi-country application services rollouts to omnichannel enhancement. Today, we're helping them scale GenAI and use Agentic AI to transform customer experience and core operations.\nUsing our AI Refinery platform, we're supporting them in powering high-value use cases, customer engagement, risk management, and workforce enablement. This transformation enables faster, more personalized service, strengthens decision-making with predictive insights, accelerates response times, and enhances operational resilience. Together, we're positioning UOB to lead and create sustainable impact in the financial services industry.\nNow, an important part of our growth strategy is to be relevant to the core of our clients' industries, such as digital manufacturing, and to be relevant to their growth agenda. Industry X grew 10% and Song grew 8% in FY 2025. Both follow a similar pattern of needing a strong digital core and reinvention. The digitization of digital manufacturing and engineering and the use of AI and data to reinvent customer experience is still in the early days.\nWe're seeing strong demand across both areas and continue to invest both organically and inorganically. For example, we recently acquired Momentum ABM in the UK and Super Digital in the US, extending our edge in B2B, social, and influencer marketing. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we expect revenues to be in the range of $18.1 billion-18.75 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately +1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Our Q1 guidance reflects an estimated 1%-5% growth, including about a 1.5% impact from our federal business, with AFS contracting mid-teens.\nFor the full fiscal year 26, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be approximately positive 2% compared to fiscal 2025. For the full fiscal 2026, we expect revenue to be in the range of 2 to 5% growth in local currency over fiscal 2025, including an estimated 1%-1.5% impact from our federal business.\nExcluding the impact of federal, our revenue is expected to be an estimated 3%-6%. This year, we expect an inorganic contribution of about 1.5%, and we expect to invest about $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year 26 to be 15.7%-15.9%, a 10-30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 25 results. We expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5%-25.5%.\nThis compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2025. We expect our full-year adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share for fiscal 2026 to be in the range of $13.52-$13.90, or 5%-8% growth over adjusted fiscal 2025 results. For the full FY 2026, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $10.8 billion-$11.5 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $1 billion, and free cash flow to be in the range of $9.8 billion-$10.5 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. We expect to return at least $9.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, an increase of $1 billion, or 12% from FY 2025. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.63 per share to be paid on 14 November, a 10% increase over last year, and approved $5 billion of additional share repurchase authority. We remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash generated to shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Alexia?\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you please provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator 4\n\nAbsolutely. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you'd like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Today's first question comes from [Tin Jin Wong] with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks. Good presentation here. My first question I'll ask on visibility on revenue growth, if that's okay. Just love to hear your thoughts on visibility compared to the last couple of years, given the backlog, which is quite big with large deals. You have the pipeline, of course, and then what you're seeing on discretionary spending, given the economic backdrop as you see it.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Hi, [Tin Jin]. Good morning. Let me start with that. As we look at FY 2026, we feel really good about our positioning. And so, as you said, you saw our strong bookings of $80.6 billion in FY 2025 that positions us for FY 2026. We can see our backlog from the large deals. And if you look at our pipeline and looking at our pipeline, it's solid overall, and we see strong demand for our large transformation deals.\nFrom a discretionary perspective, what we've assumed is at the top end of the range, there's no change in discretionary spend, while at the bottom of the range, it allows for deterioration. By the way, as you think about our guidance of 2-5, excluding AFS, we're at 3-6 for the year.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. Thanks for that, Angie. Just maybe, Julie, I liked your AI remarks. Can you dig this? I'd like to dig in a little bit more, if you don't mind. Just give us your latest thoughts on AI-driven productivity and those gains and how they might unfold. I get that question quite a bit from investors. Do you see potential deflationary effects, and how might that impact Accenture services, both positively and negatively?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks. Great. Thanks, Tin Jin. We don't see AI as deflationary. We do see and are seeing it as expansionary, similar to every tech evolution we've been through. The move from an analog to digital, from on-prem to cloud, and SaaS, and as many of you who've been with us over the course of the years have known, in every successive tech evolution, we've become stronger.\nAnd so if you look at AI, we see the same thing. Yes, AI absolutely boosts efficiency in areas like coding or operations, but those savings don't disappear. They're being reinvested into new priorities. The list of what our clients want to do with technology is truly virtually unlimited. And so when we can save them money by delivering our services with advanced AI, that frees up their budget to do the next things on their list.\nAnd that's what they're doing. They're always going to those next priorities, and we're best positioned then to help them. That is how we delivered our 7% growth last year. I mean, two years in, we're seeing the pattern for how that journey to advanced AI is expanding our business. By the way, I will add that one of the most consistent things that I'm telling CEOs today is that their AI strategy has to focus on both growth and productivity.\nAlmost every CEO that I've talked to says they pivoted way too far toward productivity and not enough to growth, which, of course, we are helping them with things like Song. We give that advice really from our own experience in how we have successfully grown through every tech evolution, embracing the productivity on one side and then capturing the opportunity it creates on the other side by helping our clients.\n\n[Analyst] (JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Dave Cunningham with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Baird)\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Great job, and great to see GenAI bookings re-accelerate. A question, I guess, a little like Tin Jin's question. Just wanted to ask about the balance between GenAI and managed services. You do a ton of managed services work. You get to know client operations really well. You can probably go in and recommend GenAI work and gain a lot of share there, but then maybe displace some managed services. And how does that really balance between consulting and managed services over time, and does the net of it all push revenue and margins higher?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. Well, first, let me just kind of ground you in how we're thinking about consulting and managed services in FY 2026, just so we all have kind of the facts of how we're thinking about it in FY 2026. I'll give you some more color on how we see those things actually work in the market. So, Angie, you want to just ground them in the FY 2026 piece?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, David. Good morning. So overall, for our guidance for FY 2026, both consulting and managed services are balanced. We see both of them in the low to mid-single-digit range. So that's the context. Yeah.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nAnd then how it actually works out on the ground, right, is that as you think about enterprise-wide strategies, a lot of times what we're talking to our clients about is where do you invest and build proprietary capabilities, where do you want to buy capabilities, and where are you best situated to go faster because you're partnering and buying them through a managed service like Accenture.\nAnd so what we're seeing a lot of is, for example, companies that are really behind, they're not as far along in their tech journey, they need managed services because they simply can't go fast enough. It's not just a cost play. They want the cost take out, but they want to use everything we've invested in our platforms to get them to the Advanced AI. Similarly, in the core operations, things like digital manufacturing, supply chain, we're developing more and more managed services there in order to allow them to go faster.\nAnd so we see this kind of continuing to develop as we have over the last several years where managed services have become very strategic. They're not just a cost play. And of course, the more we can save them money in the way that we deliver, right, so using advanced AI, that allows them to then reinvest into the business. And so very similar patterns. Managed services, really, for the last five or six years has become a very important part to the strategy of companies and how to use advanced technology, now with advanced AI, faster.\n\n[Analyst] (Baird)\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nGreat. No, that's super helpful. And then maybe just quick follow-up. [Though], are you expecting a similar Q4 headwind through the first three quarters of this year and then anniversary it in Q4, and then kind of going forward, maybe not having much impact at all? Is that kind of how you're modeling it?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThat's exactly right. We expect it to anniversary at the end of Q3.\n\n[Analyst] (Baird)\n\nAnalyst, Baird\n\nAwesome. Thanks, guys. Nice job.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Fawcett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you very much. Appreciate all the incremental color and detail here from everybody. Wanted to ask, we see, at least in the forecast, a little bit of increase in CapEx, etc. Wondering if you can give us a little bit of detail where that investment is going and how we should expect that to play out further.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nSure. So, hi Jim. On our CapEx, we expect about $1 billion this year, which is about $400 million more than FY 2025. This is really about us expanding our real estate and leasehold improvements in certain geographies, certain major markets for us, because we're bringing more people back to the office, so. Yeah. That's why.\n\nJames Fawcett\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's kind of what I suspected. And then the second thing was just you mentioned, and we saw the re-acceleration in GenAI and bookings, etc. How is the pricing of those projects evolving, and has the velocity of projects transitioning from proof of concept to production changed at all?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYes. Let me just start on the pricing. For our GenAI projects and the pure GenAI that we were, or advanced AI that we've been talking about, we do see pricing that is accretive overall to Accenture's average.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. In terms of acceleration, in terms of kind of moving from proof of concept to production, right, we're seeing more and more now move into production because it's just we're helping them with the proof of concept, and then we're helping them scale. But you also are just continuously seeing companies that weren't as fast out of the block now starting proof of concept.\nSo it really is a cycle that many companies are going to go through. And you've got leaders who are way ahead. We've got other companies that are just getting started. And what I would say is, rather than a re-acceleration or deceleration, these things are going to be like everything. They're going to be lumpy, right, in terms of it. But what we really look at is the overall trend of how much growth that we are getting and our share of this new spend. Thanks.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, operator. Next question, please.\n\nOperator 4\n\nYes, ma'am. And our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nHi. Good morning. I too appreciate your prepared remarks. Really thought-provoking. I wanted to ask Julie about the way you're defining advanced AI. And I think if the transcript's right, you say GenAI, agentic AI, and physical AI. I'm actually asking about why you're saying you're not including data because we've sort of been trained that data is foundational. So why is the data component not in the definition of advanced AI?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nBecause what we're trying to share with you is how we're taking spend in a new market. And by the way, data is absolutely critical. In fact, one out of every two projects in GenAI, agentic AI, physical AI has significant data pull-through. So our data business is on fire, right? This is an absolutely critical area. Companies are just getting started.\nIt's nascent in many places. It's part of the digital core that we're building. It's just that to date, we've wanted to share with all of you transparently the really new areas. So data is part of the digital core that's growing. We've shared with you that 60% of our revenue is from the ecosystem partners. That's including the data. And look, going forward, now that advanced AI is, in fact, in all of the work, because it's either actual work or we're getting ready for the work, we'll think about how to share that.\nBut just to date, since this started for all of us, really from negligible revenue, we wanted to share how we've been specifically accelerating in the new area of spend.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nGot it. Thank you. And then going further, will you say that every new wave of technology has a time where you have to train and retool, and your core competence is to do that at scale? So I'm just wondering relative to prior technology, and you alluded to some of this in prior architectures, but how do you think about that requirement, which you have tremendous mindshare at, which is to do technology at scale? How do you think about this relative to some of the previous technological evolutions? Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nIt's going faster. I mean, there is so much demand, and the technology is moving faster. So the more advanced skills and the new types of skills are coming faster. And that's why we're being very decisive, right?\nUpfront, we said, \"We've got to start training everyone in the new skills.\" We're now saying, \"We've got to move faster to that.\" And also, remember that when we went into this, we'd already trained about 500,000 of our people on classical AI because going back to FY 2019, we said the next decade would be about tech cloud, data, and AI. So we start with a very strong base. And this is definitely moving faster than prior technology evolutions in terms of how fast the demand is coming and the importance of us really winning the talent rotation.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nPerfect. Thank you both.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Brian Bergen with TD Cowan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Bergen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, good morning. And thanks for the added detail in the slides here. My first question on GenAI impact: can you speak about client behavior in seeking to use GenAI and agentic solutions more themselves? You mentioned the efficiencies from the tech in areas like software development. So I'm curious if you're seeing more clients seeking to then benefit to do that more themselves versus with third parties.\nAnd I'm also curious if you've seen clients that thought they could do it themselves six, 12 months ago and then realize they do need help and they return to you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYes. And in fact, especially early on, because GenAI seems so simple, right? And then the reality is it's not the technology that is the biggest barrier. It is actually being able to get the mindset reorganized around how best to use it, the ability to do the change management, the process reinvention. If you think about your average company, their core competencies inside are not things like end-to-end process reinvention, right? You're hard-pressed to find a CEO that doesn't say, \"I feel like my organization is too siloed.\nI feel like we don't have the right way of managing our data.\" So we've had lots of clients who have started things on their own and then come to us who've got good proofs of concept that their team was able to do but then just can't scale it. I mean, I'm doing right now, just in the next few weeks, I'm personally leading a few different workshops with the entire C-suites of companies where the focus is, \"Share with us how do we actually scale it, and what can we really do now?\" Right?\nBecause we're a couple of years into this, we have a number of solutions which we're now doing repeatedly within industries and cross-industries. And our clients are looking for us to share that success so that they can start, stop just having their own team saying, \"Well, I have this idea, this idea,\" and saying, \"How can we actually get scale now?\"\n\nBrian Bergen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, follow-up on the business optimization plan. Can you talk about the assumed savings you expect to achieve from this optimization plan and how it may help you evolve your operations? I'm specifically curious if you see that kind of combined with GenAI adoption internally allowing you to operate at a sustainably higher utilization as that did take up this quarter.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nHi, Brian. I think that for overall, we expect savings of over $1 billion from our business optimization program, which we expect that we will reinvest in our business and in our people because it's so important for our future growth. So we expect to reinvest that while still delivering modest margin expansion.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Then in terms of kind of the connection, just making sure this particular, these moves are primarily due to our talent strategy. The other piece was an exit of a couple of non-strategic acquisitions. But on the talent strategy, it's more around, well, our number one strategy is upskilling. Given the skills we need, and we've had a lot of experience in upskilling, we're trying to, in a very compressed timeline where we don't have a viable path for skilling, sort of exiting people so we can get more of the skills in we need.\nThat's really not related to kind of the utilization piece in terms of it ticking up to 93%. We think it'll stay in the zone, right, and the low 90s to that, and it'll fluctuate a little bit. But to your point around sort of what can we do long-term, we are continuously looking at, as the technology matures, our new structure around reinvention services. We'll look to see, are there ways that we can use the technology to deliver our services and operate Accenture and its core better?\nAnd that's one of the reasons why we have the new reinvention services to really simplify how we're operating because that makes it much easier to start to use this AI. And so more to come as we fully roll out that model and identify new opportunities.\n\nBrian Bergen\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, next question, please.\n\nOperator 4\n\nAbsolutely. Our next question comes from Darren Peller, Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, guys. Thanks. It's good to hear from what it sounds like the pace of procurement change has calmed down a bit from the government side such that you can forecast those. I guess number one, just to verify that's where you feel more confident around forecasting on it. But then there's a lot of policy changes. Just wanted to touch on a couple and ask you your thoughts lately.\nNumber one, now that we have a little more clarity on tariffs, do you see more capital investment, especially in areas like products? Number two, maybe you could just comment on H-1B changes or potential changes. What are your thoughts around either wages or the pace of hiring of H-1Bs going forward and how it may or may not impact the business? And then just a quick one on healthcare and the big UFO bill, any impact you're seeing there. Thanks, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Well, thanks. So just quickly on federal, we do see procurement is now starting to pick up, although it's still slower than it has been in the past. The demand in federal is very much around modernization, consolidation, and efficiency. Tech is at the center, so lots of demand around ERP and platforms. Our position with the ecosystem is really key here, and our strategy to expand that partnership, those partnerships is also important.\nWe're really pleased with our new partnership with Palantir, which is really playing a critical role in federal. So we feel good about where we are in federal and our relevance to the administration's agenda. And that's what we're really focused on, is being relevant to our clients. So that's federal.\nOn capital investment, I would say it's still a little early, right? I mean, obviously, you've seen the improvement with the cut in interest rates. We're a global company, so there's a lot of stuff going on around the world. And so I think it's just a little bit too early to call yet how much this is going to open up on the capital investment. Of course, we're growing very significantly in taking advantage of the investments that are already happening, as you saw in our capital projects business.\nOn H-1B visas, for us, this is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and therefore really specialized experience and skills for our clients. So not something that is really a big impact on Accenture. And then whether it's healthcare or a lot of the different policy changes, remember, our business thrives by helping our clients navigate change, right?\nSo what we're seeing is that every time there's big policy changes, and this has been true for decades, right? That's why in our business, we have industry expertise. We have the functional expertise. And so when you have new compliance rules, etc., that usually drives more business for us. And so at this point, we see an opportunity to really stay close to our clients and help them navigate, take advantage, and comply with new policy changes. And that's true in healthcare, and it's really true across the board.\n\nAlexia Quadrani\n\nExecutive Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThat's great to hear. Thank you. Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator 4\n\nAbsolutely. And our final question comes from Jim Schneider at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Julie, I just wondered if I could follow on your comment. Do you expect headcount to grow during the course of the fiscal year across all regions? Can you maybe kind of frame for us the magnitude of that and the timing for it, given the context of some of the other business optimization actions you're seeing? Where would you expect headcount growth to land exiting the year, perhaps?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nI'll take that. Hey, Jim. Good morning. What I would tell you is we expect it to grow across all markets. We don't have a specific number that we're giving you, but based upon the demand that we see, we expect our headcount to grow.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. And then as a follow-up on that, if you could sort of maybe talk about the net impact of AI you're using internally to optimize your own work, your own business utilization, as I think you mentioned earlier, 93%, that's basically hitting a new record. But when would we expect to see that either reflected in even higher utilization or potentially gross margins, even though we know you don't manage directly to that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Remember, right now, our utilization is really a reflection of the kind of momentum in demand that we're seeing. You saw the bookings, right? And so our utilization, we would expect to continue to move around in the low 90s. So we don't have a structural change in utilization due to AI. We are already embedding AI, particularly in our big platforms like GenWizard, to drive efficiencies.\nAnd that's reflected in both our bookings and in our guide for the year. We're going to continue to be the leaders because that is what works, right? If you lead yourself, we're able to take that to our clients. We're able to show them how we're doing it and then help them do it in their business. So that's kind of how it's developing.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Julie Sweet for closing remarks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nTerrific. Thanks again, everyone, for joining. In closing, I just want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. We are working every day to earn your trust. And a huge thank you to all of our reinventors because you are why we are able to deliver these results. Thanks again.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Today's conference has now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Alexia, and to everyone joining this morning. And thank you to our more than 790,000 people around the world for your extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in another strong quarter of reinvention across industries, companies and countries.\nStarting with our quarter. We are very pleased with our results as we continue to deliver on our strategy to be our clients' reinvention partner of choice and lead in GenAI. Our clients continue to prioritize large-scale reinventions as reflected in our bookings of $19.7 billion, including 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. We grew 7% in local currency with revenue of $17.7 billion, above our guided range, and we continue to take market share on a rolling 4-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors which is how we calculate market share.\nWe are a leader in GenAI with another milestone quarter of $1.5 billion in bookings and over $700 million in revenues bringing our Q3 year-to-date GenAI bookings to a total of $4.1 billion and revenue to $1.8 billion. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points compared to adjusted operating margin last year, and we delivered EPS growth of 12% over Q3 FY '24 adjusted EPS. We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas. We invested in our people with 38 million training hours year-to-date, up 18% over the same period last year.\nWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 75,000 continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of FY '26. We invested over $297 million across 4 strategic acquisitions and investments. We are expanding our Learn Vantage capability through this quarter's acquisitions of Talent print in India and Ascendiant in the United States, enhancing our ability to deliver industry relevant certifications and tailored upskilling and reskilling programs.\nIn Japan, we acquired Umami, which strengthens [indiscernible] ability to craft, launch and scale digital products that are both intelligent and impactful. We are also investing in our industry X capabilities with the acquisition of [indiscernible] in Scotland, expanding our infrastructure and capital projects expertise globally and across Europe. We are proud to have earned the #6 spot on the Great Place to Work list of the world's best workplaces and to have been recognized as a great place to work in 12 individual countries, representing nearly 80% of our people. And in recognition of our strong brands, we are proud to have earned the #20 position on Cancer Brands prestigious list of the top 100 most valuable global brands.\nOur brand value has increased by 27% to $103.8 billion, up from $81.9 billion last year. A key component of our long-term strategy is investing and maintaining thriving communities and creating pipelines of talent the skills we need, which are important for businesses to thrive. In the U.K., one of our largest markets, we are supporting a government initiative to create a coalition with 10 other companies focused on upskilling 7.5 million people, 1/5 of the U.K. workforce in AI skills, breaking down barriers to opportunity and unlocking economic growth. I'm also thrilled to congratulate our 97,000 people who were promoted this fiscal year including more than 800 who are promoted to Managing Director.\nIn summary, we had a strong quarter. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nManaging Director & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. we are very pleased with our third quarter results with revenue above our guided range as well as very strong margin expansion, EPS growth and free cash flow.\nThese results reflect the diversity and resilience of our business and demonstrate our ability to deliver significant value for our shareholders. Based upon the strength of our results, we once again raised our full year revenue outlook, and we are on track to deliver or exceed all aspects of our guidance provided in September.\nLet me summarize a few highlights from the quarter. Revenues grew 7% in local currency and continued to be broad-based across geographic markets, industry groups and both types of work. Seven of our 13 industries grew high single digit or higher in the quarter, and our federal business had an immaterial impact to our overall growth in Q3 and we continue to take market share, reflecting the strength of our diversified portfolio and execution.\nOperating margin of 16.8% for the quarter, an increase of 40 basis points compared to adjusted Q3 results last year and includes significant investments in our people and our business. We delivered EPS in the quarter of $3.49, reflecting a 12% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.5 billion and returned $2.7 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Nine months into the fiscal year, we have invested $789 million, primarily attributed to 15 acquisitions.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $19.7 billion for the quarter, a 6% decrease in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1.\nConsulting bookings were $9.1 billion with the book-to-bill of 1.0, Managed Services bookings were $10.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.2. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $17.7 billion, an 8% increase in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency, above our FX-adjusted guided range as the foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately positive 0.5% compared with a negative 0.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9 billion, up 7% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currency.\nManaged services revenues were $8.7 billion, up 9% in both U.S. dollars and in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in technology managed services, which includes application managed services and infrastructure managed services and mid-single-digit growth in operations.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In the Americas, revenue grew 9% in local currency. Growth was led by banking and capital markets, Industrial and Health. Revenue growth was driven by the United States. In EMEA, we delivered 6% growth in local currency, led by growth in Life Sciences, Banking and Capital Markets and insurance. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. In Asia Pacific, revenue grew 4% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, banking, capital markets and insurance, partially offset by a decline in chemicals and natural resources.\nRevenue growth was led by Japan and Australia, partially offset by a decline in Singapore. Moving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared to 33.4% for the third quarter of last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.9% compared to 10.6% for the third quarter last year.\nGeneral and administrative expense was 6.1% compared to 6.3% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q3 of FY '24, we recorded $77 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions which decreased operating margin by 40 basis points and EPS by $0.08. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nOperating income was $3 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 16.8% operating margin, a 40 basis point increase from adjusted operating margin in Q3 of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5% for the third quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.49 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $3.13 in the third quarter last year, reflecting 12% growth.\nDays services outstanding were 47 days compared to 48 days last quarter and 43 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.5 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.7 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $169 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $9.6 billion compared with $5 billion at August 31. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 6 million shares for $1.8 billion at an average price of $302.35 per share.\nAs of May 31, we had approximately $3.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $924 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on August 15, a 15% increase over last year.\nIn closing, we feel very good about our results in Q3 and are now working hard to deliver Q4 and continuing to operate our business with rigor and discipline.\nAnd now let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Angie. Let me start with the environment in which our clients are operating today. Stating the obvious, as we shared last quarter, we continue to see a significantly elevated level of uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment as compared to calendar year 2024.\nIn every boardroom in every industry, our clients are not facing a single challenge. They are facing everything at once. Economic volatility, geopolitical complexity, major shifts in customer behavior. In these times, our clients need us more than ever. They look to us to help them build resilience and deliver results to not really navigate the environment, they want to thrive and be the first to reshape their industries. To do so, all roads lead to reinvention.\nGen AI has been a catalyst for reinvention because the power of Gen AI has created the opportunity to meet challenges in new ways and is creating new opportunities to achieve even better results than any single technology in the Internet era and yet Gen AI alone is just a tool. The work needed to use Gen AI to create value at scale is substantial. We are working with our clients using all of our reinvention expertise our deep understanding of how to build a cognitive brain for the enterprise and our deep understanding of data, every function in the enterprise, industries and change as well as our own experience reinventing Accenture. The breadth and depth of our capabilities across industries and solutions that use all of our services is clear in the examples I will highlight today.\nWe are working with Air France-KLM, a global leader in aviation on a digital transformation that will redefine how they operate and serve millions of travelers worldwide by using the power of cloud, data and AI. As part of a multiyear partnership, we will help them move away from proprietary data centers and migrate their legacy applications to the cloud. This work is expected to unlock new efficiencies across passenger flights, cargo services and aircraft maintenance to improve the traveler experience.\nIt will drive faster decision-making using real-time insights and a scalable platform to quickly deploy additional resources when there is a spike in demand and we have already delivered value by successfully deploying over 400 apps using a proven governance model that accounts for the company's need for safety, reliability and resilience to disruptions. With a more agile digital foundation in place, Air France-KLM will be setting the stage for growth through continuous reinvention and the creation of new value. We are advancing our partnership with Vincanteria, 1 of the world's largest shipbuilders to accelerate digital transformation across the maritime industry, helping the sector navigate growing complexity, rising operational demands and the urgent need for sustainability.\nCombining our deep expertise in digital platforms, AI and connected and intelligent operations, we're building Navis Sapiens an AI-powered ecosystem designed to make ships smarter and more integrated. This includes building application services that streamline how ships operate and are maintained, creating a secure AI-powered platform and establishing a marketplace where maritime companies can share digital solutions. For example, a next-generation cruise or naval ship will use a digital twin and IoT sensor network to simulate and monitor vessel core systems. This, coupled with real-time data exchange between ports, ships and shipyards will support AI-driven diagnostics like predictive maintenance and energy management such as fuel efficiency to create a more resilient and sustainable infrastructure.\nThe first AI equipped ship is expected to launch for the end of 2025, demonstrating how we're helping Fincontaria set a new bench work for innovation in capital-intensive industries. We partnered with Nationwide Building Society, 1 of the U.K.'s leading financial institutions and the world's largest building society transformed their cybersecurity operations and stay ahead of evolving threats. We built a cloud-based GenAI-powered security information and event management capability and migrated hundreds of terabytes of security logs and detection use cases to help them achieve a streamlined security infrastructure.\nThis is expected to fast track the deployment process by 40% compared to traditional methods while maintaining full operational continuity. Now Nationwide has a future-ready security operations center that can detect cyber sets faster than before, reduce manual effort required from its cybersecurity team and enhanced business resilience, laying the foundation for future adoption of automation and Gen AI in its security ecosystem.\nOur clients continue to take advantage of Gen AI as one of the ways they can accelerate their reinvention, and we see many clients successfully scaling Gen AI to create value today. We are deepening our partnership with Pfizer, one of the world's top pharmaceutical and biotech companies to lead the next wave of reinvention, using Gen AI and Agentic technologies to transform operations, empower talent and accelerate digital maturity.\nThrough our Gen Wizard platform, we are reimagining how technology managed services are delivered by embedding AI into the process to reduce redundancy, lower costs and increase efficiencies. We are also integrating components of AI refinery into the Gen Wizard platform to help the company implement Agentic AI and zero ops automation. Now intelligent agents will proactively monitor and resolve issues bringing up support teams to focus on higher-value work. For example, when an employee encounters a system issue, an Agentic AI agent can instantly identify similar past cases resolve the ticket automatically and take steps to prevent such issues in the future, reducing manual effort and improving speed to resolution. And through our Learn managed services, we are training the company's digital employees on leveraging Agentic-AI to drive operational facilities, efficiencies, foster joint ownership and enable seamless adoption. This transformation is helping Pfizer set a new standard for how digital and AI technologies and capabilities accelerate innovation and drive efficiencies to bring medicines to patients faster.\nWe are continuing our work with [indiscernible] an integrated mine to pigment global market leader to reimagine operations using AI-driven solutions that will enhance data trust productivity and operational agility. Together, we will build a cloud-based standardized data foundation as the backbone for the company's digital core. Using our AI refinery platform, we will launch a new set of services based on high-value priority Gen AI and agentive use cases, focusing on productivity, site efficiency and workforce enablement. For example, a sales and marketing adviser to streamline customer segmentation, a knowledge assistant to unify institutional knowledge across global sites and an asset management tool to proactively identify and resolve operational issues. The platform will also support process control and decision-making using data to enable predictive insights, faster response times and improved operational stability.\nOur collaboration means [indiscernible] is positioned to achieve long-term differentiation in the pigment manufacturing industry. We are continuing our work with Vale, a Brazilian mining and logistics company to transform its environmental licensing program, accelerating permit applications and advancing its sustainability goals. We've now expanded smart licensing an end-to-end management platform to support greater scale and functionality. Using generative AI, the platform scans application materials and environmental studies to help ensure compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements. Building on this foundation, we've continually introduced new features and enhance the platform's intelligence and business value. These include tailoring checklist for applicants based on project type and location, automating document validation steps and deploying AI-powered chatbots to assist users throughout the licensing process.\nTogether, these improvements have significantly reduced internal review time and improve submission quality while minimizing rework with demand areas. With our broad capabilities, across everything needed to serve the customer from creative to industry expertise to technology and, of course, the latest in AI, we are helping clients shape new growth opportunities. We are collaborating with Nestle, a global leader in food and beverage with well-known brands like Purina, Nescafe, Dolce Gusto and Nespresso to accelerate its digital transformation journey using AI-powered digital twins to meet the growing demand for personalized high-quality content.\nIn partnership with Accenture Song, we've developed a secure cloud-based platform that creates 3D virtual replicas of physical products to streamline content creation and localization Nestle's marketing experts can now generate campaign ready assets without repeated reshoots, digitally adjusting packaging and integrating products into formats tailored to each channel and market. With thousands of digital assets already created, Nestle is reducing the time and cost of scaling digital twins by over 70%, accelerating production intense and quality and keeping their iconic brands top of mind.\nAccenture Song also is helping a Fortune 100 high-tech company transform its sale and marketing functions to meet the demands of a fast-evolving business landscape. With increasing pressure to improve execution, the company's focus on simplifying structure, reducing cost and unifying efforts across regions under a leaner, more agile approach powered by an integrated customer data layer. Together, we're shaping a future-ready model that brings greater integration across sales and marketing. Accelerating speed to market, increasing efficiency through automation and shared services, driving value through Gen AI and agentic architecture. By focusing on data, AI, customer experience and simplified ways of working Song is helping this leading company strengthen execution, enhanced creative impact and deliver lasting business results. I hope these examples have brought to life the amazing work on which we have the privilege of partnering with our clients and the technology ecosystem.\nWe are able to do this quarter in and quarter out because we invest in having great people and in building extraordinary capabilities across our services, developing deep industry and functional expertise, creating world-class AI-enabled assets and platforms like Gen Wizard, the AI refinery in SynOps and by investing in our unmatched technology ecosystem partnerships and then we bring all of these capabilities together as solutions for our clients that deliver measurable value, which brings me to the exciting news we announced today for how we are changing our growth model so that we can be the most AI-enabled, client-focused great place to work in the industry and capture the massive opportunity we see for our clients, technology partners and Accenture.\nStarting September 1, we are bringing all of our services, strategy consulting, Song, technology and operations together into a single integrated business unit called reinvention Services. Once we fully implement our new model, we will be able to bring more leading solutions faster and embed data in AI more easily into our solutions and delivery. We will also be able to help our people learn and imply AI more easily as this technology continues to evolve quickly. We will continue to manage our business through our geographic markets, the Americas, EMEA and APAC and go-to-market by industry. I'm excited about these changes and how they will fuel our growth.\nBack to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nManaging Director & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Julie. Now let me turn to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '25, we expect revenues to be in the range of $17 billion to $17.6 billion. This has seen the impact of FX will be approximately positive 2.5% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '24 and reflects an estimated 1% to 5% growth in local currency. I'd also like to provide some additional context on our guidance for Q4.\nAs it relates to our federal business, we saw an immaterial impact to our overall growth in Q3 and our best estimates right now include about a 2% headwind overall in Q4.\nMoving to full fiscal '25. Based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be positive 0.2% compared to fiscal '24. For the full fiscal '25, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 6% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal '24. We expect our inorganic contribution for the full year to be about 3%, and we now expect to invest about $1 billion to $1.5 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year.\nFor operating margin, we now expect fiscal year '25 to be 15.6%, a 10 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '24 results. We now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal '24. We now expect our full year diluted earnings per share for fiscal '25 to be in the range of $12.77 to $12.89 or 7% to 8% growth over adjusted fiscal '24 results.\nFor the full fiscal '25, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.6 billion to $10.3 billion property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $9 billion to $9.7 billion. Our free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2.\nFinally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash for shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Alexia?\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThanks Angie, I would ask to you ask 1 question and a followup to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator would you provide instructions for those on the call?"

As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining this morning. And thank you to our more than 800,000 people around the world for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in a very strong quarter creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. Starting with our quarter, we are very pleased with our results as we continue to deliver on our strategy to return to strong growth in FY25. I will share some highlights from the quarter and then turn to an update on new developments since we were together in December in our federal business and the current environment more broadly.\nOur clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, and we are their reinvention partner of choice, as reflected in our bookings of $20.9 billion, including 32 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. We grew 8.5% in local currency with revenue of $16.7 billion at the top end of our guided range, and we continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share. We had another milestone quarter in GenAI with $1.4 billion in new bookings and approximately $600 million in revenue.\nOperating margin contracted 20 basis points compared to adjusted operating margin last year, and we delivered EPS growth of 2% over Q2 FY24 adjusted EPS. We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas, with over $250 million deployed primarily across six strategic acquisitions, and we invested in our people with approximately 15 million training hours this quarter, designed to help us bring the latest in solutions and technology to our clients, provide our people with marketable skills, and reinvent our services using GenAI.\nWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 72,000, continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of FY26. We continue to invest in creating and maintaining thriving communities, which is a component of our long-term growth strategy. This quarter in India, we launched a transformative hospitality skilling program in collaboration with our client, Marriott International, which prepares disadvantaged youth for entry-level jobs in the hospitality sector, including training for digital skills.\nBecause we help our clients execute on some of their most important priorities, and we need to attract and retain the best people, recognition of Accenture as an ethical and admired company is critical for our clients' confidence and to attract these great talents.\nWe are pleased that we have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 18th year in a row, and for the third consecutive year, we ranked number one in our industry and among the top five overall in JUST Capital's America's Most JUST Companies. In addition, thanks to our clients, partners, and the wider business community, we earned the number one position in our industry for the 12th year in a row and number 30 overall, our highest stint on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. Now for two updates. First, Accenture Federal Services.\nFederal represented approximately 8% of our global revenue and 16% of America's revenue in FY24. As you know, the new administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently. During this process, many new procurement actions have slowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue. In addition, recently, the General Services Administration has instructed all federal agencies to review their contracts with the top 10 highest-paid consulting firms contracting with the US government, which includes Accenture Federal Services.\nThe GSA's guidance was to terminate contracts that are not deemed mission-critical by the relevant federal agencies. While we continue to believe our work for federal clients is mission-critical, we anticipate ongoing uncertainty as the government's priorities evolve and these assessments unfold. Based on our significant experience across federal and commercial clients, we see major opportunities over time for us to help consolidate, modernize, and reinvent the federal government to drive a whole new level of efficiency.\nSecond, in recent weeks, we are seeing an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty in the global economic and geopolitical environment, marking a shift from our Q1 FY25 earnings report in December. At the same time, we believe the fundamentals of our industry remain strong, and we are very well positioned with our clients because all strategies continue to lead to reinvention through new ways of working, tech, data, and AI. We are confident in executing our strategy to help clients reinvent. As you would expect, we are laser-focused on bringing tremendous value to our clients.\nOur strengths lie in our agility as the market we operate in changes, utilizing our deep client and ecosystem relationships and our leading position in GenAI and technology more broadly. We are also well-diversified across markets, industries, and types of work, which enables us to continue to lead in a changing market context as we have done before. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased with our results in the second quarter, particularly our continued strong top-line growth, which was once again broad-based across geographic markets, industry groups, and consulting and maintenance services. Let me begin by summarizing a few highlights from the quarter. Revenues grew 8.5% in local currency, which was at the top end of our guided range, with nine of our 13 industries growing high single-digit or higher. We continue to take market share.\nWe delivered EPS in the quarter of $2.82, reflecting 2% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Operating margin of 13.5% for the quarter decreased 20 basis points compared to adjusted Q2 results last year and includes significant investments in our people and our business.\nFinally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.7 billion and returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. In the first half of the year, we have invested almost $500 million, primarily attributed to 11 acquisitions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $20.9 billion for the quarter, a 3% decrease in US dollars and flat in local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of $1.3. Consulting bookings were $10.5 billion, with a book-to-bill of $1.3. Maintenance services bookings were $10.4 billion, with a book-to-bill of $1.2.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.7 billion, a 5% increase in US dollars and 8.5% in local currency. The foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately negative 3% compared with the negative 2.5% estimate provided last quarter.\nConsulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, up 3% in US dollars and 6% in local currency. Maintenance services revenue were $8.4 billion, up 8% in US dollars and 11% in local currency, driven by double-digit growth in technology-maintenance services, which includes application-maintenance services and infrastructure-maintenance services, and high single-digit growth in operations. Turning to our geographic markets. In Americas, revenues grew 11% in local currency. Growth was led by banking and capital markets, industrial, health, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services.\nRevenue growth was driven by the United States. In EMEA, we delivered 8% growth in local currency, led by growth in public service, life sciences, and consumer goods, retail, and travel services. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom. In Asia Pacific, revenue grew 1% in local currency, driven by growth in insurance and utilities, partially offset by a decline in chemicals and natural resources.\nRevenue growth was led by Japan, partially offset by a decline in Singapore. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 29.9% compared to 30.9% for the second quarter last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.1% compared with 10.3% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.3% compared to 6.9% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q2 of last year, we recorded $115 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.14.\nThe following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Operating income was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting a 13.5% operating margin, a 20 basis point decrease from adjusted operating margin in Q2 of last year.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 18.8% for the second quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $2.82 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.77 in the second quarter last year, reflecting 2% growth. Days sales outstanding were 48 days compared to 50 days last quarter, and 43 days in the second quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2.7 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.9 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $171 million.\nOur cash balance at 28 February was $8.5 billion compared with $5 billion at the end of 31 August. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4 million shares for $1.4 billion at an average price of $361.16 per share.\nAs of 28 February, we had approximately $5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $929 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year. And our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on 15 May, a 15% increase over last year. And now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Angie. Starting with the demand environment, our clients continue to be focused on reinvention, and GenAI is a catalyst for reinvention. They're focused on building the digital core, with more AI being built in, which is driving our growth, and on areas such as the customer and core operations, including supply chain and Industry X. For our clients, the twin themes of achieving both cost efficiency and growth continue. The number of clients embracing GenAI is increasing significantly, and we are starting to see some tangible examples of scale in data and AI.\nWe are partnering with Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications company, to create a new joint venture to accelerate its data and AI roadmap and fast-track the business into a new era of AI-driven reinvention. Through the joint venture, we will work together to simplify and modernize their data systems and set up a comprehensive AI foundation to deploy advanced AI solutions across their organization. Value-driving AI use cases have been identified across the business that are suitable for scaling and will enhance network resilience, deliver seamless connectivity, and better customer experience.\nUsing our AI refinery platform, we will reimagine business processes by implementing identical AI. Specialized AI tools will support their employees to work smarter and faster, and teams to operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, we will help evolve Telstra's Data and AI Academy, a company-wide upskilling initiative leveraging our learning and development programs, helping to build data and AI fluency and future critical skills across its workforce.\nBuilding on Telstra's globally leading responsible AI practices, the JV is designed to sustain and improve on this by identifying and mitigating AI risks while building trust and adoption as it scales AI across the organization. This partnership with Telstra illustrates to clients that there are creative ways to accelerate their own use of data and AI. Clients in Australia from banking, retail, and utilities are working with us to design their own innovative ways to jump-start their reinvention with data and AI.\nWe continue to see our clients building their digital core as a foundation for reinvention and increasingly asking us to incorporate emerging technologies like AI as well as data into this work. Cloud saw double-digit growth this quarter, and security had very strong double-digit growth. We are working together with a multinational food processing company to help reinvent themselves as a data-driven organization, revolutionizing their enterprise.\nThis includes the end-to-end supply chain and frontline sales function to support rapid growth. Our unique partnership model uses our library of AI and GenAI assets to quickly deliver productivity, with the potential of generating over $0.5 billion in value to self-fund their reinvention. The savings are reinvested into an ongoing build-out of a robust digital core, which becomes the foundation to support and enable any new technologies, processes, or systems the company may adopt in the future.\nFor example, the company is using GenAI to forecast inventory risks and generate next best action recommendations, saving them millions of dollars annually. If excess inventory on a product is selling slower than expected in a region, GenAI tools proactively prompt a promotional sale or halt production before the inventory results in a margin loss.\nIn another instance, an AI-based communication platform was deployed that eliminates up to five different language barriers between supervisors and frontline workers in plants, reducing costly errors from miscommunications and delays. With many households having at least one of their products, this company's commitment to ongoing transformation will position them to continue to build, design, and run a future-ready enterprise, rethink work, and drive innovation.\nWe are helping one of the world's largest auto manufacturers modernize their security operations to protect the company's critical IT systems and stay ahead of the rapidly evolving security landscape. We will implement a modern threat detection and response platform that will enable the company to integrate its data across the enterprise, identifying cyber threats and responding to incidents faster.\nWe are building a new GenAI security engine on Accenture's MySecurity platform, which will help automate cloud migration tasks, moving the threat detection capability from the legacy platform to the new one without interruption. This is expected to increase the company's operational excellence, enhance cyber resiliency, increase risk visibility, and drive a significant improvement in efficiency. With the new platform, the company will be able to better safeguard digital assets, including information critical to automotive design and manufacturing.\nThis collaboration will help better protect the company, its partners, and customers, setting the stage for advanced AI, smart manufacturing, and increased innovation. To capture the value of technologies like generative AI, companies need a digital core. And now, to stay ahead and truly scale AI, companies also need what we call a cognitive digital brain, an always-on and always-learning system, as we shared in our Tech Vision 2025.\nOur industry expertise is critical to building the digital core and digital brain. A deep knowledge of the processes today and how they can be reinvented for tomorrow is key. Our proven track record of digital transformation and our ability to bring experience in strategy, consulting, industry, process, and technology services, and decades of experience in managed services for our clients, allows us to truly reinvent using AI, including digital agents, to create transformational value at scale.\nWe are deepening our partnership with Repsol, a leading multi-energy company and a client for more than a decade, to advance its digital program and scale agentic AI, reinventing key business operations to drive sustainable growth. Over the past three years, we have built a secure cloud-based digital core with a unified data foundation.\nNow, we will use our AI refinery platform to deploy customized AI agents across functions such as planning, forecasting, and customer service, making processes more dynamic and less complex. Employees will be able to work more efficiently and provide customers with accurate, personalized products and services. For example, AI agents can analyze available data to offer timely and relevant bundled energy solutions, enhancing Repsol's position as an integrated provider. We will upskill employees in AI and digital technologies through an expanded training program to support adoption.\nWe are also exploring digital twins and robotic solutions to enhance planned maintenance and other tasks in industrial and logistics centers. Repsol is positioning itself as an early adopter of AI in the energy sector, increasing efficiency, boosting productivity, and promoting new ways of working to better serve customers.\nThe transformation and digitization of manufacturing is an important area of growth, and Industry X grew high single digits this quarter. We are working with KION a global leader in supply chain solutions, to use AI-powered digital twins to create smarter, safer, and more adaptable warehouses that can evolve with the world around them and handle nearly any supply chain challenge, marking the next digital frontier. Picture a busy warehouse during peak shopping season, workers navigating narrow aisles and conveyor belts, forklifts loading and unloading freight.\nNow, imagine robots working seamlessly with human teams to fulfill orders faster and more safely. We are making this a reality by creating digital versions of physical assets such as conveyors and forklifts and integrating autonomous robots with human workers on an AI-driven platform that accurately simulates millions of complex factory processes to help ensure safety and avoid disruptions before robots hit the factory floor. We are also predicting and adapting to real-world challenges as they happen, such as how events like Black Friday sales or a product going viral might affect warehouse operations, adjusting robot brains in real time.\nWith these advancements, warehouse workers' responsibilities will evolve as they work alongside AI systems, making them more desirable candidates for higher skilled roles. Song grew double digits this quarter as more clients seek to reinvent customer and experience.\nWe have the unique ability to integrate creative, data and AI, tech, and strategy while leveraging our industry and operations expertise to unlock marketing and sales as a growth enabler for our clients while delivering efficiencies. We are partnering with a multinational conglomerate in the communications industry to streamline and optimize their media strategy and operations for their mobile division. We've implemented a new digital platform with a unified data foundation, which will provide transparency and real-time access to expedite campaign positions.\nThe company will also reduce the number of media agencies to a single partner, Accenture Song, to maximize media spend outcomes. Accenture's marketing operations managed services will leverage automation and AI to increase efficiencies in manual routine tasks, which will allow employees to focus on more strategic work.\nThese changes will also allow the company to shift from focusing solely on media-related data to incorporating broader insights to make more strategic and informed decisions that benefit the entire company, such as predicting customer content preferences, which can drive more efficient media placement and sales. Talent continues to be at the top of the agenda for CEOs and governments, and reinvention requires working in new ways and the development of new skills. LearnVantage positions us to be able to help clients develop talent and skills to drive future growth.\nOur clients are using LearnVantage to strengthen learning development, turbocharging the learner's experience. For example, we are bridging the skills gap and creating certification pathways for learners using LearnVantage in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This will fast-track their careers and support their adoption of GenAI.\nA big-box retailer has accelerated learning opportunities for entry-level to highly technical skill sets, deepened understanding of current industry skills by role, needs by role, and empowered employees with guided learning based on the skills they need for their role. Finally, a look at how we continue to execute on our goal to strategically deploy $2 to 3 billion in BNA this fiscal year. We are investing in our Industry X and supply chain capabilities with our acquisitions this quarter of AOX and Staffan AG in Germany.\nWe also acquired IQT Group in Italy, a managed services provider, which will help utility providers build and modernize integrated electricity and water networks. To continue to lead in GenAI, we acquired Hafspace in Denmark to help our clients in the Nordics region leverage and scale AI to make better, more informed decisions faster.\nTo enable us to scale faster in financial services, we acquired Altus Consulting in the UK, a leader in consulting and digital transformation. Also, this quarter, we purchased a digital twin technology platform for banks from Proscipient, a Singapore-based fintech company with deep expertise in banking technology transformation. Back to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Before I get into the details of our outlook, as Julie mentioned, we have seen an elevated level of uncertainty, including in our federal business. Because this change is very recent, our revenue guidance range for both Q3 and the full year reflects our best view based upon what we see today, which may evolve differently from our estimates and assumptions. With that said, let me turn now to the business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.9 to 17.5 billion.\nThis assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 0.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and reflects an estimated 3% to 7% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2025, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2024. For the full fiscal 2025, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 5% to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal 2024. We continue to expect an inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3%, with about 4% in the first half and about 2% in the second half.\nWe now expect to invest about $2 to 3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2025 to be 15.6 to 15.7%, a 10 to 20 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2024 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2024. We now expect our full-year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of $12.55 to $12.79, or 5% to 7% growth over adjusted fiscal 2024 results.\nFor the full fiscal 2025, we continue to expect operating cash flow in the range of $9.4 to 10.1 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.8 to 9.5 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. As we move into the second half of the year, we remain laser-focused on managing our business with rigor and discipline. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If your question has already been addressed and you'd like to remove yourself from queue, please press star then two. Our first question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for all of this. So I just wanted to start outside of US federal, so the other 92% of the business. Can you just clarify to what extent you are or are not seeing clients hit the pause button at all on new initiatives, any change in pace of converting pipeline to backlog or backlog into revenue? I can certainly appreciate that your tone's a little bit more cautious. Maybe the visibility isn't quite as high, but are you seeing tangible signs of any pause in client activity at this point in time?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Jason. Good morning. Thanks for your question. For us, there's really, we've seen no change overall. Yeah.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nAs you can imagine, some of these changes are relatively recent, and so we're in a lot of discussions. In some cases, those discussions are about accelerating, particularly in the cost discussions, right? Like, can we go a little faster to get to our programs for places where we're contracting? We are at the heart of many of the discussions where businesses are trying to process what this might mean. But we're not seeing any pauses now.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. We got to watch and wait on that. Let's go to US federal just for a minute. Can you just clarify for us what the growth rate was in US federal revenue in the quarter and what you're assuming for the second half of the year in US federal?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nJason, why don't I take that? Because I think it's important to give a little bit of context on our Q3 and our full-year guidance. Certainly, as it relates to Q2 specifically for federal, we really don't provide that during the year. As you know, we provide that at the end of the year. So let me just start with, because I do think this is important, when you think about we were really pleased with the quarter, our second quarter, and the first half of the year. For the second quarter, we did deliver revenue at the top end of our range. We're very pleased that we were able to update our guidance to 5% to 7% by taking off the bottom. Why is that?\nSo, pleased with how our business is positioned with the larger deals coming online, which was a very deliberate part of our strategy. And then, as you think about Q3 and the full year, it includes our current estimates and assumptions of the potential impacts of federal and the overall environment. And then, if I just break apart organic and inorganic, from an inorganic contribution, we continue to expect a bit over 3% with H2, about 2%, which is consistent with what we shared last quarter in our assumptions.\nAnd then, for the year, what that means is, from an organic perspective, we now expect 2% to 4% in organic growth for the year. And by type of work, to provide that context as well, consulting, we continue to expect to be in the mid-single-digit range growth. And we now see managed services at high single digits.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Understood.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nAnd of course, when you think about, yeah. And then, okay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Tien Wong with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTina Wong\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thank you so much. So great to hear from you, Julie and Angie. Just maybe I'll ask, instead of demand, I want to ask on the margin outlook and the change there. How much of that is organic versus inorganic in terms of the change? And is it just, I'm always getting questions. Is it just costing more to do business? Is there a cost to execution here going up? Is there a pricing change? What more can you share?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nSure. And as it relates to, thank you, Tien Wong. As it relates to inorganic, our capital deployed, we've updated. We may be a bit lighter at $2 to 3 billion, but relative from a margin profile, no change there. So let me just peel this back a little bit.\nIn this quarter, we did see a decrease in our gross margin, primarily due to higher subcontractor costs and the impact of our business optimization actions, which reduced severance costs in Q2 of last year. As you know, this fluctuates quarter to quarter, which is really why we manage the overall operating margin. As you think about our operating margin for the year, based upon where we are, we now expect a 10 to 20 basis point expansion for the year while continuing to invest significantly in our business and our people. Look, we're seeing the variability in the operating margin throughout the year that we expected.\nSo what are we focused on? Pricing, which this quarter was relatively stable, how we deliver our contracts, and how we run our business, which includes managing supply and demand and digitizing and making our own operations more efficient. So we feel really good about our full-year guidance of 10 to 20 basis points, which includes EPS growth at 5% to 7%.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And Tien-Tsin Huang, we always update. We typically update about this time. We just don't see; we didn't see the 30 basis points. It's a super competitive market. So while pricing's relatively stable, as we've been talking about, it's a competitive market, so.\n\nTina Wong\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. No, that's all clear. Thanks for going through that. Just my follow-up. I think Jason Kupferberg asked about federal ready. Maybe I'll ask it differently. Is there a way to frame the real revenue at risk? I know mission critical is maybe hard to define it here on the call, but is there anything that you can share in terms of what's really at risk or not at risk, thinking about duration? Or is it really more of an issue of replenishing work, etc.? Just trying to get a better understanding of visibility there. Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. So, Tien-Tsin Huang, what I would say is, and what we've been clear about, is the guided range we're giving for the quarter and for the year reflects our best view of the impact that's coming from both the slowing of new procurement actions and the assessments of the work that we're doing.\nAnd so we don't get into different pieces of it, but we can see on one thing that we're looking at both two things: the range of outcomes, and that's reflected in the range. I mean, it is 8% of our business. We have lots of other parts of our business that are about that size that we are always looking at estimates and assumptions. This is our best view of it today, and the range reflects it.\n\nTina Wong\n\nVP, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. No, your view is better than mine, and glad to see the bottom end of the range taken up here. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian King\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one is, Julie, just thinking about how budgets were set and how conversations maybe changed from January, February, to March. Could you give us some color on that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nI'd start with, as we went into this calendar year, we did not see kind of across the board a meaningful increase in budgets for our services. We saw more of the same, which is consistent with what we've been talking about. As we went into the budgets, as the budgets were set, it was kind of more of the same. It's pretty early right now in terms of processing, right, what just happened. There's a lot of different things that can happen, right? So you sometimes see clients reprioritizing, like maybe they'll go faster on the cost cutting than on some of the building and that.\nEven that kind of a conversation, it's super early, right? So what we are seeing, though, is a continuation that these conversations always turn to, \"Okay, we got to go faster, and we got to go bigger.\" This theme around cost and growth, because that's really the unique way that we can help clients.\nSo one of the examples that I gave in the script around a major manufacturer of food supplies is all about when you are better managing inventory and supply chain; that's both driving growth and, at the same time, self-funding big transformation programs. So I think right now, if you think about just what is the impact of an elevated level of uncertainty, it's the same thing as what we've been seeing, like more desire to do larger transformation. And while we're at it, because I'm sure the question will come, discretionary spending this quarter, Q2, was overall about the same, still constrained.\nThere were some pockets of improvement, for example, in banking and capital markets in the Americas. But again, going into the calendar year, discretionary spending was overall about the same constraint, and particularly in small deals that we've been seeing. So yeah, that's kind of where we are.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nI would just add, Julie, thanks for that. I would just add that as you think about our guidance for the full year as well, what it assumes is discretionary spend does not have to improve at the top end of the range while it continues to allow for further deterioration at the bottom.\n\nBrian King\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, Angie, as my follow-up, I was going to ask, if you take that midpoint of that Q3 constant currency revenue, you get to about five. It implies Q4 revenue range looks a little wider than usual and maybe a couple points lower than the Q3. So just kind of what's built in? Are you building in a little bit of a slowdown in organic growth in that fourth quarter, or is that just some level of elevated uncertainty that goes into the fourth quarter number? Thanks so much.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nAnd Bryan, your math is right. So we have seen an elevated level of uncertainty, and so we spoke about that. And you're correct that as you think about our inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3% for the full year, it was roughly 4% in the first half. We're expecting about 2% in the second half, which means really importantly that our organic growth for the full year is now 2% to 4%.\n\nBrian King\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThanks. And our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Good job. I guess my first question, health and public services typically is kind of flattish sequentially in Q2. It was down about 5% sequentially. I guess kind of asking Jason's question too is, is some of that US federal, or are there other parts of health and public services that were weaker than normal? I'm just trying to understand that.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nHi, David. Good morning. Nothing to read into that. We didn't see any material impact within HMPS. It just ebbs and flows over the quarters, and so nothing to really comment there.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Just as a follow-up, I think you might have mentioned pricing was pretty stable. I looked back the last seven quarters. You called pricing as being down a bit. I mean, are we starting to get back to a more stable environment for pricing?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo as you think about our pricing, we did comment that it was relatively stable. The market continues to be very competitive. And so what you can count on us to do is we're always focused on it. And just as a reminder, pricing is the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell.\n\nDave Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYep. Great. Thanks, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Fossett\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. As we talk about the little bit of the slowdown that you've seen in recent weeks, how would you characterize it geographically or industry vertical, just trying to get a little more color there? And what do you think those customers are looking for in terms of their proceed, or continue to pause, or hesitate type of decision-making?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, James. I want to be clear. We haven't seen a slowdown in the last few weeks. What we commented on, which I think is kind of everyone's well aware of, is in the last few weeks, there's been an elevated level of what was already significant uncertainty. There's a couple of big themes around that. Obviously, tariffs, and that's a global discussion. That is not just an American discussion. Also, consumer sentiment, which is a little bit more of an American discussion. So we're really just commenting on what I think we're all seeing, and that's only been in the last few weeks.\nSo we're already, of course, in the heart of the discussions of clients globally who are talking about it. You're seeing, for example, in Europe, there was an announcement of major spending in areas like defense where we've been investing in a well-positioned.\nBy the way, I do want to shout out to my UK team. Hopefully, all of you noticed that the UK is back, and we're driving our revenue. It's a great example of how we address challenges by leveraging our ability to invest. We've done a lot of acquisitions there. The agility, the use of data and AI, which are all driving the repositioning that you're starting to now see in the UK. So again, we have a lot of diversification of our business.\nWhen you think about the Americas and the agenda now in federal with respect to consolidating, modernizing, and reinventing the federal government, we're incredibly well-positioned because we've been driving already a lot of efficiency in the federal government with the work we've been doing for decades.\nWe're now bringing that reinvention that we've been doing now for a few years, those commercial solutions. We've got the ability to bring that to the federal government as they move forward with their agenda. The conversation's global, lots of opportunities that depend on the market. We have a really strong position. I'll just flag again the 32 clients this quarter who did over $100 million of bookings.\n\nJames Fossett\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great and great clarification. I appreciate that. Then I want to touch quickly on your AI and AI initiatives, etc. Can you give a little bit of color on how that's developing with your software partners, what kinds of improvements, or adjustments, and go-to-market that may entail? Just trying to get a sense for how you're working with the broader ecosystem to really drive results.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, James, the ecosystem is absolutely critical here. This is where decades of relationships really matter because GenAI is a new technology. The adoption of AI more broadly is new. It wasn't being adopted as much. And so we work so closely with our partners and the client really in three-way conversations and work in order to reinvent and do that. We're not taking things off the shelf and say, \"Here, go do this.\" And as you know, we are the leader with our ecosystem partners. And that has been a major differentiating factor when you look at our growth, particularly in these large deals where the ecosystem is absolutely at the heart of it.\nAnd by the way, I'm glad that you commented on the GenAI because I think it's important as we think about how GenAI is developing that we don't walk past that. In H1, we did $1.1 billion in revenue. Last year in FY24, we did $900 million for the entire year. So you're starting to see the leadership that we have in GenAI really come through on the revenue side.\n\nJames Fossett\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. Julie, hoping you're feeling well. I want to start on bookings. Can you just give us a sense on Q2 bookings, how they landed relative to your plan? Understanding just elevated uncertainty may extend signings. I'm just curious if that did, in fact, play out in Q2. Can you comment on how you feel you're set up for the second half in bookings?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, just as a reminder, that elevated uncertainty has been in the last few weeks. So no impact on our bookings.\nAnd Angie, do you want to add anything?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Bryan. So for us, we were pleased with our bookings this quarter of $20.9 billion. And importantly, our book-to-bill was 1.3. And again, reinforcing being the partner of choice for our clients with 32 clients with quarterly bookings over $100 million. So we feel really good about that.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. And then on the workforce, can you comment on how you're managing that mix of subcontractors versus employees? And is that higher subcon mix in the quarter just some form of a transition component as you've taken actions on bench across the organization? Or are there certain service types where you're having to lean a little bit more on that subcon mix?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nBrian, I think that as you think about our subcontractor and our workforce mix, certainly that can fluctuate quarter to quarter based upon the work that we're doing for our clients. As it relates to this quarter, you saw that we added a little bit over 2,000 people in Q2. As always, what we are all about is managing our supply and demand, including through the use of technology and reskilling. So for us, as you think about our workforce overall, subcontractors can fluctuate. At the same time, what we focus on is our utilization, which continues to be 91%, which is exactly the range that we want to be in.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is coming from Keith Bachman at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYes. Good morning. Thank you. Perhaps I'll ask my two just concurrently since they're on similar veins. On the first one, one of the previous questions was asking about AI more from the demand side or revenue side. I wanted to go back to the supply side and delivery side. While I think it's still really early in the life of GenAI because most of the work is actually still test, not inferencing, but are you seeing any changes in the nature of your economic relationship with your customers?\nIn other words, are customers asking for some of the savings, or is there any change in that narrative on how the supply side and economic relationship, broadly speaking, with your customers may unfold as GenAI matures a little bit?\nAnd then the second part of the question is, I wanted to just jump into Song for a bit and sort of the same type of question. I spent the last day with Adobe at their user group conference, and there's tremendous efficiency gains associated with both marketing and creativity. And just, Julie, any comments? I know you mentioned Song had double-digit growth, which is quite impressive. How do you see the durable growth rate of Song? And so that's it for me. And Julie, all the best to you in particular.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Keith. I think in the first question, what we've been seeing with GenAI is what we've seen in the past when we have new technologies. I take you back to 2015 when we first announced MyWizard, which we now call GenWizard as we've introduced GenAI.\nThat was that major shift that occurred with respect to automation, which, by the way, is still relevant, right? We are not seeing a different change. We've been continuously, particularly on the managed service side, our contracts assume that there's going to be more efficiency driven from technology. GenAI is allowing that to kind of go up over time. But the way that the model's working is just very similar to what we've seen with prior waves of big efficiencies from technology. We're not seeing new patterns evolve there. Of course, really, our strategy is to lead in both helping our clients use GenAI, but also to lead in our own use of GenAI.\nAt the same time, it is still early in the technology. It's still expensive. You have to get to the right ROI in terms of when to use it. It requires our clients to have foundations in place. This isn't just, sort of, push a button and we can have GenAI. And so we should expect that. Remember that this is still very early in the technology cycle. Excuse me. With respect to Song, one of the big areas that we're helping our clients on is build the data foundation in order to use the GenAI because those efficiencies that you're seeing, and as you know, we're Adobe's major partner, require the right data foundation.\nAnd they require really the reinvention of processes. We've seen that in our own marketing where we've been using agentic AI, but you had to completely change the way that you're doing marketing. So Song's durability is being at the heart of building the digital core and helping them do the reinvention while leading in our own use of GenAI, which is what we continue to be focused on.\nSo I feel very good about Song. And importantly, our diversification is we want to be relevant to all parts of the enterprise and the growth agenda, which is what Song positions us, in addition to our entire ability to be at the core operations and at the enterprise. So really very pleased with how our strategy to be relevant across the enterprise continues to give us resilience in the market.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Jonathan Lee at Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Lee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to clarify the change in the revenue outlook here. Your original outlook contemplated status quo at the high end of the outlook. Is that still the case? And is that indexed to what you're seeing today with the elevated uncertainty, but not necessarily any sort of slowdown?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nHi, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. Yes, that's correct. So with our assumptions, the range of five to seven, which we raised for the full year, is a discretionary spend, does not have to improve at the top end of the range. While at the bottom of the range, it allows for further deterioration.\n\nJonathan Lee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nThanks for that, Angie. Then on the pricing front, it's good to hear about the pricing stability you're seeing despite the competitive environment. How do we think through the timing in which it takes stable pricing to flow through the P&L, especially as it looks like we're still digesting some of the pricing headwinds we've been seeing over the last few quarters?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nAs you think about pricing, it does take time for it to layer in. And certainly, it depends on the mix of the deals that we're selling as well. So we'll see that come through over time.\n\nJonathan Lee\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Guggenheim Partners\n\nAppreciate that.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you. Operator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGuys, thanks. And Julie, I just want to wish you. Echo that and wish you my best as well. When we think about what we're seeing in terms of the larger transformational contracts that are benefiting you so much this year despite slower discretionary or not a real improvement in discretionary yet, just remind us again where you are on that path. I mean, again, bookings was a question before. It was up. Maybe it was more or less flat year over year, but your book-to-bill is still very strong, obviously.\nAnd so just help us understand what you're seeing in terms of the most transformational contracts right now that can give us room despite sort of whatever outcomes are on the discretionary. And then one quick follow-up, Julie. I know when we spoke last, you talked about how there was so much in terms of waiting by executive CIOs, CEOs, and others on tariffs and some of the policies you talked about earlier.\nIf we do get some resolution on that in the next couple of months, 2 April could be a big day for the administration in terms of explaining. I mean, how much have you heard from your customers on how much they're just really waiting? There's pent-up demand budget. Just help us understand that a little more if you can.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. So on the demand side, the 32 clients with bookings over 100 million continue to show that we're executing on that strategy. But what clients want to buy are larger transformational deals. They want the reinvention, and we continue to execute on that too, again, because we're going where the demand is, right? So that same sort of view of continuing to make sure that we're having those larger deals that will continue to layer in is the strategy, and really no change there because that's the demand, right?\nWe need to be focused on where clients are buying. Then, again, what I would say on how things might layer in, CEOs are actually focused on how do I succeed regardless of the level of uncertainty. The conversations we're having are not, \"Hey, what happens if the tariffs, this gets resolved, etc.?\" It's, \"Okay. We have a higher level of uncertainty than we did 90 days ago. And so how do we then reinvent faster, right? What do we need to shift to?\" CEOs, and this is not from this.\nThis has been going on for now for a few years, right? They're embracing that their responsibility is to grow regardless of what has been, in my tenure as CEO in the last six years, a series of a lot of different events. That's why, as we think about our own business, right, we continue to anchor on the characteristics that have allowed us to be the leader over these different cycles. That's the deep client relationships. Our top 100 clients, we've been with for over 10 years. The diversification of geographies, industries. I do want to give a shout-out to all my industry teams, the industry groups.\nWe had broad-based growth, but it allows us for that diversification as well as types of work. Then the all-important ecosystem relationships and our leadership in GenAI and technology, those are the building blocks of our resilient business. We all, our CEOs and ourselves, have to be agile to succeed in whatever market. That is what our range reflects. The fact that we took the bottom off of the range reflects our belief in our resilient model as we continue to navigate.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's really helpful, Julie. Just a quick follow-up would be on AI again, on DeepSeek, just given the developments. I mean, has there been more of an emphasis around it, just given the ability to use even more efficient systems? Or just help us understand in terms of, I know you've said before, 10% of customers might actually have the infrastructure ready. So we still have a lot of work to do to prepare. Has there been an acceleration in the momentum, or is it the same as it was the last couple of quarters? Thanks again.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you very much. We are seeing increasing numbers of clients embracing GenAI. Really, that is, in our view, DeepSeek is an interesting development. It's an example of the ongoing technology developments. But the reason they're embracing it is that they're seeing the proven value. And that is why we continue to grow because we're the ones in our client base helping our clients get to that value. And you saw that in a lot of the examples we've been giving. So there's an increasing number of clients embracing it as companies are seeing it. And there is no view that you can sit back, right, and wait on this.\nAnd that, two years in, is very evident in our conversations with clients. Thank you. Well, thank you again for joining. Before we wrap up, I have two updates versus many as you know. Last month, I did announce that I had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. Just want to let everyone know I'm feeling good.\nMy treatment is on track, and my prognosis continues to be excellent. I have received so many well wishes, including on this call. And I just want to thank everyone for all of their support. It has meant a lot. I also want to thank Katie O'Conor, our head of investor relations. She has been an amazing partner to me, to Casey, and to now Angie for the last three years. We've asked her to take on a very important new role as the CFO of Avanade, our joint venture with Microsoft. I know we're all going to miss her in this role, and we're super excited to see Katie take on this next chapter of her very impressive career.\nSo thank you very much, Katie. And I'm also very pleased to welcome Alexia Quadrani, who will become our new head of investor relations. Alexia joins us from The Walt Disney Company, where she was the Executive Vice President of investor relations and shareholder services. Prior to that, she spent over 20 years as an equity analyst at JP Morgan.\nI know she's really looking forward to getting to know all of you in the days ahead, and I'm super happy to welcome her to Accenture. Finally, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support. We are working every day to continue to earn that trust. Finally, a huge thank you to all of our people for what you're doing every day. I will speak with all of you next quarter. Thanks again for joining.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The conference is now concluded, and we thank you all for attending today's presentation.\nYou may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O'Connor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, Operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our First Quarter fiscal 2025 Earnings Announcement. As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Connor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and Angie Park, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.\nLet me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. Angie will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the first quarter. Julie will then provide an update on our market positioning before Angie provides our business outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2025.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings.\nThese risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at Accenture.com.\nAs always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining. And thank you to our nearly 799,000 people around the world for their extraordinary work and commitment to our clients, which resulted in a strong quarter of financial results creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. I am very pleased with our performance this quarter as we delivered on our strategy to position Accenture for strong growth in fiscal year 2025. Here are a few highlights of the 360-degree value we created.\nOur clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, and we are their reinvention partner of choice, as reflected in our bookings of $18.7 billion, including 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million.\nWe grew 8% in local currency this quarter, with revenue of $17.7 billion, approximately $240 million above the top end of our guided range, and continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly traded competitors, which is how we calculate market share. We had another milestone quarter in GenAI with $1.2 billion in bookings and approximately $500 million in revenue.\nOperating margin was flat compared to adjusted operating margin last year. EPS grew 10% over Q1 adjusted FY24 EPS, while we continued to invest in our business and our people with $242 million deployed primarily across five acquisitions and with approximately 14 million training hours this quarter designed to help us bring the latest in solutions and technology to our clients, provide our people with marketable skills, and reinvent our services using GenAI. This averages 19 hours per person.\nWe increased our data and AI workforce to approximately 69,000, continuing progress against our goal of 80,000 by the end of fiscal year 2026. We are proud to be recognized by Fortune as one of the world's best workplaces, jumping from number 10 to number six. This recognition is important as it is based on feedback from our people around the world.\nAn essential part of our strategy is having access to the best people, and being an attractive workplace is critical to our success. In recognition of our strong brand, we are proud to earn our highest brand value to date on Interbrand's prestigious Best Global Brands list, increasing to $21.9 billion and ranking number 31. We continue to invest in creating and maintaining thriving communities, which our long-term growth depends on.\nThis quarter, among other things, Accenture has partnered with the NGO Instituto PROA in Brazil to help transform the lives of low-income youth by providing them with digital skills to enter the workforce. I am very pleased with our results this quarter and our return to broad-based growth due to our strategy to be our client's reinvention partner of choice. We also have a resilient business model with diversity across markets, industries, and the types of work our clients come to us for, both consulting type of work and managed services. Over to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie, and happy holidays to all of you. Thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were very pleased\nwith our results in Q1, which exceeded our expectations and reflected momentum across our business. We are particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth, which was broad-based across geographic markets, industry groups, and consulting and managed services, demonstrating we are a leader in the market as a trusted reinvention partner for our clients.\nBased on the strength of our Q1 results, we are increasing our full-year revenue outlook, which I will cover in more detail later in our call. Let me begin by summarizing a few highlights from the quarter. Revenues grew 8% in local currency above the top end of our guided range, with six of our 13 industries growing double digits, and we continue to take market share.\nWe delivered EPS in the quarter at $3.59, reflecting 10% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Operating margin was 16.7% for the quarter, consistent with adjusted Q1 results last year, and includes significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $870 million and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $242 million, primarily attributed to five acquisitions in the quarter.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $18.7 billion for the quarter, representing 1% growth in both U.S. dollars and local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $9.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Managed Services bookings were $9.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Turning now to revenues.\nRevenues for the quarter were $17.7 billion, a 9% increase in U'S.dollars and 8% in local currency, approximately $240 million above the top end of our guided range. The foreign exchange impact for the quarter was approximately positive 1% compared with the positive 1.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $9 billion, up 7% in US dollars and 6% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $8.6 billion, up 11% in both US dollars and local currency, driven by double-digit growth in Technology Managed Services, which includes our Application Managed Services and Infrastructure Managed Services, and high single-digit growth in Operations.\nTurning to our geographic markets, in the Americas, revenues grew 11% in local currency. Growth was led by industrial, Software & Platforms, Banking & Capital Markets, and Consumer Goods Retail and Travel Services. Revenue growth was driven by the United States and Argentina.\nIn EMEA, revenues grew 6% in local currency, led by growth in Public Service, Life Sciences, and Health, partially offset by a decline in Banking & Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by the United Kingdom and Italy, partially offset by a decline in France. In Asia-Pacific, we delivered 4% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in Utilities, Industrial, and Health, partially offset by a decline in Chemicals & Natural Resources. Revenue growth was led by Japan, which represents approximately half of Asia-Pacific, partially offset by declines in Singapore and Australia.\nMoving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 32.9% compared to 33.6% for the first quarter last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.2% compared with 10.5% for the first quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6% compared to 6.4% for the same quarter last year.\nBefore I continue, I want to note that in Q1 of last year, we recorded $140 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 90 basis points and EPS by $0.17. Following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Operating income was $2.9 billion in the first quarter, reflecting a 16.7% operating margin, consistent with adjusted operating margin in Q1 of last year.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% compared with an effective tax rate of 23.2% for the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share were $3.59 compared with adjusted EPS of $3.27 in the first quarter last year, reflecting 10% growth over adjusted EPS in Q1 last year. Days sales outstanding were 50 days compared to 46 days last quarter, and 49 days in the first quarter of last year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $870 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $152 million. Following the completion of our $5 billion inaugural debt offering, our cash balance at 30 November was $8.3 billion compared with $5 billion at 31 August.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the first quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.5 million shares for $898 million at an average price of $355.03 per share. As of 30 November, we had approximately $5.9 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share for a total of $926 million. This represented a 15% increase over last year.\nOur board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.48 per share to be paid on 14 February 2025, a 15% increase over last year. In summary, we are very pleased with our Q1 results, and we are off to a strong start in FY25. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Angie. Starting with the demand environment, we saw more of the same. Our clients are focused on reinvention, which means large-scale transformations. We do not currently see an improvement in overall spending by our clients, particularly on smaller deals. When those market conditions improve, we will be well-positioned to capitalize on them as we continue to meet the demand for the critical programs our clients are prioritizing.\nAs expected, building the strong digital core required for reinvention was a strong driver of our growth this quarter. GenAI continues to be a catalyst for reinvention across the enterprise, and building out the data foundation necessary to capitalize on AI is an increasing part of that growth. Themes around achieving both cost efficiencies and growth continue across the demand we're seeing.\nThrough the examples from Q1, you can see both our strategy to be the reinvention partner of choice and how we are bringing together our services, our ecosystem relationships, and our scaled investments in cutting-edge platforms like SynOps and GenWizard, as well as technologies like GenAI to drive value for our clients. We are helping our clients build their digital core, including in the cloud, which saw double-digit growth this quarter.\nAccenture Federal Services is working with the US Air Force, the nation's military service air branch, on a cloud modernization journey to manage its complex IT environment so that military personnel can maintain their competitive edge. We will develop a multi-cloud ecosystem using services from multiple providers to create a robust, secure, and integrated infrastructure. This will enhance how different systems and devices work together and communicate to quickly implement cutting-edge tools and technologies.\nWe also provide managed services that foster collaboration and enable personnel to quickly make data-driven decisions about their cloud usage and costs while adapting to changing mission requirements. This partnership will enable the US Air Force to get the most out of their cloud investments to achieve real-time cross-cost transparency, accelerated cost savings, increased efficiency, and improved agility.\nOur industry expertise is critical to building the right digital core. We are partnering with the BCC Iccrea Group, Italy's largest cooperative banking group, through a joint venture with its IT subsidiary on a reinvention journey to help over 100 affiliated banks grow. Our managed services will modernize the IT platform and migrate applications to the cloud, enhancing resiliency, stability, and service quality. We will also consolidate data and build an integrated cloud platform for advanced analytics and AI, strengthening their digital core.\nGenAI will be applied to increase internal IT efficiency and reduce customer response time on digital interaction channels. We will expand digital offerings, employee onboarding, and payments using our suite of shared finance services solutions. A change management communications program will offer targeted upskilling and reskilling opportunities to ensure employees use new technologies and methodologies effectively.\nTogether, we will help BCC Iccrea Group reduce costs and drive innovation, enabling the banking group to be more competitive and bring new products and services to market faster. Security is an absolutely essential component of every company's digital core, and we again saw very strong double-digit growth. We are the partner of choice in part because we bring both the understanding of cross-industry threats and industry-specific threats with our deep experience across 13 industry groups.\nWe are supporting a leading aircraft manufacturer in its cybersecurity across Aerospace and Defense, on critical infrastructure and production systems. We will provide managed services and solutions for their cybersecurity capability, leading to a more powerful and secure program, bringing security by design in industrial assets and the extended enterprise.\nOur solutions will help provide improved security and meet regulatory compliance. We are also helping with the digitization of manufacturing and supply chains. Industry X grew double digits this quarter. We are continuing to evolve our long-time partnership with a global leader in tire manufacturing to revolutionize the way factories operate and to reduce time to market for new products, accelerating innovation. We will build a hybrid data foundation in the cloud, integrating millions of data points. We will also implement advanced analytics, AI, and digital twin technologies to optimize operations processes such as quality checks.\nThis will enable the company to trace the root cause of a failed batch of tires back to a machine or process in minutes instead of days. Predictive maintenance will pinpoint what parts of their process or machinery may be impacting quality and productivity, preventing costly downtimes. Engineering teams will benefit from machine learning and simulation tools to generate and optimize the design of new products.\nWe will also implement new ways of working to attract tech-savvy talent and cultivate a learning culture where employees in over 100 factories are upskilled on the AI-powered tools. The company will look to increase growth opportunities and support their digital-first strategy, all while remaining competitive in the market. We are partnering with Puma India, a leader in sports lifestyle products, to reinvent their supply chain and distribution network.\nThis will meet the ever-evolving customer demand for order delivery in a highly competitive omnichannel market where quick commerce is becoming the norm. We will use data and AI to identify and set up localized fulfillment centers, optimizing their size and location based on customer sales. Digital twins of these facilities will simulate various process designs and physical automation scenarios to identify bottlenecks.\nThis will help redefine warehouse layouts and improve material flow for more efficient order and return processing, delivering orders up to 70% faster, with express delivery for online orders expected to double. Supply chain costs are also expected to decrease by up to 10%, and additional features like solar power and EV charging stations at fulfillment centers will further reduce costs and support sustainability goals.\nPuma India will be the first amongst sports brands in the region to build this type of cutting-edge operating model, enhancing customer loyalty to drive future growth. We are reinventing all things customer through Song, which grew high single digits this quarter. We have the ability to integrate creative data and AI, tech and strategy, while leveraging our industry, and operations expertise to unlock marketing as a growth enabler for our clients while delivering efficiencies.\nWe are helping Spotify optimize its advertising business by finding opportunities to drive efficiency as it scales globally. Our marketing operations managed services support their ad operations under a single roof, touching a significant amount of their ad revenue across 150 markets.\nWe've infused automation across their operational workflows to help significantly reduce the time and effort required to launch advertisers' campaigns, getting them to market more quickly to help ensure revenue realization and advertiser satisfaction. We continue to expand beyond ad operations, actively launching new capabilities across analytics and insights, data integrity and enrichment, customer support, and more. Our partnership helps Spotify to focus on its core competencies so it can achieve long-term relevance and growth in an increasingly competitive market.\nWe are collaborating with CaixaBank, a leading financial group in Spain, on their plan to enhance customer and employee experiences. We will increase productivity and efficiency by leveraging AI and GenAI to build multiple solutions, such as the bank's chatbot, which has significantly reduced response times and improved the quality of answers for clients, and an employee assistant tool that utilizes natural language conversations and solution searches.\nWe will also build a customer service claims solution that analyzes documents and supports agents and lawyers in proposing the right responses, reducing processing time and assisting specialized teams. This will help CaixaBank reinvent with GenAI. We are creating real value from GenAI across industries and countries.\nWe are partnering with Vale, a Brazilian mining and logistics company, to transform its environmental licensing program, speeding up permit applications and expanding its sustainability goals. We created Smart Licensing, an end-to-end licensing management platform that uses GenAI to scan application materials and environmental studies to promote compliance with regulatory and environmental requirements.\nThis creates actionable summaries, reducing internal document reviews from days to minutes. We've trained over 500 people to use Smart Licensing and established a change management team to combine previously segmented teams, helping Vale plan and execute more efficiency while further reducing environmental impact.\nWe are partnering with Indosat, a digital telecommunications company, and its subsidiary, Lintasarta, a leading provider of data communication, internet, and IT services, to launch Indonesia's first sovereign AI cloud platform. This will accelerate their AI-driven digital transformation and support the country's vision of becoming a digitally empowered nation by 2045.\nThe collaboration will initially focus on AI solutions for Indonesia's financial services sector, one of the key pillars of the country's economy. Accenture's AI Refinery platform will provide scaled AI capabilities with pre-built solutions that have a modular architecture to meet clients' needs wherever they are in their AI journey, significantly reducing time to value. This partnership will help Indonesian companies to drive reinvention by harnessing the power of scaled GenAI, propelling innovation, operational efficiency, and sustainable growth in a competitive market.\nTalent continues to be at the top of the agenda for CEOs and governments, and our Learning Managed Services position us to be able to help clients invest in their workforce. Our partnership with S&P Global, a leading provider of financial data analytics and ratings, is driving GenAI innovation across the financial services industry, empowering their workforce to adopt GenAI at scale to enhance productivity and deliver revenue growth.\nThey are equipping nearly 40,000 of their employees with the necessary skills, leveraging Accenture Learning Managed Services, a comprehensive GenAI learning program. This program includes curated and customized content to drive AI fluency and address the industry's evolving talent requirements. Finally, a quick look at how we're continually using our investments and acquisitions to drive our future growth.\nTo continue to scale Learning Managed Services, we acquired Award Solutions in the US, which expands our learning offerings tailored to the unique needs of the network leaders, network operations, and performance engineers, and IT professionals in the telecom space. To enable us to scale faster in Health, a $70 billion addressable market growing approximately 6%, we acquired Consus Health, a leading German healthcare management consultancy.\nHealth is an industry still early in digitalization, and our investments are positioning us for the continued growth we see over the next several years. Supply chain continues to be early in digitalization, and we are investing to continue to drive growth.\nThis quarter, we acquired Camelot, an international SAP-focused management and technology consulting firm from Germany with specific strengths in supply chain, data and analytics, and Joshua Tree Group in the US, a supply chain consulting firm specializing in distribution center performance. Back to you, Angie.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook.For the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.2 to 16.8 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 2.5% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and reflects an estimated 5 to 9% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2025, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 0.5% compared to fiscal 2024.\nFor the full fiscal 2025, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 4 to 7% growth in local currency over fiscal 2024, which includes an inorganic contribution of a bit more than 3%, which we expect will be about 4% in the first half and about 2% in the second half. We continue to expect to invest about $3 billion in acquisitions this fiscal year. For operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year 2025 to be 15.6% to 15.8%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2024 results. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.6% in fiscal 2024.\nWe now expect our full-year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2025 to be in the range of $12.43 to 12.79, or 4% to 7% growth over adjusted fiscal 2024 results, reflecting the raise in our revenue outlook and adjusting for the revised FX assumption. For the full fiscal 2025, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.4 to 10.1 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.8 to 9.5 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $8.3 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, Angie. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. If you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you're using a speakerphone, we ask that you please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed and you would like to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Today's first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Good morning. It's really encouraging to see the revenue come in here above the guidance range. I think it's the widest margin in nearly two years.\nJulie, you said that the demand environment is more or less the same. So I'm curious what you attribute this new pattern to and if market conditions are maybe improving underneath here. Any comments?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Tien-tsin Huang. This is the strategy that we've been outlining for the last few quarters, where last year, when we saw the constrained spending, particularly on the smaller deals, we pivoted to really focusing on winning more reinvention partners of choice. So increasing the number of our deals that were over 100 million in a quarter. You'll remember last year, we actually had 125 of those. And the idea was to go after the demand, which is in the larger reinventions, and that that would position us to get back to strong growth in 2025 as those deals begin to layer in.\nWhat you're seeing is the result of what we're really proud of: quite a bit of agility last year that when the market changed, we changed. Because as you know, these are not easy deals to do quickly, and we quickly pivoted last year, went after the demand, and then put ourselves in this position. That's why we did underscore that the market environment has not changed.\nThis is the result of the strategy we executed, which we're uniquely able to do because we have all the skills and capabilities. We have the mix of consulting and managed services. This is what we were talking about last quarter when we said we're going to get back to strong growth based on execution of this strategy. Of course, these are super critical strategic programs.\nAnd so when spending does come back and the market does improve, we're at the heart of our client's business, and we should be well capitalized to pick up on that spending.\n\nTien Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. No, the last point is important. Short-term stuff comes back. You should see that pretty quickly as well on top of this. So good. Thanks. I have my follow-up. Just had to ask it. I get a lot of questions on the US federal government and Accenture's exposure there. I think it's about 8% of revenue based on some of your annual report disclosure. So just curious, given some of the change in administration and this discussion around efficiency, have your expectations or are you going to change your strategy here on the US federal government side? Any comments there would be terrific. Thanks for the time.\nYeah.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, we're really excited because our core competencies in federal, right, are around driving efficiencies. They're around helping keep our country secure. We're working with the US federal agency on securing critical infrastructure, right, and on changing citizen services. We work across very important agencies. And so we believe that we're super well-positioned to continue to help the mission of the federal government to secure itself, to help citizens, and to drive more efficiencies, which will be tied very much to cloud, data, and AI.\nAnd what really makes us uniquely positioned is that we believe that there's going to be an even greater appetite of taking commercial solutions to the federal government. And we are very uniquely positioned because we have strong government expertise, but we've got commercial and private sector solutions. We're the leader with every major ecosystem partner.\nYou saw that I was talking today about the US Air Force and what we're doing on the cloud modernization. Our work is mission-critical. I mean, the vast majority of what we do is mission-critical to the federal government. We see a real opportunity to continue to partner with the new administration as we've partnered with all administrations and also with all of the leaders in the federal government who every day are waking up to really drive those three things. Really, really feel good about where we are positioned in the federal government to help this agenda.\n\nTien Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Reseacrh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Happy holidays.\nI know that last quarter, you indicated the high end of the initial revenue guide for this fiscal year did not require any material improvement in consulting. I'm just wondering if that's still the case as you're now raising the top end a little bit, or are you now assuming any improvement in consulting since you're almost four months into the new fiscal year?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYes. Hi, Jason. Good morning. I'll take that. For us, with the raise in the four to seven for the full year, there's really no change in what we shared with you before, which is that at the top end of the range, we continue to see more of the same, whereas at the bottom of the range, we see a bit more; we allow for a little bit more deterioration. So no change there.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah.\nOur overdelivery, I mean, we're very pleased, obviously, with consulting and managed service growth this quarter. These large deals came in a little bit better, which is how we overdelivered, and are now raising the guidance.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Reseacrh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat to hear. Then just looking at the net headcount adds cumulatively over the past two quarters, I think we're almost 50,000. That was a pretty big step up from what the prior trend looked like. Can you give us any sense of how much of that was from acquisitions versus organic? I guess, is there any reason to not look at this accelerated hiring as kind of a bullish indicator?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nLet me take that question as it relates to the net people adds that we had in Q1.\nSo we did add about 24,000 people in the first quarter, which is really reflective of the momentum that we see in our business. And managing supply and demand is a core competency of ours. And what you see is the continued high utilization rates at around 90%. Looking ahead, we'll continue to hire for the demand that we see and the skills that we need.\nAnd I would give you a little bit more context that the hiring that we saw this quarter, similar to last, was that it was concentrated in India.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And I would just say that underlying our guidance, right, you're seeing organic momentum, right? So at the high end of our guidance, for the year, we're going to exit at four. The range of organic growth in our guidance is one to four, right?\nSo I think that it is a positive sign that we're hiring. And some of it's coming from acquisitions, but we are seeing organic momentum in our business.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Reseacrh Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for the comments.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Brian Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Keane\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Congrats on the solid result and happy holidays. Kind of asking the guidance question a little bit differently. The 4% to 7% constant currency revenue guide for fiscal 2025 is a touch below just the Q1 number of 8% on a constant currency basis. So just trying to think about if there's any reason why the growth would decelerate off the Q1 level as we get more into fiscal 2025.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Hey, Brian. Happy holidays to you as well.\nLet me give you, here's how we were thinking about our guidance for the full year and the raise to 4% to 7%. If you think about where we are, we had a strong start in Q1. We had strong guidance in Q2, which was really driven. It was broad-based and driven by our organic growth. At the same time, you heard Julie say the macro remains the same. There's no change in the overall environment.\nI want to reinforce, importantly, what I said earlier, which was we do expect, we continue to expect inorganic contribution of about a bit over 3%. And one of the things that we provided to you was how that will come in. So H1, we expect somewhere around about 4%. Second half, about 2%.\nThat will give you more of an understanding of how we see organic playing out for the year. We will continue to see organic throughout this fiscal year. Then as it relates to if you think about it, we're one quarter in. We've got one quarter under our belt. We've got three more to go. As Julie said earlier, we're executing on our strategy, and you can count on us to continue to do so.\n\nBrian Keane\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Got it. That's helpful. Then maybe you guys could just talk a little bit about the industry group, the financial services. A lot of times, that kind of leads out of economic slowdowns.\nBut it sounds like Banking & Capital Markets was a little bit softer, but some other areas of strength, and just trying to figure out where that is in the industry right now because we're kind of getting mixed messages from some of the other IT service providers. Thanks so much.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And I think it's a little bit different by market, right? So we're seeing the results a bit different by market. I will say, by the way, that we were pleased to see the UK, as you might have heard, is coming back as we repositioned the UK. But with the dynamics in the US market, where it's a little bit better, in EMEA, it was a little bit worse. And you've got a mixed picture on the interest rates and what the expectations are. And so I'd say that and that is probably not a surprise.\nYesterday probably complicated that a little bit in the US, right? And so on the one hand, we're seeing a lot of interest, for example, in Banking and Capital Markets on things like GenAI. On the other hand, there's a lot that's being kind of processed with what's going to happen with interest rates and that. And so we see, obviously, it's getting better, but it is a mixed picture by region.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And just as a reminder, Brian, we look at financial services overall. We exited Q4 last year with a -2%, and we saw the uptick in the first quarter at 4% globally, which reflects the dynamics that Julie was just describing, which really placed our strengths as you think about the diversity of our business across markets and industries.\n\nBrian Keane\n\nManaging Director of Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Darrin Peller at Wolfe Research.Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGuys, thanks. Great results. Can we just touch on your potential for visibility this year into budgets and the timing you'd expect again? I know last, I think earlier this year, it was generally in the January/February timeframe, which had moved back up a little bit. But do you still anticipate that kind of visibility at that part of the year where we could get a better picture on whether discretionary is really going to pick up or not?\nAnd then maybe just as a dovetail on that, maybe just conversations you're having right now around AI for next year. Obviously, the bookings keep looking really strong for you guys, which is great. Any more specifics on where you're seeing it incrementally improve? Thanks, guys.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. Yeah.\nA great understanding of Accenture. January is sort of January. February is where we really see what the client budget's going to be looking at. That's where we get the most visibility. We'll be reporting more on that in the next quarter. You're absolutely right. We do anticipate getting that visibility in January, February. With respect to AI, we're just continuing to see in our conversations, and I've probably talked to 30 CEOs in the last two months, right?\nIt's been a lot of time. Also around the world. It's been a busy travel quarter. I've been in Europe. I've been in Southeast Asia, Australia, and the US. Pretty consistently, clients are seeking to do more in AI, but they're in such different places.\nI mean, I'll be with one bank where we're talking about what is GenAI, AI, why does it matter, and the fact that they're not yet in the cloud. And I'll be talking to another bank where they've been fully in the cloud, and they want to be the first out to use GenAI. And so I think it's hard to generalize. You're still seeing that because the overall spending environment is the same, that those who really want to go into AI are more prioritizing spending as opposed to spending more, right?\nWhere we see the biggest opportunity when companies start to get more confident to spend more is going to be in moving faster with their data foundation that fuels AI and then AI. But right now, it still generally feels more like a prioritization within current budgets. And so we'll see what happens in January and February.\nAnd that's why our strategy has been to pivot there, right? So to go after more than our fair share of those budgets.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nAll right. That's really helpful. Then just when we look at the opportunity for where you're hiring, you mentioned India, but we've heard a lot of customers are starting to think about a little bit even more onshore. So just maybe talk a little bit more about the mix again. It had gone for a while more offshore, looking for better price optimization. But where are we on that right now? Are you seeing any evidence of a shift back to nearshore or onshore? Thanks again, guys. Great job.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nNo big trend. What I'd say is we focus on the G2000, so a lot of our companies are global.\nAnd so they really are looking for optimization of right skills because a big piece of why people, for example, use India is about skills, right? Ten years ago, it was about labor arbitrage, right? Today, it's about the ability to get these skills at scale. What I would say is that we at Accenture are continuing to develop more because in some cases, it's language, right?\nAs you're kind of doing more transformation in new parts of the enterprise where you want maybe language with skills or time zones. So we have a global network with 100 centers around the world. In the US, for example, we've been opening some new centers in underserved environments. We opened a center in The Bronx recently. But all of it is kind of aimed at being very sophisticated. And we see ourselves as part of the integrated talent strategy of our clients.\nIt's like right skills, right time zone, right price continues to be the guiding with, I would say, an emphasis on skills.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Julie. Thanks, Angie.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question today comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Julie, I understand that your outlook and you're not really seeing any difference on macro side in your outlook with sort of idiosyncratic growth. But can you maybe discuss a little bit about when you talk with clients, what's the sort of range of outcomes for discretionary increases in the 2025 budget outlook? And how big a factor is rates specifically as a macro impact when they're thinking about that? And do you think that changes materially given the Fed's message yesterday? The rates definitely depend on industry, right?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo if you're a more capital-intensive industry or you're an industry that wants to grow more in acquisitions, the rates, there's lots of puts and takes in doing the range. And I think it's just too early based on yesterday's and a lot of speculation. I mean, our business is very much focused on when there's change, and it doesn't matter what the change is, good or bad change, that's where we really partner with our clients successfully.\nBecause if they've now got new constraints because the rates are higher, then they want more opportunity to cut costs. If the rates are going to fuel things like capital projects, we've got our capital projects business, right? So what we focus on, and I think what we're so successful is we have these deep relationships with our clients. Our top 100, we've been with over 10 years. We understand them.\nWe are always looking at this and saying, \"Okay, what does that mean?\" anticipating what they're helping. So that's whatever the change is, that's where Accenture really can help them pivot. And it's part of our strength that we're so relevant to both growth and cost.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then with respect to the AI work, I mean, you talked about some of the context of the client conversations you're having, but quantitatively, are you seeing any kind of major changes in terms of the size and scope of the individual projects? And what are clients saying about sort of their pivot or when they might pivot to sort of larger, more transformative projects within GenAI?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. We're already starting to see that, right? We're starting to see that clients and the characteristics are pretty clear.\nIf you have a client that's been investing in their digital core, including security and data for many years, and we have many of those that we've helped, they're now able to start to scale. We're starting to do that, and we're seeing those partnerships. Where you have clients where we've been helping them prove it and maybe scale in a part of the business, but they really haven't got their data foundation or they're not moving into the cloud, then what they're working with us is how do we accelerate that?\nWhat you probably heard as we were talking through some of the examples today is that there's a lot of data foundation now being built along with getting into modern cloud platforms. So we are seeing an acceleration of the data work, which is absolutely fundamental to using GenAI.\n\nJim Schneider\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question today comes from David Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Associate Director, Robert W Baird & Co\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Great job. I guess my question just on the fiscal Q2 guide. Historically, Q2 has been a pretty flat sequential quarter. You're guiding, I believe, to down about $1 to 1.5 billion sequentially this quarter. I know a little of that, maybe a few hundred million, FX. I get that. But was there anything in Q1 that's kind of naturally falling off in Q2 this year that's a little unusual or some sequential pattern that's a little different?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYes. David, happy holidays and good morning. As we think about our Q2 guide of 5% to 9%, it's a very solid guide based upon what we see. There's nothing unique in Q2 that I would call out.\nIn fact, just anchoring back to our overdelivery that we saw in the first quarter, it was really a function of the larger deals coming online a bit better than we expected. We continue to see that, which gave us confidence in driving and raising our guidance for the full year. Nothing to call out for Q2.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Associate Director, Robert W Baird & Co\n\nGotcha. Yeah. You definitely crushed Q1. Then I guess one just a nerdy kind of financial question. Now that you fully have the debt in place, should we think about a sequential pickup in interest expense? I think it was $30 million in Q1. Does that go to $50 million in Q2 or something like that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Different than giving you the specific numbers. In terms of how to think about it, yes, that is correct.\nBecause there's certain things, of course, that we see in our income below Operations. And what you saw there was the net interest income was lower as a result of we did have average lower cash balances, also lower interest rates. And then we also had the interest expense from our long-term debt. But all of that has been factored in the guidance that we've given. And so it's in there.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst and Associate Director, Robert W Baird & Co\n\nGotcha. Thanks, guys. Great job.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Head of US IT Services and Fintech Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I want to just quickly ask a follow-up on capital structure and allocation. It sounds like you're still quite committed to pursuing both acquisitions as well as capital return. Last year, we looked at we did some essentially debt raise to help fund those priorities. Where are we at from that perspective?\nOr do you feel like we're in a pretty good overall cash position and continue to be able to do that? Or should we expect that at some point, at least over the next couple of years, we could see further increases in debt and debt raising to fund the capital allocation priorities?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Hey, James. Nice to talk to you. What a nice start. We were pleased to execute our inaugural bond offering of $5 billion, which we did in October. When we stepped back, it was really a routine review of our capital structure where we tapped the long-term debt market to increase our liquidity for general corporate purposes. What it does is it ultimately optimizes our capital structure and reduces our cost of capital. That said, let me just reinforce for you.\nThere is no change to our capital allocation strategy, which also includes how we look at and use M&A.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. This year, we're going back to kind of more of a business-as-usual. We think it's going to be somewhere around $3 billion. But as we've always said, if there's opportunities or not, we've got the balance sheet. So we could raise debt. But there's no strategy to increase debt. But we might if we had the right opportunities. I mean, last year, we had a great opportunity to double down on strategic acquisitions. And it's served us well as we've gone into this year. This year, we're back to kind of standard around $3 billion, which is kind of the right percentage. So we'll communicate as we go. We always have that flexibility.\nAnd I think that's the strength, if you think about Accenture, is having a strong balance sheet and the flexibility to go after opportunities in the market that drive long-term growth. And that's how we think about the decisions about whether or not to do debt or not.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Head of US IT Services and Fintech Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great color there. And then I wanted to ask about the consulting bookings, seeing nice growth and acceleration there. I'm wondering, and I know it's hard given the breadth of Accenture's customer base, but I'm wondering if you can help us maybe generalize what you're seeing in the consulting bookings and if there's a change there. And I guess I'm wondering if we're seeing a focus on cost control versus potential revenue generation or new technology evaluation or how it folds into AI.\nJust any color you could provide on what the tenor of those consulting bookings look like right now.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So maybe just keep in mind that what we're generally bringing to our clients are multi-service solutions. So you might do, as we talked about, we're doing managed services in security. And that requires industry consulting as a part of it to make sure that we're doing all the work. A lot of the reinvention is a lot of process that. So I think I would anchor on there really are two themes that at least when they come to us: they want cost efficiency.\nEvery industry wants a cost efficiency now. And they're looking for growth, or other outcomes, speed to market. So you heard a lot when we talked about what we're doing with CaixaBank. That was both speed to market as well as efficiencies.\nAnd so that's one of the things that we focus on. And that really gives us; it's our unique differentiation because we've got things like Song that's everything about customer, and we can put to that. We understand the industry. So the twin themes here is cost efficiency and growth.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director and Head of US IT Services and Fintech Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question today comes from Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nHi. Good morning. Many thanks and happy holidays to everyone. My first question I wanted to ask is around pricing dynamics. And you've indicated that the macro backdrop's fairly steady. You're getting share through skills. And I wanted to ask specifically about some of the legacy areas such as application maintenance, maybe the BPO work.\nOne of your competitors has suggested that pricing is pretty challenging because there aren't enough deals and a lot of folks chasing those deals. But could you specifically address what you're seeing as pricing dynamics during the quarter? Any changes?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nIt's a very competitive market, which is what we've been seeing every quarter. We did see lower pricing across the business, which has been pretty consistent. What I would say is, which makes sense, right? You're in a constrained as we said, the clients have constrained spending, particularly on small deals. So you'd expect it to be constrained. What I would say, though, that AMS, Application Managed Services, is not legacy if you do it the way we do it, right? So what we offer to our clients is we have the talent, the full-stack engineers, the GenAI. We have a platform called GenWizard.\nAnd so clients are coming to us not to say, \"Hey, can you take off my old applications?\" They're coming to us to modernize while taking costs down. And you see that in what the work we're doing; it's very advanced in how we're doing it. And so basically, we call it run to the new, right? It's like have us help you run your applications in order to rotate to the New. So we see this as a critical way that we are at the heart of their business in modernizing their digital core. It's not legacy. Same thing with our Operations business.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Okay. That makes a ton of sense. Thank you, Julie.\nMy follow-up question is, in some of our recent discussions, and to be fair, with software companies, have suggested that Europe's softened in the last 30, 45 days, which makes sense if you just read the newspapers about what's going on in Europe. But have you guys seen any change in the dynamics underpinning Europe and/or changed the perspective that you may have as it relates to European demand over the next 12 months? And that's it for me. Many thanks again and happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks. Well, so our view of European demand over the next 12 months is baked into the rise of our guidance, right? And we're all reading the same papers. Europe is definitely more. Middle East is obviously different. Europe is definitely in a more challenging environment. And you see that with our growth rate there on a relative basis as well.\nBut we feel very good about we have an excellent business in EMEA. We're very relevant to our clients. And so we feel good about our demand environment. And that's fully reflected in the raise and guidance that we just gave you.Thank you. We have the next person.\n\nKatie O'Connor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nAbsolutely. And our final question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. I wanted to ask on the service line, sir. Can you comment on performance across strategy consulting, tech services, and Operations?\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. All strong this quarter.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Bryan, the thing that I would add to that is we did see broad-based growth.\nIf you look at it from a consulting and a managed services type of work perspective, we had mid-single-digit growth in consulting and 11% growth in managed services. As you think about the rate that we have for the year, which is 4% to 7%, underneath that, we see consulting now in the mid-single-digit range growth and managed services in the mid-to-high range growth.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Then a follow-up here on the workforce and contract profitability. So you noted most headcount was added across India. Can you just comment on what you're seeing there as far as wage inflation dynamics, just given most services companies and GCCs have been leaning in, and particularly amid the competitive pricing environment? Just talk about the levers you have here to mitigate gross margin pressure.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I'll start, Bryan.\nNo real change in terms of the market dynamics of what we see reflected around wage inflation. Of course, we are always paying market-relevant pay based upon the skills and the locations of our people. We continue to see that the same. Then as it relates to pricing, as Julie mentioned, it continues to be highly competitive. At the same time, as you know of us, right, we're managing it. We're focused on pricing as well as on our differentiation. We're focused on cost and delivery efficiencies in our business and how we operate.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nAll right. Understood. Happy holidays.\n\nAngie Park\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Bryan. Well, in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support, and all of our people for what you do every single day. I wish everyone a very happy and healthy holiday season.\nThank you for joining us today. We look forward to being back here in a quarter. Thanks, everyone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

If you should require assistance during the call, please press star, then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Katie O'Conor. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, Operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Announcement. As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for\nthe third quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and, as discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ\nmaterially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining. Thank you to our 750,000 people around the world who work every day to deliver 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. Before we get into the quarter, I want to thank KC, who's been an excellent partner for these last five years, and our three other extraordinary leaders who are stepping down in the next two quarters: Jean-Marc, Ellen, and Paul. Each have given over 36 years of service and demonstrated strong stewardship in developing outstanding successors, including Angie, who you all know from her former role as Head of Investor Relations, who will succeed KC on 1 December. As always, we are executing a smooth leadership\ntransition to the next generation with our strong bench of great leaders. Now, onto the quarter. I am pleased this quarter to bring to life yet again the resilience and agility of our business, as our actions to remain laser-focused on our clients' needs and quickly adapt to market conditions can be seen in our results, which are building a foundation for stronger growth as we go into Q4 and next fiscal year. As you know, this fiscal year, our clients' spending developed differently than we expected at the beginning of the fiscal year, and these conditions continue, with clients prioritizing large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue more slowly, while limiting discretionary\nspending, particularly in smaller projects, with delays in decision-making and a slower pace of spending as well. In response, we have moved quickly to adjust by leveraging our unique strengths, our end-to-end services, including deep industry and functional expertise that enable these large-scale transformations or what we call reinventions.\nWe are also leveraging our deep technology expertise, ecosystem partnerships, and our learning machine and culture that gives us the agility to shift to new areas of demand, including, for example, GenAI, while continuing to invest at scale for future growth. Here is how these strengths and our strategy are demonstrating results three quarters into the fiscal year. With our clients prioritizing large-scale transformations, we have accelerated our strategy to be the reinvention partner of our clients. Our success is reflected in our bookings of $21.1 billion, including another 23 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, bringing the total of such clients with\nthese bookings to 92, year-to-date, seven more than last year at this time. This focus on being the reinvention partner is an important part of our strategy to return to stronger growth.\nAs we enter next year, as this work ramps, the revenue from these large-scale bookings is expected to continue to layer in throughout the year, and we are also well-positioned to capture increases in discretionary spend when it comes back because of the strategic positioning these deals bring at our clients. We also have leaned into the new area of growth, GenAI, which is comprised of smaller projects, as our clients primarily are in experimentation mode. In this quarter, we hit two important milestones. With over $900 million in new GenAI bookings this quarter, we now have $2 billion in GenAI sales year-to-date, and we have also achieved $500 million in revenue year-to-date. This\ncompares to approximately $300 million in sales, and roughly $100 million in revenue from GenAI in FY 2023. Leading in GenAI positions us to help our clients take the actions needed to reinvent and to benefit from GenAI, which frequently means large-scale transformations. We are also taking an early lead with an eye toward long-term leadership in this critical technology, which is still in the early stages of maturity and adoption, despite its rapid evolution. We have built our expertise in making strategic acquisitions over the last decade, leveraging a strong balance sheet, and we have used this expertise to expand into new growth areas, scale in hot areas, and\ngeographies, and continue to build strength in our industry and functional consulting. We deployed $2.3 billion of capital across our geographic markets in Q3 across 12 acquisitions, bringing the total number of acquisitions to 35, with invested capital of $5.2 billion year-to-date as compared to $2.5 billion for the entire FY 2023.\nAs a learning organization and talent creator, we continue to invest in our people, with approximately 13 million training hours this quarter. This averages 19 hours per person, representing an increase predominantly due to GenAI, as we continue to prepare our workforce for the infusion of GenAI across our business in the coming years. We also continue to steadily increase our data and AI workforce, reaching approximately 55,000 skilled data and AI practitioners against our goal of doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 by the end of FY 2026. We continue to take market share on a rolling four-quarter basis against our basket of our closest global publicly\ntraded competitors, which is how we calculate market share, with revenues of $16.5 billion for the quarter of 1.4% in local currency and slightly above the midpoint of our FX-adjusted range.\nWe expanded Adjusted Operating Margin by 10 basis points and delivered Free Cash Flow of $3 billion. I want to congratulate our 97,000 people we have promoted around the world through 1 June, including 702 to Managing Director and 64 to Senior Managing Director, reflecting our commitment to providing vibrant career paths. We are recognized as a top 10 place to work in 10 countries, representing more than 70% of our people: number two in Argentina, Brazil, and the Philippines. Number four in Singapore. Number five in Costa Rica, Finland, and Indonesia. Number seven in the US. And number 10 in Chile on the Great Place to Work list of best workplaces. And number\ntwo on Business Today's best companies to work for in India. In recognition of our strong brand, we are proud to earn the 20th position on Kantar BrandZ' prestigious Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list, our highest rank to date, with an 11% increase in brand value to $81.9 billion. Our scale across strategy, consulting, technology, and operations, and our breadth and depth across industries and functions make us uniquely capable of helping our clients reinvent using technology, data, AI, and new ways of working. Before turning to KC, I want to give a little more color on our acquisitions this quarter, which yet again demonstrate the strategic importance of both our ability to\ninvest and our expertise in identifying, attracting, and integrating great companies joining Accenture. Let's start with new areas of growth. We completed our acquisition of Udacity to scale our technology learning and training services and to help our clients reskill and upskill their people.\nUdacity is a critical part of our LearnVantage digital learning platform, which we announced last quarter as a new area of growth for the future. Building on our expertise in customer-focused consulting, we invested to help drive our clients' growth agendas. We acquired Unlimited, an award-winning customer engagement agency with a deep understanding of human behavior, as evidenced by its proprietary human understanding lab and AI-powered data insights platform. We acquired The Lumery in Australia, a marketing technology consultancy that helps leading organizations deliver seamless customer experiences and transform their marketing services. It provides industry\nand platform consulting services, including marketing, advisory, and planning implementation across entire technology stacks, operational excellence, and simplification. We closed our acquisition of GemSeek in Bulgaria, a leading customer experience analytics provider helping global businesses understand customers through insights, analytics, and AI-powered predictive models.\nWe closed Mindcurv, a global cloud-native digital experience and data analytics company specializing in composable software, digital engineering, and commerce services. Now, let's turn to scaling in hot industries. We acquired Cognosante, a provider of innovative technology solutions for US federal health, defense, intelligence, and civilian agencies. With this acquisition, Federal Services is creating a new federal health portfolio for its business. We invested in Customer Management IT and SirfinPA, which will provide the public sector with technology, support, and justice and public safety in Italy. We see public service and, in particular, health, intelligence, and\ndefense as highly strategic industry-focused areas globally for the next several years. We invested in Teamexpat, focusing on testing integration for lithography systems in the semiconductor industry, another attractive industry segment. Our investment in Flo Group, a leading European consultancy and Oracle business partner who specializes in global supply chain logistics, is helping us scale in supply chain, also a major growth area. Finally, we're scaling in attractive geographic markets. We acquired CLIMB, a technology-based consultancy based in Japan, where we continue to experience very strong revenue growth. Over to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie. Thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our Q3 results, which were in line with our expectations and reflect continued investment at scale. We continue to serve as a trusted partner for our clients while running our business with rigor and discipline. Now, let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 1.4% local currency, with mid-single-digit growth or higher in seven of our 13 industries, including public service, industrial, high-tech, life sciences, energy, utility, and health. We also continue to see improvement in our CMT industry group. We continue to take market share. As a reminder, we assess market\ngrowth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about a third of our addressable market.\nWe use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. Adjusted Operating Margin was 16.4%, an increase of 10 basis points over Q3 last year, and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered Free Cash Flow of $3 billion and returned $2.2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we've invested $5.2 billion across 35 acquisitions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new\nbookings. New bookings were $21.1 billion for the quarter, representing 22% growth in US dollars and 26% growth in local currency, with an overall Book-to-Bill of 1.3. Consulting bookings were $9.3 billion, with a Book-to-Bill of 1.1. Managed Services bookings were $11.8 billion, with a Book-to-Bill of 1.5.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.5 billion, a 1% decline in US dollars and a 1.4% increase in local currency, and slightly above the midpoint of our FX-adjusted guidance range, as the FX headwind was approximately 2% compared to the 1% headwind estimated at the beginning of the quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, a decline of 3% in US dollars and a decline of 1% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $8 billion, up 2% in US dollars and up 4% local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services, strategy, and consulting grew low single digits, and operations was flat. Turning to\nour geographic markets. In North America, revenue grew 1% local currency, led by growth in public service, partially offset by a decline in banking and capital markets. In EMEA, revenues declined 2% local currency, with growth in public service, offset by declines in banking and capital markets, and communications and media. Revenue growth in Italy was offset by a decline in France. In growth markets, revenue grew 8% local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, and industrial. Revenue growth was driven by Argentina and Japan, partially offset by a decline in Australia. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.4%, consistent with\nthe same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.6%, compared to 10.5% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.3%, compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q3 of FY 2024 and FY 2023, we recorded $77 million and $347 million in costs associated with our Business Optimization Actions, respectively. These costs decreased operating margin by 40 basis points and EPS by $0.08 this quarter and operating margin by 210 basis points and EPS by $0.42 in Q3 of last year. In Q3 of last year, we also recognized a gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which\nimpacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting an Adjusted Operating Margin of 16.4%, an increase of 10 basis points from Adjusted Operating Margin in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 24% for the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.13, compared with an adjusted diluted EPS of $3.19 in the third quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 43 days, compared to 43 days last quarter and\n42 days in the third quarter of last year. Free Cash Flow for the quarter was $3 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.1 billion and net of property and equipment additions of $124 million. Our cash balance at 31 May was $5.5 billion, compared with $9 billion at 31 August. With regard to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.3 million shares for $1.4 billion, an average price of $320.41 per share. As of 31 May, we had approximately $3.3 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $811 million. This represents a 15%\nincrease over last year. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on 15 August, a 15% increase over last year. In closing, we feel good about our results in Q3 and are now working hard to deliver Q4. We remain focused on capturing growth opportunities while continuing to invest in our business for long-term market leadership. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, KC. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing more of the same in terms of the demand environment. Now, let me give a little context on how we're executing our strategy to be the reinvention partner of choice and why we're uniquely positioned to be helping our clients on AI. It is important to remember that while there is a near universal recognition now of the importance of AI, which is the heart of reinvention, the ability to use GenAI at scale varies widely with clients on a continuum, with those which have strong digital cores genuinely seeking to move more quickly, while most clients are coming to the realization of the investments needed to truly implement AI across the\nenterprise, starting with a strong digital core from migrating applications and data to the cloud, building a new cognitive layer, implementing modern ERP and applications across the enterprise to a strong security layer. Nearly all clients are finding it difficult to scale GenAI projects because the AI technology is a small part of what is needed.\nTo reinvent using technology, data, and AI, you must also change your processes and ways of working, reskill and upskill your people, and build new capabilities around responsible AI, all with a deep understanding of industry, function, and technology to unlock the value. And many clients need to first find more efficiencies to enable scaled investment in their digital cores and all these capabilities, particularly in data foundations. In short, GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to more aggressively go after cost, build the digital core, and truly change the ways they work, which creates significant opportunity for us. And this is why clients are coming to us.\nWe are able to help our clients with this AI rotation because of our broad services across Strategy and Consulting, technology and operations, as well as everything customer through Song and digital manufacturing and engineering through Industry X, and our relevance across the functions of the enterprises and 13 industries. Our privileged position in the technology ecosystem has never been more important. We are working closely with our ecosystem partners to help our clients understand the right data and AI backbone that is needed and how to achieve tangible business value. Now, let me give you a few examples of the complex work of reinvention and\nbuilding a digital core. We are partnering with Currys, a leading European technology retailer, to unlock new growth and cost savings by accelerating its adoption of new technologies. First, we will move their operations from a legacy data center to a new cloud platform using pre-built and customized solutions to create a powerful digital core. This unified data foundation allows us to deploy automation and generative AI in key growth areas such as repair centers, customer service, e-commerce, procurement, and in-store experiences, delivering faster, more efficient services to their customers. The move to a new platform supports the company's sustainability goals, reducing energy\nconsumption by transitioning to a more efficient cloud infrastructure. Now, Currys employees will be empowered to serve their customers better by offering high-touch experiences both online and in stores. We're working with Independence Health Group, IHG, a leading health organization headquartered in southeastern Pennsylvania, on a transformation journey to modernize end-to-end operations, improving the way they serve current and future generations of customers.\nWe will help migrate nearly two million members to a new digital-first platform expected to drive immediate improvements in existing business processes. This will lay the foundation to leverage advanced technology and generative AI to proactively manage members' health. We are also helping reskill and retrain their operations staff, creating opportunities for employee development. With this reinvention, Independence continues its ongoing efforts to increase service quality, improve experiences, and enable better health outcomes, positioning them for new areas of growth in the rapidly changing healthcare landscape. Digital core work also requires deep industry\nexpertise as we work with our clients to design the right tech, data, and AI to reinvent their enterprise and their industry. We are helping Macy's, an iconic American retailer, with a technology modernization effort. As a strategic technology execution partner, we will migrate their mainframe systems to a cloud platform, a move that will enhance their operational efficiency and scalability. This will allow Macy's to be more agile and enable growth. We are helping the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates, the regulatory body responsible for the country's banking and insurance sector, with a digital transformation to strengthen the financial system's stability and contribute to growth,\ninnovation, and diversification in the sector in line with the UAE's national vision. Our program will deliver advanced analytics along with AI-driven automation to improve supervisory capabilities and streamline activities for licensed financial institutions by creating best-in-class processes to support regulatory compliance. We will also modernize the bank's enterprise data management by implementing a single unified portal to provide a holistic view of the financial services ecosystem, all of which will enhance the UAE's position as a global financial center. We are partnering with Virgin Media O2, a leading carrier services provider in the UK, to support regional businesses to\nrealize the promise of 5G, opening new revenue streams and stimulating growth in the telco market. We will bring to market solutions built on our edge orchestration platform, which combines edge computing, data and AI, GenAI, and embedded security. This will enable use cases such as quality inspection, safe workplace management, and behavior monitoring to improve operations and customer experience. Whether it's enabling safe communication on building sites, creating a fan experience while handling crowds in busy venues, or supporting vital devices and clinician workflow in healthcare, Virgin Media O2 can now offer businesses a range of flexible, secure, and\naffordable solutions that boost efficiency, growth, and performance. With our Managed Services and customer operations, we can work together with Virgin Media O2 to scale this growth. Security is a critical part of reinvention in the Digital Core. We saw continued very strong digital double-digit growth in our security business this quarter. We are partnering with the US Navy to enhance its cybersecurity operations with cutting-edge capabilities that will strengthen its data security posture and support mission readiness. More than ever, data and information are critically important to national security.\nOur solution sets are configured to provide defensive cyber operations across US Navy networks to help safeguard digital assets and mission operations. Together, we will help ensure the US Navy can combat evolving cyber threats, protect our sailors at sea, and defend American interests around the world. Once clients have a strong foundation, they can explore new opportunities to drive growth and efficiencies with GenAI. We are helping a leading global food and beverage company who already built a strong digital core as part of its reinvention journey to now leverage the power of generative AI to create new value. Together, we developed the digital shelf console pilot, a GenAI\nengine that accelerates content creation for e-commerce and optimizes it to drive sales. The engine empowers marketers to audit and customize content at scale, expected to reduce time to deliver one year's worth of content to just eight working days and save costs of up to 80% quickly and effectively. Once they scale, this enables the company to produce more targeted content with significant time and cost efficiency, increase sales, and transform customer experiences. We have partnered with National Australia Bank, one of the country's largest financial institutions, to strategically implement and scale generative AI to create material value at speed, enhance\nrelationship-driven customer service, and drive operational efficiencies. We worked on a methodical build of a secure and robust GenAI platform built within the bank's existing strategic data platform with the creation of 200 generative AI use cases in backlog. To date, over 20 use cases have been tested across the bank, with eight of these enterprise-grade pilots underway and a number of those scaling and already delivering value. We also co-created a methodology for delivering GenAI projects from experiments to scalable deployment, ensuring each stage delivers tangible business benefits. While doing so, National Australia Bank and Accenture are putting safety at the core of\nthe approach through responsible AI and risk policies alongside developing in-house AI expertise and literacy. One of the areas of richest opportunities for our clients is customer experience transformation, which uses the unique capabilities of Song across creative customer insights and deep technology expertise. Song grew mid-single digits this quarter. We are helping Saudia Airlines, the national flag carrier of Saudi Arabia, to launch an innovative digital platform to transform the traveler's experience. Powered by GenAI, the platform will provide a one-stop solution enabling customers to seamlessly plan their journeys, book flights, and modify their trips in just a few words, all\nwhile providing a personalized and conversational experience. The platform is continuously evolving and will integrate more services over time. This modernization will support Saudia Airlines' vision of redefining the standards of travel in a digital world. We continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. Industry X grew high single digits in Q3. We are supporting a large Asia-Pacific automobile manufacturer on their reinvention towards software-defined vehicles. We will help accelerate software development and create a software center of excellence to optimize quality, cost pressures, and delivery times. This center of excellence will\nmanage four key work streams: advanced driver assistance systems, in-vehicle infotainment, electrical and electronics, and powertrain. By leveraging our expertise and strategic partnerships, we are empowering them to strengthen and evolve its in-vehicle software, providing advanced functions and services throughout the vehicle's lifecycle. This enables the company to drive innovation, enhance driver and passenger experiences, and realize the full potential of software-defined vehicles. We will continue to leverage all of our strengths to manage the current macro conditions and constrained spending while investing in leadership for the future. Back to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.05 billion to 16.65 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about -2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated 2% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be -0.7% compared to fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal 2024, we now expect our revenues to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, which assumes an inorganic contribution\napproaching 3%. We continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. For Adjusted Operating Margin, we continue to expect fiscal 2024 to be 15.5%, a 10 basis points expansion of fiscal 2023 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023.\nWe now expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.85 to $12, or 2 to 3% growth over fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to 9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and Free Cash Flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to 9.3 billion. Our Free Cash Flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong Free Cash Flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our\nshareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question in the follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you so much. And congrats to KC and Angie. I'm excited for both of you guys. I just wanted to ask upfront just for Julie, maybe you mentioned stronger growth next year. Hoping you could just elaborate on that at a high level. I know there's a lot of moving pieces. On one hand, you have a big backlog, a lot of large deals. You have strong inorganic growth. But on the other hand, the sector is struggling with this weak discretionary spend, and there's uncertainty with global elections in the second half of the year. So just I know you can't give formal guidance until next year. I know consensus is at what, 6%? Can you just give us maybe just some high-level considerations that are\nworth underlining as we're recasting our outlook for next year? Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. And thanks for the question, Tien-Tsin. So let's just anchor on our strategy for growth and what you're seeing in three quarters into the year. Because obviously, expectations at the beginning of this year were different in terms of how things develop with spending. So what did we do? We leaned into what clients need. And they need these reinventions. They need these big, large-scale transformations. And so what you've seen us do is you got to go with what the clients need, and that's what they're buying. And so we have accelerated our leaning into these large transformation deals, which is why you see that we have seven more than last year, at this time, of clients with\nbookings of over $100 million. Now, these convert to revenue more slowly, but as we're accelerating, you know that they ramp up and they will start to layer in. And we are very uniquely positioned in this market to be able to do these large-scale transformations because they require the combination of services. Everything from the ability to help them move faster through our Managed Services, our industry expertise. Everyone wants to do that with the eye towards GenAI. So even though the transformations are often in preparation for GenAI, they want to work with the partners who really understand GenAI. And so how do we get there faster? And so as you think about the\nreinvention strategy, that's a strategy we've been executing for a couple of years. And we uniquely can lean in. And you're seeing the results of that this quarter with the acceleration, compared to last year, of clients with that level of bookings. And those, of course, then ramp next year. The second is our leaning into where we are seeing growth in smaller deals. Because remember, the discretionary spending is constrained, overall spending constrained, and particularly in smaller projects. But what did we do?\nWe see GenAI is the new growth. We have an incredible ability to pivot our people. You can see the specialists in data and AI growing. We started at 40,000. We're at 55,000 now against our goal of 80,000 by the end of 2026. We're also training our people. You saw that big increase because we're preparing our people. You're now doing a transformation. It may not be GenAI, but you have to understand GenAI. And so we're uniquely able to train our people at scale to understand GenAI. And how is that translating? We'll look at our bookings this quarter now getting to $2 billion three quarters into the year as compared to $300 million last year and $500 million in revenue.\nSo starting to be meaningful in terms of the numbers. We were at $100 million for all of last year. So we expect to continue to lean into GenAI. And what it's doing is very interesting from where we were, say, three quarters ago. It's acting as the catalyst to understand what you have to do. So I'll finish here, and then I'll just, of course, mention our ability to invest in inorganic. But right now, from a perspective of the pull-through, we're still reprioritizing. But every other GenAI project now is leading to some data project because people are understanding, \"Hey, this is a great technology, and I'm not ready.\" So we feel really good about being very well-positioned as spending increases when\nit does increase because of what we're doing. And then finally, remember, we invest in acquisitions to drive organic growth. So it's all about future growth. I gave a lot in the script today to just help bring to life just how strategic our ability to invest is as we think about future growth. Not trying to comment at all on FY 2025. We'll call it like we see it. We also want to be clear that our strategy is working and these deals will ramp up.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll just add just in terms of how we feel just within this fiscal year. We're very pleased with where we landed in Q3. When you look to Q4, we do have, and you see that in our growth rate, a clear uptick in our growth rate for the fourth quarter.\nI think importantly included in that is the expectation that our consulting type of work in Q4, Tien-Tsin Huang, will return to growth, and that we haven't had growth in consulting type of work since Q2 of last year.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood. No, thank you both for that. I'll be less wordy with my follow-up. Just on the inorganic piece, can this pace continue?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nI'll let Julie talk about add on here. But in terms of our, let's talk about capital allocation. We've always said this. We have the ability, and I think it's a differentiator of ours, to be able to invest and approach the market whenever we see something that we want to execute. And that remains unchanged. And you've seen us do this over all the different business cycles. Importantly, when we do that, we're able to continue all parts of our capital allocation in terms of share buybacks and dividends as well. From a financial standpoint, we have a very strong balance sheet. We have the ability to continue to flex up and down as we see fit from a capital allocation standpoint, Tien-Tsin.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah, Tien-Tsin. I think we'll make the decision as we go into next year as to what level we want to drive for next year. I think we'll comment next quarter.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nOh, that's perfect. I know you've been able to amplify the growth of what you bought, so that's why I asked. Thank you.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDave Koning\n\nResearch Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much.One thing I noticed, debt was up to $1.6 billion or so sequentially. It was the highest. Really, in 20 years, you've almost had no debt. And you have a lot of cash. So I guess, what's the strategy around borrowing money now? And maybe it's just geographic cash positions too.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. That's a great question. So in terms of our cash, you said that we started the year at $9 billion, and now we're a little bit, we're about $5.5 billion. And we do have some debt. It's very small, as you mentioned, for a company of our size. We do have a. We had a credit facility that we put in right during the pandemic. And we continue to have a credit facility. It's about $5.5 billion. It's a five-year credit facility. What you just see, Dave, is that we're just exercising some of that credit facility, kind of normal treasury operations.\n\nDave Koning\n\nResearch Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. And maybe just as a follow-up, margins this year up at the lower end of kind of normal. And certainly, scale, just the growth this year being a little slower, maybe the acquisitions. And just as we kind of look forward, the margin puts and takes, how should we think that with acquisition spending being a little higher, does the next few quarters remain kind of putting a little pressure on margins? Or how should we think of just the moving parts of margins going forward?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah, sure. So I'll just obviously keep my comments to this year, to 2024. And maybe I'll just point out where we are and what we are continuing to assume. So we stated last quarter that we'd be at 10 basis points of operating margin expansion. We reconfirmed that, Dave, for the full year again this quarter. We feel confident in our ability to do that. So if you look at we run our business to operating margin. If you look at gross margin and overall what we've been saying on pricing. Just importantly, when we talk about pricing, we mean the margin on the work that we sell. What I think is really important for us is that we've been able to operate our business with rigor and discipline in how we run\nourselves in efficient operations of Accenture and be our own best credential as we absorb kind of higher selling costs, which you would expect. We're looking at our record $60 billion of bookings, and also the continued pressure on pricing that we've had across our business. So with that, we feel really good. And if you look at it, we grew 1% in Q1. As an example, we were able to do 20 basis points of margin expansion. We grew 1% this quarter, and we were able to do 10 basis points of margin expansion. So we feel good about the way we run our business with rigor and discipline.\n\nDave Koning\n\nResearch Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thanks. And nice bookings.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. And congrats, KC. Great run at Accenture. You were awesome. So I want to ask on Managed Services on the bookings, the $11.8 billion. That was an outsized number. How much of that is new bookings versus renewals? And maybe give us some flavor on what caused that spike in growth.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll talk a little bit about the numbers. In terms of, it is a record bookings for Managed Services. As Julie's been and as we've been talking, it is obviously based on the larger transformational deals that we're doing. While those larger transformational deals, just to be clear, Bryan, they do have both consulting and outsourcing, excuse me, Managed Services type of work with them. They do have, as you would expect, a larger portion of Managed Services type of work. So when you see what we were able to do this year, we're already at 92.7, seven more than last year. And we did have a very strong Managed Services booking, as you noted, in Q3.\nWe don't really do a breakout in terms of expansions or new. But we always have a healthy mix, I would say, of both. That's what we strive to over rolling four quarters in our business always. And no difference there.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And just maybe a little color, Bryan, as you think about this idea of reinvention, Virgin Media O2 is a great example because there, right, we have a combination where using our edge platform to provide help O2 provides Virgin Media O2 to provide these new services. And at the same time, we're supporting it with our customer operations, supporting their growth so that they can scale. And right now, clients, of course, they're looking for growth. They're also looking for transformation and efficiency. The other thing I'd say is this is a great example of how we're embracing GenAI.\nYou've heard us talk in the past about ourc, which helps in our Managed Services. That's become GenWizard. And we're seeing that our early embracing of using GenAI, where it's ready to be used, has been a real differentiator in our technology Managed Services. So we're very focused on helping our clients move faster using our expertise and leverage our digital investments in order for them to transform and reinvent faster. And you're seeing that focus.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. And just a follow-up, just looking at some of the dimensions breakout. When I look at operations being flat, just any callouts for that? I know it was negative last quarter, so it's turned a little bit here. But just trying to understand the growth there and the prospects. Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. No, we're really pleased that it ticked up this quarter. And it's a very strategic part of our business. Think about it really as sort of two ways, right? So we remain number one in our industry in finance and accounting. And we're embracing, again, GenAI there to help differentiate our platform. And so there's a focus that we're seeing in our clients as they're saying, \"Okay, we really understand how much more we need to digitize. And we need to do that in the enterprise.\" They're excited about our ability over time. Again, it's very early days still in GenAI over time to help build our Synapse platform. We're building our Synapse platform. We're building in GenAI. And that helps them have\nless to build in their enterprise side by partnering with us. And so that's, we think, a really great differentiator. And then we continue to diversify into areas that are in the core of our business, core of our industries for our clients, whether it's claims and underwriting and insurance, or supply chain for consumer goods and industrial, or core banking in the financial services. So we feel really good about the business and kind of continue in its continued prospects.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst Payments, Processors, and IT Services, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Bryan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please go ahead.\n\nRod Bourgeois\n\nHead of Research, DeepDive Equity Research\n\nHey, guys. And very best wishes to KC as well. Julie, you mentioned that the demand environment is sort of more of the same. At the same time, it appears you've seen some growth momentum in certain key areas. I'm particularly interested in the growth improvement in the CMT vertical and in Strategy and Consulting. Can you talk about what's enabling those growth improvements and a sense of the outlooks for CMT and S&C? Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo really want to compliment our entire team on the work that they're doing with our clients in CMT. So as we've been talking about that for now for a little while, and you start to see things like the Virgin Media O2 deal. So our teams are working with our clients on what do they need. And they're focused on getting rid of technology debt because that's critical in order to use some of these new technologies. They're focused on using the new technologies. So we have a number of clients that, while it's still small, are working on GenAI. And then being very focused on efficiencies. And then finally, network. So really across the board, what I would say is the industry was\nchallenged. We have been just focused on going to where they need help. You're seeing that result in our results. Then on Strategy and Consulting, again, it's all about being focused on what do our clients need. We've pivoted many more people, for example, toward cost and strategy. Cost takeout's a big theme, particularly for our strategy. We're seeing a lot of growth still in things like implementing modern ERP platforms with the focus on the digital core. Again, at Accenture, it's not just technology, right? It's about where the number one player with all of these technology ecosystem players. But our clients want to do it faster. They need the industry expertise. You saw a\nnumber of examples in the script about how we're putting in these platforms. We're doing so within an industry context. So I would say cost takeout and move the cloud data platforms wrapped around with industry and functional expertise. That's where we're seeing the growth. We just continue to remain laser-focused on more people, more focus working with the clients on what they need to buy.\n\nRod Bourgeois\n\nHead of Research, DeepDive Equity Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for that. You're seeing revenue mix incrementally shift into Managed Services. I'm curious if you think some of that mix shift towards Managed Services is due to secular forces, or are you purely seeing that mix shift as just a cyclical phenomenon?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I think it's in terms of what the real driver is; it's the larger deals that have a little bit of both in those both components of secular and cyclical in what you're talking about. So it really is just based on the larger deals.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSo just think about Accenture as very uniquely positioned in this market. Clients are prioritizing large-scale transformations. And doing those and getting the efficiencies and moving faster, Managed Services is a highly strategic component of being able to do that. And this is where Accenture, with such scale in both strategy and both consulting type of work with Managed Services, is really able to lean into what our clients buying now.\n\nRod Bourgeois\n\nHead of Research, DeepDive Equity Research\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. And congrats, KC, and the other leaders on the retirements and appointments. First question I wanted to ask on the consulting existing revenue-based performance. Can you just talk about how base business runoff kind of progressed within the -1% local currency performance? I heard your comment on the Q4 consulting returning to growth. I'm trying to understand if that's a reflection of sustainable stabilization potential here and really gauge whether you're reaching a point where the new consulting bookings conversion should more than offset the existing base runoff moving ahead.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So, Bryan, in terms of what we'll talk about is really what I just mentioned on Q4, I guess. I understand what you mean by a base runoff. We don't really think of it that way. We kind of look at it as maybe our terms would be, what do we have booked in backlog? And what have we already and what's new coming in from new sales? Just kind of going with those two points, the way we evaluate and we talk about it, Bryan, is from a year-over-year basis, looking at both the components of what we've already sold for the next quarter, and then what we see in our pipeline and how we see those sales will convert to revenue. That's how we kind of assess where we think that we will be overall.\nAnd again, very pleased that consulting, we do feel that and see that it will return to growth. And I think it's a milestone that we haven't had in a number of quarters. So we're pleased with that. And we'll comment on anything else for next year or next year, I mean, in September.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. And then bookings obviously very solid here. Can you just comment on pipeline, and any bookings expectations worth calling out for Q4?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Overall, we feel good about our pipeline. And we don't have guidance to next quarter bookings. But we feel good.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Wanted to follow up on the acquisition activity. It's obviously been really robust, providing a lot of good opportunities. Can you give us any sense collectively across the acquisitions you've been doing and maybe what you are looking at in terms of what the growth rates of those businesses are generally or collectively when you do the acquisitions? And I know there's a target to accelerate those. How the growth rates tend to change as those companies are absorbed into Accenture, even if directionally?\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, I think in terms of make sure I'm answering your question is when we look overall at our acquisitions, they all come with they're typically higher growth business cases that we have from the companies that we buy. We have a base case that comes with the organization. We assess that growth rate. Then we obviously put in pretty significant synergy cases that are, without going through kind of metrics, a pretty high bar for those acquisitions to deliver to, along with a broader Accenture. That's why integration is so important in what we do because it's not just having great business case. That is maybe half of what you need to do. But the key really is on how you integrate to\ndeliver to that. We have a very strong track record. So what you'll see is you can just maybe get the sense. To your question is, look at how many we've done over the last five years. You can see how we've been able to continue to grow our business throughout that time. It is really continuing to fuel our organic growth.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGot it. Then, quickly, one of the areas where you've leaned in on and was mentioned in the prepared remarks is the government and healthcare sector, really strong growth there, obviously. How should we be thinking about that as a long-term or medium-term potential grower in that segment? How are you thinking about the investment needed to continue to drive that? Thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks. Yeah. No, we feel really good about that vertical. Obviously, there's a lot of transformation that's going on in public service. You see health as a big driver. Defense is a big driver. There's a lot of infrastructure support, whether it's IRA in the US or what the EU has been doing as well. Of course, a lot of the digital transformation hasn't happened in the public service and health. So we see that now being the time. You're seeing that in the results. We feel very confident. We think about the investment like we do all our industries. I mean, remember, we have 13 industry groups. Diversification is a key part of both our resilience and our growth strategy. At any given time, we're\ninvesting differently depending on the growth trajectory. As we called out this quarter, we've been investing significantly in public service because we see the next several years this being a big growth area. We're making those investments now.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question. And then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO. Please go ahead.\n\nKeith Bachman\n\nAnalyst, BMO\n\nHi. Many thanks. And first, KC and Paul, special congratulations as you make the transition. I wanted to ask a question. And I'll just make it concurrently in the interest of time. And Julie, I think I'll direct this to you. Number one, on BPO, one of your competitors just talked pretty openly about pricing's been under pretty material duress as of late. And I wondered if you would echo that. And I'm really curious as to why. Why do you think pricing has been under duress? And how do you think about impacting future growth? And then the second area that I wanted to ask about is Song. Thank you for the comment on mid-single-digit growth. I'm really interested how you think GenAI will\nimpact your digital agency over the next 12 to 24 months. The reason I asked the question is we also spend a lot of time with companies like Adobe that have significant generative AI is going to have a significant impact on digital agencies. Some of the agencies are talking about seat reductions because of the value associated with generative AI. I'm just wondering if you could comment on how you think generative AI will impact the growth potential of Song. That's it for me. Many thanks.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. KC, why don't you quickly comment on pricing? Then I'll do Song.\n\nKC McClure\n\nSenior Finance Advisor and CFO, Accenture\n\nKeith, I would say just in terms of pricing, and we've been commenting on this for quite some time, you are correct in that we've had overall in our entire business continued pricing pressure. So, I mean, that's the way I would reflect on that statement on your question before I hand it over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. It's overall. It's a tight market. So that's what you normally see. On Song, here's where we are so unique because our business is not an agency business, right? The agencies are part of an incredibly differentiated value proposition where you have creative, technology, and digital, and by the way, Managed Services. And so we see this as a huge opportunity because we are embracing it as fast as possible to help our clients get value. But we put it together with all of these other services. So we were happy to see the uptick in growth this quarter with Song. And long-term, we really think it's great. And remember, this is our playbook, right? We embrace technology. We've done\nit in every wave. We've done it when we did Managed Services. Remember in 2015, we had Synapse and myWizard. Our business is to help our clients be more efficient and grow. That is what we do. And we use technology and how we deliver it. And we help them use technology and how they operate. And so we see GenAI as yet another way that we're going to embrace it. We're going to be fast. And we're going to help. We're going to do what we do for clients. And that is a very exciting opportunity. So we feel really good about our Song business. Great. So thanks, everyone, for the questions and the time today. In closing, I want to, again, as always, thank all of our shareholders for your\ncontinued trust and support, and all of our people for what you're doing for our clients and for each other every day. Thanks so much for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.\nWe're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Your conference will begin momentarily. Please continue to hold. Your conference will begin momentarily. Please continue to hold.\nGood morning. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's Q2 Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. If you have a question at any time during the call, please press one, then zero. If you should require assistance during the call, please press star, then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations, Katie O'Conor. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director, Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, Operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings announcement. As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you'll hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the Q2. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the Q3 and full fiscal year 2024.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.\nDuring our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at Accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining, and thank you to our 742,000 people around the world who work every day to deliver 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. I'm pleased with our performance in an uncertain macro. Our results highlight the benefit of the deep trust our clients have in us, our capabilities to do the most complex work at the heart of their businesses, the privileged position we hold within the ecosystem, and our ability to invest for the next waves of growth.\nWe continue to see momentum in the quarter on how we are executing on our strategy to be the trusted reinvention partner of our clients, with a record 39 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million. These large transformational wins position us to capture more growth as spending increases.\nWe also had over $600 million in new GenAI bookings, taking us to $1.1 billion in GenAI sales the first half of the fiscal year, expanding our early lead in GenAI, which is core to our clients' reinvention. We now have over 53,000 skilled data and AI practitioners against our goal of doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 by the end of fiscal year 2026.\nWe are laser-focused on the needs of our clients, and this focus is reflected in our bookings of $21.6 billion, representing our second-highest quarter on record. This included $10 billion of bookings in North America, our highest ever. We continue to take market share with revenues of $15.8 billion for the quarter, flat compared to last year and slightly above the midpoint of our range.\nAs we turn the page on the calendar year, we saw another turn of the dial on constraining spending by our clients, including spending on our services, particularly in parts of EMEA and North America. This was evident in the composition of our new bookings, which came in differently than expected. We see clients continuing to prioritize investing in large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue more slowly, while further limiting discretionary spending, particularly in smaller projects.\nWe also saw continued delays in decision-making and a slower pace of spending. We are pleased that despite these conditions, our focused efforts to return to growth resulted in North America and CMT showing improvement over last quarter. We are running our business with rigor and discipline, and we remain on track with the business optimization actions we announced last year to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS growth of 3%. We continue to invest significantly in our business to drive additional growth in highly strategic areas, with $2.1 billion of capital deployed across our geographic markets in Q2 in 11 acquisitions, bringing the total investment in acquisitions to $2.9 billion in H1 across a total of 23 acquisitions. We also continue to invest in learning for our people, with approximately 10 million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 14 hours per person.\nIn recognition of the 360-degree value we create, we are proud that we earned the number one position in our industry for the 11th year in a row and number 33 overall on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. We ranked number one in our industry and number three overall on the JUST Capital CNBC list of America's most just companies.\nWe have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 17th year in a row. An important part of our growth strategy is to use our strong balance sheet to invest in order to scale higher growth areas and expand into new growth areas. We have a strong track record of delivering on this strategy. Here are some highlights from the quarter.\nIn North America, we invested in supply chain, an area with significant reinvention ahead, with the additions of Insight Sourcing, Impendi, and 6point6. We acquired Navisite to help clients across multiple cloud providers, enterprise applications, and digital technologies modernize their digital core. In Song, we acquired Work & Co to help our clients drive growth by designing and bringing digital brand strategies to market and operationalizing world-class digital products at scale.\nIn EMEA, we are investing to help clients build their digital core and drive growth. In the UK, we invested in 6point6, which will help our clients transform their digital capabilities and modernize their legacy systems. We also acquired in the UK Redkite, with its full-stack data expertise that will help our clients accelerate their performance with data-driven intelligence and AI.\nIn Germany, we added Vocatus, which will accelerate our clients' growth strategies using behavioral economics modeling to develop pricing strategy and sales concepts for B2B and B2C models. Similarly, in growth markets, our acquisitions position us to drive our clients' growth agendas by expanding our capabilities in marketing and customer experience with Rabbit's Tale in Thailand and Jixie in Singapore, helping clients in Indonesia capitalize on their fast-growing digital economy. Our ability to invest to fuel our organic growth is a competitive advantage.\nAs our clients continue to transform, we announced earlier this month that we will invest $1 billion over the next three years in Accenture LearnVantage, which will provide comprehensive technology learning and training services to help our clients reskill and upskill their people. Our investment includes the acquisition of Udacity, a digital education pioneer, which we expect to close by the summer. Once closed, we will have revenue in the zone of $100 million annually.\nThese services are highly strategic, and they enhance our position as a reinvention partner of choice because talent is at the top of the agenda for CEOs. For example, we are helping Merck, a global biopharmaceutical company known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, launch a groundbreaking Generative AI training program for their employees to create world-class digital leaders.\nAs a renowned thought leader in the biopharmaceutical market, Merck has long led the way in investing in its people and helping them build the skills and expertise needed to develop breakthrough therapies. Digital, data, analytics, and AI play a pivotal role in discovering, developing, manufacturing, and providing access for patients to medicines and vaccines. By once again investing in its people, Merck will be able to continue delivering on its promise to use the power of leading-edge science to save and improve lives around the world. Over to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie. Thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were pleased with our overall results in the Q2, with our second-highest quarter of new bookings. We continue to invest at scale to strengthen our leadership position while delivering value for our shareholders. Now, let me summarize a few of the highlights of the quarter.\nRevenues were flat in local currency, with mid-single-digit growth or higher in six of our 13 industries, including public service, life science, utilities, energy, health, and high tech. While our CMT industry group improved this quarter, we continue to see pressure, as expected. We continue to take market share. As a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about a third of our addressable market.\nWe use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. Adjusted operating margin of 13.7% decreased 10 basis points compared to Q2 last year. Year-to-date operating margin is flat.\nThis includes continued significant investments in our people and in our business. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.77, reflecting 3% growth over adjusted EPS last year. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2 billion and returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. In the first half of the year, we have invested $2.9 billion in acquisitions across 23 transactions. With those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings.\nNew bookings were $21.6 billion for the quarter, representing a 2% decline in both US dollar and local currency, with an overall book-to-bill of 1.4. Consulting bookings were $10.5 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Managed services bookings were $11.1 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.4. Turning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, flat in both US dollars and in local currency, and were slightly above the midpoint of our guided range.\nConsulting revenues for the quarter were $8 billion, a decline of 3% in both US dollars and local currency. Managed service revenues were $7.8 billion, up 3% in both US dollars and local currency. Taking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services grew low single digits, and operations, strategy, and consulting declined low single digits. Turning to our geographic markets.\nIn North America, revenue was flat in local currency, with growth in public service offset by declines in banking and capital markets, software and platforms, and communications and media. In EMEA, revenues declined 2% in local currency, with growth in public service offset by declines in communications and media, and banking and capital markets. Revenue growth in Italy was offset by declines in the United Kingdom, France, and Ireland. In growth markets, revenue grew 6% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, industrial, public service, and chemicals and natural resources.\nRevenue growth was driven by Japan and Argentina, partially offset by declines in Australia and Brazil. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 30.9%, compared with 30.6% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.3%, compared to 9.9% for the Q2 last year.\nGeneral administrative expense was 6.9%, compared to 6.8% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q2 of FY 2024 and FY 2023, we recorded $115 million and $244 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, respectively. These costs decreased operating margin by 70 basis points, and EPS by $0.14 this quarter, and operating margin by 150 basis points, and EPS by $0.30 in Q2 of last year.\nThe following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion in the Q2, reflecting an adjusted operating margin of 13.7%, a decrease of 10 basis points from adjusted operating margin in the Q2 of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 18.8%, compared with an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.4% for the Q2 last year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.77, compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $2.69 in the Q2 last year. Days sales outstanding were 43 days, compared to 49 days last quarter and 42 days in the Q2 of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.1 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $110 million.\nOur cash balance at 29 February 2024 was $5.1 billion, compared with $9 billion at 31 August 2023. With regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the Q2, we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $1.3 billion at an average price of $352.35 per share. As of 29 February 2024, we had approximately $4.6 billion of share repurchase authority remaining.\nAlso, in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $813 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on 15 May, a 15% increase over last year. In closing, we remain laser-focused on capturing growth opportunities in the market and delivering value for our clients. As you know and expect of us, we will operate with rigor and discipline while continuing to invest for long-term market leadership. Now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Casey. Let me give a little more color on the demand environment. While all strategies continue to lead to technology and reinvention, our clients are navigating an uncertain macro environment due to economic, geopolitical, and industry-specific conditions. In response, we're seeing them thoughtfully prioritize larger transformations, building out their digital core to partnering to improve productivity, to free up more investment capacity, to a focus on growth and other initiatives with near-term ROI.\nOur focus on being at the center of our clients' business, doing their most complex transformational work, provides us with resiliency over time, as demonstrated by the fact that our top 100 clients have been clients for over 10 years. There is now near-universal recognition of the importance of AI, which is the heart of reinvention.\nThe ability to use AI at scale, however, varies widely, with clients on a continuum, with those which have strong digital cores generally seeking to move more quickly, while most clients are coming to grips with the investments needed to truly implement AI across the enterprise. Nearly all are finding it difficult to scale because the AI technology is a small part of what is needed.\nTo reinvent using technology, data, and AI, you must have the right digital core, change your processes and ways of working, reskill and upskill your people, and build new capabilities around responsible AI, all with a deep understanding of industry and function in order to unlock the value. Many clients need to first find more efficiency to enable scaled investment in all these capabilities, particularly in their data foundations.\nWe are able to help our clients with this AI rotation because of our broad services across strategy and consulting, technology and operations, as well as everything customer through Song and digital manufacturing and engineering through Industry X, and our relevance across the functions of the enterprises in 13 industries. Our privileged position in the technology ecosystem has perhaps never been more important.\nGenerative AI is rapidly evolving and still in the early stages of maturity and adoption. We are working closely with our ecosystem partners to help our clients understand the right data and AI backbone that is needed and how to achieve tangible business value. I'll now bring to life the complex work we are doing at the heart of our clients' businesses.\nBuilding on the back of a long-trusted partnership, we are working with Mondel?z International, a world leader in snacking, with well-known brands like Oreo, belVita, and Cadbury to continue to drive growth and be an industry leader. Having laid the foundations of a strong shared services model powered by leading technology platforms and a data and AI foundation, we are now working on an ambitious reinvention of their digital core.\nWe will design and implement a single cloud-based platform while also modernizing the finance function and transforming their supply chain planning and warehouse management capabilities. This will enable faster availability of products for customers, driving more sales growth and maximum profitability. This new digital core will also allow Mondel?z to further reinvent how they satisfy customers through the adoption of new technologies like generative AI. Cloud continues to be the foundation of the digital core.\nOur cloud business grew high single digit this quarter as clients do work across the cloud continuum, from migration to modernization to new business models to working at the intelligent edge. For example, we're helping Riyadh Air, a digitally native airline based in Saudi Arabia, become the world's first fully cloud-based airline. We will equip the brand new airline with a cloud-only infrastructure, enhanced cybersecurity, and AI-driven operations.\nOur capabilities will ensure that Riyadh Air's digital core is future-proof and remains legacy-free, enabling the airline to use cutting-edge technologies such as cloud, data, and AI to scale quickly and deliver a seamless and more personalized travel experience for its customers and employees. This will also help the company scale as it plans to operate over 100 destinations by 2030.\nWe are partnering with Belden, a global networking solution organization, on a cloud transformation program that will help them become a platform business, unlocking the power of edge, data, and AI to drive new business opportunities and enhance the customer experience. This platform will be powered by edge-to-cloud technology, allowing them to collect and analyze real-time data from industrial environments and improve operational efficiencies.\nThis will provide valuable data-driven insights to Belden and to their clients in industries where real-time insights are crucial. This reinvention will enable them to break down operational technology silos, allowing them to become a key player in the digital twin domain. We will also help enable this new service in the market. This strategic partnership will support Belden's reinvention from a products company into a data engineering and insights company that leverages the power of platforms.\nWe are focused on helping our clients leverage the power of AI quickly, generating tangible business value, leveraging our investment in differentiated tools that accelerate results. Our AI Navigator has helped clients across industries outline their value case, AI architecture, and AI solutions. Our recently announced AI Switchboard is already helping clients with the complex new need for integration across LLM models.\nFor example, one of the largest entertainment companies is currently testing the Switchboard to compare how the same prompt would be interpreted by different models and how they perform before deciding on which model to use. Ultimately, an enterprise-wide AI rotation requires a strong data foundation. We are working with Telstra, Australia's leading telecommunications and technology company, on a radical simplification and modernization of its data ecosystem, accelerating its efforts to become AI-powered.\nWe are modernizing and consolidating over 50 disparate enterprise data sources into a small integrated set, forming Telstra's governed and secure data and AI core, allowing Telstra to rapidly scale bespoke generative AI capabilities in the future. Our work will also support the company's efforts to develop responsible, ethical, and secure market-leading AI frameworks while helping their teams provide quicker, more effective, and more personalized customer interactions.\nOne of the areas of richest opportunities for our clients is customer experience transformation, including with Generative AI, which uses the unique capabilities of Song across creative customer insights and deep technology expertise. Song grew low single digits this quarter. We continue to help clients reimagine marketing to drive growth. We're helping ExxonMobil, an energy supermajor, transform and optimize its end-to-end fuels marketing operations to drive future growth.\nWith our global capabilities, our managed services will leverage our Synapse platform to drive automation and deliver measurable efficiencies across the fuels marketing business. We are strengthening our partnership with Best Buy, a leading consumer electronics retailer, across multiple fronts to reimagine the customer experience, optimize costs, and drive growth. By leveraging data and Generative AI, we are helping to transform their context in our operations and improve customer and employee experience.\nWe are also pleased to have entered into an agreement with Best Buy for lifecycle management of our own Accenture devices in North America and are creating a joint offering of end-to-end field service device support for clients. We have already applied this new offering to a major TV provider, marking our first entry into this new market. These strategic initiatives underscore our commitment to helping Best Buy achieve superior customer experiences, operational efficiencies, and growth.\nSecurity is essential to reinvention, moving beyond IT to protecting the core assets of the business and evolving the critical role of security as technologies change. We saw very strong double-digit growth in our security business this quarter. We are working with one of the largest electric utility holding companies in the United States to integrate their operational technology into a seamless, unified cybersecurity solution.\nTogether, we will enhance their security capabilities by implementing advanced monitoring and response, vulnerability management, and security automation. This will help reduce the risk of cyber events in their grid environment, protecting critical infrastructure serving tens of millions of people. We continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. Industry X grew double digits in Q2.\nWe're working with Indo Count Industries Limited, a global leader in the home textile space, on digital transformation to simplify operations, support its ambitious growth plans, and maximize e-commerce opportunities. We will build a cloud-enabled digital core powered by data and analytics that will help standardize, digitize, and automate processes and operations. From supply chain to logistics to manufacturing, the new platform will enable more efficient inventory management, quality standardization, optimal energy consumption, and better customer experiences.\nTogether, we will reinvent their operations and help expand their business in India, the Middle East, North America, the UK, and Europe. We continue our support for corporate green transformation by promoting carbon footprint compliance through the calculation and visualization of greenhouse gas emissions. To create a market where consumers can choose environmentally conscious products and services, a system to visualize the carbon footprint of each product is necessary.\nFor example, we're assisting Matsumoto Precision, a precision machine parts processing company based in Japan, to gain more detailed insights into the sustainability of their production and achieve their decarbonization goal. We implemented a solution through our manufacturing platform that uses individual manufacturing performance information to record and report the CO2 emission on a per-product basis. This will allow Matsumoto Precision to enhance their understanding of the environmental impact of their business and contribute more effectively to the realization of a decarbonized society. Back to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the Q3 of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.25 to 16.85 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about -1% compared to the Q3 of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated -1% to 3%+ growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to expect the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal 2024, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 1% to 3 growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, which assumes an inorganic contribution approaching 3%.\nWe continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. For adjusted operating margin, we now expect fiscal year 2024 to be 15.5%, a 10 basis point expansion over fiscal 2023 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22.5% to 24.5. This compares to an effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023.\nWe now expect our full-year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.97 to 12.20, or 3% to 5 growth over fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 to 9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 to 9.3 billion.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to shareholders. With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director, Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press one, then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one, zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one, then zero at this time. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, thank you. Good morning to all of you. Julie, just a big picture, maybe too simple of a question, but just curious to get your thoughts on where we are in the cycle for IT services spend because we've been seeing sector softness for quite some time now. Accenture has done well. You've had very large deal activity come through. Short-term cycle stuff is always a little pressured, as you said. Where are we in terms of seeing maybe things bottoming or short-cycle discretionary spend returning?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, Tien-Tsin, I think it's hard to predict at this point anything other than what we see right now, right? What's different than 90 days ago? Well, as we said in December, we really get visibility into our clients' budgets in January. We say that every year, right?\nAs the calendar year, we turn the page, what we saw was a further tightening of spending at our clients, and that affects our services, and particularly on the smaller projects. From a sort of trend perspective, right, 90 days ago, we didn't see the same level. Now you've kind of turned the dial a little bit more, constraints, and that's where we see the budgets being set for calendar year 2024, right?\nAs you said, though, in this environment, we're taking market share, and we're seeing building momentum on our strategy to be the reinvention partner with a record 39 clients with bookings over $100 million. What does that tell you, right? The clients understand the importance of the technology-led transformation, right? The fundamentals remain the same, right? There's a lot more reinvention ahead.\nWhen you look at where is cloud, right, both migration and modernization, we say about 80% of the opportunity is ahead, right? Data and AI, about 90% of the opportunity is ahead. Replatforming and cloud-based platforms, about 65% of that opportunity ahead based on who has actually adopted the more modern platforms. Security, well, I think security can be kind of forever ahead, but at least 65% ahead.\nThat's before you get to thinking about areas like digital manufacturing, engineering services, where that technology has only been coming online even in the last couple of years, sort of the modern technology. Of course, customer also extraordinarily early days. Where we really focus on is meeting clients where they are today, right? That's prioritize the large transformational deals and then be positioned to capture the spending when it increases.\nWe see sort of the industry as being very strong because all clients have to get there. They need to get to the technology transformation. They need to get to reinvention. That's why you're seeing, even as the constraints, you're seeing that early interest in GenAI. I mean, $1 billion sales in the first six months of the year, that is the fastest we have ever built sales in an emerging technology. What it tells you is that clients understand the importance of AI, that they're going to have to reinvent every part of the enterprise. That's exactly where everything we've done for the last decades at Accenture, right?\nBeing the company that can go from strategy to build to operations, deep in industry and functional expertise, because of strategy and consulting all comes together for this moment to be the partner for reinvention across the enterprise, not just to build the technology, but to use it to reinvent. That's exactly what you see in these results, which is why I'm super confident about the industry and in the future.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. No, and I'm confident that Accenture will be there to catch all that, like you said. Maybe it's my follow-up with the GenAI bookings. Any trends on deal size and confidence that some of these early bookings will convert to become a part of this whole large $100 million+ deal activity across, or pull through from GenAI, if that question makes sense?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nA couple of things, right? What you see in our resilience is that we are doing these bookings over $100 million, and that's what kind of layers that. That just gives you that base, right, of resilience during this period. As we said, we've seen further constraint on the smaller projects. That's why you've got the updated guidance, right? The base of these larger deals, we feel really good about from a resilience perspective.\nThen you know how this is, right? You're at the client. You're at the heart of their business. You're really doing the strategic work. That's what all these large deals represent. Then as spending increases, you catch the pent-up demand. That's kind of how we see it, and that's how we've run it in the past. By the way, of course, as you know, we're really investing inorganically to capture more growth, which you also start to see in particular at the back end of our fiscal year. Thanks, Tien-Tsin Huang.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, good morning. KC, if Accenture does 1% constant currency in Q3, that's kind of the midpoint of the range. I guess the implied midpoint for Q4 is a ramp up to 6% constant currency. What kind of visibility do you have going into a number of the midpoint like that in Q4?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Hi, Brian. Thanks for your question. You're right. Obviously, your math is correct. That would be what our guidance would say. In terms of visibility, it's really no different than what we have any time in the past in this part of the year for our full-year guidance. Obviously, we are not forecasting the whole year. We just have the back half of the year. There's no difference in visibility as it relates to what we've done any other time of the year, any other year this time. We do our same analysis and outlook to provide you with our guidance of the Q1 to Q3.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Got it. Then, Julie, just thinking about clients needing to update their data in order to leverage AI and scale, why isn't that translating to stronger demand in the business? You would think that everybody would turn around and spend considerably on short-term to get that ramp up in order to get AI to leverage it, but it doesn't quite translate. I'm just trying to figure out the disconnect there.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. There's two things. First of all, it's about prioritization, right? They're overall constrained on spending, right? You make choices, right, as opposed to it being additive. They're not able to allocate extra budget. They're prioritizing their budget. You're seeing more of a substitution right now as opposed to, Hey, we need to do this. Let's add to the budget. That's tied to the uncertain macro that's putting people constrained. I had one banker say it's like corporates have put themselves on a diet given the macro, right? The second thing, Bryan, is you have to remember that you can't just jump to the great data foundation, right? You need to be in the cloud. You've got to have modern platforms.\nWhat you should read into the higher clients doing these higher bookings, right, is that they're doing the big transformations oftentimes to be ready to put in the data foundation, right? There's only still 40% of workloads that are in the cloud. Roughly 20% of those haven't been modernized, right? Many of our clients haven't put in the platforms. If you don't have the major ERP platforms that are modern, you don't create a data foundation to fuel GenAI in isolation. You've got to build the digital core, and as we've said, there's a lot more to go. That's what's driving these larger complex transformations.\nPeople don't like to do these big transformations in the sense of they're big, they're hard, they're complicated, and they need to do them in order to ultimately be able to use the AI, not just in a part of the business or as a proof of concept, but really to transform and get the value they now see. Again, you can't jump to AI. You've got to put all the pieces, and a lot of clients aren't there yet, which is our opportunity.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Bryan. Thanks, Bryan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on the questions around particularly AI, etc. I recognize everybody's kind of at different stages. How should we think about first the timeline in terms of preparing and getting ready to implement new solutions, etc., and then moving into full implementation and how we should think about that affecting Accenture's business? Like you mentioned, you've talked about some record bookings or the number of new customers over 100 million, how that will ramp in the timeframe.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Well, so maybe just let me just start with the strategy around capturing the growth opportunity from GenAI, right? This is the same playbook that we have used in every wave of new technology evolution, right? When we went from mainframe to client server, then to cloud and software as a service, and then to RPA and AI-driven automation when you saw things like myWizard and Synapse, right? We have the same strategy.\nThe strategy starts with, we want to be the first mover to help our clients use the technology. That's why, what we're doing with our investments of $3 billion to create solutions for them. You see that coming through with our sales in Generative AI, which, as I said earlier, are the fastest we've ever seen in sort of these new technologies, because there's a lot of interest, and we're the leader. We want to be the first mover in helping our clients use it. The second part of our strategy is to be the first mover in using the technology itself to serve our clients, right? We did that with the digital, with AI automation, with all of our platforms.\nWhat that does, it's a proven formula because if we invest big to be early and be the first mover, right, then we're positioned to capture all the opportunity with our clients because they need to adopt it and transform. As I just went through, that requires a lot, the digital core. Then you've got to actually use it to change new ways of working, right, to upskill your talent, right, and build new capabilities like responsible AI. When we are able to be the first mover, which we are already starting now to use GenAI and how we deliver, that enhances our competitive position, right? It makes us more differentiated.\nOf course, it also then allows our clients over time, the more we use the GenAI, to achieve the results they need at a lower cost, which frees up their investment capacity to do the massive reinvention. Of course, we are then best positioned to be their partner as they reinvest in using the tech and AI to reimagine their enterprise. That use of AI, because remember, as you think about the growth, right, you've got a lot of a digital core that's got to be built, right?\nYou can't jump that step, right? It's not a magic technology, right? Then as you build it, you then have to go function by function to change the ways you work to actually get the productivity and the growth. We really see this as being kind of the next decade of what our clients are going to be focused on, and we're positioning ourselves to be their partner and be the first mover in both places.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe I'll take the layering-in question on the larger deals and talk a little bit about how that's going to work for the back half of the year as it relates to guidance. We have the larger deals that were terrific, right, in our Q2 and our whole first half of the year. You're right, they do layer in slower than the smaller deals, and we see pressure in the volume of our smaller deals. That's why we have the 1 to 3 guidance for the full year. Now, we do feel good about delivering to this guidance and what that means for H2.\nIt really is for a few reasons that we've talked about before, but let me just kind of reiterate. The first is that our competitive advantage is that we have the ability to invest. You saw us do that in H1, and Julie talked about that, with investing more in acquisitions this year in the first half than we did all of last year. That's really important because that drives inorganic growth. Again, we do that really to fuel organic growth. We see that coming online in the back half of the year. The second thing is that we have done these larger transformation deals, but also the ones from the previous years. We see that continuing to benefit us as it relates to revenue as they will layer on in the back half of the year.\nThat really just speaks to the resilience of our strategy, both in terms of what Julie has talked about, being where our clients need us, and our inorganic strategy to continue to benefit, to pivot to scale in new areas of growth. That's how that all kind of comes together in terms of revenue conversion from those larger deals and when they come online, James. Maybe I'll just also add what that means from a type of work for the entire year. What we now see from the context of Q1 to Q3 is our consulting type of work probably will be about flattish. We see our managed services growing to about mid-single-digit growth for the year.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color to both of you. Quickly, KC, just in terms of that investment, how do we think about how that affects the margin expansion? I mean, typically, when you're doing acquisitions, there's a little bit of time before you can start to get people to the same type of trajectory as Accenture's margin expansion. Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about that impacting as well.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYes. Thanks for that. Well, first of all, I just want to point out that I'm really pleased with our profitability in the first half of the year and the outlook for our profitability for the full year. Margin is flat, but we have EPS growth for the first half of the year, profit growth of 5%. That really just points to the rigor and discipline that we continue to operate our business in.\nWell, really importantly, what Julie talked about, all the investments we're making in our business and our people continue, right? As you look at the back half of the year, we now see the 10 basis points expansion is where we see it. Again, very important, continue to have high levels of investment in our people and our business. In EPS, we see for the whole year at about 3% to 5.\nOne thing I will point out just to help all of you, we did benefit from the first half of the year in our EPS with higher non-operating income, which makes a lot of sense on interest income on our higher cash balance. The first half, you see that our cash went from $9 to $5. Still great cash. No concerns. We'll continue with our capital allocation strategy.\nJust as you model on the back half of the year, you'll see that, not surprisingly, with lower cash, we'll have lower interest income. Just as you're working through your EPS modeling for the first half and the second half, that's something that you might want to consider.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nSuper helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning. Thank you. Julie, I'm curious, just based on your conversations with leaders, what might be the catalysts here to have clients release spending programs and kind of lean back into shorter cycle work? Just as economic data generally holds up, are we just in a slower for longer backdrop? Or I'm just kind of hoping that you can share some color on how you're thinking about a recovery internally here and what enterprises really are watching and waiting for.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nI think there's going to be a couple of dynamics, right? Remember, they just set budgets. We're kind of assuming these are the budgets for their calendar year. We see, in general, most of this constraint is tied to the uncertain macro. Those are the kind of things. They've set budgets, and they've got uncertain macro.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Just a reminder that everything that we're talking about in terms of giving guidance, I know all of you know this, but just as a reminder, our fiscal year ends in August, right? It's a little bit over halfway through the calendar year.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Okay. That makes sense. Then as it relates to GenAI, just kind of the revolutionary versus evolutionary kind of questioning here, just given how much work needs to be done for most clients to really do anything with large language models, how do we interpret that as a driver of your growth? Meaning, does GenAI enable you to essentially drive a higher level of growth when spending does become more normal? Or should we think about this more as a next tech wave that enables comparable levels of normalized growth just because of how long this might all take for large enterprises to get there?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWhat I'd say is this is more about we think of this as prior technology waves, right? Each one's been a little bit faster, right, in terms of that. Especially when you look at kind of where our clients are on the continuum of building out that digital core, there's a lot to go, and you really need that to fully realize it. We see this as more like our prior kind of the way these things have evolved in the past. Right now, that's what we see.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks so much. I guess my question, are you seeing your clients probably having much lower attrition, just like every company has low employee attrition right now? Are you seeing them take their own employees, their own IT employees, and just do more internally right now? Is that a little bit of just the demand issue right now?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWe certainly are seeing, obviously, our clients have invested in more technology internally at our advice, right? We've said to them during the pandemic, with technology being so important, they should be building up their technology. Sure, there are clients. A lot of our clients, not all of it, because it really depends on your positioning. Some of our clients, that's really not the differentiator, right?\nThey want a smaller IT, and they've got others who built it up, and it really depends on where they are. Sure, I mean, we certainly got clients doing more in-house as part of it. We've got other clients outsourcing more, right? It's really all over the map because it's very company-specific as to what makes sense for their strategy.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Okay. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up for KC. The tax rate, clearly, you lowered guidance just on the tax rate itself. Is that something one-off to this year, or is that something now that just seems more normalized?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. There's really four things that every year are the same that really influence the tax rate. It just really is how those things come together. The geographic mix of income, any settlements from previous years, any increase that we need to do on prior year tax liabilities, and lastly, the impact of our equity on our tax rate. Those four things really are confluences that are the same every year. Depending on how they fall, that's going to influence where we land on our tax rate. This year, we saw them favorably in aggregate, so we were able to keep our two-point range but drop it by 1%.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nOkay. Well, thank you, guys.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I have a really big picture question. I'm curious, Julie, how you feel about Accenture's role in the broader context of technology like software and cloud. I realize in your prior, very thoughtful answer about technology architectures, that was a great structure, as was your innovation session back on 16 February. It does seem like other parts of tech are doing better than services. I'm just interested in your perspective on services in the context of broader tech spending.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. No. Absolutely. It's a great question, right? Services are where you can dial back more easily than when you're signing up for licenses for technology that you need, right? You'd imagine, and which is what we're seeing, that when you're constraining overall spending, right, your discretionary spending, you go to service providers where you're saying, Wait, I can pause for that. I can wait for that. At the same time, you've got in other parts of it, like with software, where you've got to, if it's things you really need to invest in, and you've got different licenses.\nIt's really not different than other cycles is services have a bigger opportunity to say, It's a little more discretionary. Let's wait. Even if I've bought the licenses, I'm going to wait to actually incur the cost because a lot of times the cost of the services can be significantly higher than the software licenses, right, because you've got all the change that you've got to do and all of that around.\nAgain, we don't see anything sort of different than when you've got an uncertain macro. You look around for your discretionary spending, and you cut back. That's why, of course, you're seeing still the big transformations happening because it's not discretionary, and they've really got to replatform in that. It's like nothing mysterious about it is kind of what I consider kind of normal in this kind of a macro.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThat's right. I think just as a reminder, even with all of that, we still have the record spend with us, right, with $40 billion of bookings for the first half of the year.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nYep. Those are great points.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. I'll drop back in the queue.\n\nJamie Friedman\n\nSenior FinTech and IT Services Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThank you, Julie. Thanks, KC. Thanks.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director, Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you. Hi, Julie. Hi, KC. Going back to, hey, going back to the question of bookings, are clients actually revisiting existing bookings, ones that they signed maybe last year and in our times prior, relooking at them using the lens of applying sort of rapidly evolving GenAI capabilities? To what extent is that happening? Then that kind of then implies, obviously, can we use those past bookings and backlog as an indicator of future growth and how soon that can layer in?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I'll take that just maybe more just the financial kind of mechanical part of it. We have not seen a change in us working the work that's already been contracted, what we would call our backlog. What we talked about was really spending on new sales, new services, and their smaller projects. That's the dynamic that we have factored into our guidance for the year.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGot it. Then the other question was on LearnVantage and Udacity. I thought that was a particularly interesting deal. If you could walk us through maybe the mechanics of that deal? Every company's investing in talent here. This seems to be a bit different approach, maybe. Could you just talk about the rationale, the downstream impact, and so on?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. Thank you because I'm super passionate about what we're doing with LearnVantage because it is so critical for our clients. Talent is the number one agenda item for CEOs, right? The number one. When you think about what reinvention means, the clients have to do an AI rotation, and they have to do a talent rotation, right? What LearnVantage does is it, first and foremost, provides the ability for everything from the board to the C-suite, to business users, to the technologists to get the technology training they need to make the right decisions on AI, for example, right, to be able to become deeper in the new technologies.\nIt really goes from the board to the technologist. With Udacity, what we're able to provide is essentially the same approach Accenture uses, right? We spend over $1 billion ourselves. You saw our latest average 14 hours per employee. We use learning science to learn and do. Most of our clients aren't able to do that.\nThe big differentiator for us in the market here is that we Accenture know when you train someone, we have to then put them on a job, and they have to get paid to do something. They are work-ready. We're bringing that expertise now at scale to our clients. What Udacity does is the same thing. They use experts, mentors. They have real project work that they then coach people on.\nIt's that same sort of approach of learn and do. Our clients don't have all the work that we do. Udacity has created this ability. It's coupled then with Accenture's deep understanding of what it takes to train and be work-ready. We're really excited about it. Our clients are excited about it. They've been coming to us. We've been doing this learning.\nThis enables us now to do it at scale. Again, we want to be the reinvention partner. The more that we can fill all of the needs of our clients around that, the better position that we will be. We see LearnVantage is highly, highly strategic. By the way, we have a managed service today to actually manage the learning services that companies are now doing internally, which we also expect to grow. We're investing and expect to grow, so very excited.\nThen finally, we all have the responsibility as corporates to bring our people along the journey. When people worry about things like AI and displacement, right, we feel that our ability to bring proven upskilling expertise to help our clients be able to bring their people is really, really important. It's important for our communities. It's important to their boards. We all should consider it really important because it's the right thing to do.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGot it.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you very much. Okay. Great. Thanks, everyone. In closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support, all of our people for what you do every day, and to assure you that we are working every day to continue to earn that trust. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect"

Please continue to hold.\nThank you all for standing by. Welcome to Accenture's Q1 Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. If you wish to ask a question, please press one, then zero, now on your phone. If you should require assistance during the call, please press star, then zero. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThank you, Operator, and thanks everyone for joining us today on our Q1 Fiscal 2024 Earnings announcement. As the Operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Connor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC McClure will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the Q1. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC McClure provides our business outlook for the Q2 and full fiscal year 2024.\nWe will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the investor relations section of our website at accenture.com.\nAs always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call. Now, let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Katie, and everyone joining. And thanks to our 743,000 people around the world for their incredible dedication and commitment every day, which is how we are able to consistently deliver 360-degree value for all our stakeholders. I am pleased that we delivered on our commitments this quarter while continuing to invest significantly in strategic areas to drive the next waves of growth, including extending our early leadership in Generative AI. And we did so against a macro backdrop that continues to be challenging. Starting with our financial results, our bookings were $18.4 billion, representing 12% growth in local currency. We had 30 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in the quarter, and over half were in North America, representing the trust our clients have in us to be at the center of their major programs, spending, and ongoing reinvention.\nWe delivered revenues of $16.2 billion for the quarter at the top end of our FX-adjusted range, representing 1% growth in local currency. We continued to take market share. As expected, we continue to see lower discretionary spend, which particularly impacts our consulting type of work, as well as slower decision-making, and our CMT industry group continues to be challenged. We remain on track with the business optimization actions we announced in March to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience. Finally, we expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 6% while continuing to invest in our business and our people. Turning now to our investments, we closed 12 acquisitions this quarter for a total of $788 million in strategic areas across our geographic markets.\nIn North America, we are continuing to build out our new growth area of capital projects, an $88 billion addressable market in North America, which we entered in August with the acquisition of Answer Advisory. In Q1, we added Comtech, a consulting and program management company for infrastructure projects in Canada. We also invested in the next digital frontier with our supply chain acquisition of the Shelby Group. We expanded our cloud capabilities with the acquisitions of Ocelot Consulting and Incapsulate, and we invested in digital marketing in the healthcare industry with the acquisition of ConcentricLife. In EMEA, we expanded our cybersecurity capabilities with the acquisition of Innotec in Spain, enhanced our business process services in the insurance industry with the acquisition of ON Service Group in Germany, and invested in digital healthcare and talent with the acquisitions of Nautilus Consulting and The Storytellers in the UK.\nFinally, in growth markets, we are focused on the cloud opportunity with the acquisition of Solnet in New Zealand, along with cybersecurity with the acquisition of MNEMO in Mexico, and on digital marketing services with the Song acquisition of Signal in Japan. Our ability to invest at scale to fuel our organic growth is a competitive advantage. For example, in EMEA, we are focusing on pivoting our CMT business. We are investing with Vodafone to create a strategic partnership to commercialize its market-leading shared services operations and unlock new sources of growth and efficiency, enhance speed to market, and new customer opportunities for their operating companies and partner markets. Together, we plan to create a new data and AI-driven shared services model and a scaled, commercially driven, and more efficient organization with higher quality services and enhanced speed to market for its portfolio of offerings.\nThe new unit will utilize Accenture's world-class technology, transformation, and managed services such as its digital solutions and platforms, and deep AI expertise. It will also tap into our well-known learning capabilities to continuously create new skilling and career paths for its people. This move speaks to Vodafone's ambition to work in new ways, reduce structural complexity, reinvent their company, and the industry. Of course, we continue to invest in learning for our people with approximately eight million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 12 hours per person. Turning to Generative AI, our growth and investments, we continue to take an early leadership position in GenAI, which will be an important part of the reinvention of our clients in the next decade. Last quarter, we shared that we had sold approximately 300 projects with $300 million in sales in all of FY 2023.\nDemand continued to accelerate in Q1 with over $450 million in GenAI sales. As you know, we are investing $3 billion in AI over three years. For many of our clients, 2023 was a year of Generative AI experimentation. We are now focusing on helping our clients in 2024 realize value at scale. We're excited about the recent launch of our specialized services to help companies customize and manage foundation models. We're seeing that the true value of Generative AI is to deliver on personalization and business relevance. This is driven by context and accuracy. Data readiness, along with foundation model choices and customization, are some of the most important steps and decisions that companies will make in the next year as they pursue value. Our clients are going to use an array of models to achieve their business objectives.\nOur proprietary Switchboard allows the user to select a combination of models to address business context or factors like cost or accuracy. We will offer rigorous training and certification programs to organizations using these new services to customize and scale GenAI solutions and transform every link in their value chain. We are also investing in AI acquisitions. For example, we recently announced our intent to acquire Ammagamma, an Italy-based firm that helps companies advance their uses of AI and Generative AI technologies. With this acquisition, we will add 90 experienced AI professionals, many specializing in Generative AI, along with the expertise that includes engineering, mathematics, economics, historians, philosophers, and designers who will join our growing network of professionals in our Advanced Center for AI.\nWe are progressing towards our goal of doubling our deeply skilled data and AI practitioners from 40,000 to 80,000, with an additional 5,000 practitioners as of Q1. Finally, a few additional highlights of the 360-degree value that we created this quarter. We recently achieved our highest brand value ranking to date on Interbrand's prestigious Best Global Brands list, increasing to $21.3 billion and ranking number 30. We jumped from number 17 to number 10 on the 2023 World's Best Workplaces list by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This recognition is particularly noteworthy because it is based on feedback from our people. We were recognized for the 7th year in a row on the Wall Street Journal list of best managed companies for excellence in customer satisfaction, employee engagement, and development, innovation, social responsibility, and financial strength.\nAnd we also received the top score for social responsibility and are among the top 10 for customer satisfaction. We continue to lead in our ability to attract people with different backgrounds, different perspectives, and different lived experiences. Our success is reflected in the top score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index in the US for the 16th consecutive year for leading equitable workplace policies, practices, and benefits for LGBTQ+ people. And today, we're proud to present an update to our 360-degree value reporting experience, which is available on our website because we believe that transparency builds trust and helps us all make more progress. Over to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you, Julie. Happy holidays to all of you, and thanks for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our Q1 results, which were in line with our expectations and include continued investments at scale to strengthen our position as a leader in the market. Once again, our results illustrate our ability to manage our business with rigor and discipline and deliver value for our shareholders. So let me begin by summarizing a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 1% local currency with mid-single-digit growth or higher in five of our 13 industries, including public service, industrial, utilities, health, and energy. As expected, we saw continued pressure in our CMT industry group, and we continue to take market share.\nAs a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly two dozen of our closest global public competitors, which represents about 1/3 of our addressable market. We use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results to theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of any significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results on a rolling four-quarter basis. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.27, reflecting 6% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.7% for the quarter, an increase of 20 basis points over Q1 last year, and includes significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $430 million and returned $2 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. We also invested $788 million in acquisitions across 12 transactions in the quarter.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $18.4 billion for the quarter, representing 14% growth in US dollars and 12% growth in local currency with a book-to-bill of 1.1. Consulting bookings were $8.6 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Managed Services bookings were $9.8 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Turning now to revenues, revenues for the quarter were $16.2 billion, a 3% increase in US dollars and 1% local currency, and we're at the top end of our guided range, adjusted for a foreign exchange tailwind of approximately 1.5% compared to the 2.5% estimate provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion, flat in US dollars, and a decline of 2% in local currency. Managed Services revenues were $7.8 billion, up 6% in US dollars and 5% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions, technology services grew mid-single digits, operations was flat, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single digits. Turning to our geographic markets, in North America, revenue declined 1% local currency. Growth was led by public service, offset by declines in communications and media, software and platforms, and banking and capital markets. Before I continue, I want to highlight that for this fiscal year 2024, we have reorganized our geographic segments. Europe is now EMEA and includes the Middle East and Africa, which were previously included in growth markets. The reclassification for prior years can be found in our investor relations website. In EMEA, revenues grew 2% local currency, led by growth in public service and banking and capital markets, partially offset by decline in communications and media.\nRevenue growth was driven by Italy, Austria, and France, partially offset by a decline in the United Kingdom. In growth markets, we delivered 5% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in chemicals and natural resources, public service, and banking and capital markets. Revenue growth was led by Japan. Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.6% compared to 32.9% for the Q1 last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5%, compared with 9.8% for the Q1 last year. General and administrative expense was 6.4%, compared to 6.6% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q1, we recorded $140 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 90 basis points and EPS by $0.17. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the Q1, reflecting a 16.7% operating margin, an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in Q1 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.2%, compared with an effective tax rate of 23.3% for the Q1 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.27, compared with diluted EPS of $3.08 in the Q1 last year. Days sales outstanding were 49 days, compared to 42 days last quarter and 48 days in the Q1 of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $430 million, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $499 million and operating equipment additions of $69 million. Our cash balance at 30 November was $7.1 billion, compared with $9 billion at 31 August.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the Q1, we repurchased or redeemed 3.8 million shares for $1.2 billion at an average price of $311.90 per share. At 30 November, we had approximately $5.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also, in November, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share for a total of $810 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. Our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on 15 February, a 15% increase over last year.\nSo, in closing, we remain committed to delivering on our long-standing financial objectives, growing faster than the market and taking share, generating modest margin expansion and stronger earnings, while at the same time investing at scale for our long-term market leadership, generating strong Free Cash Flow, and returning a significant portion of that cash to shareholders. And now, let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThank you, KC. As we begin our Q2, we remain laser-focused on creating value for our clients. The pace of spending continues to be impacted by the macro environment. Our business in the UK, in particular, in Q1, saw even greater challenges than we expected last quarter. The fundamentals of our industry remain unchanged. All strategies continue to lead to technology, and companies need to reinvent every part of their enterprise using tech, data, and AI to optimize operations and accelerate growth. To do so, they must build a Digital Core. Strategy and consulting, which brings our deep industry and functional expertise, is critical to how we differentiate by helping our clients ensure they drive business value from their Digital Core.\nWe are continuing to see significant demand in areas like cloud migration and modernization, modern ERP and data and AI, including GenAI, platforms, and security, all of which represent areas of great opportunity. It is still early with more Digital Core to be built in the future than has been done to date. Let me bring to light the significant opportunities still ahead with examples from the quarter. Our cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong double-digit growth, reflecting the ongoing significant market opportunity. We estimate only 40% of enterprise workloads are in the cloud, of which only 20% or so are modernized, and 80% opportunity remaining. Clients are continuing to prioritize the Digital Core, as evidenced by strong demand for cloud migration. We're working with a leading insurance provider to continue their cloud transformation.\nTogether, we are migrating hundreds of applications to a cloud-based platform, enabling the company to exit their data centers by 2025. To date, we have migrated more than half of their apps to the cloud. This is not just a migration. We are modernizing applications and accelerating automation to integrate disparate data more easily from acquisitions and help the company move into new markets. We are helping reshape their organizational mindset, drive cultural change, and find new ways of working, including the creation of a new IT service model to lead complex transformations with agility and speed. This transformation will reduce legacy complexity and technical debt, enable more cost-effective back-office operations, and drive growth and innovation, ultimately helping the company provide more affordable and personalized insurance solutions for families and businesses.\nFor those clients who have made significant progress on their migration, they are investing to modernize and innovate across the cloud continuum, extending cloud to the edge, unlocking greater value with more opportunities still ahead. For example, we recently announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with McDonald's to help execute their technology strategy and leverage the company's scale to unlock greater speed and efficiency for customers, restaurant teams, and employees. This new work supports McDonald's ambition to connect restaurants worldwide with cloud technology and apply Generative AI solutions across McDonald's platforms. Accenture also will support the acceleration of automation innovation and the enhancement of the digital capabilities of McDonald's employees. Accenture's deep understanding of the McDonald's business, industry, and technology will help unlock opportunities in their ongoing digital investments as McDonald's reinvents the customer experience and stays ahead of their customers' changing needs.\nTurning to data and AI, we estimate that less than 10% of companies have matured data and AI capabilities. This is a critical part of building the Digital Core, and we see this embedded in our larger transformations in work focused on data and AI modernization, and in the opportunities of Generative AI. We help leaders such as BBVA, a global financial services group, to stay ahead of the curve by continuing to reinvent its business model with GenAI. For example, we are building a GenAI-powered financial coach assistant to help them disrupt customer centricity in the banking industry while they reinvent their Digital Core to also become even more efficient. This work is a continuation of our ongoing GenAI implementation, which is transforming BBVA's operations and digital marketing and is helping employees be more productive.\nThanks to its strong Digital Core, BBVA can continue to reinvent across their enterprise by applying GenAI. We are also helping a global hospitality group to support its content production capability and marketing communications across its hotel brands, tailoring content to guests' evolving needs. This new data-driven content supply chain model will create personalized, flexible, and efficient marketing communications content across every customer touchpoint. Spanning both physical and digital communications, the service will be available to all marketing professionals, enabling content production management from its initial brief to performance measurement and content optimization. This will increase the effectiveness of its digital marketing programs, drive more traffic to its branded website, and deliver exceptional customer experiences, all while reducing costs. Platforms are a core component of the Digital Core and are critical to our clients' transformations. We estimate 60% of the opportunity is still ahead as clients upgrade their core platforms.\nWe are working with OCBC Group, a Singapore-based multinational banking and financial services corporation, on a two-year transformation journey to modernize their human resources organization. We will shift key HR functions such as hiring, talent management, and career development to the cloud and create a next-generation HR operating model with enhanced capabilities. Together, we will drive operational efficiency with a strategic focus on future talent readiness, employee experience, and AI-driven decision-making. By providing a scalable framework to meet evolving business needs, we'll free up HR capacity to provide high-value advisory work and empower business and HR leaders with analytics and insights to facilitate better talent decisions. Security is also essential to a Digital Core, and we continue to see very strong double-digit growth in our security business this quarter.\nWhile the opportunity to continue to grow and expand, we estimate that currently only 36% of business leaders are confident that their organizations are cyber-resilient, representing at least 64% of untapped potential. An example of our important work with our clients to build secure organizations is Fortrea, a global contract research organization of about 19,000 people that provides clinical trial and research services for life sciences companies in more than 90 countries. We're working with Fortrea to deliver database outcomes and health-related insights, which require adherence to regional and local industry and government regulations. As they continue to grow and enter new markets, they need a partner to ensure that their cybersecurity program remains resilient and compliant with security best practices. We will co-create, architect, and operate a series of global cybersecurity services and capabilities through our managed services.\nOur partnership will help Fortrea grow its business, utilizing flexible risk and security strategies. We are focused on helping clients reimagine marketing and their customer experience to drive growth. Strong demand continues to remain strong with double-digit growth in Q1. We are collaborating with PEUGEOT, a French automotive brand, to lead strategic and creative direction for its global communications. The partnership supports PEUGEOT's ambition to engage a younger audience and become a leader in the electric vehicle market. Accenture Song will manage global communications across all traditional and digital media channels. The first campaign will be a full 360 integrated launch of the all-new electric fastback SUV E-3008, in early 2024. Finally, we continue to see strong demand for digital manufacturing and engineering services. We estimate that only 5% of enterprises have scaled mature digital capabilities across their organizations. Industry X grew strong double digits in Q1.\nWe are working with a leading German multinational car manufacturer to engineer the next generation of infotainment system. Using our deep industry expertise and software engineering capabilities, we will support the implementation of a new flexible platform that enables the next level of in-car experience with cutting-edge customer features while minimizing complexity and maximizing the software we use across hardware generations. We're working with a global food manufacturer on a total enterprise reinvention strategy to modernize its supply chain, reduce operating costs, and position it for the future. We will transform key supply chain processes such as planning, procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. AI and intelligent automation will optimize end-to-end supply chain operations and achieve greater efficiency and agility. We'll also help the company leverage data for better decision-making and implement portfolio optimization to ensure the right assets are focused on for investment to maximize returns and minimize risks.\nThis self-funded program is expected to generate significant productivity gains, with ongoing savings fueling further capability builds and bottom-line growth. Back to you, KC.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Julie. Now, let me turn to our business outlook. For the Q2 of fiscal 2024, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.4 to 16 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 0.5% compared to the Q2 of fiscal 2023 and reflects an estimated -2% to +2% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year 2024, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we continue to assume the impact of FX on our results in US dollars will be about flat compared to fiscal 2023.\nFor the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect our revenue to be in the range of 2 to 5 growth in local currency over fiscal 2023, with the inorganic contribution now expected to be more than 2. We continue to expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal 2024 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. The following guidance for full year 2024 excludes these impacts. For adjusted operating margin, we continue to expect fiscal year 2024 to be 15.5 to 15.7%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal 2023 results. We continue to expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal 2023.\nWe continue to expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2024 to be in the range of $11.97 to 12.32, or 3 to 6% growth over adjusted fiscal 2023 results. For the full fiscal 2024, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 to 9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million, and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 to 9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders. With that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nThanks, KC.\nI would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, please press one then zero on your telephone keypad. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the one-zero command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. Once again, if you have a question, please press one then zero at this time. And one moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, guys. Happy holidays. I just wanted to start with a question on the revenue guidance for Q2.\nThe midpoint there would suggest a point of deceleration, but we do have an easier comparison, and there was a return to positive growth in consulting booking. So just hoping you can help us reconcile that and then maybe comment on the second half re-acceleration that is continuing to be implied in the guide, maybe slightly steeper than previously thought. Thank you.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah, great. Thanks, Jason. Happy holidays to you too. So let me first start in terms of our guidance. I'll first start with Q1. And as you heard us say, we were really pleased with our Q1 performance. And as you stated, our Q2 guidance is the same as Q1. And maybe a couple of things that I'll point out compared to what we thought 90 days ago.\nAs Julie mentioned, we do see some differences in EMEA, particularly in the UK, where we're focused on repositioning the business back to growth, and that's going to take some time. But Jason, what is the same is that we are still operating in an environment, which is the same that we described last quarter, where the discretionary spend and the decision-making is slow. And so right now, as you expect, and you know that we do this every year, we're talking to our clients right now about their 2024 budgets. And so that's all, again, to be expected. When we look forward into H2 2024, to start with just what the math is, we continue to see higher growth in the back half of the year. That's going to start with higher growth in Q3.\nOur confidence in our H2 increased growth is really based on a few things, again, reiterating what we talked about at the beginning of the year versus our results in Q1. So we're confident, again, that we were able to deliver across the board as we expected in the Q1. And also, then, as Julie mentioned quite a bit, we made a lot of investments in our business in the quarter, and that's helping us pivot to higher growth areas. In addition to that, as we talked about last quarter, the same remains. We do have our revenue positioned in the back half of our year from these larger transformation deals. So that has not changed. We continue to see that. And then we just need to continue to layer in our new sales as we get closer to the back half of the year.\nSo we're really very pleased to reiterate the 2 to 5% revenue guidance that we had at the beginning of the year.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Just as a quick follow-up, what should we expect in terms of Q2 bookings for consulting and managed services year-over-year? I know managed services has a particularly tough comp. Thanks again.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So, Jason, I know I've been giving color and basically guiding for future quarter bookings, but as you know really well covering us for so long, bookings can really be lumpy. So I'm not going to give that color anymore. Going forward. What I would say is the best way to think about demand for our business is the revenue guide that we give. And we give revenue guidance for the Q2 as well as our 2 to 5% for the full year.\nAnd obviously, we'll continue to do that. I would just put in that we do feel good about our pipeline. We have a very solid pipeline.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nPerfect. Yeah. I just want to follow up to Jason's question just with the bookings, which was better than expected, and your large-scale backlog is quite large now. Just the visibility and the timeliness of those conversions. Have you seen any signs of push-out or delays or that thing? Just trying to understand the conversion potential.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So maybe just a couple of things on that. So I think conversion can be really mainly impacted by the mix, right? So the mix of deals that we have.\nSo let's just start with overall, we haven't seen any change in the conversion based on the mix of work. So strategy and consulting, which converts faster. Then you know with operations, there's been no change within those different parts of our business, no change in the conversion. What we have talked about, and we've been consistent, that there's really been no change over the last 90 days in our discretionary spend environment, and that is consistent with our expectations. And we haven't been reliant, and we're not reliant on a change in that macro to get to our full year guidance. So what does that mean? Hopefully, you guys can hear me. There's a little trouble on the line. Okay. That is, as we have lower discretionary spend, that does impact the conversions, Tien-Tsin, as you know, but we have factored that all into our guidance.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nUnderstood, KC. Thanks for that. Just my quick follow-up. I know you've been really busy with acquisitions, and Julie listed a bunch of them. Is there a change here in the rhythm of acquisitions or your appetite? It sounds like the revenue contribution is up a notch, but up a little bit. But you tell me. I didn't know if there was a change in your thinking here on deals. Thanks.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, I'm going to maybe give a little bit of color now. I'll certainly hand it over to Julie. Just more from a financial perspective, I think, and as you know this really well, but our competitive advantage really is our investment capacity that allows us to pivot to higher areas of growth. We can do that and invest through every cycle, and you've seen us do that.\nAnd I really think that is clearly a differentiator for us. You see that with our strong start this quarter. Julie talked about the 12 acquisitions, $800 million of spend, and we have five more that we've announced for Q2. All of that, and we're reconfirming op margin expansion of 10 to 30 basis points. I think it's important to see that in terms of our strategy, we're continuing to do this to really fuel organic growth. And lastly, I think one of the parts that really distinguishes us is our capital allocation framework, which is durable yet flexible. So we're able to flex up and do inorganic to the degrees that we see that we'd like to, while at the same time continuing to increase our return to our shareholders. So I think it's really, really great.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. Yeah.\nAnd there's no change in the strategies in the sense of we're still trying to we're still investing to either scale in hot areas or add new types of skills. So you see that we're executing in capital projects like we described, right? In August, we did the, yeah, in August, we did the Answer Advisory. We just added Canada. And then, of course, adding the niche skills and consulting and whether it's industry or functional. So no change in strategy. But I would reiterate that it is really a huge competitive advantage for us that we can invest across the cycles. You saw that we did that in the first year after the pandemic where we significantly increased, and again, always to drive organic growth and position ourselves for those next waves. So you're going to see the AI acquisitions.\nYou saw health in the UK, another great area of growth, capital projects. So think about our strength here is how we accelerate pivoting to growth. And then I'll just add, Tien-tsin Huang, that you heard me mention in guidance that we are going to do now more than 2% inorganic contribution for this year.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah.\n\nTien-tsin Huang\n\nSenior Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nYeah. No, I'm sure you'll amplify the growth of what you buy. Just wanted to check on that. That's helpful. Thank you.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. And congratulations on the performance. Happy holidays from me. I wanted to ask about, as you have conversations with your clients with regards to budget and spending priorities into next year, if you can comment, first of all, on that.\nAnd then it's only a couple of quarters since GenAI took hold, but it's a fast-moving technology, and I want to inquire into whether the nature of those discussions has changed, become more meaningful, gone past proofs of concept, and so on.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nGreat. And happy holidays to you too. Great questions. So first, with respect to, on your first point around what's happening in the market on client budgets, what I would say is that we're having lots of discussions that are pretty similar to what we've been talking about, which is how do you prioritize in a more cautionary environment. So we'll really know how that will play out in January, as always, because this is when they finalize.\nBut what I'd say is it's the consistent theme I've been talking about, which is in a cautionary environment, in a tough macro, we're helping clients prioritize. And they're in the things that we talked about in the script again today, things like building the Digital Core. It's using the technology to drive both growth and cost. And I would just say on the macro side, right, is that our clients recognize you cannot cut yourself to growth. And if you think about the examples that I used in today's script, most of them were both cost and growth, right? Because that is what our clients are focused on, is how are they going to grow revenue despite whatever the environment is. And that, of course, is our unique capabilities to be able to do both.\nWith respect to Gen AI, so first of all, I just want to say $450 million in sales this quarter. We're very pleased with it. I mean, it demonstrates we are leading here. All of last year, it was $300 million. And to your point, the conversations are changing. You have examples like BBVA, which we talked about earlier in my script, where we're starting to use it at scale. Our clients want to get out of proofs of concept to material value, and we're super well-positioned. Why? GenAI is not Plug and Play. It is not just technology. In fact, it's closer to any other technology. Think about cloud. That's farther away from the heart of the business. In order to scale, you have to deeply understand the technology, which is still rapidly changing, and the business value. And this is Accenture's leadership position, right?\nWe have strategy, we have consulting, deep industry and functional expertise. We're the biggest partner with every major player. We're working with them at a product level, and we can bring those two things together. So think of 2024 as being the shift for our clients from experimentation to scale, and we believe we're the best position to lead that shift to value.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nUnderstood. Understood. I want to ask also about operations performance. It did decelerate meaningfully. I think it was high single-digit growth, and now it's flat. Is that also a reflection you mentioned just now, maybe a pivot from cost savings to revenue generation maybe is beginning? Is that what's happening, or are there other factors in here?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe just in terms of the quarter performance, operations came in as expected.\nAs we talked about at the beginning of the year, Ashwin, we do have some impacts in CMT that impact operations. And so we'll see that growth may fluctuate as we go throughout the year. That's part, though, of our overall guidance for the full year of managed services continuing to be mid-single-digit to high-single-digit growth for the year.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And in fact, I would say it's the opposite. Operations, which was impacted, by the way, by CMT, for example, look, it's going to build similar to the way Accenture is going to build over the course of the year. Actually, the sweet spot of operations is that it does both cost and growth. So the BBVA example includes operations. Fortrea includes operations. So our managed services are highly strategic because they are typically able to do both. Think about IT transformation.\nOur managed services are as much about modernizing. So an IT modernized tech is what drives growth. So we really see our strength being that our managed services are strategic. And one of the reasons is that we do them in the context of understanding the industry and the function. So we're not back office. We're bringing that strategy and consulting expertise to make sure that it isn't just a cost play. And that's an important differentiator for us.\n\nAshwin Shirvaikar\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGot it. Thank you both.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nHi guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. I wanted to start on some of the expectations around shorter cycle and discretionary work within S&C and SI. Do you have a sense of stabilization forming there, or cuts still occurring in those areas?\nMaybe can you give us a sense on how you expect consulting to do in Q2?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So look, as KC said earlier, we're operating the same environment we have for the last few quarters, right? Discretionary spend is down, and we're right in the middle of the budget cycle. So next quarter, we'll have a much better view of what's there. But as you look around in the environment, there aren't a lot of green shoots on the economic side. And obviously, the volatility on the geopolitical side continues. And so as KC said, we're not planning right now for a change in the macro, which means that we're not planning for a change in discretionary spending. We just don't see that being meaningfully different as we go into 2024. And obviously, we'll update you.\nBut that's why when you think about the question earlier on revenue conversion, our level of smaller deals is just down. It's going to stay down for a while, which means that how revenue is going to how sales are going to bleed into revenue is going to be consistent with what we've been seeing. So. And then you want to comment.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Just in terms of Bryan on the overall growth, there's no change from what we said at the beginning of the year in terms of our full-year outlook for consulting type of work. We see low single-digit positive growth for the full year. That's in our Q2 to 5. And Q1 came in as we expected, which was -2.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then just a clarification around the M&A.\nSo first, I don't know if you mentioned M&A in Q1, the contribution to growth. And we're saying greater than 2% for the full year. Just to be clear, that's just a rounding around 2%, or are we upwards of 3%? Thanks.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Yeah. So we're saying more than 2% for the full year, and it can fluctuate by quarter. So we really just stick to our guidance for the overall year.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nRight. And if we get close to 3%, we'll talk about that. But right now, it's more than 2%. Right. Because we gave you guidance to it's down definitely more than 2%. And remember, we only do deals that we think are good deals. So what we see right now is a lot of good deals that is going to get us to above 2%. And if that we have a lot of financial flexibility. So if that changes, we'll update if it gets above 3.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nThanks. Happy holidays.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nSame to you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Koning from Baird. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. Guys. Thanks so much. One thing I noticed, gross margin growth year-over-year expansion. Gross margin was the strongest in about nine quarters or so. Is that just lower attrition, offshore shift? Maybe walk through why that's gotten nicely better.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Dave. Thanks for the question. So as you know, we run our business for operating margin, which we did 20 basis point expansion this quarter. And I will mention that if I didn't already, that the 10 to 30 that we have for the year, we might see more variability as we go throughout the quarters. But now back to gross margin. You're right.\nWe did see expansion this quarter, but it's really hard to look at that in isolation. And why is that? Well, there's various things that can go in and out of gross margin in terms of increase or decrease spend. So for example, one would be acquisitions. There's a lot of some of the investment acquisitions; some of that spend will go into gross margin, and that can be lumpy as we go throughout. As you know, it also depends on where people spend their time. So for example, you saw that, yes, we had improvement in gross margin, but then we also had increased sales and marketing costs, which is a result of people spending more time out in the market selling to create the $18.4 billion in sales that we have.\nSo that's why, again, we look at those components, but really, at the end of the day, we always continue to run our business top margin.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGotcha. Thanks for that. And then maybe as a follow-up just to Jason's question at the beginning on the back-end loaded growth, if I just put in normal sequential patterns in Q3 and Q4, I get to about 2% constant currency. So the low-end to guide. Is there a scenario given bookings were really good this quarter that it actually the progression sequentially in the back half of the year is better than normal, and then that gets to the better parts of the guidance range for revenue?\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. So I think, obviously, what you're just talking about is a bit of the math.\nWhat I would choose is give you the year-over-year way we look at it in terms of our guidance, right? So we had 1% growth this quarter with strong bookings, right? 1% revenue growth with strong bookings. We see Q2 shaping up the same way year-over-year. And again, just reinforcing that we do see fuel in our sequential growth in the back half of the year based on the transformation deals that we have signed. That's no different than what we talked about at the beginning of the year. We've layered in then the sales that we expect as we go throughout. And there's no difference to how we're doing our range. That gets us to the 2 to 5% range.\nI would say at the top end of our range, again, as we said last quarter, just when you said guidance, that to get to the top end of our guidance range, you would see S&C reconnecting with growth would be one thing that we'd see. And you would probably also see the mid to high single digits that we've been referencing consistently in managed services be more like high single digits. So hopefully that helps, Dave.\n\nDavid Koning\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nYeah. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Nice job.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, guys. Good morning. Just wanted to ask on the clarification on the UK market in particular. I know the economy has been weak there for a couple of years, and I know it's been a callout for the quarter.\nWhat exactly happened in the UK, and then what's the outlook for that?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nSure. In the UK, as you said, it has been challenged for a couple of years. We have a big banking capital markets business there, and we're really trying to pivot to more growth there in other areas. That's why you saw the acquisitions that we did, for example, this quarter. What we're seeing is that it's just taking longer than we anticipated to really move into the other areas. Banking capital markets, which we've talked about, have been more challenged, particularly in the UK. So it's really about how long it's taking us to pivot. We think it's going to take some time.\nSo I'm not going to call exactly when, but we do think it's going to take some time, and it's taking more time than we anticipated going into the fiscal year. So we've got a good team. We're on it. And again, this is where you're going to see us do more acquisitions to diversify our business there as we reposition that.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. Maybe just also, Bryan, just for context, it's about 6% of our overall business, a little bit more than $4 billion that we have in the UK.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. No, that's helpful. And then KC, just to make sure we understand the comments on the margins, given the movement in acquisitions and the pickup in acquisitions, there could be some fluctuations in given quarters. So you're not going to have it perfectly in the range of 10 to 30 per quarter.\nAny quarters to call out in particular where it could fall below the range given the ramp of acquisitions and the ramp of investments? Thanks.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. No, I don't want to really guide to the quarter because 10 basis points or 20 basis points on a quarter, that's spend, Bryan, as you know. That's big and small in terms of the dollar amount that we're talking about. So we're going to guide overall to the full year of 10 to 30 for the full year. And I just wanted to point out that we might have some periods where it's just a little bit more variable than what you've seen us do over the years.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. Thank you. Happy holidays.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nThanks, Bryan.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, guys.\nJust want to touch on headcount growth. I mean, I think it's still a bit decelerating. And so what are the expectations going forward? I mean, just given the backdrop of an acceleration on the revenue in the second half of the year. And then, Julie, maybe we could just touch on the linearity of the business one more time. Just if we could revisit the mix of the business you're seeing now and the revenue per head you'd expect, or maybe just directionally, what you'd anticipate based on the mix we're seeing and what demand is for?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYep. So thanks for that, Darrin. So I'll talk about, in terms of our people, in terms of number of people we have. First, I'll start with, as you know, managing supply demand is really our core competency.\nYou can see that in our ability to manage our utilization at high levels. I'll just point out that for the last 13 quarters, our utilization has been 91% or higher. We hire for the skills that we need, and we hire where we need them. What you're pointing out is that we had about a 1% increase year-over-year in our headcount, as well as about a 1% sequentially. That's in line with how we see revenue going for the rest of the year. So there's really no change there. As it relates to the revenue per head and the non-linearity, I mean, we do have automation. We do have value-based projects. So while there still is obviously a connection to the amount of people that we have, we have been able to break that.\nThere are parts where we were able to not fully disconnect, but not completely rely on headcount to drive revenue.\n\nKC McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture\n\nYeah. And Darrin, and in terms of just demand, right? So I'd anchor to, first of all, we're seeing demand for transformational deals. So in an environment like this, the thing that I look at most is, are we continuing to have our clients do more than $100 million of bookings, right? Which is, in our industry, we are a real standout here. And what does that mean? That means that we continue to be at the heart of where clients are spending to do material transformations. That's where you want to be so that you're positioned when inevitably discretionary spending, the pace goes back up, the macro changes, you want to be at the heart. So at times like this, that's what I'm really looking at.\nAnd that's where you're seeing. I will tell you, this is one of the most exciting times in the market. You just take what we are announcing today on McDonald's. I talked about it in the script, right? Incredible company, technology-driven. We've been their longtime partner, just expanded the partnership to take it all the way to the edge and reinvent their restaurants and their crew experience. This is going to be really cutting work at the edge because that's where we're starting to see the leaders in cloud go, and we're leading there. Those are the kinds of things that then you see how they're going to expand. There's so much opportunity still in these big areas of cloud, of data and AI. I mean, but cloud itself, yes, we've done a lot of migration.\nThere's still more migration to go, but even more importantly, you got to take it all the way to the edge. So from a demand perspective, we continue to see the transformations that move the needle for cost and growth, and that's what we're expecting. From a mix perspective, we're not seeing a big change between managed services and consulting. The mix we're seeing is that in this environment, you're seeing less of the smaller deals, which convert to revenue faster, and more on the larger deals. And that's been around for a while, and that's what you're going to continue to see. And we are laser-focused on making sure we are winning in the reinvention, the transformation, and at the same time, massively pivoting to GenAI, right?\nOur clients have so much work to do to be able to use GenAI, but you can see the momentum in our business, right, from that change from $300 million of all of last year to $450 million in a quarter. I'll just remind you, that's not the pull-through. That's not data. We are very pure because we really want to be sharing with all of you where GenAI is in the market. We're pretty excited about where we are today and what's ahead.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's really helpful. Look, you guys have obviously managed well through what was a softer discretionary demand environment. My question would be, if we thought about what a normalized run rate of revenues on really S&C would be if we just said today's a normal, no longer softer discretionary environment, where do you think the difference is?\nI mean, I know it's probably hard to give an exact or precise estimate, but how much upside is there when we get that back?\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nWell, we have a really strong strategy and consulting business, and so we're very positive about that business growing. But beyond that, I think, Darrin, we're not going to start to predict growth rates. But in the meantime, it is a huge differentiator. Nobody has that combination that we have, and that is what is driving the resilience of our business to be at the core of our client's agenda. Thanks so much, Darrin.\n\nDarrin Peller\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nManaging Director and Head of Investor Relations, Accenture\n\nOperator, we have time for one more question, and then Julie will wrap up the call.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay. That question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\nI want to just ask a couple of follow-up questions to those that have already been asked. First, on the inorganic contribution, appreciate that it's going to be better than 2%. Can you talk a little bit about whether that increased activity is now how you would balance that increased activity between just better valuations and more opportunities from a purely financial perspective in the market versus it sounds like some of the acquisitions you're doing, you're trying to push into new strategic areas, and just wondering how you're balancing those strategic imperatives versus perhaps a little better valuations.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nYeah. I mean, I wouldn't say that this activity is because of better valuations, right?\nAt any given time, when we look at the market, right, and we see where are the growth opportunities, we want to move quickly, and we look at organic versus inorganic ways of moving quickly. We never do anything purely inorganic, right, or purely organic. And so think about our acquisitions as being matched to what is the opportunity in the market and what's the best way to capture that growth quickly, right? And so the strategy of categories is the same, right? So there are new areas that we want to go into, like capital markets. That's an investment decision. We go into a certain number of those. We're executing now with rigor. We went and bought Answer Advisory. Now we bought the next one in Canada, right? So that's just about it's a great growth area, and we're trying to pivot.\nThe best way to do that, to build something that we don't have already organically, is to make some inorganic acquisitions, and then that becomes organic growth, and we're able to kick in our recruiting machine. If you think about the UK, health is a great area. We just bought a health company, right? So you look at the market and you say, \"If I want to diversify, what's the fastest way to diversify into new areas?\" That's where often inorganic can help us do that through these niche acquisitions, consulting, and industry. Then you've got just massive opportunities like cloud and security, where you saw some of those acquisitions, and supply chain, and that's all about both adding phenomenal talent quickly and scaling to go after a market that's today, right? So that's how we think about it. It's extremely rigorous.\nWe always have a decision: what's the best way to get there organically or inorganically? And inorganic is always about acceleration and driving organic growth. So it's very consistent. We've been doing it in a very disciplined way. And in these kinds of environments, we believe the companies that invest win. And that is why we do actions like we did last year to increase our business resilience and enable us to be really well-positioned to invest when others are not.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThat's great color. I appreciate that. And similarly, just on bookings activity and AI contribution, there are clear acceleration in the AI level of activity, etc. When you're talking to clients and that thing, how are they thinking about AI budget allocation versus other initiatives, etc. right now?\nAre they looking at it as, \"Hey, this is an incremental investment that we need to be making given the pace of changing technology\"? Or are they trying to really use that spend or have that spend be to offset some other projects maybe that they're going to curtail a little bit sooner? Just trying to think about, as that continues to build, how we should think about it being incremental versus substitutive within a lot of the budgets.\n\nJulie Sweet\n\nChair and CEO, Accenture\n\nRight now, we're seeing a lot of reprioritization, right? Because, I mean, obviously, the market's growing. We're growing. The market's growing. So spending in technology is increasing. It's not increasing as fast as it was increasing a couple of years ago, right? So spending on technology is increasing. But within that, you're seeing more prioritization.\nAnd our research, everybody's research is saying, \"Hey, more spending on AI.\" For lots of companies, it's also more spending mostly on building that Digital Core because many companies don't have the data estates in order. They're not on the cloud. They don't have the data in order to use the GenAI. So think of it as a real focus on building a Digital Core to enable as well. So market's still growing. It's more about prioritization of where that spending's going. Okay. Great. Thank you so much. So in closing, I want to thank all of our shareholders for your continued trust and support, and all of our people for what you do every single day. And I wish everyone a happy and a healthy holiday season. Thank you for joining today.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference.\nYou may now disconnect. We're sorry. Your conference is ending now. Please hang up."

Welcome to the Accenture's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder: Today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nThank you, operator. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.\nAs the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations.\nOn today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer.\nWe hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2024. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap at the end of the call.\nSome of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward looking and as such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Katie and everyone joining us. And thank you to the approximately 733,000 Accenture people who have worked hard to be at the center of our clients' business across our fiscal year '23.\nOur laser focus on creating 360-degree value for our clients and all our stakeholders is reflected in our overall strong results for the year. With record bookings of $72 billion, we had a record 106 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million in FY '23, up from 100 last year. We now have 300 Diamond clients, our largest client relationships, an increase of [ 33 ] from last year, demonstrating yet again the depth and breadth of our capabilities and the trust our clients have in us. We delivered revenues of $64 billion for the year, representing 8% growth in local currency, while continuing to take market share. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points and delivered adjusted EPS growth of 9% while continuing to significantly invest in our business and our people, with capital deployed of over $2.5 billion across 25 acquisitions; $1.3 billion in R&D, assets, platforms and industry solutions; and $1.1 billion invested in the training and development of our people. And we generated free cash flow of $9 billion, allowing us to return over $7 billion of cash to shareholders. And we are delivering a little ahead of schedule on our business optimization actions we announced in March to reduce structural costs to create greater resilience.\nWe also continued to attract, retain and inspire outstanding people through our talent strategy. We're making progress toward our commitment to net zero by 2025, and we invested in our communities to help ensure we have vibrant places where we work and live. I will give more detail a little later in the call.\nTaking a step back. Coming off 2 fiscal years of double-digit growth and a truly extraordinary FY '22, we are very pleased with our FY '23 results and the moves we have made to optimize our business. We are also rapidly taking an early leadership position in gen AI, which will be an important part of the reinvention of our clients in the next decade. Last quarter, we shared that we had sold 100 projects with roughly $100 million in sales over the prior 4 months. Demand accelerated in Q4 with another approximately $200 million in gen AI sales, to bring our total to over $300 million for the year. We also are embracing the use of gen AI in our own delivery of services and the way we work across Accenture.\nAs we reflect on how our market has developed over the last year: We and our clients have had to navigate a macro environment that is tougher than we anticipated at the beginning of FY '23. While it's played out differently across markets and industries, we have seen greater caution globally with lower discretionary spend; slower decision-making; and in particular for us, a significant impact from the challenges the comm, media and tech industries have faced. For example, in Q4, where we grew 4% in local currency, if we exclude CMT, we grew 7% globally, 6% in North America, 9% in Europe and 8% in Growth Markets. Against that backdrop, as we enter FY '24, we remain laser-focused on creating value for our clients. While the pace of spending has changed, the fundamentals have not. All strategies continue to lead to technology; and companies will need to reinvent every part of their enterprise using tech, data and AI to optimize operations and accelerate growth. To do so, they must build a digital core. We are continuing to see significant demand in areas like cloud migration and modernization, modern ERP and data and AI and the emergence of gen AI in particular, all of which represent areas of great opportunity. And it's still early.\nFor example, we estimate that only 40% of workloads are in the cloud today. Only 1/3 of clients have modernized their ERP platforms and less than 10% have what we define as mature data and AI capabilities. We believe helping build a strong digital core and then using it to reinvent will be the drivers of our growth. Our ability to advise, shape and deliver value-led transformation leveraging the breadth of our services and industry expertise, from strategy and consulting to technology, to our managed services across industries and geographic markets, along with our privileged position with our ecosystem partners, is what makes Accenture unique. And you can see this unique positioning in the number of our Diamond clients and clients who turn to us for large-scale transformation.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie. And thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.\nWe were pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, which were within our guided range and aligned to our expectations, completing another strong year for Accenture. Our results reflect the diversity of our business and once again illustrate our ability to run our business with discipline and deliver significant value for our shareholders.\nSo let me begin by summarizing a few highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 4% local currency, driven by high single or double-digit growth in 5 of our 13 industries. As we called out last quarter, we expected increased pressure in our CMT industry group; and we saw declines of 12% local currency this quarter. As Julie mentioned, excluding CMT, our business grew 7% globally.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.71, reflecting 4% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, an increase of 20 basis points over Q4 last year, and includes significant -- continued significant investments in our people in our business. And finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.2 billion, driven by very strong DSO management.\nNow let me turn to some of the details. New bookings were $16.6 billion for the quarter, a 10% decline in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1. Consulting bookings were $8.5 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Managed services bookings were $8.2 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16 billion, a 4% increase in both U.S. dollar and local currency representing continued market share gains. Now as a reminder: We assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly 2,000 of our closest global public company competitors, which represent about 1/3 of our addressable market. We use a consistent methodology to compare our financial results and theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of our -- of their last publicly available results on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.2 billion, a decline of 2% in both U.S. dollar and local currency. Managed services revenues were $7.8 billion, up 10% in both U.S. dollars and local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services grew mid-single digits. Operations grew high single digits, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 1% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, health and utilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in communications and media, software and platforms, banking, capital markets and high tech. In Europe, revenues grew 7% in local currency, led by growth in banking and capital markets, industrial and public service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 6% revenue growth in local currency driven by growth in chemicals and natural resources, industrial and energy. Revenue growth was driven by Japan.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 32.4% compared with 32.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.8% compared with 10.2% for the fourth quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.7% compared to 7.1% for the same quarter last year. Before I continue, I want to note that in Q4 we recorded $472 million in costs associated with our business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 290 basis points and EPS by $0.56 and also impacted our tax rate. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 14.9% adjusted operating margin and an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in Q4 last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 24.6% for the fourth quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.71 compared with EPS of $2.60 in the fourth quarter last year.\nDays service outstanding were 42 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 43 days in the fourth quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.2 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.4 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $180 million. Our cash balance at August 31 was $9 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31 last year.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 3.2 million shares for $1 billion at an average price of $312.35 per share. Also in August, we paid our fourth quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share, for a total of $706 million. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.29 per share to be paid on November 15, a 15% increase over last year; and approved $4 billion of additional share repurchase authority.\nNow I'd like to take a moment to summarize the year, as we've navigated a challenging macro environment and successfully executed our business to deliver or exceed all aspects of our original guidance that we provided last September on an adjusted basis. We delivered $72.2 billion in new bookings, reflecting 5% growth in local currency; revenue of $64.1 billion for the year, reflecting strong growth of 8% in local currency and reflecting continued market share gains. Before I continue: For the full year, we recorded $1.1 billion in costs associated with business optimization actions, which decreased operating margin by 170 basis points and EPS by $1.28. We also recognized a gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results: adjusted operating margin of 15.4%, a 20 basis point expansion over FY '22.\nAdjusted earnings per share was $11.67, reflecting 9% growth over FY '22 EPS. Free cash flow of $9 billion was significantly above our original guided range, reflecting a very strong free cash flow-to-net income ratio of 1.3. And with regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, we exceeded our original guidance for capital allocation by returning $7.2 billion of cash to shareholders while investing approximately $2.5 billion across 25 acquisitions.\nIn closing. We remain committed to delivering on our enduring shareholder value propositions while creating 360-degree value for all our stakeholders, clients, our people, our shareholders, partners and our communities.\nAnd now let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC.\nLet me now bring to life for you the demand we saw from our clients this quarter as they build their digital core and reinvent. We saw this demand across markets and industries. Our cloud momentum continued with very strong double-digit growth in Q4 as clients prioritized building a strong and secure foundation for reinvention. We're partnering with a multinational financial services company on a cloud-based transformation to deliver enhanced, personalized and secure customer experiences; and to increase employee productivity. Together, we're developing an integrated hosting strategy that unifies their hybrid multi-cloud landscape and lays the foundation for their digital transformation over the next decade. This partnership enables innovative solutions across all bank functions and is backed by a trusted and secure foundation that supports advanced workloads and complex AI and data solutions. Working from a compliant cloud platform will safeguard the customer data, privacy and financial assets, positioning the organization to stand out for its innovation and customer focus.\nAnd we are supporting a U.S.-based energy company on a total enterprise reinvention strategy to unify different technologies and business processes around a common digital core. We'll help leading the deployment of a cloud-based IT platform that integrates customer management, finance, HR, supply chains, asset management and operations, improving the ability to assess and optimize operational performance. We also are helping manage and integrate the responsibilities and activities of the vendors involved in the project, standardize data from legacy applications and enable company employees to understand and manage the new processes and technologies. Data-driven decision-making will be improved, allowing the company to cultivate better collaboration within their business, helping them operate more efficiently and better serve their customers.\nWe are partnering with Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan to accelerate their path to becoming a world-class bottler and data-driven organization. The partnership includes establishing an innovative joint venture of significant scale of approximately 870 people that will accelerate transforming their digital core, optimizing their enterprise operations, leveraging the power of cloud, data and AI to increase the value delivered from their core business functions. In support of their broader strategic business plan, Accenture will provide specialized talent; industry expertise; and leading-edge technology, automation and managed services to help Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan adopt a strategy of continuous enterprise reinvention.\nData and AI are an important part of building the digital core. And we see that work both embedded in our larger transformations, as you just heard, and in work focused on data and AI modernization. Accenture Federal Services is helping the Defense Health Agency operate and enhance the joint medical common operating picture platform. By implementing data synchronization across multiple network domains and near real-time collaboration and information sharing, we will provide a comprehensive picture into Department of Defense medical assets. This increases visibility into unit health, equipment and supplies; and allows for faster and more informed decision-making. We are a strategic partner for the Saudi Data & AI Authority to boost the kingdom's transformation to a data-driven economy and help the kingdom become a world leader in generation and deployment of AI technology. We're working closely with SDAIA to support cutting-edge research, promote digital innovation in public life and boost national capabilities and talent. We're especially pleased with the double-digit growth we have in the Middle East, a small but growing part of our business.\nSecurity is essential to a digital core, and we had very strong double-digit growth in our security business in Q4. We're working with a major energy network in the U.K. on the transformation of its cybersecurity systems. We will provide an entire managed service for their cybersecurity capability, including migration to a more powerful security platform, continuous and active threat monitoring and response services as well as security tools management. Our solutions will help provide improved security, reduce exposure to potential global security threats and ultimately better safeguard the safe delivery of gas to millions of U.K. homes and businesses. As clients continued to reimagine and [ prioritize ] the customer experience, [indiscernible] delivered strong double-digit growth in Q4.\nWe are helping smart Europe, maker of the next generation of smart vehicles, products and services of the iconic brand from Smart Automobile company [indiscernible], a joint venture between Mercedes-Benz and Geely. We are helping them reinvent car shopping by creating an ecosystem that supports a seamless, fully digital-driven buying experience. By putting data at the core, the system allows personalization of the customer journey, makes recommendations based on real-time data and includes enhanced offerings such as extended insurance coverage. It will help smart Europe reposition its brand and support the launch of its intelligent, fully electrical car lines.\nWe also continue to see demand for our supply chain and Industry X capabilities, the next digital frontier, which grew strong double digits in Q4. In Industry X, we are partnering with a global chemical and materials company on a digital transformation of their manufacturing core and commercial capabilities. Through our Industry X capabilities, we have built a unified connected worker platform for operators, maintenance technicians and job planners, along with a cloud-based data lake, to help generate insight from disparate sources of manufacturing data. The program is already live in dozens of manufacturing sites and is expected to create significant revenue growth over the next few years for our client. And in supply chain, we have partnered with a large global food and beverage conglomerate to strengthen supply chain resilience so consumers have continued access to their products in stores and online. By creating a digital twin of its supply chain, we will develop stress test models to help identify supply disruptions with the highest risk before they occur. Across these examples, you can see our unique capabilities of both being a technology powerhouse, along with our industry and functional expertise from strategy and consulting to technology, to managing services -- managed services, to help our clients reinvent.\nNow let's turn to generative AI. As a reminder: Last quarter, we announced a $3 billion investment in AI. While still in the early stages, gen AI technology is maturing rapidly, and we believe it will be a significant source of value for us and our clients over time. We now have about 300 projects. And I want to share a little color on how this demand is coming through. We have projects across all our industries, with banking, public service, consumer goods and utilities leading in activity. Clients are doing a variety of different types of work, from strategy and use case implementations; to tech enablement; to scaling; to model customization, tuning and training; to talent and responsible AI. For example, we're working with a multinational telcom company, Telefonica Brasil, also known as Vivo, to deliver a generative AI solution that helps its agents respond quicker to landlords' queries about property rental contracts for network towers. The application quickly reads landlords' queries and proposes a set of actions to help fulfill requests, reducing the time it takes agents to respond. It also structures the response with a set of relevant answers to increase the response quality and ensure all queries are answered in a helpful manner. The solution has already reduced agent response time by 30% and increased the user experience score by 66%.\nSome of the key ingredients of our success in gen AI are, first, ecosystem partnerships. As always, we are starting with deep relationships and leadership in the ecosystem from the hyperscalers to the model builders, to the start-ups and academics. It is important to emphasize that we are early in the maturity of gen AI for enterprise; and our depth, experience and insight on these [indiscernible] is essential to guiding our clients. Second, talent. We start with a deep technical knowledge and understanding of AI and gen AI and blend that with our industry and functional expertise to know how to reinvent across the enterprise, including processes and operating models, bringing together the depth and breadth of our expertise. And that is where Accenture is different, building the bridge from as is to the future. And we have already trained approximately 600,000 of our people in the fundamentals of AI. Now with generative AI, the pace and impact is growing rapidly. And we are now taking a further step to equip more than 250,000 people; and using new AI tools equitably, sustainably and without bias. And with investments in our AI academy focused on deep AI and gen AI specialization, we are also progressing towards our goal of doubling our deeply skilled data and AI practitioners from 40,000 to 80,000.\nThird, responsible AI is essential. At Accenture, we have an industry-leading responsible AI compliance program which is embedded in how we use and deliver AI. And we're using the experience and lessons learned by us to help our clients build out their own responsible AI program, which is necessary to address the risks and get the full value from AI. Finally, we are embracing gen AI across our services, developing new cutting-edge tools and solutions, [ embedding ] gen AI in the way we work. Our approach takes into account where the technology is today, the need to deploy it responsibly and the recognition that we do work in highly complex environments. While all companies want to explore and understand gen AI, what we find is that clients who are more mature digitally want to go faster, while others would like to test the waters with proofs of concepts and synthetic data. And others prefer to wait until they have built more of their modern digital core. The extent and pace of this generative AI progression will become more clear over the coming quarters as the technology and the market continue to mature and progress.\nNow turning to our people, who have made all of this happen. Core to our success is our ability to attract and retain and inspire our outstanding talent. Essential to our success is our robust talent strategy and, in particular, our ability to attract diverse talent and our Net Better Off approach to retaining our great talent. We continue to lead in our ability to attract people with different backgrounds, different perspectives and different lived experiences. These differences ensure that we have and attract the cognitive diversity to deliver a variety of perspectives, observations and insights which are critical to drive the innovation needed to reinvent. Our success is reflected in our being the top-scoring company on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the second year in a row. And we also earned the #1 position on the Refinitiv global diversity and inclusion index for the fourth time in 6 years. This index ranks over 15,000 organizations globally and identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces.\nOur talent strategy includes inspiring and retaining our best talent through our Net Better Off approach. We want our people to feel they are net better off for working at Accenture. This strategy has 4 dimensions focusing on people feeling healthy and well physically, emotionally and financially; feeling connected with a sense of belonging; feeling their work has purpose; and filing -- feeling they are continuing to build market-relevant skills. This year, for example, our people participated in approximately 40 million training hours. And we were a recipient of the Brandon Hall gold award for best benefits, wellness and well-being programs.\nBuilding on our long-standing commitment to the environment, we are pleased to have hit a significant milestone on our path to net zero, [ approaching ] 100% renewable electricity across all of our Accenture offices. I will wrap up with a comment on our work in communities. Vibrant communities are important to our business success, and therefore, we continue to prioritize creating value in these communities around the world. For example, Accenture is helping to welcome refugees, recognizing how they enrich our communities with their courage, strength and talent. In June 2023, on World Refugee Day, we committed to partner with organizations to help skill and support an estimated 16,000 refugee job seekers and migrants and to hire 100 refugees in Europe over the next 3 years.\nBack to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie.\nNow let me turn to our business outlook. For the first quarter fiscal '24, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.85 billion to $16.45 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be approximately positive 2.5% compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23 and reflects an estimated negative 2% to positive 2% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal year '24, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be flat compared to fiscal '23.\nFor the full fiscal '24, we expect our revenue to be in the range of 2% to 5% growth in local currency over fiscal '23, which includes an inorganic contribution of about 2%. We expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal '24 GAAP operating margin by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.56. The following guidance for full year fiscal 2024 excludes these impacts.\nFor adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year '24 to be 15.5% to 15.7%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over adjusted fiscal '23 results. We expect our annual adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 25.5%. This compares to an adjusted effective tax rate of 23.9% in fiscal '23. We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '24 to be in the range of $11.97 to $12.32 or 3% to 6% growth over adjusted fiscal '23 results.\nFor the full fiscal '24, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $9.3 billion to $9.9 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a free cash flow-to-net income ratio of 1.2. Finally, we expect to return at least $7.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases, as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.\nAnd with that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O'Conor\n\nThanks, KC. [Operator Instructions] Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?"

Welcome to Accenture's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O’Conor\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks, everyone joining us today, on our third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.\nLet me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the third quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market position before KC provides our business outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.\nSome of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and, as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the call.\nDuring our call today, we will reinforce certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Katie, and thank you to everyone joining today, and thank you to our people around the world for their dedication and commitment, which is how we are able to consistently deliver 360 degree value for all our stakeholders, our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities.\nTurning to the quarter, I will start with the financials. While the macro environment continues to be uncertain overall, in Q3, we delivered solid revenue and sales with very strong profitability and very strong free cash flow while continuing to significantly invest in our business. Now getting into the highlights, we had bookings of $17.2 billion, including 26 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, bringing the total year-to-date to 85, which is 11 more than the same time last year. We delivered revenues of $16.6 billion, representing 5% growth with North America growing 2%, Europe at 7% and growth markets at 9%, all in local currency, bringing us to [ $481 ] billion of revenue at 10% growth fiscal year-to-date.\nRevenues were impacted by lower-than-expected small deal sales, especially in strategy and consulting and systems integration, and lower-than-expected results in the communications, media and high-tech industry group for the quarter. Excluding CMT, our business grew 8% globally, 7% in North America, 9% in Europe and 10% in Growth Markets in local currency. We expanded adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points, grew adjusted EPS 14% over last year and delivered free cash flow of $3.1 billion. And over the past 11 quarters, we have operated at 91% or higher utilization, leveraging our digital enterprise to connect our sales, staffing, hiring and skill needs to make proactive real-time decisions.\nWe are on track with the business optimization actions to lower costs in fiscal 2024 and beyond while continuing to significantly invest in our business with 5 acquisitions in strategic areas this quarter, bringing the total investment in acquisitions year-to-date to $1.3 billion. We invested in cloud, data and AI with the acquisition of NextEra in North America, Objectivity in the U.K. and [ Einer ] in Norway. We also invested in sustainability with the acquisition of [ Greendomes ] in Brazil and in modern ERP services with Foreign Digital in Australia. We continue to take market share, growing about 2x the market.\nNow turning to other aspects of the 360 degree value we delivered in the quarter. We continue to invest in learning for our people with 9 million training hours in the quarter, representing an average of 13 hours per person, giving them the skills to grow as our clients' needs evolve. We're incredibly pleased that we're recognized as a top 10 places to work in 7 countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, India, Mexico, the Philippines and U.S.. Collectively, these countries represent nearly 70% of our people.\nVibrant communities are important for our business success, and digital skilling helps ensure vibrant communities thrive. In collaboration with L'Oreal and our NGO partner, Chambo Foundation, we are supporting women in India to build digital literacy skills alongside the technical skills needed to access jobs in the beauty industry. Together, we have collectively created sustainable livelihoods for 2,500 women across 10 states in India, accelerating quality, delivering social impact in the community and continuing our commitment to embed diversity and inclusion in everything we do.\nFinally, this year, we are proud to earn the #22 position on BrandZ's prestigious Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list [indiscernible] today. Over to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We are pleased with our third quarter results. and we are on track to deliver or exceed all aspects of our guidance provided in September on an adjusted basis.\nNow let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 5% local currency, driven by single or double-digit growth in 7 of our 13 industries. While we've been highlighting the pressures in our CMT Industry group all year, this quarter, the revenue was lower than expected with a decline of 8% in local currency. We delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $3.19, reflecting 14% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.3%, an increase of 20 basis points over Q3 last year, and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $3.1 billion and returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we've invested $1.3 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 20 transactions.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were $17.2 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 4% in local currency with overall book-to-bill of 1.0. We were very pleased with our 26 clients with quarterly bookings over $100 million. Consulting bookings were $8.9 billion with a book-to-bill of 1. Managed services were $8.3 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.1.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $16.6 billion, a 3% increase in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 2.5% compared to the approximately 3.5% headwind provided in our business outlook last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.7 billion, a decline of 4% in U.S. dollars and 1% local currency. We see the same level of Consulting decline in Q4. Managed Services revenues were $7.9 billion, up 10% in U.S. dollars and 13% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services grew high single digits. Operations grew double digits, and we expect high single-digit growth in Q4. Strategy and Consulting declined high single digits this quarter, and we see declines continuing in Q4. Regarding our market share, we extended our leadership position with growth estimated to be about 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies. Now as a reminder, we assess market growth against our investable basket, which is roughly 2 dozen of our closest global public company competitors, which represents about 1/3 of our addressable market. We used a consistent methodology to compare our financial results and theirs, adjusted to exclude the impact of significant acquisitions through the date of their last publicly available results.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 2% in local currency driven by growth in Public Service for our U.S. federal business, Health and Utilities. These increases were partially offset by declines in Communications and Media, High-tech, Software and Platforms and Banking and Capital Markets. In Europe, revenue grew 7% local currency, led by growth in Banking and Capital Markets, Industrial and Public Service. Revenue growth was driven by Italy, Germany and France. In Growth Markets, we delivered 9% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in Public Service, Chemicals and Natural Resources and Banking and Capital Markets. Revenue growth was driven by Japan.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 33.4% compared with 32.9% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 10.5% compared to 10.3% for the third quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.5% compared to 6.5% for the same quarter last year.\nBefore I continue, I want to note that in Q3, we recorded $347 million in costs associated with the business optimization actions we announced last quarter, which decreased operating margin by 210 basis points and EPS by $0.42. This quarter, we also recognized a gain in our investment in Duck Creek Technologies, which impacted our tax rate and increased EPS by $0.38. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nAdjusted operating income was $2.7 billion in the third quarter and adjusted 16.3% operating margin, an increase of 20 basis points from operating margin in the third quarter of last year. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 24% compared with an effective tax rate of 27.1% for the third quarter last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $3.19 and compared with diluted EPS of $2.79 in the third quarter last year. Days source outstanding were 42 days compared to 42 days last quarter and 44 days in the third quarter of last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $3.1 billion, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $3.3 billion net of property and equipment additions of $142 million. Our cash balance at May 31 was $8.5 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 2.8 million shares for $789 million at an average price of [ $269.65 ] per share. As of May 31, we had approximately $3.5 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in May, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $708 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on August, a 15% increase over last year.\nSo in closing, we remain committed to delivering on our long-standing financial objectives, growing faster than the market and taking share, generating modest margin expansion and stronger earnings while, at the same time, investing at scale for long-term market leadership, generating strong free cash flow and returning cash to shareholders.\nNow let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC. As we look at demand in our larger deals, we continue to see 2 common themes that I've highlighted before. First, the rapid rise of generative AI interest among our clients highlights yet again that all strategies lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. And second, companies remain focused on total enterprise reinvention as they execute compressed transformation to achieve lower costs, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster.\nNow let me give you more color on the quarter to bring this to life. Starting with the digital core, our cloud momentum continues with very strong double-digit growth in Q3 as clients priorities building a strong and secure foundation for reinvention. We have been working with ENI, a global energy company, for more than 30 years. Now we are helping them as they continue our hybrid cloud transformation and embark on a total enterprise reinvention strategy with a focus on sustainability, digital transformation and security. We are managing their IT infrastructure and telecommunications integration and helping implement new operating models, all hosted in the ENI &I green data center, one of the largest data bunkers in the industry to securely hold the company's data. The ENI green data center houses one of the most powerful nongovernmental supercomputers in the world. enabling the highest use of data across the value chain from exploration and production to the energy of the future. New operating models will help exploit the full value of data, AI and cybersecurity for faster adoption of new business processes. This transformation is the first step toward creating a secure digital core that will accelerate ENI's energy transition, drive innovation in AI and R&D and build even greater resilience.\nClients are also working with us to do multifaceted compressed transformation that utilize all of our deep industry and functional expertise in our SNC services, along with our outstanding technology services. We are helping DuPont, a global multi-industrial specialty products company, with a compressed transformation to standardize their finance processes and achieve operational excellence. Building on our trusted relationship of over 35 years, we are now supporting our client with its strategic pivot to innovation-based growth across electronics, sustainable water and protection solutions, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. We've been supporting their transformation to an agile cloud-based IT infrastructure to maximize data access, drive efficiency and modernize their landscape. Our work with DuPont is focused on achieving greater resilience, reducing costs and increasing revenue growth and shaping its portfolio through M&A with industry-leading innovation for long-term success.\nThese companies expanding their digital footprint and cyber risk widening security continues to rise in importance as a fundamental part of the digital core with very strong double-digit growth in Q3. We are working with a food and beverage company to strengthen their cybersecurity and prevent vulnerabilities along the supply chain. Building on previous operations transformation work, we are now providing managed security services, which will cover perimeter security, detection and response as well as threat intelligence and monitoring dark web activities. We also will provide day-to-day identity, data and privacy management, helping provide a holistic security approach for our client.\nWe're helping a global universal bank future-proof their cryptographic landscape and corresponding risks for over 1,000 applications, procedures and data. Based on the analysis, we will develop and implement an end-to-end mitigation strategy, including evaluation of solution vendor strategies, mitigation principles as well as change management procedures. We will also design and implement post-quantum methods and new architecture blueprints, which will help scale the solution, all to help the bank achieve post-quantum computing readiness.\nOur Managed Services continued to grow double digits in Q3, demonstrating the relevance of our approach to run, digitize and transform our clients' operations. We're providing a global health care and insurance company with managed services to help run its complex claims and membership processes. As part of our long-standing relationship with the company, we will improve the efficiency and quality of these tasks and simplify the customer journey, ensuring members can easily access the support they need when they need it. Its employees will now have more time to focus on boosting customer satisfaction by better serving its millions of customers around the world. A new cost solution has also been introduced to determine fair and accurate pricing for the company when purchasing services and products from vendors to reduce costs across the business.\nWe recently worked with a major media brand to launch a streaming platform that will help attract new subscribers, expanding their content portfolio and power-targeted broadcasting and advertising offerings, all while lowering costs. We helped engineer aspects of the new platform from the content supply chain to the player experience, ensuring that customers have a seamless viewing experience across all devices and platforms and enabling the company to use data insights to continually enhance its platform. We delivered the program as part of a managed services arrangement, demonstrating the industry and engineering innovation that we bring to help clients reinvent their business with cloud, data and AI.\nAs clients continue to reimagine and prioritize customer experience, Song experienced strong double-digit growth again in Q3. We are partnering with Virgin Media O2, a British media and telecommunications company, to reimagine their customer experience. Accenture Song will design a new, more predictive and personalized customer journey, enabled by an AI-powered cloud-based digital core. Customer care journeys will be omnichannel, combining customer calls, chat and instant messaging to increase first-time resolution and upselling, leading to greater customer satisfaction. We also will deploy our managed services capabilities to support contact center activity using AI to provide timely agent assistance and route calls intelligently to drive precision and reduce call volume. Our work will help build brand loyalty supporting Virgin Media O2's mission to be a more customer-first business.\nWe see continued demand for our Industry X capabilities, which grew strong double digit. We are working with one of the world's leading consumer products companies on a transformation of its manufacturing practices to achieve energy savings. We are developing a comprehensive program to collect and analyze energy consumption data from their production plans and use data-driven analytics to identify energy savings and greenhouse gas reduction opportunities. We are also helping to track energy efficiency gain to [ deliver ] value through operational improvements in the manufacturing process.\nAs clients progress on their total enterprise reinvestment journeys, [ talent is ] at the forefront. we are working with an international consumer goods and services provider in the European market on a digital transformation of its core human resources organization and talent acquisition processes. We will design and implement an approach that includes program management, process design, training and development and additional services. Together, we will create greater efficiencies in the human resources function, leading to a data-driven culture focused on better employee experiences.\nNow stepping back, our strategy is to be at the center of our clients' business to help them continuously reinvent themselves to reach new levels of performance and to set themselves apart as leaders in their industries. And our clients are at different starting points. All are interested in AI, and particularly, generative AI. But most recognize the work ahead of them to get their data, people and processes ready for AI. To reinvent requires a strong modern digital core. And as they embark on this journey, clients are looking to us for our unmatched global scale, deep industry and functional knowledge, breadth of services from strategy and consulting to technology to managed services.\nWith that context, I want to turn to generative AI and AI more broadly. No previous technology wave has captured the intention of leaders and the general public as fast as gen AI. We are now embarking on the age of AI, and companies will need to reinvent how they operate with AI at the core. And it is also early. Think of it as the cloud over a decade ago. Foundation models and products based on them are still maturing with many products announced but fewer at the general availability stage and ready for wide deployment. And with our position as the largest partner with most of the major technology companies, we are at the center of helping our clients navigate their choices in the evolving landscape.\nWe've been investing in AI for years. And so while it is early days, we see generative AI as a key piece of the digital core and a big catalyst for even bigger and bolder total enterprise reinvention going forward. In fact, in a survey of global executives that we completed just last week, 97% of executives said gen AI will be transformative to their company and industry. and 67% of organizations are planning to increase their level of spending in technology are prioritizing investments in data and AI.\nOur approach to AI is clear. Just as we have successfully done with cloud, we are investing to take an early lead and position for the opportunity ahead. Last week, we announced a $3 billion investment in AI, a big step to accelerate our clients' reinvention journey, which includes us doubling our data and AI workforce from 40,000 to 80,000 strong, including the expansion of our center for advanced AI that today has over 1,600 generative AI experts bringing new assets such as our AI navigator for enterprise to life and developing new GenAI-powered industry solutions. And across this all, we are leading with responsible AI to be the most trusted source in helping our clients mitigate the risks as they drive value.\nAnd this isn't just about tomorrow. We have sold over 100 generative AI products -- projects over the last 4 months. Let me give you a flavor of these across a few industries. We are working with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, a Japan-based subsidiary of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, to improve customer service by using generative AI and simplify operations for accident response. The generative AI solution will draw from the company's knowledge base, including policy causes and related laws and regulations, which will generate appropriate response plans in a timely manner, dramatically improving the accuracy and speed of explanations to customers.\nWe're working with a global broadcast company to explore how generative AI can be used to drive audience engagement and growth through deeper and more personalized customer experiences. Together, we recently launched testing that leverages generative AI and large language models to explore how we can automatically create content for the company's customer-facing platforms. The content will help enhance engagement, grow the consumer base across new coverage areas and channels. We believe it will demonstrate how generative AI can be used to create content at scale for a wide variety of experiences and events.\nWe are working with [ Linda Basel ] Industries, a leader in the chemicals industry, to increase its enterprise data and analytic capabilities and help unlock new value. we will develop a strategic data-led digital transformation program across multiple parts of the business and embed new capabilities in areas like sustainability, customer data, digital manufacturing and generative AI to drive insightful and predictive decision-making.\nCompanies are coming to us for help with the strategy in the business case to understand how and where to apply AI, and gen AI specifically, to get their digital core in shape, to help assess which ecosystem partners and models to use, to rewire their processes to be AI-driven, to upgrade and reskill their talent with new ways of working and to navigate the risks and challenges responsibly. In short, we believe clients need our full range of services, and we are well positioned to be the leading trusted AI partner for the enterprise as they move from exploration to experimentation to reinvention.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThanks, Julie. Now turning to our business outlook. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $15.75 billion to $16.35 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 2% to 6% growth in local currency. For the full fiscal '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 4% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we now expect revenue to be in the range of 8% to 9% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which assumes an inorganic contribution of about 2%.\nWe continue to expect business optimization costs of $800 million in fiscal '23 to reduce EPS by $0.96. The gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies will increase EPS by $0.38. Our guidance for full year '23 excludes these impacts. For adjusted op margin, we now expect fiscal year '23 to be 15.4%, a 20 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. We now expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22. We now expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.52 to $11.63 or 8% to 9% growth over fiscal '22 results.\nFor the full fiscal '23, we continue to expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion. We now expect property and equipment additions to be approximately $600 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion. Our free cash flow guidance reflects a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1 to 1,2. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of our cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?\n\nKatie O’Conor\n\nThanks, KC. I would ask that you each keep to 1 question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as possible to ask a question. Operator, would you provide instructions for those on the call?"

I would now like to turn the conference over to Katie O'Conor, Managing Director and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKatie O’Conor\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Katie O'Conor, Managing Director, Head of Investor Relations. On today's call, you will hear from Julie Sweet, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and KC McClure, our Chief Financial Officer. We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago.\nLet me quickly outline the agenda for today's call. Julie will begin with an overview of our results. KC will take you through the financial details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for the second quarter. Julie will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before KC provides our business outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2023. We will then take your questions before Julie provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.\nSome of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward-looking and as such, are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in today's news release and discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this call.\nDuring our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations section of our website at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference call.\nNow let me turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Katie, and thank you to everyone joining today, and thank you to our 738,000 people around the globe for your incredible work and commitment to our clients, which has resulted in our delivering another strong quarter of financial results and the broader 360-degree value we continue to create for all our stakeholders.\nLet me share a few highlights and value we created in our continued disciplined execution. I'm very pleased with our record bookings for Q2 at $22.1 billion, our highest ever including 35 clients with quarterly bookings greater than $100 million, our second highest quarter on record for such bookings, representing the continued trust that our clients have in us. We delivered revenues of $15.8 billion, representing 9% growth in local currency, bringing us to $31.6 billion of revenue at 12% growth through H1, and we continued gaining market share, growing approximately 2x the market.\nWe continued our inorganic investments with 6 acquisitions in strategic areas, including cloud with the acquisition of SKS in Europe, which will expand our specialized technology, consulting and regulatory capabilities, enabling us to better serve our financial services clients; security with the acquisition of Morphus in Brazil, a cyber defense risk management, cyber threat intelligence service provider; and supply chain with the acquisition of Inspirage in the U.S., which will enhance our technology capabilities to accelerate innovation for clients through emerging technologies such as touchless supply chain and digital twins.\nWe also continued our investment in our people with 10.3 million training hours, a 12% increase year-over-year. We are optimizing our business to lower costs in fiscal year 2024 and beyond, while continuing to invest in our business and our people to capture the significant growth opportunities ahead. KC will be giving you more detail on these actions.\nFinally, we believe our focus on creating 360-degree value differentiates us in our market. We earned the #1 position in our industry for the 10th year in a row and #32 overall on Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies. We ranked #1 in our industry and #4 overall on the Just Capital list of America's most just companies. And we have been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the world's most ethical companies for the 16th year in a row.\nI'm very pleased that our results demonstrate once again that our strategy to be the execution partner of choice for transformation, lead in the 5 forces and have a diverse business across markets, industries and services continues to allow us to lead and take market share. And in a world in which all strategies lead to technology, we have distinguished ourselves and our impact in the market.\nOver to you, KC.\n\nKathleen R. McClure\n\nCFO, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, Julie, and thanks to all of you for taking the time to join us on today's call. We were pleased with our overall results in the second quarter, setting a new bookings record at $22.1 billion, $2.5 billion higher than our previous record set in Q2 of last year with consulting bookings close to matching our previous record. We delivered revenue growth for the quarter at the top end of our guided range as we continue to deliver on our shareholder value proposition.\nBefore I summarize results for the quarter, let me spend a moment on the business optimization actions we are taking to reduce costs for fiscal '24 and beyond, which includes streamlining operations, transforming our non-billable corporate functions and consolidating office space.\nWe estimate cost of $1.5 billion through fiscal year 2024, of which we expect to incur approximately $800 million in FY '23 and $700 million in FY '24, comprised of approximately $1.2 billion in severance and $300 million for the consolidation of office space. These actions are expected to impact roughly 2.5% or 19,000 of our current workforce, of which over half are non-billable corporate functions and include over 800 of our more than 10,000 leaders across our markets and services. Nearly half of the 19,000 people will depart by the end of fiscal year '23.\nNow let me summarize a few of the highlights for the quarter. Revenues grew 9% local currency, driven by broad-based growth across all markets with more than half of our 13 industries growing double digits. We also continue to extend our leadership position with growth estimated to be about 2x the market, which refers to our basket of publicly traded companies.\nIn Q2, we recorded $244 million in costs associated with the business optimization actions, which impacted operating margin by 150 basis points and EPS by $0.30. The following comparisons exclude these impacts and reflect adjusted results.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS in the quarter of $2.69, reflecting 6% growth over EPS last year. Adjusted operating margin of 13.8% increased 10 basis points, with 20 basis point expansion year-to-date and includes continued significant investments in our people and our business. Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion and returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date, we've invested $1.1 billion in acquisitions, primarily attributed to 15 transactions.\nWith those high-level comments, let me turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings were a record at $22.1 billion for the quarter, representing growth of 17% in local currency with an overall book-to-bill of 1.4. Consulting bookings were $10.7 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.3. Managed service bookings were also a record at $11.4 billion with a book-to-bill of 1.5. We were very pleased with the strength of our new bookings, which were broad-based, delivering a very strong book-to-bill across all of our geographic markets and across our services with a book-to-bill of 1.5 in operations, 1.4 in technology and 1.3 in strategy and consulting.\nTurning now to revenues. Revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, a 5% increase in U.S. dollars and 9% in local currency, and we're at the top end of our range, adjusting for a foreign exchange headwind of approximately 4% compared to the 5% provided last quarter. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $8.3 billion, a decline of 1% in U.S. dollars and an increase of 4% in local currency. Managed services revenue were $7.5 billion, up 12% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currency.\nTaking a closer look at our service dimensions. Technology services and operations grew double digits, and strategy and consulting declined mid-single digits.\nTurning to our geographic markets. In North America, revenue growth was 5% in local currency, driven by growth in public service, health and utilities. These increases were partially offset by a decline in communications and media and high tech. Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\nIn Europe, revenues grew 12% in local currency, led by growth in industrial, banking and capital markets and public service. Revenue growth was driven by Germany, Italy and France.\nIn growth markets, we delivered 14% revenue growth in local currency, driven by growth in banking and capital markets, chemical and natural resources and public service. Revenue growth was led by Japan.\nMoving down the income statement. Gross margin for the quarter was 30.6% compared with 30.1% for the same period last year. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 9.9% compared to 9.4% for the second quarter last year. General and administrative expense was 6.8% compared to 7% for the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating income was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, reflecting an adjusted 13.8% operating margin, an increase of 10% -- 10 basis points from operating margin in the second quarter of last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.4% compared with an effective tax rate of 19.2% for the second quarter last year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.69 compared with diluted EPS of $2.54 in the second quarter last year. Days services outstanding were 42 days compared to 48 days last quarter and 41 days in the second quarter of last year.\nFree cash flow for the quarter was $2.2 billion compared to approximately $400 million last quarter, resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $2.3 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $108 million. Our cash balance of -- at February 28 was $6.2 billion compared with $7.9 billion at August 31st.\nWith regards to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the second quarter, we repurchased or redeemed 4.1 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average price of $273.55 per share. As of February 28, we had approximately $4.2 billion of share repurchase authority remaining. Also in February, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share for a total of $708 million. This represents a 15% increase over last year. And our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.12 per share to be paid on May 15, a 15% increase over last year.\nFinally, turning to the 360-degree value we are creating for all our stakeholders. We are partnering with Save the Children to connect with new audiences and invigorate donors through fundraising and creative campaign excellence. So the halfway point of fiscal '23, we are pleased with our results.\nNow let me turn it back to Julie.\n\nJulie T. Spellman Sweet\n\nCEO & Director, Accenture Plc\n\nThank you, KC. I will start with the overall demand environment, which is more of the same. We believe that the ongoing volatility and uncertainty in the macro environment is making it even clearer to clients that they need to change more, not less. And that 2 of the 5 key forces of change that we have identified for the next decade, the need for total enterprise reinvention and the ability to access, create and unlock the potential of talent are critical to succeed in the near, medium and long term.\nWe see 2 common themes. First, all strategies continue to lead to technology, particularly cloud, data, AI and security. This is reflected in the latest market estimates, which are down slightly but are still hovering around 5%. And second, companies remain focused on executing compressed transformations to achieve lower cost, stronger growth, more agility and greater resilience faster.\nWe remain laser focused on pivoting to our clients' changing needs and being relevant across the enterprise from the front line to core operations to corporate functions. Our ability to advise, shape and deliver value-led transformation, leveraging the breadth of our services from strategy and consulting to our strategic managed services across all industries and geographic markets is what differentiates Accenture.\nNow I will give you more color on the quarter and in particular, how total enterprise reinvention and talent are critical to our clients. For example, we are helping Shionogi & Co., Ltd., a Japanese pharmaceutical company with a compressed transformation to improve its business process efficiency and create a more agile organization. We will enter into a joint venture with the company that will provide a managed services capability to oversee back-office functions such as human resources, finance and accounting, public relations, facility management, procurement and marketing.\nThe joint venture will also be charged with the management of the pharmacovigilance function from safety management operations to post marketing operations to regulatory compliance. As part of this transformation, we will upscale over 400 employees, enabling them to play a greater role in the growth and development of the wider business, hence demonstrating the value of all our services from strategy and consulting, our deep industry knowledge to technology and operations coming together to enable the clients transformation.\nI would like to take a moment to recognize Egawa-san, our Head of the Japan market unit and our extraordinary people in Japan for how they are consistently creating value for our clients with double-digit revenue growth for each of the past 5 years.\nAs clients focus on building their digital core with a modern cloud-based infrastructure, our cloud business continues to grow very strong double digits. For example, we are working with the state of Missouri to replace its legacy applications and infrastructure with a modern ERP in the cloud, introducing new capabilities in finance, supply chain management, human capital management, payroll and budgeting.\nAs the current ERP system no longer fully meets the business needs of the state, they are looking for a modern system that is efficient, scalable and flexible, all delivered by a best-in-class implementation partner. This compressed transformation, one of the earliest and most complex ERP implementations for any state will help reduce operating expenses, provide opportunities for upskilling and improve customer experience and services.\nWe are partnering with minority and women-owned businesses on this transformation, and we will bring in apprentices, the program's life cycle part of our shared commitment with the state of Missouri to foster diversity and inclusion.\nWith our cloud-first strategy, our approach has been to help clients migrate to the cloud and then partner with them on their journey to grow and innovate in the cloud. Our cloud growth is driven by both migration and clients who are moving forward on this journey, such as Enel, one of our largest utilities clients who's taken their mass migration to cloud a few years ago to the next level, changing their operating model, tools and talent and largely automating IT operations. We are now helping them accelerate the modernization of their application landscape, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, support a significant acquisition and divestment agenda and pivot to platform-based business model for integrated retail delivery beyond meter services, grid and renewable energy.\nUsing cloud as their operating systems is helping this market leader manage increasing levels of complexity by bringing together data, AI and applications to optimize their operations and accelerate growth.\nA strong and secure digital core also is essential to total enterprise reinvention. We're seeing continued very strong demand for our security services, which experienced another quarter of very strong double-digit growth. We're working with Empresas CMPC SA, a Chilean pulp and paper company, and a cybersecurity transformation of their plant operations. We will implement a security program across its 48 industrial sites focused on threat detection, management and response as well as governance and workforce training.\nThrough our global and local industrial capabilities, we will help strengthen the company's cybersecurity expenses through continuous monitoring of its physical locations and equipment.\nWe continue to lead in managed services, which experienced strong growth again this quarter at 16%. Managed services are strategic for our clients because they enable clients to move faster, leveraging our digital platform expertise and talent as well as delivering cost efficiencies. And our clients are turning to Accenture because of the depth and breadth of our industry, functional and technology expertise that we bring together into the transformation journey.\nOur approach to managed services is to both run and transform, and run and modernize. We deliver cost savings as table stakes. For example, we are partnering with the U.K.'s Department for Work and Pensions, which is responsible for welfare pensions and child maintenance policy to modernize its legacy systems, eliminating backlogs and delivering a better experience for citizens and employees. We developed a cloud-based intelligent optimization platform that combines robotic process automation, AI, analytics and machine learning to provide bots-as-a-service to create the equivalent of a virtual workforce available 24/7.\nWith routine tests now automated, the organization has already saved 2.4 million human hours, which can be reallocated to more complex higher-value tasks.\nLet me pause to thank our global H&PS colleagues for their amazing contributions as evidenced by 14 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.\nAs our clients continue to prioritize cost optimization as well as growth in [ landscape ], Song is more relevant than ever. In Song, which grew strong double digits this quarter, clients are focused on more capital-efficient growth that creates efficiency, drive short-term growth and optimizes existing assets with clear outcomes and shorter time horizons to keep up with the pace of change with customers and technology.\nWe've moved quickly to help clients seize new opportunities in contact centers, not only for enhanced customer service, but also customer acquisition and growth. We are working with a global biopharmaceutical leader in North America to reinvent digital marketing at scale. Driven by data and using technologies integrated with SynOps, the company will be able to create, produce and deliver consistent world-class content that informs and educates health care providers and patient communities around the world, helping to deliver innovative health services.\nWe are working with the Prada Group, the Italian luxury fashion player, to offer its customers an entirely new customization experience through an online 3D configurator. Accenture Song created a digital twin of Prada's iconic show called Americas Cup, which allows shoppers to fully customize it for material to color to trim across the overlay, lining, sole and other parts. With more than 50 million possible configurations, more than any web platform could handle, this innovative approach allows customers to see high resolution 3D models of their custom builds with the same quality and fidelity as a physical show. Song solution to online product customization is fully scalable to the cloud. It gives Prada the flexibility to apply the same strategy to other products, ensuring the outstanding experience that their shoppers expect.\nAs I continue to move across the enterprise, industries and markets, I want to also highlight Industry X, which grew very strong double digits again this quarter, and which we believe is the next digital frontier where our digital engineering capabilities are advancing sustainability services. For example, we are working with Recharge Industries, a battery research and production company in Australia, to help design and engineer one of the world's largest lithium-ion battery facilities. Once built, the facility will generate up to 30-gigawatt hours of storage capacity per year.\nFinally, moving to the metaverse and the ongoing tech revolution. We've talked about the importance of artificial intelligence in building the digital core for our clients. While generative AI has recently burst into the popular imagination, at Accenture, we've been working with the technology from its earliest stages and are already applying it at clients.\nFor example, we're working with a multinational bank to transform how it manages high volumes of post-trade processing e-mails every day. We are leveraging a generative AI solution as it is built to understand the context of e-mails with high accuracy. It automatically routes large numbers of e-mails, daily to relevant teams and draft responses with recommended actions and related information. Our work will help reduce manual effort and risk, boost worker efficiency and improve interactions with customers.\nAnd finally, on that note, we will release our Tech Vision 2023 on March 30th. The fourth and fifth key forces of change we have identified for the next decade are the metaverse and ongoing tech revolution. And this year's Tech Vision is particularly relevant and actionable as our clients face a rapidly changing landscape in which generative AI, metaverse, cloud, science, tech and other technologies are driving more opportunities for change and reinvention. This year's vision will explore how these technologies and more are blending the physical world and the virtual world into a shared reality, creating a huge opportunity for our clients and for Accenture.\nNow turning to our business outlook. For the third quarter of fiscal '23, we expect revenues to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.7 billion. This assumes the impact of FX will be about negative 3.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22 and reflects an estimated 3% to 7% growth in local currency.\nFor the full fiscal year '23, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we now expect the impact of FX on our results in U.S. dollars will be approximately negative 4.5% compared to fiscal '22. For the full fiscal '23, we now expect our revenue to be in the range of 8% to 10% growth in local currency over fiscal '22, which assumes an inorganic contribution of 2%. We expect business optimization actions to impact fiscal '23 GAAP operating margin by 120 basis points and EPS by $0.96. We expect our anticipated gain on our investment in Duck Creek Technologies to impact EPS by $0.39. Our guidance for full year fiscal '23 excludes these impacts.\nFor adjusted operating margin, we expect fiscal year '23 to be 15.3% to 15.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal '22 results. We expect our adjusted annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 25%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 24% in fiscal '22. We expect our full year adjusted earnings per share for fiscal '23 to be in the range of $11.41 to $11.63, or 7% to 9% growth over fiscal '22 results. For the full fiscal '23, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $8.7 billion to $9.2 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $700 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $8 billion to $8.5 billion, $300 million higher than our previous guidance.\nOur free cash flow guidance continues to reflect a very strong free cash flow to net income ratio of 1.1. Finally, we continue to expect to return at least $7.1 billion through dividends and share repurchases as we remain committed to returning a substantial portion of cash to our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up so we can take your questions. Katie?"

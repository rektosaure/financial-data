Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. This was a terrific quarter for Alphabet, driven by double-digit growth across every major part of our business. We are seeing AI now driving real business results across the company. We delivered our first ever $100 billion quarter. 5 years ago, our quarterly revenue was at $50 billion. Our revenue number has doubled since then, and we are firmly in the generative AI era. In parallel, we've built for the long term and diversified with successful businesses in cloud, YouTube and subscriptions. Our momentum is strong, and we are shipping at speed. As just a few examples: Our first-party models like Gemini, now process 7 billion tokens per minute via direct API use by our customers. The Gemini app now has over 650 million monthly active users and queries increased by 3x from Q2. Cloud had another great quarter of accelerating growth with AI revenue as a key driver. Cloud backlog grew 46% quarter-over-quarter to $155 billion. And we crossed $300 million paid subscriptions led by growth in Google One and YouTube Premium.\nToday, I'll discuss progress in our full stack approach to AI and then share highlights from search, cloud, YouTube and Waymo. As a reminder, our full stack approach spans AI infrastructure world-class research, including models and tooling and our products and platforms that bring AI to people everywhere. First up, AI infrastructure. Our extensive and reliable infrastructure, which powers all of Google's products is the foundation of our stack and a key differentiator. We are scaling the most advanced chips in our data centers, including GPUs from our partner, NVIDIA as well as our own purposeful TPUs. And we are the only company providing a wide range of both.\nAs we announced yesterday at NVIDIA GTC, we are now shipping the new A4X MAX instances powered by NVIDIA GB-300 to our cloud customers. Our highly sought-after TPU portfolio is led by our 7-generation TPU Ironwood, which will be generally available soon. We are investing in TPU capacity to meet the tremendous demand we are seeing from customers and partners, and we are excited that Anthropic recently shared plans to access up to 1 million TPUs.\nNext world-class AI research, including models and tooling. Our models are world-leading. GEMINI 2.5 Pro Veo Genie 3 under viral sensation Nanobanana, are among the very best in class. Over 230 million videos have been generated with Veo 3, and more than 13 million developers have built with our generative models. We are looking forward to the release of Gemini 3 later this year. Our research leadership is advancing next frontier technologies.\nLast week, we announced that our Willow Quantum chip achieved a major breakthrough, running an algorithm 13,000x faster than 1 of the world's best supercomputers and the result is verifiable paving the way to future practical applications. Speaking of quantum, let me congratulate Michele Debre, our Chief Scientist for Quantum hardware. He received a Nobel in physics for early research he did in the 1980s. 3 Nobles awarded to current Googlers in 2 years, incredible.\nAnd third, our products and platforms. we are bringing AI to more people and developers than anyone else. In July, we announced that we processed 980 trillion monthly tokens across all our services. We are now processing over 1.3 quarterly and monthly tokens, more than 20x growth in a year, phenomenal. This quarter, we took big steps to reimagine Chrome as a browser powered by AI through deep integrations with Gemini and AI mode in search with more agentic capabilities coming soon. In August and made by Google, we unveiled our Pixel ton series of devices. They are the first with our most powerful chip designed to run on Gemini Tensor G5. They're our best reviewed devices ever. And last week, we launched Android XR, our new operating system at Samsung's Galaxy XR device. It brings new ways to use headsets and classes with Gemini at the core.\nNow turning to highlights from search. AI is driving an expansionary moment for search as people learn what they can do with our new AI experiences, they're increasingly coming back to search more. search and its AI experiences are built to highlight the web, sending billions of clicks to sites every day. During the Q2 call, we shared that overall queries and commercial queries continue to grow year-over-year. This growth rate increased in Q3, largely driven by our AI investments in search, most notably AI overviews and AI mode. Let me dive into the momentum we are seeing. As we have shared before, AI overviews drive meaningful query growth. This effect was even stronger in Q3 as users continue to learn that Google can answer more of their questions. And it's particularly encouraging to see the effect was more pronounced with younger people. We're also seeing that AI mode is resonating well with users. In the U.S., we have seen strong and consistent week over week growth in usage since launch and queries doubled over the quarter.\nOver the last quarter, we rolled out AI mode globally across 40 languages in record time. It now has over 75 million daily active users and we shipped over 100 improvements to the product in Q3, an incredibly fast pace. Most importantly, AI mode is already driving incremental total query growth for search. Philipp will talk more about monetization and share how AI is helping people connect with businesses and shop on search.\nNext, Google Cloud. Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins and backlog. In Q3, customer demand strengthened in 3 ways. One, we are signing new customers faster. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger deals. We have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous 2 years combined. Third, we are deepening our relationships over 70% of the existing Google Cloud customers use our AI products, including Banco BV, Best Buy and Fair Price Group.\nAs we scale, we are diversifying revenue. Today, 13 product lines are each at an annual run rate over $1 billion. And we are improving operating margin with highly differentiated products built with our own technology. This deep product differentiation starts with our AI infrastructure. We have a decade of experience building AI accelerators and today, offer the widest array of chips. This leadership is winning customers like HCA Healthcare, LGAI Research and Macaquarie Bank. And it's why 9 of the top 10 AI labs choose Google Cloud. We are also the only cloud provider offering our own leading generative AI models including Gemini, IMAGINE, Veo, Chirp and Lyria, Adoption is rapidly accelerating. In Q3, revenue from products built on our generative AI models grew more than 200% year-over-year.\nOver the past 12 months, nearly 150 Google Cloud customers, each processed approximately 1 trillion tokens with our models for a wide range of applications. For example, WPP is creating campaigns with up to 70% efficiency gains. Swarovski has increased e-mail open rates by 17% and accelerated campaign localization by 10 times. Earlier this month, we launched Gemini Enterprise, the new front door for AI in the workplace, and we are seeing strong adoption for agents built on this platform. Our packaged enterprise agents in Gemini Enterprise are optimized for a variety of domains are highly differentiated and offer significant out-of-box value to customers. We have already crossed 2 million subscribers across 700 companies.\nNext, YouTube. In the living room, YouTube has remained #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, according to Nielsen. Last month marked YouTube's first time as a live NFL broadcaster. This exclusive global broadcast live from Brazil drew more than 19 million fans and set a new record for most concurrent viewers of a live stream on YouTube.\nYouTube Shorts also continues to perform well. In the U.S., Shorts now earned more revenue per watt than traditional in-stream on YouTube. At our Made on YouTube event, we rolled out a number of AI-powered features that are helping create a supercharge creation and build their businesses. AI is now streamlining the entire content creation workflow from generated video tools and more efficient editing to AI-powered insights that help creators optimize their channels. We are also using AI to expand monetization, automatically identifying products to make their videos more shoppable. Philipp will discuss in more detail. And finally, Waymo, next year Waymo aims to open service in London, and they are working to bring service to Tokyo. They've also announced expansions to Dallas, Nashville, Denver and Seattle and secured permission to operate fully autonomously at San Jose and San Francisco Airports.\nAutonomous testing continues to scale in New York City. The new Waymo for business allows enterprises to offer Waymo as a work travel option. And we launched Waymo Teams accounts in Phoenix this summer, we are pleased to see usage steadily increase with positive feedback from teens and their parents alike. Waymo's growth and momentum are strong and 2026 is shaping up to be an exciting year. Overall, a milestone quarter, the incredible work of our teams is driving momentum across the board and our leadership in AI positions us so well for the opportunity ahead.\nI want to thank all of our partners and our employees for their hard work and an excellent Q3. With that, I'll turn it over to Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior VP & Chief Business Officer\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks are on the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $87 billion for the quarter, up 14% year-on-year driven by accelerated growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. Adding some further color to our results. The 15% increase in search and other was led by growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. Its 15% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand. Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $56 billion in revenue for the quarter.\nAs Sundar mentioned, AI is driving an expansionary moment in transforming how people use Google Search. Our investments in new AI experiences, such as AI overviews and AI Mode continued to drive growth in overall quarries, including commercial quarries, creating more opportunities for monetization. These AI experiences are enhancing how people connect with businesses and shop on search. We recently added shopping capabilities in AI mode, which now help people shop conversationally in search and we expand try-on capabilities to more clothing items now available to anyone in the U.S.\nLastly, we're making it easier for consumers to benefit from deals through new loyalty offerings like personalized annotations on organic results and ads. Looking at monetization, businesses can now tap into our most powerful AI search experiences. Using our most advanced AI models, we can understand and predict intent like never before, unlocking entirely new commercial pathways to provide valuable new consumer connections and helping us monetize even more efficiently.\nRolled out globally in September, AI MAX and search is already used by hundreds of thousands of advertisers currently making it the fastest-growing AI [indiscernible] search ads product. In Q3 alone, AI MAX unlocked billions of net new quarries by delivering the most relevant ad across surfaces and matching advertisers against additional queries they weren't reaching before. AI MAX helps advertisers discover new customers at the exact moment they need their product or service.\nKayak, for example, look to grow conversions while staying within their [indiscernible] goals. After turning on AI MAX and search, they grew the conversion value by 12% in early tests. We continue to infuse generative AI capabilities at every step of the marketing process. We rolled out Imagen 4 in asset studio and product studio, helping businesses produce more and better creators. On the measurement front, we enriched the model supporting Meridian, our marketing mix model with additional variables and more granular reporting in P-MAX is making bidding more effective. Financial services company [indiscernible] has been using PMAX to meet its ambitious growth targets and help drive a 39% improvement in its conversion volume year-over-year.\nMoving to YouTube, where we saw accelerated revenue growth, our recommendation systems are driving robust watch time growth in our key monetization areas like Shorts and Living Room. As we leverage Gemini models, we're seeing further discovery improvement. On direct response, we're excited about the growth in revenue we're seeing, especially from small and medium advertisers adopting demand gen. We also improved performance on demand gen with over 100 launches helping to increase conversion value by more than 40% for advertisers using target-based bidding on YouTube. The retail vertical continues to lead our growth on YouTube with demand [indiscernible] helping us further monetize shopping-related categories.\nLooking at the Living Room, our long-term bet more advertisers are adopting interactive direct response ads, leading to an annual revenue run rate exceeding $1 billion globally for this format. For our viewers, we continue to give fans greater access across sports, while tapping into the best of YouTube's product innovation and creator led content. Sundar mentioned that we expanded our NFL partnership with our first ever exclusive global broadcast of an NFL game. Brands love the opportunity and we sold all our ad inventory within a couple of weeks. Looking at creators, a significant force behind the thriving YouTube creator economy is the collaboration between creators and brands. Tools like direct linking to deals, websites and shorts and swap brand segments in long form will soon help creators show how they deliver great value for brands.\nThanks to a collaboration with [indiscernible], Comcast Xfinity drove an 8% search lift, beating other XFINITY ads, recall [indiscernible] on shorts by 34%. At the same time, it decreased the cost per lifted user by 50% when compared to the next most efficient ad. We continue to invest in AI part features that are helping greater supercharge creation and build their businesses. with Veo 3 integration and speech to song, creators go from idea to iteration quicker and new channel insights help them better understand performance. Ending on YouTube with our subscriptions product, we're also seeing momentum with strong growth in offerings such as YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV. We're also applying Gemini internally to help us serve customers with increased speed, intelligence and efficiency. Our sales teams use Gemini enrich with ads knowledge to streamline customer interactions.\nThis increased productivity by over 10%, led to hundreds of millions in incremental revenue and frees up sellers to engage with more customers at a deeper, more strategic level. In our Customer Support division, Gemini-powered solutions have managed over 40 million customer sessions so far this year and resolved hundreds of thousands of customer inquiries, and we're just getting started. As always, I'll wrap with the progress we're seeing across partnerships where our customers tap into the strength and breadth of Google's products to accelerate their transformation.\nRevolut, the global financial services company leverages Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform and Gemini models to help power its advanced customer service chatbot develop new hyperpersonalized financial products and offer predictive insights. Revolut is also increasing its presence on YouTube adopting Veo 3 for personalized creatives, making Google a key ads partner for delivering growth and launching new markets.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank Google everywhere for their contributions to our success. And as always, to our customers and partners for their continued trust. And of course, a huge thanks to all of you as we celebrate 25 years of Google Ads. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2025. We had an outstanding quarter in Q3, continuing the strong momentum we've had throughout the year, delivering double-digit revenue growth across search and YouTube advertising, subscriptions, platforms and devices and Google Cloud. Consolidated revenue reached $102.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase or 15% in constant currency. Total cost of revenue was $41.4 billion, up 13%. Tech was $14.9 billion, up 8%. Other cost of revenues was $26.5 billion, up 16%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation and other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses increased 28% to $29.7 billion, R&D expenses increased by 22%, driven by compensation and depreciation expenses related to our AI efforts. Sales and marketing expenses were flat and G&A expenses increased meaningfully, primarily due to a $3.5 billion charge related to the European Commission fine mentioned in the earnings press release.\nOperating income increased 9% this quarter to $31.2 billion, and operating margin was 30.5%. Excluding the EC fine, operating income increased 22%, and operating margin was 33.9%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, offset by the legal charge and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Other income and expenses was $12.8 billion, primarily due to unrealized gains in our nonmarketable equity securities portfolio.\nNet income increased 33% to $35 billion and earnings per share increased 35% to $2.87. We generated free cash flow of $24.5 billion in the third quarter and $73.6 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in Q3 benefited from strong operating cash flow and recent tax changes regarding the timing of when research and development costs are expensed and assets are depreciated. This was partially offset by higher CapEx. We ended the quarter with $98.5 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nTurning to segment results. Google Services revenues increased 14% to $87.1 million, reflecting strength in Google Search, YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 15% to $56.6 billion, representing another robust quarter with continued growth across all major verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 15% to $10.3 billion driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 3%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues increased 21% this quarter to $12.9 billion, driven by very strong growth in both YouTube and Google One subscriptions. Google Services operating income increased 9% to $33.5 billion. Operating margin declined year-over-year to 38.5% as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base were offset by the impact of the EC fine, which was fully reflected in the Google Services segment.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, which again delivered very strong results this quarter as cloud continued to benefit from our enterprise AI optimized stack, including our own custom TPUs and our industry-leading AI models. Cloud revenue increased by 34% to $15.2 billion in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in GCP, which continued to grow at a rate that was much higher than cloud's overall revenue growth rate. GCP's growth was driven by enterprise AI products, which are generating billions in quarterly revenue. We had strong growth in enterprise AI infrastructure and enterprise AI solutions which benefited from demand for our industry-leading models, including Gemini 2.5. Core GCP was also a meaningful contributor to growth. And we had double-digit growth in Workspace, which was driven by an increase in average revenues per seat and the number of seats. Cloud operating income increased by 85% to $3.6 billion and operating margin increased from 17.1% in the third quarter last year to 23.7% this quarter.\nThe expansion in cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense base partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes depreciation expense and other operations costs such as energy. Google Cloud's backlog increased 46% sequentially and 82% year-over-year, reaching $155 billion at the end of the third quarter. The increase was driven primarily by strong demand for enterprise AI. As Sundar mentioned earlier, cloud has signed more billion-dollar deals in the first 9 months of 2025 than in the past 2 years combined.\nIn Other Bets, revenues were $344 million, and operating loss was $1.4 billion in the third quarter. Within Other Bets, we continue to allocate more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create substantial value. With respect to CapEx, in the third quarter, our CapEx was $24 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment. In Q3, we returned capital to shareholders through repurchases of stock of $11.5 billion and dividend payments of $2.5 billion.\nTurning to our outlook. I would like to provide some commentary on factors that will impact our business performance in the fourth quarter of 2025 as well as an updated outlook for CapEx for the year. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum of our business. At the current spot rates, we could see an FX tailwind to our revenues in Q4. However, the volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q4 revenues. As for our segments in Google Services, year-over-year comparisons in advertising will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on U.S. elections in the fourth quarter of 2024, particularly on YouTube.\nIn Cloud, demand for our products remains high as evidenced by the accelerating revenue growth and the $49 billion sequential increase in cloud backlog in Q3. In GCP, we see strong demand for enterprise via infrastructure, including TPUs and GPUs, enterprise AI solutions driven by demand for Gemini 2.5 and our other AI models and core GCP infrastructure and other services such as cybersecurity and data analytics.\nAs I've mentioned on previous earnings calls, while we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployments and data center construction, we still expect to remain in a tight demand supply environment in Q4 and 2026.\nMoving to investments. We're continuing to invest aggressively due to the demand we're experiencing from cloud customers as well as the growth opportunities we see across the company. We now expect CapEx to be in the range of $91 billion to $93 billion in 2025, up from our previous estimate of $85 billion keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in the reported CapEx number.\nLooking out to 2026, we expect a significant increase in CapEx, and we'll provide more detail on our fourth quarter earnings call. In terms of expenses, first, as I've mentioned on the previous earnings calls, the significant increase in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&L in the form of higher depreciation expenses and related data center operations costs such as energy. In the third quarter, depreciation increased $1.6 billion year-over-year to $5.6 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 41%. Given the overall increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate slightly in Q4.\nSecond, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season. Q3 was a strong quarter and we're excited with the adoption of our AI products helped by a rapid pace of innovation and great execution by our teams. This translated into strong momentum in search, YouTube ads subscription platforms and devices in cloud, resulting in our first $100 billion-plus quarter.\nNow Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.",

Never gonna say goodbye. Happy birthday, YouTube.\nI don't know if I'm on the right path, but I'm trying to find it. I'm questioning, searching, and then something shifts, and I'm not trying anymore. I'm just doing. All the pieces start falling into place. It all feels pretty clear in my head. I see these, like, flashes of possibilities, almost like I'm traveling through dimensions.\nI'm looking down at myself and my characters in these different worlds, and it's almost coming to life on their own, even though I know I'm in control of that narrative. It feels like it's almost building upon itself at some point. You know, you could have an infinite amount of endings to your story. The work isn't built brick by brick by brick. It blooms like a spontaneous garden. It grows naturally, fully vibrant, and complete.\nI'm not forcing it. I'm just finding it. That's when I know I'm in the right place. To recap, Sarah, you'll be optimizing our Google Ads campaign for the summer collection? Yep, on it. Making the summer collection's new performance asset. No problem. Also, can you double-check the product imagery? Oh, can you look into which marketing channels are driving the highest converting users who also engage with our content for more than five minutes in the past four weeks? I'll ping you. Hi.\nOne of these apps has malware. Which one is it? You tell me. Well, the unicorn said it'd give me extra tokens. Free magical gold! Typical. The delivery app promised me free food. Do you like pizza? It can't be her. I'm innocent. Can it? You may not be able to tell which app is a trap, but Google Play can. Apps on Google Play go through over 10,000 safety checks. Oh, you're a sea unicorn? Is the cute one. Next time, stay safer with Google Play.\nHow are you finding the festival? I proper love it. I'm in my element. Don't know why everyone always complains about the weather. What's your festival camping essentials? Definitely the inflatable mattress. Why are you here? For the free love. Favorite band?

Remember last time we talked about how people think I'm doing the same thing as you, but it's all just like a crazy coincidence? Totally crazy. Well, what's even crazier is I just announced all these new features, and people think I'm doing it again. No way. Wait. Like, I announced live translation for text messages, right?

Hold up.\nThis is Ted. Ted was born in 1998, the year of the first Google Search. As a teenager, whatever Ted was looking for, Google helped him find it. Teen Sporn Music Video. My life is brilliant. It went year after year. There was always some new question on his mind. Ted is 26 now. His life isn't so simple. Fortunately, Google still is. Why is this not working? Oh. Even when his questions are a lot of questions in one. What's something cool happening tonight in the city? It gets me home at a reasonable time? Whoa, which is how Ted found something he didn't even know he was looking for. Hey. Hey. Turns out. I'm Ted Life's full of questions. Luckily, you can just ask Google.\nI see infinite possibilities with Flo. What manner of magic is that? AI Mode is the biggest revolution since the search engine was invented. You tell Gemini exactly what you want built, and it builds it for you. No. Coding with Gemini 2.5 Pro, it is awesome. Project Mariner is going to change how we use our browsers. It's an AI agent that gets things done for you. NotebookLM's mind map completely transforms learning. Why is this person following me wherever I walk? That's just your shadow. Wait, you're going to turn right? AI is completely changing how we fight fires. Generative media is expanding the boundaries of creativity. It was magic the first time I saw this.\nThis isn't just another tool. It's a game changer. This is just, like, mind-blowing to me. The potential's almost limitless.\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for Alphabet's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.

Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. Now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us with robust growth across the company. As you saw at I/O, we are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum. This quarter, Search delivered double-digit revenue growth. Our new Search features continue to perform well. AI Mode has launched in the US and India and is going well, while AI Overviews now has over 2 million monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories, and 40 languages. I'll give some more details on Search in a moment.\nWe continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions, reflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the US, Shorts now earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on YouTube. In some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream. Cloud had another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog, and profitability. The annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio.\nOf course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated full-stack approach to AI. This spans AI infrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring AI to people all over the world. I'll briefly touch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights.\nFirst, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs, along with storage and software built on top. That's why nearly all GenAI unicorns use Google Cloud. It's why a growing number, including leading AI research labs like Safe Superintelligence and Physical Intelligence, use TPUs specifically. Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers.\nNext, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to expand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide industry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In addition to improving our popular workhorse model/we debuted an extremely fast Flashlight version. We achieved gold medal-level performance in the International Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with Deep Think. We can't wait to bring Deep Think to users soon. We have some of the best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have been a catalyst for growth, and 9 million developers have now built with Gemini.\nI also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model. It's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app and with our new AI filmmaking tool, Flo. Since May, over 70 million videos have been generated using Veo 3. We recently introduced a feature in the Gemini app to turn photos into videos, which people absolutely love. It's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today.\nThird, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners through surfaces like Workspace, Chrome, and more. The growth in usage has been incredible. At I/O in May, we announced that we processed 480 trillion monthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we have doubled that number, now processing over 980 trillion monthly tokens, a remarkable increase.\nThe Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users, and we continue to see strong growth in engagement, with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet. Powered by Veo 3, our new short video product in Workspace called Google Meet reached nearly 1 million monthly active users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new Android and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices. We are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost from our Google AI Pro and Ultra plans.\nNow, some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube, and Waymo for the quarter. First up is an incredibly exciting moment for Search. We see AI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing information, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask Google. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continue to grow year-over-year. Our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users to search more as they learn that Search can meet more of their needs. That's especially true for younger users.\nLet me go deeper on our new Search experiences. We know how popular AI Overviews are because they are now driving over 10% more queries globally for the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to increase over time. AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering the fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the use of multimodal search, particularly the combination of Lens or Circle to Search together with AI Overviews. This growth was most pronounced among younger users.\nOur new end-to-end AI search experience, AI Mode, continues to receive very positive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions. It's still rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in the US and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for users by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research tool, Deep Search, and more personalized responses.\nNext, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand driven by our product differentiation and our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show this. One, the number of deals over $250 million, doubling year-over-year. Two, in the first half of 2025, we signed the same number of deals over $1 billion that we did in all of 2024. Three, the number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% quarter over quarter. Four, more than 85,000 enterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce, and Singapore's GBS Bank, now built with Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year-over-year.\nOur models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-leading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference. Along with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage, including Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70%, and Rapid Storage, which delivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to leading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages, including PyTorch and JAX, with full open-source supports for various AI training and serving demands.\nWe've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products. Wayfair is leveraging our databases integrated with AI to streamline data pipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences. Mattel is leveraging our Gemini-powered data agents and BigQuery to review and act on product feedback more quickly. Target is using our Gemini-powered threat intelligence and security operations agents to improve cybersecurity.\nCapgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher-quality software faster by automating tasks from code generation to testing. BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace are saving employees nearly three hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it out to 100,000 employees globally. We are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We introduced an open-source agent development kit, which now has over 1 million downloads in less than four months.\nWe also introduced Agentspace, an open and interoperable enterprise chat search and agent platform. Gordon Food Service is bringing Agentspace to its US employees, which is enabling better, more efficient decision-making. Over 1 million subscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general availability.\nTurning now to YouTube, Nielsen data shows YouTube has led US streaming watch time for over two years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on their devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and content on their televisions. That includes millions of sports fans, too. Globally, they consume more than 40 million hours of sports content on YouTube annually. In September, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday game of the season, live from Brazil.\nFrom sports to Shorts, we now average over 200 million daily views on YouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto-dubbing, which translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically increasing the potential audiences they can reach. Today, we began rolling out a whole raft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts. Finally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently expanding its Premium Lite offerings to 15 new countries, with more to come.\nLastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more riders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than doubled its Austin service territory, and expanded its Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched teen accounts, starting with riders aged 14-17 in Phoenix.\nOverall, great momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads. The team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the future. As I said, a standout quarter. A big thank you, as always, to our employees and partners for an amazing Q2. Philipp, over to you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar. Hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube, and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues. To add some further color to our results, the 12% increase in Search and other revenues was led by growth across all verticals, with the largest contributions from retail, and financial services.\nYouTube saw similar performance across verticals. Its 13% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response, followed by brand. Starting with Search and other revenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter, shifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native multimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual world back into the online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search.\nLet me share a few examples. Take visual queries. Google Lens searches are one of the fastest growing query types on Search and grew 70% since this time last year. The majority of Lens searches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth for shopping queries using Lens. You can obviously take this to the next level by moving from image to video-based capabilities like Search Live.\nThen there's Circle to Search, which is now on over 300 million Android devices. We've been adding capabilities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI overview or answers. Just last week, we brought a new agentic capability directly into Search for all US users with AI-powered calling to local businesses.\nFinally, shopping. We're in Q2. We introduced a virtual try-on experience for Search Labs users in the US. Now people can try billions of clothing products on themselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been extremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users. We'll be bringing this functionality to all US users imminently. All these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use technology, bringing the offline world into the online world in ways that simply have not been possible before.\nAdd in our amazing AI translation capabilities, and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more content in the language, and businesses large and small, international or local, can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these elements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search. Moving to Ads, where our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process with AI is delivering value for our customers and our business. Last quarter, we introduced AI Max in Search, a new suite of AI-powered features in existing Search campaigns. Advertisers that activate AI Max in Search campaigns typically see 14% more conversions.\nOn media buying, Smart Bidding Exploration, the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade, brings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on less obvious but potentially higher value queries more often. Campaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration see a 19% increase in conversions on average. Demand Gen continues to drive revenue growth and deliver measurable impact for our customers. As an example, Depop, Etsy's resale clothing marketplace, used a Shorts-only Demand Gen campaign to drive new customers to the site. Shorts drove 80% higher brand lift and double click-through rates versus benchmarks.\nOn creatives, we launched AssetStudio using our latest models to help businesses large and small generate creative assets. Small businesses benefit from top-quality assets and deployment scaling capabilities, while larger businesses can go faster from proof of concept to launch and resize at lower costs. Over 2 million advertisers now use Google's AI-powered asset generation tools to run ads, a 50% increase on this time last year.\nTurning to YouTube, where we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by direct response, followed by brand. YouTube creators are connected to the global zeitgeist and trusted by their audiences like no others. As part of BrandConnect, we launched Creator Partnership Hub, which allows brands to more easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments. We introduced Veo 3, photo to video, and generative effects to Shorts, making content creation easier and offering unexplored avenues for creativity.\nWe're seeing both the volume and the price of ads in Shorts increase, particularly in developed markets. The feed-based nature of the product allows for more ad opportunities on average, and this growth is further supported by ad formats native to Shorts, AI-powered ad creative resizing tools, improved ad targeting, and the rise in viewer engagement. McDonald's USA harnessed the influence of YouTube creators to ignite awareness for the Minecraft movie meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts partnership ads to increase its reach, generating a 3.3x higher view-through rate than the industry benchmark.\nFinally, on CTV, where the momentum continues. According to the Gauge report by Nielsen, YouTube has been number one in streaming watch time in the US for more than two years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in June 2025. In the past 12 months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove over 1 billion conversions. We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV shopping ads, which allows viewers to shop directly via QR codes, helping us leverage direct marketing opportunities.\nAs always, I'll wrap up with the momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where customers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them transform their business with AI. For instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital commerce experience for their merchants and customers. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing, and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the availability and functionality of PayPal's payment services and capabilities across a range of Google products.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success, and to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025. We had another solid quarter in Q2, consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion, increased by 14% or 13% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices, and Google Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter, reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $39 billion, up 10%.\nTech was $14.7 billion, up 10%, and other cost of revenue was $24.3 billion, up 10%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition cost, largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation. Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver of growth was expense for legal and other matters, which reflected the impact of a $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal matters. R&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in advertising and promotional expenses.\nOperating income increased 14% this quarter to $31.3 billion, and operating margin was 32.4%. Operating margin benefited from strong revenue growth and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier and a significant increase in depreciation expense. Net income increased 19% to $28.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31. We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7 billion for the trailing 12 months.\nFree cash flow in the second quarter was affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax payments as we make federal tax payments in the second quarter for both Q1 and Q2. We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nTurning to segment results, Google Services revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion, reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising and subscriptions. Google Search and other revenues increased by 12% to $54.2 billion. Search and other revenues delivered growth across all verticals, with the largest contributions coming from retail and financial services. YouTube advertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion, driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand. Network advertising revenue of $7.4 billion were down 1%.\nSubscription, platforms, and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. This growth was driven by YouTube subscription offerings, followed by Google One, with growth in paid subscriptions being the biggest driver of revenue growth. Google Services operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion. Operating margin was flat year-on-year at 40.1%, as healthy revenue growth and continued efficiency in our expense base were partially offset by the legal charge I mentioned earlier.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, which delivered very strong results this quarter, revenues increased by 32% to $13.6 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at the rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth and growth in Google Workspace driven by an increase in average revenue per seat and the number of seats.\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased to $2.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 11.3% to 20.7%. The expansion in Cloud operating margin was driven by strong revenue performance and continued efficiencies in our expense base, partially offset by higher technical infrastructure usage costs, which includes the associated depreciation.\nAs we ramp our AI investments, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity and efficiency to offset growth in technical infrastructure-related expenses, particularly from higher depreciation. Google Cloud backlog increased 18% sequentially in Q2 and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106 billion at the end of the quarter. This growth was driven by strong demand for our products and services from both new and existing customers.\nAs Sundar mentioned, we have signed multiple billion-dollar-plus deals in the first half of the year. As for other bets, in the second quarter, revenue were $373 million, and operating loss was $1.2 billion. Within other bets, we're allocating more resources to businesses like Waymo, where we see opportunities to create additional value. With respect to CapEx in the second quarter, our CapEx was $22.4 billion. The vast majority of our CapEx was invested in technical infrastructure, with approximately 2/3 of investments in servers and one-third in data centers and networking equipment.\nIn Q2, we returned capital to shareholders through the purchase of stock of $13.6 billion, and dividend payments of $2.5 billion. Turning to our outlook, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second half of 2025, as well as an updated outlook for full-year CapEx. First, in terms of revenues, we're pleased with the overall momentum we're seeing across the business. At current spot rates, we could see a tailwind to our revenue in Q3. However, volatility in exchange rates could affect the impact of FX on Q3 revenue.\nAs for our segments, in Google Services, advertising revenues in the second half of 2025 will be affected by the following: the continued lapping of the strength we experienced in financial service verticals throughout 2024, and year-over-year comparisons will be negatively impacted by the strong spend on US selection in the second half of 2024, particularly on YouTube.\nIn Cloud, as I mentioned, the demand for our products is high, as evidenced by the continued revenue growth and the Cloud backlog of $106 billion. While we have been working hard to increase capacity and have improved the pace of server deployment, we expect to remain in a tight demand-supply environment going into 2026. Moving to investments, given the strong demand for our Cloud products and services, we now expect to invest approximately $85 billion in CapEx in 2025, up from a previous estimate of $75 billion.\nOur updated outlook reflects additional investment in servers, the timing of delivery of servers, and an acceleration in the pace of data center construction, primarily to meet Cloud customer demand. Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in CapEx due to the demand we're seeing from customers, as well as growth opportunities across the company. We will provide more details on the 2026 CapEx outlook on a future earnings call.\nIn terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In the second quarter, depreciation increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion, reflecting a growth rate of 35%. Given the recent increase in CapEx investments, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate further in Q3.\nSecond, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. In the third quarter, we expect a sequential increase in total headcount additions, due in part to the hiring of new graduates. Third, Q3 will reflect the expense associated with the upcoming August launch of the new Pixel family of products.\nIn conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the momentum in the business and excited about the pace of innovation. Our full-stack approach, which combines AI infrastructure, AI research, and AI products and platforms, positions us well to deliver new products and services across the company. We're seeing great momentum with our AI efforts, as demonstrated by the increase in cumulative token process. Search revenues are seeing healthy growth, with features like AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Lens offering new ways for users to access the information.\nCloud has reached an annual revenue run rate of more than $50 billion and is delivering margin expansion while continuing to invest to meet customer demand. YouTube has expanded its addressable market by building new services like Shorts, which now averages over 200 billion daily views. We're excited to see the value our products and services are bringing to customers and partners around the globe. Now I'll turn the call over to the operator, and Sundar, Philipp, and I will take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Your first question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much for taking the question. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Philipp. Sundar, when you think about the journey you're on with respect to the evolution of products and platforms, how do you think about some of the implications of change, consumer behavior, and how investors should think about that from the volume perspective versus the monetization perspective? I think there's a lot of long-standing dynamics out there about clicks and click monetization that might be very different when you look out over the next three to five years.\nPhilipp, when you think about the evolution of YouTube, you made a number of comments there about subscription revenue. I'm just curious how you think about the mix of advertising versus subscription and what some of your key learnings might have been as the subscription side of the business continues to scale. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Eric. Appreciate the question. I do think looking ahead, based on everything we are seeing, people are excited about AI. They are adopting it well across our products. For me, just seeing multimodality, how people have modified their behavior to include images both through Lens and Circle to Search seamlessly as part of interacting with Google, are early indications that people are going to be adopting through these moments very, very well. I think I'm trying to understand your question in terms of clicks and click monetization. Maybe that's something Philipp can touch on.\nOverall, we expect, as we build out our organic experiences, we have a good understanding of how to continue training on monetization so that it'll work well with the organic experiences. We will lead with the organic experience. In terms of newer surfaces like Gemini app, etc., we'll focus on the organic experience for the near term. Just like we are doing with AI Overviews and with AI Mode over time, we'll be able to bring very, very good commercial experiences there as well. We think people will adapt to them, as they've always done. Maybe Philipp can add more. Philipp?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah. On your question on YouTube subscriptions versus ads, look, I mean, we love our ads business. We love our subscription business. YouTube subscriptions are increasingly important for YouTube. We'll definitely continue our long-term focus here. We had strong growth across YouTube subscription products, which includes, just to be clear, YouTube TV, YouTube Music, and Premium.\nI think one common theme for our subscription services in general is offering viewers more choice here.We also have a very deep understanding of the monetization side here, where are we monetizing more with ads, where can we potentially monetize more with subscriptions. I think we will continue this as a double-tier strategy actively going forward.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks so much for taking the questions. One for Sundar. One for Philipp. Sundar, can you just talk about how you're thinking about your current access to compute, even as you spend $10 billion more this year in CapEx? You also said that you're still in a tight supply environment, so you're trying to marry those. Philipp, perhaps on search growth, can you talk a little bit about paid click and pricing growth, just within the 12% search growth, and how we should think about volume versus monetization trends going forward? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nDoug, thanks. On the CapEx stuff, obviously, we are seeing strong momentum across our portfolio, especially in Cloud. You are right, it's a tight supply environment, and we are investing more to expand. There is obviously a time delay between this additional investment and when it will play out in future years, so that's why both of them are true at the same time. We are planning ahead, and we are investing. Overall, it's exciting to see the traction, particularly in Cloud. I think the comprehensiveness of our AI portfolio, the breadth of our offerings, both providing our models on GPUs and TPUs for our customers, all of that has been really driving demand, so we are investing to match up to it.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nOn your paid click question, look, to be very clear, I think we said this before. We manage the business to drive great outcomes for our users and an attractive ROI for our advertisers. We actually do not manage to paid clicks and CPC targets.Some of the product and policy changes we make actually drive better monetization at the expense of paid clicks. You will actually see in the 10Q, paid clicks were up 4% year-on-year.\nA number of factors affect these metrics from quarter to quarter, such as a few examples: advertiser spending, product changes, policy changes, user engagement, and so on. It is really important when it comes to paid clicks and CPCs to avoid drawing overly broad conclusions solely based on these metrics.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one, Sundar, there is a lot of discussion about agentic search for commercial activities and agents that can be broadly deployed. Maybe could you just, from a technology perspective, when you sit down with the engineering teams working on some of these new agentic capabilities that could come, what are some of the predominant technological hurdles that you think need to be cleared in order to launch scalable agents for commercial queries is the first one.\nThe second one, I think in the past, you have updated us on stats on sources of internal efficiency you have seen from GenAI-enabled capabilities. Any updates there? Any sort of learnings on friction points that also need to be overcome for some of these internal tools with GenAI? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Brian. Let me start with the first one on agentic capabilities. Look, overall, we are definitely, in many ways, when we built our series of 2.5 models, particularly with Pro, etc., it is the direction where we are investing the most. There is definitely exciting progress, including in the models we haven't fully released yet. The main gaps we are all trying to do is, you are obviously chaining a sequence of events, and being able to do it reliably, the latency compounds, the cost compounds, and being able to do it reliably in a way for the users, all of this comes together. In each of this, we are making progress, and it all needs to kind of hang together.\nThe good news is we are making robust progress. We think we are at the frontier there. In all of these areas, when you look back in a 12-month basis, you end up making the models much more efficient for any given capability. The forward-looking trajectory, I think, will really unlock these agentic experiences. We see the potential. We are able to do them, but they're a bit slow and costly and take time and sometimes are brittle, right? They're making progress on all of that. I think that's what will really unlock. I expect 2026 to be the year in which people kind of use agentic experiences more broadly, right? It's an exciting opportunity ahead.\nOn the second part, I think when you say sources of internalization, I presume you're talking about how we are using all of this internally. Again, given you asked the question about agents, we are now beginning to roll out agentic coding journeys for our software engineers within the company. It's been exciting to see just over the last few months, and particularly over the last few weeks, people are definitely doing more agentic workflows in software engineering as well internally.\nThat's a good example of the kind of—the same experiences a few months ago had a lot of friction points, but we are overcoming it, and people are beginning to use internally on the coding side, as well as in certain other areas of the company as well. Exciting progress. I expect it to be an active area where we will roll out journeys for our users as well. Look forward to it.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks, Sundar. That's great.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. Sundar, I have two for you. At I/O, you announced a partnership with Warby Parker to develop glasses. I wonder if you could share your view of how important a cycle of new devices will be to further scale AI. Do you envision a world in which the most functional or essential to our consumer experience? That's one. Secondly, how does Google Search with AI Mode usage differ versus Gemini standalone apps? I'm wondering, do you see any differences in usage or the types of consumers who go to the app versus who go to traditional search with AI? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Michael. On the first thing, look, I think anytime I/O changes, you can drive new experiences, including on hardware experiences too. I think AI will particularly enable—we've long had the promise of glasses and other form factors, but I think AI will spur a whole new wave of innovation there. We are super excited about our investment in glasses and found the experiences have taken a dramatic step up compared to the last iteration.\nI think it'll be an exciting new emerging category, but I still expect phones to be at the center of the experience for the next two to three years at least. I still think that's going to be phones would continue to be at the center of the consumer experience. We are excited about the emerging categories as well.\nOn your second question on AI mode versus Gemini standalone app, broadly, there are some use cases where you can get a great experience in both places, but there are use cases which are very specific. I think where the queries are information-oriented, but people really want to rely on the information, but have the full power of AI, I think AI mode really shines in that. You can go there and you know it's backed up. The Gemini models are using search deeply as a tool, and so it's all grounded in that search experience. I think users are responding very positively to it.\nWhereas in the Gemini standalone app, you see everything from people can have a long conversational chat just trying to pass time, right, in the Gemini app. You've seen early cases where people may get into it in a therapy-like experience, right? These are all emerging experiences of what people do. I think this is why I'm glad we have both surfaces and we can innovate in both of these areas. Of course, there'll be areas which will be commonly served by both applications, and over time, I think we can make the experience more seamless for our users.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks, Sundar.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Shmulik\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. Sundar, it seems there's almost like a daily news report about the AI talent war and high-profile folks moving around, what's kind of like your perspective and how you think Google's been doing it, both kind of attracting and retaining key AI talent? Along with similar lines, how do we think about AI-related resourcing costs alongside kind of the step-up in capital investments required to go build for AI? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMark, on the first question, look, I think we've gone through these moments before. We've obviously always deeply invested in talent, including AI talent, for well over a decade now. I think we have an extraordinary both breadth and depth of the talent. In my experience, the top people look for a combination of they want to really be at the frontier driving progress, and so the mission and how state-of-the-art your workers matter. That's super important to them, access to compute resources, and access to your peers, right, working with the best people in the industry. It's a combination of all of that and using it to drive impact. I think we are pretty competitive on all those fronts.\nThrough this moment, we continue to, I look at both our retention metrics as well as the new talent coming in, and both are healthy. I do know individual cases can make headlines, but when we look at numbers deeply, I think we are doing very well through this moment. We'll continue investing in the people, the talent, and the compute needed to make sure we are set up well for the opportunity ahead. Maybe I'll pass it on to Anat.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nYeah, the question on how we integrate this into our overall cost structure. I've mentioned before, the benefit of having the full stack includes research, which is our people, and one of our most critical resources. We make sure that we invest appropriately to have the best and brightest minds in the industry sitting here at Google and advancing our innovation to customers. It is part of what you're seeing now in our operating expense line across the organization. We're also working hard to offset not just growth and investment across the business, but also to ensure that we can allocate resources appropriately.\nSundar mentioned earlier the use of AI tools within the company. That's another area where we can drive efficiency across the business, to use these tools internally in terms of how we run the organization. We're continuing on the same efforts that I've talked about before with regards to running the company with a high level of discipline and execution, and driving efficiency across the business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. If I can ask two, that'd be great. The first one's on search click-through rates as a driver of monetization. You guys have done a great job over the past decade of driving better ad relevancy and higher click-through rates in search. Just curious, as we look forward and we see lower ad impressions per SERP and all these things that are changing with AI Overviews and different AI search formats, how do you feel about your ability to drive CTR going forward? The second question is, it looks like you're now working with OpenAI for some aspect of cloud infrastructure. Just curious how that relationship might expand in the future. Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet",
    "content2": "I can take the first one. Look, specifically referring to the AI Overviews, if I understood your question correctly. Sundar mentioned it. They continue to drive higher satisfaction. They continue to drive higher search users. They're scaling up very nicely. They're actually working for our entire user base now, scaled to over 2 billion users in over 200 countries. Very happy with this development.\nWhen it comes specifically to the monetization of it, we talked about it before.We see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a really strong base on which we can then innovate and drive actually more innovative and new and next-generation ad formats. That's how we look at it at this moment in time.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nOn the second part, with respect to OpenAI, look, we are very excited to be partnering with them on Google Cloud. Google Cloud is an open platform, and we have a strong history of supporting great companies, startups, AI labs, etc. Super excited about our partnership there on the cloud side. We look forward to investing more in that relationship and growing it there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nOkay. Two questions, please. First, could you just describe, maybe, Philipp, what you see in terms of the ad environment, maybe for the back half of the year, maybe versus last year? Does it seem as certain or as uncertain as it was last year? The results seem pretty strong. Are there any unusual concerns you would have for the back half of the year?\nThen, Sundar, I want to ask you again about the two surfaces approach to search. You obviously got some, you must have some internal metrics that tell you that that's the optimal way for you to approach the market. I'm sure there's a counterargument that just having that unified search and being able to discern the intent of the search, whether it's pure information or commercial just from the query, that could give you a material advantage over other offerings in the market. Just talk a little bit about what metrics you've seen that make the two-surface solution seem to be optimal. Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nLet me start. Look, we said our ad business performed strongly in Q2. Give you maybe some vertical color of it. In Q2, search and other performance was led by growth across all verticals. We mentioned the largest contributions from retail and financial services, which was primarily due actually to strength in insurance. We saw healthcare as a sizable contributor to growth as well. Look, we're only a few weeks into Q3, so I think it's really too early to comment on anything happening in the second half of the year.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMark, on the second part of the question. Look, I think between these two surfaces, you pretty much are covering the entire breadth and depth of what humanity can possibly do. I think there's plenty for two surfaces to tackle at this moment. Obviously, you are right, Search is more information-focused, and we think of the Gemini app as more your assistant, a more personal, proactive, and powerful assistant for every aspect of your daily life. You can imagine wanting to code deeply or create a long video, etc. Those things can be done by the Gemini app today better.\nOver time, like we've always done, we've gone through these evolutions before. Like as you point out, we can understand user intent better and abstract some of the complexity for our users. At one point, people used to query separately for text, differently from images, differently from videos, etc., and we kind of made it all seamless with universal search. We have the experience of being able to bring together experiences in a way that makes sense for users and do the heavy lifting for them.\nI think when you're in this early stage of new emerging paradigms, we want to make sure we can meet them, what they are expecting today. Over time, I think it'll give us an opportunity to serve them better. I think that's how we are thinking about it.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much. Two if I may, please. The first on cloud, I'm just hoping maybe you could clarify your back half outlook. Given last quarter, you talked about some supply constraints that would ease towards the end of 2025, but yet you put up a really nice acceleration in Q2. Now you're talking about some supply constraints easing into 2026. If you could just clarify a little bit on the back half outlook for cloud, given the strong results in Q2.\nThe second is a bigger picture question, which is, an agentic experience. Does it democratize the web like search did two decades ago. Enabling discovery in the long tail, or does it lead to more concentration with a smaller group of vertical winners? Would love it if you could opine on that. Thank you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nOkay. On your first question on the cloud, second half outlook and the comments I previously made on, with regards to where we're going to see the capacity increase. Obviously, we're working hard to bring more capacity online, which means data centers and servers are coming online. We see more of an increase towards the back end of the year, but we're increasing capacity with every quarter that goes by, as you can see with the growth rates we've had both this quarter and the previous quarter.\nAs Sundar mentioned earlier, this is not the type of investment that's a light switch. It takes time to make this investment. What you're seeing now is investment we made some time ago that's now translating to additional capacity coming online, but more of that towards the back end of the year. I will say it's important, as you think about cloud growth, not to think about this in a linear fashion because the quarter-on-quarter growth rates could depend on the timing of capacity delivery and when that comes online, s that could move a little bit from quarter to quarter.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, on agentic experience, look, I think there was an earlier question on the technology aspects of it and how we are making progress. Obviously, there is the value proposition for all the players involved, and I think that's going to be an equally important thing to create the unlock here. I do think over time, users will, it's clear to me, as we make progress on the agentic experience, it's going to be a much better experience for users, right? You'll find savvier players leaning into these experiences, and that'll help them grow and meet this moment. I think, so I do think it's an opportunity for some of the players.\nYou are right, just like the early days of the web, there are aspects about it which will expand access, grow the use cases, etc., and I think that elements are there. I do think it's important, it's not just a technology play, but we have to solve the business models for the varying players involved, and I think that's going to be an important part of this evolution as well.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. A couple for Sundar. First, looks like the subscription businesses are all tracking well. Certainly, Gemini 2.5 has got some much good reviews. How are you doing with Gemini subscriptions? I know it's a focus area for the company, and anything you can kind of do to accelerate the consumer subscriptions of Gemini within Google One. Secondly, just on the course change of CapEx, obviously a bigger increase, which appears to be because of cloud demand. Just your comments on cloud ROI and, I'm sorry, CapEx ROI, what gives you confidence that you're going to get good returns on that spend? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nGreat. Look, on the first thing on subscriptions. We've definitely, Google One has been an attractive value proposition powered by storage. Now, our AI plans, including both Pro and Ultra, and particularly with the 2.5 series of models, we have definitely seen accelerated traction. It was a very healthy quarter, and we are definitely excited about the opportunities ahead. You will find through this moment, I think we'll be able to drive growth in that area based on our AI offerings. It's definitely an area we are both excited by, and we are actually seeing traction, particularly in the last quarter ever since we introduced 2.5 Pro. We are excited about the trajectory there.\nOn the CapEx on the cloud side, look, I think we are definitely investing because we are delivering a lot of value through our cloud offerings. I think it's important to understand, as we build more and more of an install base with Google Cloud, we have very high customer satisfaction. Our churn rates are very low, and we are much more efficient in the investments needed to grow those lines of businesses.\nYou're seeing all that play out in our margin trajectory, particularly if you look at it annually, sequentially over the past few years. All that gives us confidence as we are investing in this. We'll be able to have a healthy ROI on our investments. Particularly in this AI moment, there's definitely the value we are delivering to the customers is also growing pretty significantly on a forward-looking basis. I think all that will help us do well here.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2025 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during this session, you will need to press star one on your telephone. I would now like to hand the conference over to our speaker today, Jim Friedland, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Anat Ashkenazi. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\nActual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\nI'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our strong results this quarter. We continue to see healthy growth and momentum across the business, including AI powering new features. In Search, we saw continued double-digit revenue growth. AI Overviews is going very well with over 1.5 billion users per month, and we are excited by the early positive reaction to AI Mode.\nThere's a lot more to come ahead. In subscriptions, we surpassed 270 million, with YouTube and Google One as key drivers. Cloud grew rapidly with significant demand for our solutions, and you saw our leadership in AI at Cloud Next across infrastructure, agents, and more. Our differentiated full-stack approach to AI continues to be central to our growth.\nThis quarter was super exciting as we rolled out Gemini 2.5, our most intelligent AI model, which is achieving breakthroughs in performance, and it's widely recognized as the best model in the industry. That's an extraordinary foundation for our future innovation. We are focused on bringing this to people and customers everywhere. Looking ahead to I/O, Brandcast, and Google Marketing Live, I can't wait for our teams to showcase the innovations they've been working on.\nTurning to our AI progress this quarter, which continues to enable significant growth opportunities, the elements of the AI stack I've previously mentioned are AI infrastructure, world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms. Starting with AI infrastructure, our long-term investments in our global network have positioned us well. Google's network is robust and resilient, supported by over 2 million miles of fiber and 33 subsea cables.\nComplementing this, we offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs, and continue to invest in next-generation capabilities. Ironwood, our seventh-generation TPU and most powerful to date, is the first designed specifically for inferenced scale. It delivers more than 10x improvement in compute power over our recent high-performance TPU, while being nearly twice as power efficient. A strong relationship with NVIDIA continues to be a key advantage for us and our customers.\nWe were the first cloud provider to offer NVIDIA's groundbreaking B200 and GB200 Blackwell GPUs, and will be offering their next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs. Second, this infrastructure powers our world-class research, including our industry-leading models. We released Gemini 2.5 Pro last month, receiving extremely positive feedback from both developers and consumers. 2.5 Pro is state-of-the-art on a wide range of benchmarks, and debuted at number one on the Chatbot Arena by a significant margin.\n2.5 Pro achieved big leaps in reasoning, coding, science, and math capabilities, opening up new possibilities for developers and customers. Active users in AI Studio and Gemini API have grown over 200% since the beginning of the year. Last week, we introduced 2.5 Flash, which enables developers to optimize quality and cost. Our latest image and video generation models, Imagen 3 and Veo 2, are rolling out broadly, and are powering incredible creativity.\nTurning to open models, we launched Gemma 3 last month, delivering state-of-the-art performance for its size. Gemma models have been downloaded more than 140 million times. Lastly, we are developing AI models in new areas where there's enormous opportunity. For example, our new Gemini robotics models. In health, we launched AI Co-Scientist, a multi-agent AI research system, while AlphaFold has now been used by over 2.5 million researchers. Third, turning to products and platforms.\nAll 15 of our products with half a billion users now use Gemini models. Android and Pixel are two examples of how we are putting the best AI in people's hands, making it super easy to use AI for a wide range of tasks just by using their camera, voice, or taking a screenshot. We are upgrading Google Assistant on mobile devices to Gemini, and later this year, we'll upgrade tablets, cars, and devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches.\nThe Pixel 9A launched to very strong reviews, providing the best of Google's AI offerings like Gemini Live and AI-powered camera features. Gemini Live camera and screen sharing is now rolling out to all Android devices, including Pixel and Samsung S25. Now, moving on to key highlights from across Search, Cloud, YouTube, and Waymo. First, Search.\nAI is one of the most revolutionary technologies for enabling and expanding our information mission. For Search, we see it growing the number and types of questions we can answer. We are already seeing this with AI Overviews, which now has more than 1.5 billion users every month. Nearly a year after we launched AI Overviews in the US, we continue to see that usage growth is increasing as people learn that Search is more useful for more of their queries.\nWe are leaning in heavily here, continuing to roll the feature out in new countries, to more users, and to more queries. Building on the positive feedback for AI Overviews, in March, we released AI Mode, an experiment in labs. It expands what AI Overviews can do with more advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities to help with questions that need further exploration and comparisons.\nOn average, AI Mode queries are twice as long as traditional search queries. We're getting really positive feedback from early users about its design, fast response time, and ability to understand complex, nuanced questions. We also continue to see significant growth in multimodal queries. Circle to Search is now available on more than 250 million devices, with usage increasing nearly 40% this quarter. Monthly visual searches with Lens have increased by 5 billion since October.\nMoving on to Cloud. At Cloud Next, we announced major innovations, and over 500 companies shared the business results they are achieving by working with us. We provide leading cost, performance, and reliability for AI training and inference. This enables us to deliver the best value for AI leaders like any scale and contextual AI, as well as global brands like Verizon.\nFor highly sensitive data and regulatory requirements, Google Distributed Cloud and our sovereign AI make Gemini available on premises or in-country. Our Vertex AI platform makes over 200 foundation models available, helping customers like Lowe's integrate AI. We offer industry-leading models, including Gemini 2.5 Pro, 2.5 Flash, Imagen 3, Veo 2, Chirp, and Lyria, plus open-source and third-party models like Llama 4 and Anthropic. We are the leading cloud solution for companies looking to the new era of AI agents, a big opportunity.\nOur Agent Development Kit is a new open-source framework to simplify the process of building sophisticated AI agents and multi-agent systems. An Agent Designer is a low-code tool to build AI agents and automate tasks in over 100 enterprise applications and systems. We are putting AI agents in the hands of employees at major global companies like KPMG.\nWith Google Agent Space, employees can find and synthesize information from within their organization, converse with AI agents, and take action with their enterprise applications. It combines enterprise search, conversational AI or chat, and access to Gemini and third-party agents. We also offer prepackaged agents across customer engagement, coding, creativity, and more, that are helping to provide conversational customer experiences, accelerate software development, and improve decision-making.\nOf course, Google Workspace delivers more than 2 billion AI assets monthly, including summarizing Gmail and refining docs. Lastly, our cybersecurity products are helping organizations detect, investigate, and respond to cybersecurity threats. Our expertise, coupled with integrated Gemini AI advances, detects malware, prioritizes threats, and speeds up investigative workflows. This quarter, we were excited to announce our intent to acquire Wiz, a leading cloud security platform that protects all major clouds and code environments.\nTogether, we can make it easier and faster for organizations of all types and sizes to protect themselves end-to-end and across all major clouds. We think this will help spur more multi-cloud computing, something customers want. Next, YouTube. Yesterday marked a historic milestone, the 20th anniversary of the first video uploaded to YouTube. From that single 19-second upload, the platform has grown into a global phenomenon, fundamentally changing how billions of people create, share, and experience content.\nThrough all this growth, subscriptions are now a big part of the business. We continue to diversify subscription options, recently expanding our premium-like pilot to the US, giving users a new way to enjoy most videos on YouTube ad-free. TV is the primary device for YouTube viewing in the US. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been number one in streaming watch time in the US for the last two years.\nYouTube now has over 1 billion monthly active podcast users. YouTube Music and Premium reached over 125 million subscribers, including trials, globally. Finally, Waymo is now safely serving over a quarter of a million paid passenger trips each week. That's up 5x from a year ago. This past quarter, Waymo opened up paid service in Silicon Valley. Through our partnership with Uber, we expanded in Austin and are preparing for our public launch in Atlanta later this summer.\nWe recently announced Washington, DC, as a future ride-hailing city going live in 2026 alongside Miami. Waymo continues progressing on two important capabilities for riders: airport access and freeway driving. Thanks to all of our employees for their work this quarter. It was a great start to the year, and Q2 will be even more exciting.\nWith that, Philipp, over to you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for the quarter and then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube, and partnerships. Google Services revenues were $77 billion US dollar for the quarter, up 10% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.\nTo add some further color to the performance, the 10% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services, primarily due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube saw a similar performance across verticals. Its 10% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response, followed by brand. Let's start with Search, where we've seen robust growth in revenues. All around the world, over 2 billion people use Search every day to find information, compare products, or shop. There are more than 5 trillion searches on Google annually.\nWe've continued our efforts to help more people ask entirely new questions, bringing more opportunities for businesses to connect with consumers. As we've mentioned before, with the launch of AI Overviews, the volume of commercial queries has increased. Q1 marked our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions.\nThe feature is now available in more than 15 languages across 140 countries. For AI Overviews overall, we continue to see monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more. Turning to visual queries, on the last earnings call, I mentioned the success we're seeing with Lens, where shoppers use their camera or images to quickly find information in ways they couldn't before.\nIn Q1, the number of people shopping on Lens grew by over 10%, and the majority of Lens queries are incremental. Sundar mentioned the significant growth we're also seeing with Circle to Search as multimodality continues to drive queries across Search. Moving to ads, more businesses, big and small, are adopting AI-powered campaigns, and the deployment of AI across our ads business is driving results for our customers and for our business.\nThroughout 2024, we launched several features that leverage LLMs to enhance advertiser value, and we're seeing this work pay off. The combination of these launches now allows us to match ads to more relevant search queries, and this helps advertisers reach customers and searchers where we would not previously have shown their ads.\nFocusing on our customers, we continue to solve advertisers' pain points and find opportunities to help them create, distribute, and measure more performant ads, infusing AI at every step of the marketing process. On audience insights, we released new asset audience recommendations, which tell businesses the themes that resonate most with their top audiences. On creatives, advertisers can now generate a broader variety of lifestyle imagery customized to their business to better engage their customers, and use them across PMax, Demand Gen, Display, and app campaigns.\nAdditionally, in PMax, advertisers can automatically source images from their landing pages and crop them, increasing the variety of their assets. On media buying, advertisers continue to see how AI-powered campaigns help them find new customers. In Demand Gen, advertisers can more precisely manage ad placements across YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Google Display Network globally, and understand which assets work best at a channel level.\nThanks to dozens of AI-powered improvements launched in 2024, businesses using Demand Gen now see an average 26% year-on-year increase in conversions per dollar spent for goals like purchases and leads. When using Demand Gen with product feed, on average, they see more than double the conversion per dollar spent year over year. As an example, Royal Canin combined Demand Gen and PMax campaigns to find more customers for its cat and dog food products.\nThe integration resulted in a 2.7x higher conversion rate, a 70% lower cost per acquisition for purchases, and increased the value per user by 8%. Turning to YouTube, we saw strong growth in revenues across ads and subscriptions. This week, we're celebrating YouTube's 20th anniversary. We're proud of its leadership as a streaming destination where people come to watch everything they love, from live sports and creator-produced content to shorts and podcasts.\nCreators are what drives viewership, and on average, they upload 20 million videos a day to YouTube. Our biggest creators generate a level of fandom and viewer engagement around large cultural moments on YouTube that brands can't find anywhere else. During March Madness, brands aligned not only with clips and highlights from the game, but also with the creators who drive basketball culture, like Jesser and The Ringer's J. Kyle Mann.\nIn Q1, the growth of our reservation-based ads business more than doubled year over year. Brands and creators continue to use the opportunities that collaborations and partnerships offer. Toyota worked with Zach King, the king of short magical videos, with over 42 million followers to take over his channel. The creator takeover and accompanying creator ad lifted Toyota's brand awareness by 25% compared to a control group, and 9% compared to the Toyota brand ad.\nLooking at Shorts, engaged views grew by over 20% in the first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making globally in Shorts monetization relative to in-stream viewing, and are particularly encouraged by the trend in the US. As always, I'll wrap up with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where customers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of what Google has to offer.\nFor instance, Roblox is partnering with Google Ad Manager to bring immersive ads to gamers. Gen Z gamers are Roblox's biggest users, and thanks to our partnership, advertisers will be able to reach this audience with ads that blend seamlessly into the gaming experience. We also launched a YouTube Shorts effect to help people release iconic Roblox heads and inspire fans to create content at scale.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success, and to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSVP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless they state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary on our outlook for the second quarter in 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q1.\nConsolidated revenues of $90.2 billion US dollar increased by 12%, or 14% in constant currency. Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices, and Google Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter, reflecting strong momentum across the business. Total cost of revenue was $36.4 billion US dollar, up 8%. Tech was $13.7 billion US dollar, up 6%.\nWe continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growth at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have a much higher tech rate, declined. Other costs of revenue was $22.6 billion US dollar, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, largely for YouTube, followed by depreciation and other technical infrastructure operations costs. Total operating expenses increased 9% to $23.3 billion US dollar.\nR&D investments increased by 14%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 4%, primarily reflecting a decline in compensation expenses. G&A expenses increased by 17%, reflecting the impact of charges for legal and other matters. Operating income increased 20% this quarter to $31 billion US dollar, and operating margin increased to 33.9%, representing 2.3 points of margin expansion.\nOperating margin benefited from healthy revenue growth, a moderated pace of compensation growth, and a favorable mix shift towards lower tech advertising revenues, partially offset by a year-on-year increase in depreciation expenses of just over $1 billion US dollar. Other income and expenses was $11.2 billion US dollar, primarily due to unrealized gain on our non-marketable equity securities related to our investment in a private company, which we noted on our 10-K as a subsequent event.\nNet income increased 46% to $34.5 billion US dollar, and earnings per share increased 49% to $2.81 US dollar. We delivered free cash flow of $19 billion US dollar in the first quarter and $74.9 billion US dollar for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $95 billion US dollar in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results, Google Services revenues increased 10% to $77.3 billion US dollar, reflecting strength in Google Search and YouTube advertising as subscription.\nGoogle Search and other advertising revenues increased by 10% to $50.7 billion US dollar. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by financial services, primarily due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenues increased 10% to $8.9 billion US dollar, driven by direct response advertising, followed by brand.\nNetwork advertising of $7.3 billion US dollar was down 2%. Subscription platforms and device revenues increased 19% to $10.4 billion US dollar, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues. The growth was primarily driven by YouTube subscription offering, followed by Google One, with growth in the number of subscribers being the biggest driver of revenue growth. Google Services operating income increased 17% to $32.7 billion US dollar, and operating margin increased from 39.6% to 42.3%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter, revenue increased by 28% to $12.3 billion US dollar in the first quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core and AI products at a rate that was much higher than Cloud's overall revenue growth rate. Growth in Google Workspace was primarily driven by an increase in average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased to $2.2 billion US dollar, and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.8%. As we scale our fleet, we continue to focus on driving improvements in productivity, efficiency, and utilization to offset the growth in expenses, particularly from higher depreciation. As for Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $450 million US dollar, and operating loss was $1.2 billion US dollar.\nThe year-on-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment received in the first quarter of 2024 for one of our other bets. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $17.2 billion US dollar, primarily reflecting investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind.\nIn Q1, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15.1 billion US dollar in share purchases and $2.4 billion US dollar in dividend payments. As we announced today, our board of directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend, and also approved a new $70 billion US dollar share purchase authorization.\nTurning to our outlook, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in the second quarter and the remainder of 2025. In terms of revenue, I'll highlight a couple of items that we mentioned last quarter that will have an impact on second quarter and 2025 revenue.\nFirst, in Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experienced in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. In Cloud, we're in a tight demand-supply environment, and given that revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in Cloud revenue growth rates depending on capacity deployment each quarter. We expect relatively higher capacity deployment towards the end of 2025.\nMoving to investment, starting with our expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025, we still expect to invest approximately $75 billion US dollar in CapEx this year. The expected CapEx investment level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to the impact of changes in the timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, as I mentioned on our previous earnings call, the significant increase in our investments in CapEx over the past few years will continue to put pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation.\nIn the first quarter, we saw 31% year-on-year growth in depreciation from the increase in technical infrastructure assets placed in service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate throughout 2025.\nSecond, as we've previously said, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas. As we've disclosed previously, due to a shift in the timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation award beginning in 2023, our first quarter stock-based comp expenses is relatively lower compared to the remaining quarters of the year.\nIn conclusion, as you heard from Sundar and Philipp, we're pleased with the progress we're making across the organization, the results for the quarter, and the opportunities ahead. Our success as a company is grounded in our experience driving advancements in deep computer science that enables us to create innovative new products and services for users, businesses, and partners around the world.\nWe have a strong track record of incubating and then building these offerings into new, profitable businesses for Alphabet. As we announced last quarter, YouTube and Cloud exited 2024 at a combined annual run rate of $110 billion US dollar. As you heard from Sundar earlier, Waymo is continuing to progress in building on its impressive technological achievements to scale rapidly and develop a sustainable business model.\nThank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated.\nOur first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on sort of the macro advertising backdrop, maybe Anat, I know it's April 2024, and you call out some factors as you're kind of thinking about the second quarter. Any other factors you're seeing in advertising verticals, or regions, or categories that could be showing any signs of weakness quarter to date? We should think through any other changes from typical seasonality into Q2 2025 versus prior quarters.\nThe second one, on Philipp, I think I heard you mention how the volume of commercial queries has increased. Maybe can you just walk us through which of the products are driving that increase in commercial queries? As you sort of think about the pipeline of search products, are there any others that you're particularly excited about to kind of continue to drive further commercial query growth throughout 2025, 2026? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nLet me take the first one as well. We saw broad-based strength across ad verticals in Q1, and we saw it. To give you a bit of vertical color here, Search was led again by finance, primarily due to ongoing strength in the insurance, retail, healthcare, and travel were actually also sizable contributors here to growth. With regard to Q2, we're only a few weeks in, so it's really too early to comment.\nI mean, we're obviously not immune to the macro environment, but we wouldn't want to speculate about potential impacts beyond noting that the changes to the de minimis exemption will obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from APAC-based retailers.\nMaybe to zoom out, I would say we have a lot of experience in managing through uncertain times, and we focus on helping our customers by providing deep insights into changing consumer behavior that is relevant to their business. Examples are auction dynamics, query trend insights on topics like replacement purchases, and so on. We have a lot of experience in this area.\nOn the commercial query side, look, AI Overviews continue to drive higher satisfaction and search usage. As I noticed, Q1 was really our largest expansion to date for AI Overviews, both in terms of launching to new users and providing responses for more questions. That's really the core already of the answer. AI Overviews sits at the center of your question here. When it comes to other products, look, I don't want to speculate on this, but we're happy with what we're seeing here on AI Overviews, and I'm confident we can expand this to more products over time.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nManaging Director of Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the questions. Philipp, maybe just to go back to AI Overviews for a moment, could you just tell us how we should think about the 1.5 billion AI Overviews users just in terms of breadth of rollout? I know you're saying monetization at approximately the same rate, but what does that mean in terms of click-through rates and conversion? Then, Anat, just curious if there have been any changes to Google's approach to durably re-engineering the cost base since you've joined? If macro weakens and we see more of a slowdown, would you expect to find additional opportunities to cut back more on costs? Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nYeah. Look, on the ads in AI Overviews, late last year, actually, we launched them within the AI Overviews on mobile in the US, and this builds on our previous rollout of ads above and below. This was a change we have. As I talked about it before, for AI Overviews overall, we see the monetization at approximately the same rate, which gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more. I'm very happy with this. I don't think this is the moment to go into the details of click-through rates, conversion, and so on. Overall, we're happy with what we're seeing.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSVP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nTo your question on our approach to productivity and efficiency, it hasn't really changed. I've mentioned my approach and our approach as a company at the end of 2024, and we're still focused on driving efficiency and productivity throughout the organization, both in our operating expenses and in our CapEx. I've mentioned some of these during my prepared remarks, but certainly this helps us as we think about the investments we need to make in innovation to drive long-term, sustainable growth profile for the company.\nWe're able to repurpose some of these efficiencies into these investments, as well as if you think about the increase in CapEx we've seen over the past several years and what we're investing this year, this will put additional pressure on the income statement in the form of depreciation. We're working hard to try and offset some of the headwinds, as well as within the CapEx investments themselves. $75 billion US dollar, we're looking at how do we make sure every dollar is used efficiently.\nWe have a highly rigorous process to determine the demand behind it, and then the allocation of the compute associated with our technical infrastructure investments, ensuring that we're utilizing that appropriately, and that we're highly efficient with everything we're doing. You've seen some of the announcement and some of the changes, but we're focusing on continuing to moderate the pace of compensation growth, looking at our real estate footprint, and again, the buildout and utilization of our technical infrastructure across the business.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nManaging Director of Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director of Technology Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you for taking the questions. First, maybe for Sundar, when you look across the consumer AI landscape today, how are you thinking about continuing to drive differentiation for Gemini as a platform through the lens of usage, utility, or putting product innovation at the forefront of driving consumer habits?\nThe second one, maybe for Anat, if the macro environment were to change and become more downwardly volatile, how should investors think about the investments that are must-make this year, almost fixed in nature, versus where there might be more flexibility to alter the investment priorities of the company if the macro environment were to worsen? Thank you so much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Eric. Obviously, it's an exciting moment on the AI front. I think the foundation for everything is obviously the frontier model progress we are seeing, and particularly with 2.5 Pro and Flash, I think we're well positioned. We are seeing tremendous reception from developers, enterprises, and consumers too. Obviously, we are delivering consumer AI experiences across our product portfolio, including the primary way people experience it, which is obviously in Search with AI Overviews, and very early days with AI Mode, but that will be a consumer AI-forward experience.\nWe're already seeing very positive feedback. People are typing in roughly 2x longer queries compared to traditional Search, so there's a lot of excitement there. In the Gemini app, which you asked about, we've really seen increased momentum, particularly over the last few weeks as we've rolled out not just the newer models, but we are seeing users are really responding well to all the innovation. Gemini Live, which is based on Project Astra, has been very well received.\nDeep Research, I think, based on 2.5 Pro is SOTA, and that's been well received. Canvas, we've had a lot of traction as well. We are definitely investing more. We have recently organized ourselves better to capitalize on this momentum, and I'm excited about our roadmap there.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSVP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nOn the investments this year and overall, should there be any macroeconomic changes? As I said, we're still planning to invest approximately $75 billion US dollar in CapEx this year. We do see a tremendous opportunity ahead of us across the organization, whether it's to support Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. Recall, I've stated on the Q4 call that we exited the year in cloud specifically with more customer demand than we had capacity. That was the case this quarter as well. We want to make sure we ramp up to support customer needs and customer demands.\nHaving said that, we're investing in long-term, and we're investing in innovation. That's the essence of our business, and we want to do it in a responsible fashion. You've seen us over the past couple of years, and we're continuing to do this, and you're seeing this in our results drive efficiency and productivity throughout the business. We've announced things such as consolidation of teams, which helps not just with cost, but with velocity and speed.\nWe're able to get things to market faster. That's one of the areas we're focused on. You heard from Sundar at the last couple of calls on just the rapid pace of innovation we're bringing to the marketplace. The way we're doing this across the business to drive productivity and efficiency should help us have a more resilient organization irrespective of macroeconomic condition. Certainly, we don't ignore that. We always look at what's happening outside the organization as well as inside, but invest appropriately to drive both the short-term growth, as well as the long-term growth.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director of Technology Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. One for Sundar, one for Philipp. Sundar, it was disclosed this week in the trial that's going on that Gemini has 35 million DAUs. Just curious, that number obviously trails ChatGPT by a pretty wide margin. Could you just talk about the strategy to get that DAU figure much higher that you guys are deploying? Philipp, just curious to hear what you're seeing on the brand advertising side at YouTube in Q1 and into early Q2. Are brands holding up relatively well, like direct response, or are they starting to react to some of these macro jitters that we're all experiencing? Any thoughts there? Thank you very much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Ross. I think I touched upon this to Eric's question as well. We are definitely, I think there's been a lot of momentum in terms of product features we've been introducing, and we are definitely seeing reception, including increased adoption and usage based on those features. I think we are in a good, positive cycle. The recent advances on the model frontier, by many metrics, I think we have the best model out there now, and I think that's going to drive increased adoption as well.\nAgain, I would reiterate, people are using, obviously, we have 1.5 billion users through AI Overviews interacting with AI in a deep way, in a very engaged way. Obviously, we are innovating with AI Mode, and we have a very exciting roadmap ahead with the Gemini app as well. Across the board, super excited about what's ahead.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nOn your brand question, look, brand, and by the way, also direct response had very solid growth in Q1. Brand advertisers really enjoyed cultural moments we had, like Coachella, for example, or March Madness. We had strong contributions overall from the finance and retail verticals in Q1 on this side as well.\nThe operating metrics for YouTube were strong in Q1. Watch time growth remains robust, particularly in key monetization opportunity areas such as Shorts and living room. It's also, by the way, nice to see the strong position of our creators who obviously benefit from the brand piece, which gives us a lot of confidence when we look at it more closely. On the Q2 side, I think I mentioned it's too early to really comment on that.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Mark Shmulik from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Shmulik\n\nSenior Internet Equity Research Analyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. Sundar, I appreciate the color on Gemini deployment across the 15 products with half a billion users or more. It would be great to hear more about where you're seeing the most usage and deployment of GenAI internally at Google, perhaps whether the capabilities are in a place today in terms of either supplementing or augmenting the workforce. Just to build on that earlier AI mode type questions, appreciate AI mode has 2x longer queries than traditional search. Any color you can share perhaps on how AI mode behavior differs from how consumers are using the Gemini app? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, internally, I mean, this has been an extraordinary amount of focus and excitement, both because I think the early use cases have been transformative in nature, and I think this still feels like early days and a long way to go. Obviously, I had mentioned a few months ago in terms of how we are using AI for coding. We are continuing to make a lot of progress there in terms of people using coding suggestions.\nI think the last time I had said the number was like 25% of code that's checked in involves people accepting AI-suggested solutions. That number is well over 30% now. More importantly, we have deployed more deeper flows, and particularly with the newer models, I think we are working on early agentic workflows and how we can get those coding experiences to be much deeper.\nWe are deploying it across all parts of the company. Our customer service teams are deeply leading the way there. We've both dramatically enhanced our user experience, as well as made it much more efficient to do so. We are actually bringing all our learnings and expertise in our solutions through Cloud to our other customers.\nBeyond that, all the way from the finance team preparing for this earnings call to everything, it's deeply embedded in everything we do. I still see it as early days, and there's going to be a lot more to do. On AI Mode, look, I think we are just leaning in on the early positive feedback as we scale up AI Overviews. It's been one of our most positive launches, and it's been clear people have wanted even more of it.\nWith AI mode, we are bringing our state-of-the-art Gemini models right into search. I mentioned people typing in longer queries. There are a lot more complex, nuanced questions people are following through more. People are appreciating the clean design, the fast response time, and the fact that they can kind of be much more open-ended, can undertake more complicated tasks.\nProduct comparisons, for example, has been a positive one, exploring how-tos, planning a trip. Those are the kinds of early feedback we are seeing. I think we are obviously really focused on improving the product across all of AI mode, AI Overviews, and the Gemini app, and we are seeing positive user traction as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question is from Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director of Internet Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thanks. One for Anat and one for Sundar. Anat, getting back to a question I think that Doug was asking earlier on, you just put up record high or multi-year record high margins for both Google Services and for Google Cloud. You talk, though, about depreciation expenses accelerating rapidly throughout the year because of all the investments you've already warned people about.\nBack in the September quarter, you seemed relatively confident that you had enough levers to kind of offset kind of rising infrastructure costs. Was that still your six months later? Is that still your view that you've got enough levers that even with the rising infrastructure costs, there's enough in there to kind of counterbalance that?\nJust briefly on Waymo, that continues to rise aggressively, the numbers, Sundar. The long-term business model for Waymo, is there a reason to make a decision on that soon, or have you already made a decision on whether this is a long-term licensing model, or you really want to run this as a standalone ride-sharing delivery autonomous vehicle business? Thank you very much.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSVP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nThanks. On your first question on profitability and what levers do we have, and do we still have levers to pull, first, I think every organization can always push a little further. I don't view productivity goals or efficiency as an episodic, kind of project-based effort, but rather a continuous effort that, when you get to a certain place, you push a little further. Having said that, we do have significant investments we're making across the organization, and we have been making them for the past several quarters.\nWe've been able to do it because we were able to find efficiency to fund those investments across the organization. Those are for products and services that are going to drive long-term growth for the company. While we're trying to offset as much of the headwind associated with the increase in infrastructure costs, it will become more difficult. As I said, the depreciation will accelerate.\nWe had about a 31% year-over-year growth in depreciation this quarter, and it will be higher as we go throughout the year. Think about that kind of as a headwind that we have to manage against. We're continuing with pushing across the organization, leveraging, Sundar mentioned, the use of AI and kind of an AI-first Google across several of our functions to help us manage a larger scope of work using our AI, AI agents, and AI tools.\nAs Sundar mentioned, we did leverage it in preparation for the earnings call, and we're leveraging across several functions. There are opportunities, but there are also great opportunities for investment, and we want to make sure that we make room to make these investments to drive long-term growth and ensure we have a very resilient long-term growth profile for the company.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMark, thanks. I think this is probably the first question I've got on an earnings call on Waymo, so thank you, and I think it's a sign of its progress. Look, the thing that excites me is I think we've been laser-focused and will continue to be on building the world's best driver. I think doing that well really gives you a variety of optionality in business models across geographies, etc.\nIt'll also require a successful ecosystem of partners, and we can't possibly do it all ourselves. I'm excited about the progress the teams have made through a variety of partnerships. Obviously, a highlight of it is our partnership with Uber. We are very pleased with what we are already seeing in Austin in terms of rider satisfaction.\nWe look forward to offering the first paid rides in Atlanta via Uber later this year. We are also building up a network of partners, for example, for maintaining fleets of vehicles and doing all the operations related to that with the recently announced partnership with Move in Phoenix and Miami, obviously partnerships with OEMs. There are future optionality around personal ownership as well. We are widely exploring, but at the same time, clearly staying focused and making progress both in terms of safety, the driver experience, and progress on the business model and operationally scaling it up.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director of Internet Equity Research, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nKenneth Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director of Internet Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you too, if I may, please. First on AI-powered search. You have a number of AI-powered search interfaces, including three most prominently AI Overviews, AI Mode, and Gemini. In the future, should we think of these as distinct experiences that will be long-lasting or more experimental now, and Google will eventually focus on one approach going forward?\nThe second one is more on the financial side. You continue to experience very healthy gross margin expansion. We see the tech, sure, but Anat, you also talked about the offsetting depreciation expense. Could you talk about beyond those two buckets where you're seeing the real savings on the COGS line and driving that gross margin expansion, and maybe even how we should be thinking about that going forward? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nOkay. Now, maybe on AI-powered search and how do we see our consumer experience? Look, I do think search and Gemini obviously will be two distinct efforts, right? I think there are obviously some areas of overlap, but they're also exposed to very, very different use cases. For example, in Gemini, we see people iteratively coding and going much deeper on a coding workflow as an example. I think both will be around. Within search, I would think of AI Overviews as scaling up and working for our entire user base, but an AI Mode is the tip of the tree for us pushing forward on an AI-forward experience.\nThere will be things which we discover there which will make sense in the context of AI Overviews. I think we'll flow through to our user base. You almost want to think of what are the most advanced 1 million people using Search for, the most advanced 10 million people, and then how do 1.5 billion people use Search for? We want to innovate, and I think this allows us to do that. The true north through all of this is user feedback, user satisfaction, user experience. That will determine where this all works out in the future.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSVP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nTo your question on gross margin, a couple of trends to highlight there. I've mentioned this in the prepared remarks. You've seen improvement in tech that's really driven by the change in revenue mix with continued Search growth, and then network revenue declines. Network revenue has a much higher tech rate, so that mix is helping us from a gross margin perspective. Think about that as well. Now, we do have depreciation for technical infrastructure hits in two places, primarily in two places in the income statement.\nOne is in other costs of sales, and the rest is in R&D. It is in that line item that's impacting costs of sales. We've had some efficiencies there, and I did mention the improvement in our overall cost of headcount growth and compensation, kind of moderating those growth. That helps us as well, more than offsetting the depreciation increases in Q1. As I mentioned, this number will be higher in the coming quarters. Recall we said approximately $75 billion US dollar in CapEx, which is up from $55 billion US dollar or just over $50 billion US dollar last year. There is expected to be quite a significant increase in depreciation.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Ron Josey from Citi. Your line is now open.\n\nRonald Josey\n\nManaging Director of Internet Equity Research, Citigroup",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks for taking the question. Philipp, I wanted to touch a little bit more on your comments around direct response in YouTube. I think it's been improving and been a driver over the past couple of quarters. I'd love to hear more just about what's driving that. Is that the demand gen and integration with PMax? Or are users perhaps more involved on direct response now that short usage is rising? Would love your thoughts there. Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nYeah, I think this is a lot of different factors. Mostly, we continue to help our customers really using our AI-powered tools. You mentioned a few of them to drive performance. That's a very big one. As I mentioned before, we're also happy with the progress we're seeing on Shorts and closing the monetization gap here to the overall business, which is actually really nice to see, especially in the US. We're very happy with that.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nYeah. I'll just chime in to say YouTube just celebrated its 20th birthday, and we now have more than 20 billion videos on YouTube, and we get 20 million videos uploaded every day. I think it's a tremendous platform, and thanks to all the creators and users who have supported us there over the years.\n\nRonald Josey\n\nManaging Director of Internet Equity Research, Citigroup\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nSenior Director of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2025 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\nI'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter in Q4, driven by our leadership in AI and our unique full-stack approach. We are making dramatic progress across compute, model capabilities, and in driving efficiencies. We are rapidly shipping product improvements and seeing terrific momentum with consumer and developer usage. We are pushing the next frontiers from AI agents, reasoning, and deep research to state-of-the-art video, quantum computing, and more. The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. This is translating into product usage, revenue growth, and results. In search, AI Overviews are now available in more than 100 countries. They continue to drive higher satisfaction and search usage. Meanwhile, Circle to Search is now available on over 200 million Android devices.\nIn Cloud and YouTube, we said at the beginning of 2024 that we expected to exit the year at a combined annual revenue run rate of over $100 billion US dollars. We met that goal and ended the year at a run rate of $110 billion US dollars. We are set up well for continued growth. Today, I'll provide an update on our AI progress and how it's improving our core consumer products. I'll touch on Cloud, YouTube, platforms and devices, and Waymo. Let's start with AI. Last quarter, I outlined the three areas of our differentiated full-stack approach to AI innovation: our leading AI infrastructure, our world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring these innovations to people at scale. First, AI infrastructure. Our sophisticated global network of Cloud regions and data centers provides a powerful foundation for us and our customers, directly driving revenue.\nWe have a unique advantage because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models, and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving to developer productivity. In 2024, we broke ground on 11 new Cloud regions and data center campuses in places like South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and around the world. We also announced plans for seven new subsea cable projects, strengthening global connectivity. Our leading infrastructure is also among the world's most efficient. Google data centers deliver nearly 4x more computing power per unit of electricity compared to just five years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost, and performance we offer, are why organizations increasingly choose Google Cloud's platform. In fact, today, Cloud customers consume more than 8x the compute capacity for training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago.\nWe'll continue to invest in our Cloud business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand. Second, world-class research, including models. In December, we unveiled Gemini 2.0, our most capable AI model yet, built for the agentic era. We launched an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance. Flash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and tomorrow we are making 2.0 Flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model updates. Stay tuned. Late last year, we also debuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash thinking model. The progress to scale thinking has been super fast, and the reviews so far have been extremely positive. We are working on even better thinking models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon.\nGemini 2.0's advances in multimodality and native tool use enable us to build new agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant. One early example is Deep Research. It uses agentic capabilities to explore complex topics on your behalf and give key findings, along with sources. It launched in Gemini Advanced in December and is rolling out to Android users all over the world. We are seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on iOS last November. We have opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner, which can understand and reason across information on a browser screen to complete tasks, and Project Astra. We expect to bring features from both to the Gemini app later this year. We are also excited by the progress of our video and image generation models.\nVeo 2, our state-of-the-art video generation model, and Imagen 3, our highest quality text-to-image model. These generative media models, as well as Gemini, consistently top industry leaderboards, and score top marks across industry benchmarks. That's why more than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just six months ago. We continue to drive research breakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications. This technology holds so much promise, which is why there was real excitement around this breakthrough. Third, our products and platforms put AI into the hands of billions of people around the world.\nWe have seven products and platforms with over 2 billion users, and all are using Gemini. That includes Search, where Gemini is powering our AI Overviews. People use Search more with AI Overviews, and usage growth increases over time as people learn that they can ask new types of questions. This behavior is even more pronounced with younger users, who really appreciate the speed and efficiency of this new format. We are also pleased to see how Circle to Search is driving additional search use, opening up even more types of questions. This feature is also popular among younger users. Those who have tried Circle to Search before now use it to start more than 10% of their searches. As AI continues to expand the universe of queries that people can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for search innovation yet.\nNow, let me turn to key highlights from the quarter across Cloud, YouTube, platforms and devices, and Waymo. First, Google Cloud. Our AI-powered Cloud offerings enabled us to win customers such as Mercedes-Benz, Mercado Libre, and Servier. In 2024, the number of first-time commitments more than doubled compared to 2023. We also deepened customer relationships. Last year, we closed several strategic deals over $1 billion US dollars, and the number of deals over $250 million US dollars doubled from the prior year. Our partners are further accelerating our growth, with customers purchasing billions of dollars of solutions through our Cloud marketplace. We continue to see strong growth across our broad portfolio of AI-powered Cloud solutions. It begins with our AI hypercomputer, which delivers leading performance and cost across both GPUs and TPUs.\nThese advantages help Citadel with modeling markets and training and enabled Wayfair to modernize its platform, improving performance and scalability by nearly 25%. In Q4, we saw strong uptake of Trillium, our sixth-generation TPU, which delivers 4x better training performance and 3x greater inference throughput compared to the previous generation. We also continue our strong relationship with NVIDIA. We recently delivered their H200-based platforms to customers. Last week, we were the first to announce a customer running on the highly anticipated Blackwell platform. Our AI developer platform, Vertex AI, saw a 5x increase in customers year-over-year, with brands like Mondelez International, and WPP building new applications and benefiting from our 200+ foundation models. Vertex usage increased 20x during 2024, with particularly strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3, and most recently, Veo.\nWe are also seeing strong growth in our AI-powered databases, data analytics, and cybersecurity platforms. Customers, including Radisson Hotels, are now using Gemini to search and analyze multimodal data from across multiple Clouds. Our AI-powered threat intelligence and security operations products help customers, including Vodafone and AstraZeneca, identify, protect, and defend against threats. Our growing portfolio of AI applications is also seeing strong customer adoption. In Q4, we introduced Google Agentspace, which helps enterprises synthesize data with Google-quality search, create Gemini-powered agents, and automate transactions for employees. In addition, we recently gave all Google Workspace business and enterprise customers access to all of our powerful Gemini AI capabilities to help boost their productivity. Moving to YouTube, needs and data show YouTube continues to be number one in streaming watch time in the US, with our share of streaming now at a record high.\nOn Election Day alone, over 45 million viewers across the US watched election-related content on YouTube. Our early investment in podcasts is paying off. We integrated podcasts into the core YouTube experience, particularly with video. We are now the most frequently used service for consuming podcasts in the US, according to a recent EdisonReport. This success reflects our long-term approach of investing in emerging trends, from mobile to the living room. We now have over 250,000 creators in the YouTube Shopping Affiliate Program in the US and Korea alone. We expanded YouTube Shopping at the end of last year to three additional countries, allowing even more creators to share their favorite products with fans and grow their businesses. Philipp will talk more about YouTube performance later in the call. Next, platforms and devices.\nGoogle One's performance has been outstanding and is one of our fastest-growing subscription products in terms of subscribers and revenue growth. Last month, we announced the first beta of Android 16, plus new Android updates, including a deeper Gemini integration coming to the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series. We also recently announced Android XR, the first Android platform built for the Gemini era. Created with Samsung and Qualcomm, Android XR is designed to power an ecosystem of next-generation extended reality devices like headsets and glasses. Finally, a few words on Waymo, which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving more than 4 million passenger trips. It's now averaging over 150,000 trips each week and growing. Looking ahead, Waymo will be expanding its network and operations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this year, and Miami next year.\nIn the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will arrive in Tokyo for their first international road trip. We are also developing the sixth-generation Waymo Driver, which will significantly lower hardware costs. I want to thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. 2025 is going to be exciting, and we are all ready for it. Philipp, I'll hand it over to you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for the quarter, then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we're delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube, and partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is having on our business and our customers. Google Services revenues were $84 billion US dollars for the quarter, up 10%, driven primarily by 11% year-on-year growth in advertising revenues. Strong growth in Search and YouTube advertising was partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.\nIn terms of vertical performance, the 13% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services, followed by retail. The 14% growth in YouTube advertising revenues was driven by strong spend on US election advertising, with combined spend from both parties almost doubling from what we saw in the 2020 elections. In Q4, we saw continued strong growth in revenues from Search. We had lots of exciting updates in December, and we're rapidly integrating our AI innovation into our consumer experiences. We've already started testing Gemini 2.0 and AI Overviews, and plan to roll it out more broadly later in the year. In Search, we're seeing people increasingly ask entirely new questions using their voice, camera, or in ways that were not possible before, like with Circle to Search. We're making these benefits available to more consumers.\nGoogle is already present in over half of journeys where a new brand, product, or retailer is discovered. By offering new ways for people to search, we're expanding commercial opportunities for our advertisers. Shoppers can now take a photo of a product and, using Lens, quickly find information about the product, reviews, similar products, and where they can get it for a great price. Lens is used for over 20 billion visual search queries every month, and the majority of these searches are incremental. Retail was particularly strong this holiday season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which each generated over $1 billion US dollars in ad revenue. Interestingly, despite the US holiday shopping season being the shortest since 2019, retail sales began much earlier in October, causing the season to extend longer than anticipated. People shop more than a billion times a day across Google.\nLast quarter, we introduced a reinvented Google Shopping experience, rebuilt from the ground up with AI. This December saw roughly 13% more daily active users on Google Shopping in the US compared to the same period in 2023. Closing out on Search with Travel and sharing another interesting trend where we saw spend expand to Travel Tuesday. This contributed to 20% year-on-year revenue growth for travel advertisers across Cyber Monday and Travel Tuesday. Moving to ads, we continue investing in AI capabilities across media buying, creative, and measurement. As I've said before, we believe that AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain. Over the past quarter, we've seen how our customers are increasingly focusing on optimizing their use of AI. As an example, Petco used demand gen campaigns across targeting, creative generation, and bidding to find new pet-parent audiences across YouTube.\nThey achieved a 275% higher return on ad spend and a 74% higher click-through rate than their social benchmarks. On media buying, we made YouTube Select Creator takeovers generally available in the US and will be expanding to more markets this year. Creators know their audience the best, and Creator takeovers help businesses connect with consumers through authentic and relevant content. Looking at creative, we introduced new controls and made reporting easier in PMax, helping customers better understand and reinvest into their best-performing assets. Using asset generation in PMax, Event Ticket Center achieved a 5x increase in production of creative assets, saving time and effort. They also increased conversions by 300% compared to the previous period when they used manual assets. Finally, measurement.\nLast week, we made Meridian, our marketing mix model, generally available for customers, helping more businesses reinvest into creative and media buying strategies that they know work. Based on a Nielsen Meta analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on YouTube deliver 17% higher return on advertising spend than manual campaigns. Turning to YouTube, we saw robust revenue growth, backed by continued growth and watch time across ad-supported and premium experiences. Our focus here remains on building a streaming platform that enables creators to thrive and unlock the full potential of AI. Expanding on our state-of-the-art video generation model, we announced Veo 2, which creates incredibly high-quality video in a wide range of subjects and styles. It's been inspiring to see how people are experimenting with it. We'll make it available to creators on YouTube in the coming months.\nWe continue to invest in helping YouTube creators work with brands. All advertisers globally can now promote YouTube creator videos and ad campaigns across all AI-powered campaign types in Google Ads. Creators can tag partners in their brand videos. Sephora used demand gen's Shorts-only channel to boost traffic and brand searches for the holiday gift guide campaign, and leveraged creator collaborations to find the best gift. This drove an 82% relative uplift in searches for Sephora holiday. Shorts continues its ascent and is closing the gap with long-form. In 2024, the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing increased by more than 30 percentage points in the US, and we expect to make additional progress in 2025. We're making it easier for advertisers to benefit from Shorts on all screens.\nWe're particularly excited by its success on Connected TV, which now makes up 15% of Shorts viewing in the US. Using a combination of ad formats, Louis Vuitton reached their overall objectives on both long-form and short-form content. Their Shorts exceeded the luxury goods benchmark for average view duration by 89% for equivalent video lengths, while their long-form content exceeded the benchmark by over 15%, with strong engagement from Gen Z and millennials. Looking into the living room, we continue to be number one in streaming watch time in the US for nearly two years, according to Nielsen, and our share of streaming is at a record high. Viewers globally streamed over 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. YouTube makes multi-year investments to tap into shifting consumer behavior.\nThe current surge in living room viewership directly reflects years of work to build the right products and partnerships. Creators are now prioritizing high-quality viewing experiences that truly shine on TV screens, inspiring even more viewers to tune in. In fact, the number of creators making the majority of revenue from TV is up over 30% year-on-year. We have also invested in podcasts, where popular shows like Club Shay Shay and Lex Fridman are increasingly a visual format. YouTube creators and viewers are embracing this. In 2024, people watched over 400 million hours of podcasts each month on living room devices alone. YouTube is now the most popular service for podcast listening in the US, according to Edison. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where the breadth of what Google has to offer is increasingly being recognized.\nSundar mentioned our deepening partnership with Samsung. Another expanding partnership is with Citadel, who is modernizing its technology infrastructure with Google Cloud to transform employee and customer experiences. Using Google Cloud, it will improve its digital products, streamline employee workflows, and use advanced high-performance computing to enable millions of daily computations. This partnership also fuels Citadel's generative AI initiatives across customer service, document summarization, and search to reduce manual processing. With that, allow me a moment to thank Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment, and to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philipp. We're pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing across the business as Alphabet revenue for 2024 reached $350 billion US dollars, up 14% on a reported basis, and 15% in constant currency versus 2023. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the Q4, unless I state otherwise.\nI will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary and expectations for the Q1 and full year 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q4 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue of $96.5 billion US dollars increased by 12% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by Cloud. Total cost of revenue was $40.6 billion US dollars, up 8%. Tech was $14.8 billion US dollars, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift, with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have a much higher tech rate, declined. Other cost of revenue was $25.8 billion US dollars, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube, followed by depreciation due to increasing investments in our technical infrastructure.\nGrowth in content acquisition and depreciation were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in hardware costs due to the shift in timing of our Made by Google launches to the Q3 2024 compared to the Q4 of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-over-year comparisons reflect $1.2 billion US dollars in exit charges that we took in the Q4 of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As previously disclosed, those charges were allocated across the expense lines in other costs of revenue, and OpEx, based on associated headcount. Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $24.9 billion US dollars. R&D investments increased by 8%, primarily driven by increase in compensation and depreciation expenses, partially offset by the impact of charges for office space optimization in the Q4 of 2023.\nSales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the optimization charges last year, as well as declines in compensation, and in ads and promotion expenses due to the timing shift of the Pixel launch from Q4 to Q3. G&A expenses declined by 15%, reflecting a shift of timing in our charitable contributions, as well as the optimization charges last year. Operating income increased 31% this quarter to $31 billion US dollars, and operating margin increased to 32%, representing 4.6 points of margin expansion. Net income increased 28% to $26.5 billion US dollars, and earnings per share increased 31% to $2.15 US dollars. We delivered free cash flow of $24.8 billion US dollars in the Q4, and $72.8 billion US dollars for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $96 billion US dollars in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results, Google Service revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion US dollars, reflecting the strong momentum across Google Search, and YouTube ads.\nGoogle Search and other advertising revenues increased by 13% to $54 billion US dollars. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by the financial service vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 14% to $10.5 billion US dollars, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenue of $8 billion US dollars was down 4%. In the Q4, the year-over-year comparison in all of our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q4 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and device revenues increased 8% to $11.6 billion US dollars, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues, partially offset by the shift in timing of the launch of our Made by Google devices through the Q3 compared with the Q4 in 2023.\nWe continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, primarily due to increase in the number of paid subscribers across YouTube TV, YouTube Music Premium, and Google One. With regards to platform, we saw a slight increase in the growth rate in Play, primarily due to a strong increase in the number of buyers. Google Services operating income increased 23% to $32.8 billion US dollars, and operating margin increased from 35% to 39%, representing a meaningful margin expansion. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 30% to $12 billion US dollars in the Q4, reflecting growth in GCP across core GCP products, AI infrastructure, and generative AI solutions. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was much higher than Cloud overall. Healthy Google Workspace growth was primarily driven by increase in average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud operating income increased to $2.1 billion US dollars, and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5%. We're pleased with the work the Cloud team is doing to deliver valuable solutions to customers and generate revenue growth, as well as its continued focus on driving efficiencies across the Cloud business. As for other bets, for the Q4, revenue were $400 million US dollars, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion US dollars. The year-over-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect a milestone payment in the Q4 of 2023 for one of the other bets. Turning to Alphabet-level activities, the largest component of this line is our investments in AI research and development activities, which support all of Alphabet. As a reminder, Alphabet-level activities have included nearly all severance charges from reductions in workforce, and office space charges.\nIn the Q4 of 2024, the biggest factor in year-over-year comparison is the $1.2 billion US dollars in charges in the Q4 of 2023, almost entirely in connection with office space optimization. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the Q4 was $14 billion US dollars, primarily reflecting investments in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. In Q4, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15 billion US dollars in share purchases, and $2.4 billion US dollars in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion US dollars to shareholders in 2024. Turning to 2025, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in both the Q1 and the full year 2025.\nFirst, in terms of revenue, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenue across the company. First, in terms of revenues, I'll highlight two items that will have meaningful impact on Q1 revenues across the company. The first is the impact of foreign exchange rates. At the current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind to our revenues from the strengthening of the US dollar relative to key currencies in Q1 versus Q4 2024. Second is the impact of leap year. We expect a headwind from having one less day of revenue in Q1 2025 compared with leap year in the Q1 of 2024. As for our segments, Google Services advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experienced in the financial service vertical throughout 2024.\nIn Cloud, given that revenues are correlated with the timing of deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in Cloud revenue growth rates depending on when new capacity comes online during 2025. Moving to investments, starting with our expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers, and networking. We expect to invest approximately $75 billion US dollars in CapEx in 2025, with approximately $16 to 18 billion US dollars of that in the Q1. The expected total investment level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, primarily due to timing of deliveries and construction schedules.\nIn terms of expenses, first, the increase in our investment in CapEx over the past few years will increase pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In 2024, we saw 28% year-over-year growth in depreciation as we put more technical infrastructure assets into service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate in depreciation to accelerate in 2025. Second, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and Cloud. As you just heard from Sundar, we're delivering products and solutions to customers at a rapid pace, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. As I mentioned on the Q3 call, we're doing that while also focusing on driving further efficiencies in how we operate the business.\nBefore we take questions, I'd like to recap the financial results for the year. For the full year 2024, revenue grew by 14%, or by $43 billion US dollars, reaching $350 billion US dollars. Google Services and Google Cloud each continued to see double-digit revenue growth, coupled with margin expansion. YouTube and Cloud revenues combined ended the year at $110 billion US dollars annual run rate. In 2024, we generated total income of $112 billion US dollars, an increase of 33% from 2023. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization. We've been using AI to improve the performance of our ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual revenue from AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. We're also excited about the potential to bring new experiences to users that will provide additional opportunities for monetization.\nI look forward to sharing more in our progress throughout the year. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Sundar, one for Anat. Sundar, maybe kind of step back on Search. It seems like there's a lot of advances to come with GenAI and agentic possibilities with Search.\nCan you just sort of walk us through your big picture vision over the next few years of how you think about your Search product continuing to evolve to stay at the top of the funnel and drive more engagement and monetization for your users and advertisers? The second one, Anat, I think about 90 days ago, you talked about sort of further efficiencies and areas of simplification on the OpEx space. Can you just sort of walk us through some examples of where you see the potential for further efficiencies to the OpEx space, excluding the DNA step-ups that we have to come in 2025? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Brian. On Search, obviously, we view, I mean, this has been a long continuous journey. AI Overviews has been the next step. It's playing out positively.\nAs we have indicated, the metrics look great, and we are obviously trading on that experience, bringing better and better models, expanding to the number of queries where it works, and so on. There's a lot more to come. I think we'll continue bringing AI in more powerful ways, in multimodal ways, things like what we have done with Lens, Circle to Search. You can imagine the future with Project Astra. You can also imagine areas like we have done in Gemini Deep Research, possibilities where you are really dramatically expanding the types of use cases for which Search can work, things which don't always get answered instantaneously, but can take some time to answer. Those are all areas of explorations, and you will see us putting newer experiences in front of users through the course of 2025.\nI do feel the opportunity space with AI, there's a lot of unlock ahead.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nThanks. For the question with regards to where do we see or where do I see leverage moving forward and some of the comments I've made on the previous call, I certainly see opportunities for further productivity and efficiency, and this is one of our priority areas. We're going to do that so that we can make sure we continue to invest in areas such as AI and Cloud, where we see potential for continued growth. I'll remain focused on areas that I've mentioned before, which include the technical infrastructure, so the $75 billion US dollars in CapEx I've mentioned for this year. The majority of that is going to go towards our technical infrastructure, which includes servers and data centers. Ensuring we do that in the most efficient way is critical.\nSecond is managing headcount growth, and we're going to be investing in areas of growth such as AI and Cloud, but looking across the organization and moderating that growth will be important. Optimizing the real estate footprint is one of the areas I've mentioned. We're continuing to focus on that, as well as looking at how we simplify the organization. We previously mentioned bringing like areas together. Sundar talked about bringing some of the AI research teams together so that we can operate with increased speed, but also how we operate within the organization, using our own AI tools to how we run the business, whether it's the code that Sundar mentioned on the previous call, writing code with AI, or even running some of our key processes using AI tools. We're looking at all that. This is not a one-quarter type of effort.\nIt's going to continue throughout the year, and we're going to continue to focus on that so that we can support the growth in other areas.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Philipp and one for Anat. Philipp, can you just talk more about the expanded rollout of ads on AI Overviews, and perhaps what additional things you may have learned in Q4? I guess in particular, just curious if you rolled out to a higher percentage of commercial queries, and is it still fair to say that you're monetizing nearly on par with existing Search? Anat, just on Cloud growth, a little bit of decel Q3 to Q4, but it sounded like you also suggested that you were capacity constrained in the Q4.\nI just wanted to push on that a little bit more. Is that accurate, and is it fair to say that revenue growth could have been higher with much more capacity? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nOn your first question, first of all, AI Overviews, which is really nice to see, continue to drive higher satisfaction and Search usage, so that's really good. As you know, we recently launched the ads within AI Overviews on mobile in the US, which builds on our previous rollout of ads above and below. As I talked about before, for the AI Overviews overall, we actually see monetization at approximately the same rate, which I think really gives us a strong base on which we can innovate even more.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nOn the Cloud questions, first, I'm excited that we ended the quarter at $12 billion US dollars and a 30% year-over-year growth, very impressive growth.\nAs I've mentioned, the prepared remark, GCP grew at a much higher rate than overall Cloud. Two items to think about from a deceleration perspective. First is we are lapping a very strong quarter of an AI deployment in Q4 2023. The second is the one you've alluded to. We do see, and have been seeing, very strong demand for our AI products in the Q4 in 2024. We exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity. We are in a tight supply-demand situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online. As I mentioned, we've increased investment in CapEx in 2024, continue to increase in 2025, and we'll bring more capacity throughout the year.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you for taking the question.\nI'll just ask one. Sundar, with the news that came out of China a little over two weeks ago, I think investors have been asking a lot of questions about the long-term cost curve for AI as AI moves from the infrastructure layer to the application layer, or from training to inference, and maybe even custom silicon becomes more dominant across the theme. I would love to get your perspective on your take on that news a couple of weeks ago and what it might mean for Alphabet longer term. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Eric. Look, I think there's been a lot of observations on DeepSeek. First of all, I think tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work. Look, I think for us, it's always been obvious over time. There's frontier model development, but you can drive a lot of efficiency to serve these models really, really well.\nIf you look at one of the areas in which the Gemini model shine is the parade of frontier of cost, performance, and latency. If you look at all three attributes, I think we lead this parade of frontier. I would say both our 2.0 Flash models or 2.0 Flash thinking models, they are some of the most efficient models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1. I think a lot of it is our strength of the full-stack development, end-to-end optimization, our obsession with cost per query, all of that, I think, sets us up well for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on the Cloud side.\nA couple of things I would say are, if you look at the trajectory over the past three years, the proportion of the spend towards inference compared to training has been increasing, which is good because obviously inference is to support businesses with good ROIC. I think that trend is good. I think the reasoning models, if anything, accelerates that trend because it's obviously scaling upon inference dimension as well. I think, look, I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. That's the opportunity space. It's as big as it comes, and that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you. I have two, one for Philipp and one for Anat. Philipp, the question for you is we're starting to see more AI tools on e-commerce sites, and something like Research with AI recommendations is on Google Shopping. Can you talk about how that product and other AI tools are impacting shopping behavior? How that's impacting monetization? I guess the $75 billion US dollars question, Anat, is how do you think about long-term capital intensity for this business? It sounds like there's a bit of constraint in terms of getting things built, but how do you think, or how do you think about the modeling of capital intensity going forward, and what are the things that you're looking forward to in terms of whether or not this is the right level of spend?\nThank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nLook, excellent question. We've been using our advances in AI to make search for products on Google even easier, obviously. In Q4, we actually introduced quite a transformed Google Shopping experience, which we rebuilt from the ground up with AI. People shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced this fully reinvented Google Shopping experience. In December, we saw roughly, I mentioned this, 13% more daily active users on Google Shopping in the US compared to the same period last year. That's a good development here. The new Google Shopping experiences, specifically to your question, use AI to really intelligently show the most relevant products, helping to speed up and simplify your research. You get an AI-generated brief with top things to consider for your search, plus maybe products that meet your needs.\nShoppers very often want low prices. The new page not only includes deal-finding tools like price comparison, price insights, price tracking throughout, but it's also a new and dedicated personalized deals page where you can browse deals for you. All this is really built on the backbone of AI. We think this is a very interesting opportunity.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nOn the question of capital expenditure, I think you may have two questions in there. One is just the capital intensity and then how would we think about return on that invested capital. On the first one, certainly we're looking ahead, but we're managing very responsibly with a very rigorous, even internal governance process, looking at how do we allocate that capacity and what would we need to support the customer demand externally, but also across Google, the Alphabet business.\nAs you've seen the comment I've just made on Cloud, we do have demand that exceeds our available capacity. We'll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online. We do have the benefit of having a very broad business, and we can repurpose capacity, whether it's through Google Services or Google Cloud to support, as I said, whether it's Search, GDM, or Google Cloud customers, we can do that in a more efficient manner. We also look at every investment that we make to ensure that we're doing it in the most cost-efficient way to optimize our data center. As you know, our strategy is mostly to rely on our own self-design and build data centers. They're industry-leading in terms of both cost and power efficiency at scale. We have our own customized TPUs.\nThey're customized for our own workloads, so they do deliver outstanding, superior performance and CapEx efficiency. We're going to be looking at all that when we make decisions as to how we're going to progress capital investments throughout the coming years.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Shmulik\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nYes, thanks for taking the question. Sundar, I just wanted to follow up to Brian's question from earlier. With your own Project Mariner efforts and a competitor's recent launch, it seems there's suddenly really strong momentum on AI consumer agents and kind of catching up to that old Google duplex vision. I think when you look a few years ahead, where do you see consumer agents going, and really, what does it mean to Google Search outside of Lens?\nIs there room for both to flourish, or will they eventually be in conflict with each other? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, I think, first of all, we are definitely seeing a lot of progress in the underlying capabilities of these models. Gemini 2.0 was definitely built with the view of enabling more agentic use cases. I actually, and we are definitely seeing progress inside, and I think we'll be able to do more agentic experiences for our users. Look, I actually think all of this expands the opportunity space. I think historically we've had information use cases, but now you can act on your information needs in a much deeper way. It's always been our vision when we have talked about Google Assistant, etc. I think the opportunity space expands. I think there's plenty of, it feels very far from a zero-sum game.\nThere's plenty of room, I think, for many new types of use cases to flourish. I think for us, we have a clear sense of additional use cases we can start to tackle for our users in Google Search. All the early work with AI Overviews shows that users will react positively to that. I'm pretty excited about what's ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. One on infrastructure and then one, Anat, on the guidance on revenue.\nSundar, if we look at the inference cost per 1 million tokens and not the API pricing we see for Gemini versus something like GPT-4, but the raw cost of generating inference tokens on your TPU stack, how much more efficient do you think you guys are in terms of generating 1 million tokens compared to inference costs running on your Cloud peers? Do you see this as an advantage as everything shifts to inference? Anat, you called out lapping the financial services category strength in 2025 as a bit of a problem for Search. Could you just quantify a little bit of that? Is that kind of the same as when you guys talk about lapping the Asia outbound advertiser channel? Any numbers you could put around that headwind? Thank you very much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nRoss, look, the whole TPU project started, our V1 was effectively an inferencing chip. We've always, part of the reason we have taken an end-to-end stack approach is so that we can definitely drive a strong differentiation in end-to-end optimizing, not only on a cost, but on a latency basis and a performance basis. Be it the Pareto frontier we mentioned, I think our full-stack approach and our TPU efforts all give a meaningful advantage. We plan, you already see that. I know you asked about the cost, but it's effectively captured. When we price outside, we pass on that differentiation. It's partly why we've been able to bring forward Flash models at very attractive value props, which is what is driving both developer growth. We've doubled our developers to 4.4 million in just about six months. Vertex usage is up 20x last year.\nAll of that is a direct result of that approach, and we'll continue doing that.\n\nAnat Ashkenazi\n\nSenior VP and CFO, Alphabet\n\nOn the question regarding my comment on lapping the strength in financial services, this is primarily related to the structural changes with regards to insurance. More specifically within financial services, it was the insurance segment, and we saw that continue, but it was a one-time kind of a step up. We saw it throughout the year. I'm not going to give any specific numbers as to what we expect to see in 2025. I'm pleased with the fact that we're seeing, and continuing to see, strength across really all verticals, including retail, and exiting the year in a position of strength.\nIf anything, I would highlight as you think about the year, the comments I've made about the impact of FX, as well as the fact that we have one less day of revenue in Q1.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nInternet Analyst, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you. A couple for Philipp. You mentioned higher search usage with overviews. Just wondering how you're feeling about overall search usage. Is it accelerating as you integrate more AI? I know there's a lot of traffic growth at competitors with AI, but just wondering if you're seeing a real increase in total volumes of information gathering. Second, on YouTube, thinking about kind of maybe a move from more professional content to user-generated content. What is that doing for your usage, and how do you think about the margin impact from that? Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nMaybe just on search usage overall, look, our metrics are healthy. We are continuing to see growth in search on a year-on-year basis in terms of overall usage. Of course, within that, AI Overviews have seen stronger growth, particularly across all segments of users, including younger users. It's being well received. Overall, I think through this AI moment, I think search is continuing to perform well. As I said earlier, we have a lot more innovations to come this year. I think the product will evolve even more. I think as you make search, as you make it more easy for people to interact and ask follow-up questions, etc., we have an opportunity to drive further growth. Some color on your YouTube question. Look, YouTube ads overall had a very healthy growth in Q4, driven by brand, followed by direct response.\nUS election advertising led brand revenue growth, and we saw nearly double the spending from 2020. I mentioned that we also had a strong contribution from finance, retail, and the tech verticals. Overall, strong operating metrics. Watch time growth remains robust, particularly in key monetization opportunity areas such as Shorts and living room, just to set the stage here one more time. On your question specifically on the UGC side, look, we have a very strong position with creators, and we've always said creators are at the center of YouTube success here. They're the number one most important thing we care about, and this strong position really gives us a lot of confidence here. Today, we have more than 3 million channels that are actually in the YouTube Partner Program, which is really an incredible program.\nWe're very confident with the position we have and where this goes.\n\nJustin Post\n\nInternet Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much. Two, please. I want to focus on Gemini and the consumer agent side. Sundar, there were some press reports that suggested you have an ambitious goal on growing the usage by the end of 2025. Two questions on that, please. First, how should we think about the approach that you're going to employ to achieve this goal? Is it more aggressive marketing for Gemini as a standalone product, or is it tighter integration into existing experiences, whether it be search, mail, maps, etc.? The second one is, how should we think about the future monetization opportunity of Gemini? Today, it's really a premium subscription offering or a free offering.\nOver time, do you see an ad component? Anything you can share on that, please? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nFirst of all, we've had strong momentum for Gemini on the app side, particularly through the second half of 2024. Some of it is we've made it more easily accessible. We've brought it to, for example, with a dedicated app on iOS, which has been super positively received and definitely getting a lot of traction there. Definitely driving organic growth by putting the product out. We just last week rolled out with our 2.0 series of models. 2.0 Flash, I mean, I think that's one of the most capable models you can access at the free tier. That's definitely contributing as well. We are rapidly trading. We've had a couple of key innovations there.\nGemini Live, I think, has been definitely a hit with users, as well as for advanced users, Gemini Deep Research. I think a combination of innovation, continually trading on the product, and making it better is driving a lot of usage. We'll have a lot more to come as we go at this year. We obviously have a partnership with Samsung, so there are other things which will contribute to it as well. On the monetization side, obviously, for now, we are focused on a free tier and subscriptions. Obviously, as you've seen in Google over time, we always want to lead with user experience. We do have very good ideas for native ad concepts, but you will see us lead with the user experience. I do think we're always committed to making the products work and reach billions of users at scale.\nAdvertising has been a great aspect of that strategy. Just like you've seen with YouTube, we'll give people options over time. For this year, I think you'll see us be focused on the subscription direction.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nSenior Director of IR, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our Q1 2025 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\nI'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim. Hello, everyone. I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. They show tremendous ongoing momentum in Search, and great progress in Cloud, with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. In terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI Overviews. In Q2, Cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, at the same time past the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit. Year to date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well-positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our research and infrastructure leadership means we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly.\nCombined with our model-building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny as the technology continues to evolve. Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. We are committed to this leadership long term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next, and Google Marketing Live, and we'll touch on many of them here. Today, I'll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally, followed by Cloud, YouTube, and some closing thoughts. Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search.\nWe are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI Overviews, including increases in Search usage, and increased user satisfaction with the results. People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI Overviews. We see even higher engagement from younger users aged 18-24 when they use Search with AI Overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web. We are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI Overviews continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Beyond AI Overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address, and opens up powerful new ways to search. Visual search via Lens is one.\nSoon, you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. Already, we have seen that AI Overviews in Lens lead to an increase in overall visual search usage. Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices. We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools, and we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever. Gemini now comes in four sizes, with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle.\nGemini is making Google's own products better. All six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in Search, Workspace, Google Messages, and more. At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon, you'll be able to ask Photos questions like, what did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year? For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We've always wanted to build a universal agent, and it's an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life. Our AI product advances come from our longstanding foundation of research leadership, as well as our global network of infrastructure.\nIn Q2, we announced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia, and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia, and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best-performing and most energy-efficient TPU to date. It achieves a near 5x increase in peak compute performance per chip and is 67% more energy-efficient compared to TPU v5e. The latest NVIDIA Blackwell platform will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI, given the many opportunities we see ahead. Of course, as we do this, we'll continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models.\nFor example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI Overviews, while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI Overview served flat. We have focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query in order to minimize impact on cost and latency. Separately, on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce, as well as our local communities. Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility, and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to their large customer base. Our momentum begins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI startups like Essential AI with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications.\nWe continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, and A3 Mega powered by NVIDIA H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3. Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher, and the US Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and Wipro are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing. We broaden support for third-party models, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and open-source models like Gemma 2, Llama, and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo, and more. Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell.\nFor example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps Click Therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better quality software, find insights from their data, and protect their organization against cybersecurity threats using Gemini. Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini Code Assist to develop, test, and document software faster. Data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster. Cybersecurity risks continue to accelerate, and the number of breaches continues to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our Mandiant teams help manage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control, and reliability make Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International.\nIn Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture. Turning next to YouTube, YouTube is focused on a clear strategy: connecting creators with a massive audience, and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions, while helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great Brandcast this quarter, and Philipp will say more. I'm pleased with the progress here. YouTube has remained number one in US streaming watch time, according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube Shorts and connected TVs more than doubled last year. We are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into Shorts. Next, on Android and Pixel, we joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event.\nI'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our Pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced the new Pixel 8a, powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to Search, Best Take, and a Gemini-powered AI assistant. In other bets, I'm really pleased with the progress Waymo is making, a real leader in the space and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo has served more than 2 million trips to date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo is now delivering well over 50,000 weekly paid public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. In June, we removed the waitlist in San Francisco so anyone can take a ride.\nFully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver's seat. Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to continue to work with her in her new role. I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from her on our call next quarter. Thanks, as always, to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2. With that, over to you, Philip.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year on year.\nSearch and other revenues grew 14% year on year, led by growth on the retail vertical, followed by financial services. YouTube Ads revenues were up 13% year on year, driven by growth in brand, as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year on year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. For the rest of my remarks, I want to double-click on two topics. First, how we are applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience. Second, YouTube's position as the leading multi-format platform. Let me start by sharing some of the ways we're applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses. Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators, and customers.\nFrom I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live, and CAN, a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads, features, and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, Demand Gen, and Retail, we're applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production, and provide more engaging experiences for consumers. Listening to our customers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of a new and easier-to-use Merchant Center, we've expanded Product Studio with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner.\nYou can upload a product image, prompt the AI with something like, Feature this product with Paris skyline in the background, and Product Studio will generate campaign-ready assets. I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing virtual try-on and shopping ads, and plan to roll it out widely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images, and a higher click-out to retailer sites. Retailers love it because it drives purchasing decisions and fewer returns. Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to Performance Max and standard shopping campaigns. Advertisers who use profit optimization and smart bidding see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding.\nLastly, Demand Gen is rolling out to Display & Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months, with new generative image tools that create stunning, high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, Demand Gen delivers an average of 14% more conversions. The use cases we're seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share two examples with you. Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged Demand Gen during the holiday season and saw a 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions, such as adding items to carts and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6x more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks.\nOur own Google Marketing team used Demand Gen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for a Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail, delivering twice the click-through rate at nearly a quarter of the cost. In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models, delivering further performance gains. In just six months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance, and language understanding have improved broad match performance by 10% for advertisers using smart bidding. Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to broad match and smart bidding in their search campaigns see an average increase of over 25% more conversions or value at a similar cost. We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. As you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads.\nNow let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch, and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audiences tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, two weeks ago, MrBeast's channel hit more than 300 million subscribers. Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last three years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the number one most-watched streaming platform on TV screens in the US for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming, but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney.\nThis growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch time on YouTube grow 30% year over year. Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time growth, viewer and advertiser innovation, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco, and home and personal care, are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations. Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show the many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people's lives. Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer, and drive people to their site.\nVerizon's creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads. Turning to Shorts, last quarter, I shared that in the US, the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the US. We're also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year. Lastly, a few words on shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop. While it's still early days, shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube Shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers.\nThese updates included product tagging, where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections, and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands, and track their affiliate earnings. With that, I'll finish by saying a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment, and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years. Now, for one last time, it's over to you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philip, and thanks, Sundar, for those kind words. We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I state otherwise.\nI will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14%, or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation, as well as the impact of the Canadian Digital Services Tax, which was applied retroactively. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D, partially offset by a decline in G&A, with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter last year.\nThe increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation, which was affected by lapping a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain other bets in the second quarter last year, followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26%, and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion, and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter, and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year, we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter and will do so again next quarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nTurning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail, followed by the financial services vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13%, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion, up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 40%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting, first, significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for Cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI, and, second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million, and the operating loss was $1.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services, first, within advertising, the strong performance of Search was broad-based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter.\nWe had healthy watch time growth, continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts, and had continued momentum in connected TV, with brand benefiting, in part, from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate as we anniversaried the impact of a price increase for YouTube TV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year.\nSecond, with regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play, driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices, the most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year, benefiting revenues in Q3 this year. Turning to Cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As Sundar noted, year to date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business. Turning to margins.\nThe margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base, as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. Once again, headcount declined quarter on quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year, and a much slower pace of hiring. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud and technical infrastructure. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023.\nHowever, in the third quarter, operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to other bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies, as we invest for long-term returns.\nWaymo is an important example of this, with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multi-year investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels, will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading autonomous driving technology company. To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet, so I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude. I have been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO, and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think we have accomplished a lot in the last nine-plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue.\nOf course, I'm not going far, and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months, and I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar and our great team. Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO. Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today, and certainly, that is Google and Alphabet's focus.\nI want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you. Sundar, Philip, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. First, thank you, Ruth, for all the help and significant impact over the past decade. The first one, it's a little bit of a jumble, I guess, for Sundar, Philip, or Ruth.\nI guess we're sort of 18 months into this fever pitch around the GenAI focus in the world. Maybe from any of your perspective, can you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster-than-expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI generative AI capabilities versus slower-than-expected traction and testing from a Google perspective? Ruth, we appreciate all the comments about structurally re-engineering the OpEx space. Are there any more tangible examples of areas you can talk to us about where you still see further ways to drive more efficiency across the company?\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks. Brian, thanks. I'll take the first part. I think it's a good question. Obviously, I think there is a time curve in terms of taking the underlying technology and translating it into meaningful solutions across the board, both on the consumer and the enterprise side.\nDefinitely, on the consumer side, I'm pleased, as I said in my comments earlier, in terms of how, for a product like Search, which is used at that scale over many decades, we've been able to introduce it in a way that it's additive, enhances the overall experience, and is positively contributing there. I think across our consumer products, we've been able—I think we are seeing progress on the organic side. Obviously, monetization is something that we would have to earn on top of it. The enterprise side, I think we are at a stage where definitely there are a lot of models. I think roughly the models are all kind of converging towards a set of base capabilities, but I think where the next wave is working to build solutions on top of it.\nI think there are pockets, be it coding, be it in customer service, etc., where we are seeing some of those use cases, seeing traction, but I still think there is hard work there to completely unlock those.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nOn your second question, first, thank you for your comments. Look, the reason we consistently use the term, the phrase that we're focused on durably re-engineering our cost base is because these are deep work streams. They're not tactical fixes, and we continue to build on them. The main areas that we've talked about are around product and process prioritization, around organizational efficiency, and structure. Both of those are reflected in the headcount and the fact that headcount is down year on year. Across all of those, as I said, across our entire leadership team, we remain focused on continuing to execute against them.\nIn terms of the most recent examples, as we talked about last quarter with the combination of the devices and services product area with the platforms and ecosystems product area, we announced that back in April. What we discussed last quarter and what we're seeing is that unifying teams across these organizations helps with product execution, and what we're really focused on is really adding to velocity and efficiency. Kind of the gift that keeps giving. More broadly, all of the work streams that we've talked to you about before, we continue to remain focused on. A big one, very important one, is all of the efficiency efforts, the work streams around technical infrastructure, and improving efficiency there. We're also working on the use of AI across Alphabet. We're continuing to build on what we've done with our centralized procurement organization.\nWe're continuing to optimize our real estate portfolio. This is across our leadership team. These are efforts that all build to this phrase, durably re-engineering our cost base.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Ruth and one for Sundar. Ruth, you've now had Google Services operating margins of roughly 40% for the past two quarters. Just as you create more capacity to help offset the future investments, is it reasonable to think that you could sustain at those kind of levels going forward? Sundar, just as it relates to AI Overviews, you talked about the positive trends there.\nCan you just help us understand where you are, how far along in rolling out AI Overviews, and then any more color around kind of click-through rates and monetization levels relative to your traditional searches? Thanks.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of the Google Services operating margin, it did reflect all the work that we're doing on durably re-engineering the cost base. It also reflected the benefit of strong revenue performance in Search. What I tried to lay out in the comments as we look forward to the third quarter is operating margins will reflect the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher levels of our investment in technical infrastructure. It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch due to the pull forward. Those are important factors.\nI would say overall, company-wide, it's important to note that we do expect to continue to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. I did want to highlight those important points as we look forward to Q3.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nDoug, thanks. On the AI Overviews, we have rolled it out in the US, and we will be, through the course of the year, definitely scaling it up, both to more countries, and also we have taken a conservative start focused on quality, making sure the metrics are healthy, and so on. You will see us expand the use cases around it, and we'll touch definitely more queries. All the feedback we have seen are positive. On the monetization side, I think Philip has touched upon it. Maybe Philip, anything more you want to add there?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah. Yeah.\nLook, innovation and improvements to the user experience on Search have historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We talked about this before. We saw this when we navigated from desktop to mobile, for example. We can see GenAI obviously expand the types of questions we can help people with, as Sundar mentioned. As we said before, people are finding ads either above or below AI Overviews helpful. We have a solid baseline here from which we can innovate.\nAs you have probably noticed at GML, we announced that soon we'll actually start testing search and shopping ads in AI Overviews for users in the US, and they will have the opportunity to actually appear within the AI Overview in a section clearly labeled as sponsored when they're relevant to both the query and the information in the AI Overview, really giving us the ability to innovate here and take this to the next level. Thank you. Best of luck, Ruth, in your new role.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson with Moffett. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. I have to run for Sundar on one for fully. Sundar, on the decision this week to not deprecate cookies, I know it's been a long journey.\nCan you talk a bit about what we should expect in terms of new experience in Chrome and why the company makes the decision not to go down a path of deprecating cookies? Philip, I know it's only one quarter, but it's interesting that Search is growing faster than YouTube, which surprised some of us. Can you talk about what factors you think are behind the differences in growth rates between these markets? Is there anything on the AI front that you could see maybe re-accelerating YouTube growth as you've seen happen with Search? Thanks so much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMichael, on cookies, look, I think obviously we are super committed to improving privacy for users in Chrome. That was the whole focus around Privacy Sandbox, and we remain committed on the journey.\nOn third-party cookies, given the implications across the ecosystems and considerations and feedback across so many stakeholders, we now believe user choice is the best path forward there. We'll both improve privacy by giving users choice, and we'll continue our investments in privacy-enhancing technologies. It's obviously an area we will be taking feedback from the players in the ecosystem, and we are committed to being privacy-first as well. Philip?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nOn the second part of your question, maybe Ruth, you want to jump in first, and then I take the rest if needed.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nAbsolutely. As we both noted, Search revenues really reflected broad-based growth across verticals. That was led by retail, followed by financial services. I think your question really goes to the heart of the year-on-year growth comparison.\nAs both Philipp and I noted, we're really pleased with YouTube, the YouTube team, all that was done. It was driven by brand, followed by direct response. They have very strong ongoing operating metrics, which Philipp will comment on. I think the important point to note, I tried to tease out in opening comments, was that the deceleration in this year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter versus the first quarter primarily reflected the tougher comparison versus the first quarter. At that point, as you probably recall, YouTube was lapping negative year-on-year growth in Q1 last year. Q1 also benefited from the extra day from leap year. What you're also seeing here is with YouTube, we were anniversarying the ramp in APAC-based retailers that began in the second quarter last year, and foreign exchange headwinds as well that we noted.\nThere are some timing issues going on, and what we're trying to highlight is the underlying operating strength. Back to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah, that was very comprehensive. Nothing really to add from my side here. The only thing I would say, I think, to Brian's first question on areas where things are maybe taking longer, I think, look, we are all building multimodal models. At least Gemini has been natively multimodal from the ground up. Most of the use cases today that have been unlocked have been around the tech side. In terms of getting real generative audio-video experiences working well, I think it is still going to take some time. Over time, obviously, it will be deeply relevant to YouTube, and it is an area I'm excited about in the future.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nOkay. Thanks all, and best to you. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much. I'll echo the thanks for Ruth for all the insights and partnership over the years on these earnings calls. Sundar, maybe first for you, in terms of cloud and bringing AI to the enterprise, I wanted to know if you go a little bit deeper in terms of how you're seeing AI actually get adopted, implemented, what it potentially could mean for the strategic positioning of the cloud business, and the potential for AI workloads to be a stimulant to revenue growth for cloud first. Following up, the last set of questions on YouTube were really about the macro or the ad environment.\nWhat do you guys as a team continue to learn about the subscription side of YouTube and the appetite for consumers to engage with a broader array of media products at the subscription layer? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Eric. Look, on the cloud and AI stuff, obviously, it's something which I think will end up being a big driver over time. I mentioned in my opening remarks already, if you take a look at our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud across everything we do, be it compute on the AI side, the products we have through Vertex AI, Gemini for Workspace, and Gemini for Google Cloud, etc., we definitely are seeing traction. People are deeply engaging with Gemini models across Vertex and AI Studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things. You are definitely seeing early use cases.\nI think we are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows, we are driving deeper progress and unlocking value, which I'm very bullish will happen. These things take time. If I were to take a longer-term outlook, I definitely see a big opportunity here. I think particularly for us, given the extent to which we are investing in AI, our research infrastructure, leadership, all of that translates directly. I'm pretty excited about the opportunity space ahead.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nOn your second question with respect to subscriptions, implicit in your question, how strong is it? As I noted in opening comments, that overall line subscriptions, platforms, and devices delivered healthy growth, and that was led by subscriptions.\nAs we've said on many calls here in a row, the subscription revenue growth continued to be quite strong. It was driven by subscriber growth in both YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. The other component within that line is Google One that also delivered strong subscriber and revenue growth. I think the heart of your question is really around YouTube, and that is the heart of the revenues in that line. It continues to be very strong. We see a lot of take-up in it, strong subscriber growth, really pleased with it. We did note that growth on that line decelerated due to anniversarying this YouTube TV price increase. At the heart of it are people interested in the subscription offerings, and is the take-up significant? We're really pleased with it.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\nYour line is now open.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, everybody. Just two questions on the AI CapEx. It looks like from the outside, at least, that the hyperscaler industry is going from kind of an underbuilt situation this time last year to better meeting the demand with capacity right now to potentially being overbuilt next year if these CapEx growth rates keep up. Do you think that's a fair characterization? How are we thinking about the return on invested capital with this AI CapEx cycle? Related to that, do you think that the AI industry is close to or far away from hitting some kind of wall on foundation model improvement in AI training based on lack of availability of new data to train on? Just your thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Ross. I think great questions.\nLook, obviously, we are at an early stage of what I view as a very transformative area in technology. When you are going through these transitions, aggressively investing upfront in a defining category, particularly in an area which, in a leveraged way, cuts across all our core areas, our products, including Search, YouTube, and other services, as well as fuels growth in cloud and supports the innovative long-term bets and other bets, is definitely something that for us makes sense to lean in. I think the one way I think about it is when you go through a curve like this, the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us here, even in scenarios where if it turns out that we are overinvesting, these are infrastructure which are widely useful for us.\nThey have long useful lives, and we can apply it across, and we can work through that. I think not investing to be at the frontier definitely has much more significant downsides. Having said that, we obsess around every dollar we put in. Our teams work super hard, and I'm proud of the efficiency work, be it optimization of hardware, software, model deployment across our fleet. All of that is something we spend a lot of time on, and that's how we think about it. To your second question on whether how do the scaling laws hold? Are we hitting on some kind of wall or something? Look, I think we are all pushing very hard, and there's going to be a few efforts which will scale up on the compute side and push the boundaries of these models.\nWhat I would tell is, regardless of how that plays out, I still think there is enough optimizations we are all doing, which is driving constant progress in terms of the capabilities of the models. More importantly, taking them and translating into real use cases across the consumer and enterprise side. I think on that frontier, I think there is still a lot of progress to be had. We are pretty focused on that as well.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Steven Zhu with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThank you so much. Sundar, I guess to ask the AI question a different way, as we talk to some of the model builders out there, it looks like the initial use cases are more on the cost savings or efficiency side.\nWhen do you think we'll start thinking about products that can help revenue generation for the Fortune 500, Fortune 1000 companies, which is probably something that can hopefully create greater value over time versus just cutting costs? Philip, listening to what will be, I guess, Ruth's final comments on YouTube on these public calls, and thank you, by the way, Ruth, for all the help. I couldn't help but notice that the bigger factors were brand, followed by direct response. If we continue to think that the one you bring up first is the larger factor, and tying this into your prior commentary about shopping being an important consideration, when do you think we'll start talking about direct response being a much bigger contributor to YouTube's growth versus brand? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nOn the first part of the question, look, I think, I mean, the technology is horizontal enough. It can apply on both sides. If you take a use case like improving the customer service experience, it's a part of it which is driving efficiencies, and you can look at it from a cost standpoint. You could also be overall improving the experience, improving conversion, driving the funnel better, and increasing basket size if you're a retail e-commerce player, etc. We are seeing people experiment across both sides. I think you will see it played out across both sides. Philip, on the second one?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet",
    "content2": "Yes, on the second one. Look, on the direct response side, as you know, it's about driving and converting commercial intent. Customers are obviously benefiting from including video in their AI-powered campaigns.\nIt could be PMax, could be Demand Gen, and obviously using our automated tools to enhance and create video creatives. We're very, very optimistic about this path. On average, advertisers who run both image and video ads with Demand Gen campaigns see 6% more conversions per dollar than those running image-only ads and discovery. This is just one little example of how this can obviously boost your performance business. That's a big part. The brand side, as you know, Google AI continues to make it easier for brands to show up next to the content where viewers are obviously the most engaged. They're finding it, as you can see from the numbers, a very effective way to drive awareness and consideration. We're also quite excited about some of the recent launches on the YouTube shopping side, if you want to put that into the direct response bucket. Okay.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nInternet Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGreat. I'd like to ask a couple of areas. First, on the cloud acceleration, would you characterize that as new AI demand helping drive that year to date? Is that more of a rebound in just general compute and other demand? Is AI really moving this forward and helping drive acceleration? I wanted to ask about your internal cost savings, which has been really strong. How are you using AI internally to help cut costs? Are you seeing better efficiencies with your engineers? I would love to hear about how you're applying AI to cut your own costs. Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. Overall, as Sundar and I said, we're very pleased with the results in cloud.\nThere is clearly a benefit as the cloud team is engaging broadly with customers around the globe with AI-related solutions, AI infrastructure solutions, and generative AI solutions. I think we noted that we're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. It is clearly adding to the strength of the business on top of all that they're doing. Just to be really clear, the results for GCP, the growth rate for GCP is above the growth for cloud overall. I'll turn it to Sundar on the cost-saving point, but just one point. We're really pleased as well that cloud's margin improved as it did, and in part, that reflects the revenue strength that they delivered and all of the efficiency efforts that I've already spoken about.\nLooking ahead in Q3, we do expect the same seasonal pattern that you saw last year with respect to margin, and we are continuing to invest in the business.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, I think specifically, if the question is about engineers and coding, etc., we definitely want to be on the cutting edge there. I think we are making these tools available to some of the most productive engineers and demanding engineers out there, and they are definitely kicking the tires hard. I would say it's still all in very early stages, I think, particularly when it comes to writing high-quality, secure code. I think all the learnings, what we are gaining here, will translate into our models and products, and that's the virtuous cycle, which I'm excited by. There's a lot more to come.\n\nJustin Post\n\nInternet Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today.\nI'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2024 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors.\nWe undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\nI'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. I will take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube, and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we have gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue.\nOf course, Search continues to power that, as you see in our Q1 results. In addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion.\nThis shows our track record of investing in and building successful, new, growing businesses. Now, let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make. One, research leadership. Two, infrastructure leadership. Three, innovation in Search. Four, our global product footprint. Five, velocity in execution. Six, monetization paths. First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry.\nLast week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress developing Gemini and other models.\nIn February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text, code, and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models, as well as image and visual models and others.\nSecond, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world.\nThey've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100x more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures.\nThis will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models, and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. AI innovations in Search are the third, and perhaps the most important, point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology.\nEach shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we have been experimenting with SGE and Search Labs across a wide range of queries. Now we are starting to bring AI Overviews to the main search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where GenAI can improve the search experience, while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants. We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features.\nIt's enabling people to access new information, to ask questions in new ways, and to ask more complex questions.\nMost notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who use the new AI Overviews, as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. With Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video, and get an AI overview with Lens. Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have six products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including 3 billion Android devices. Fifteen products have half a billion users, and we operate across 100+ countries.\nThis gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful GenAI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages, and more.\nWe are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. Fifth, improved velocity and execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model-building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader.\nLast week, we took another step, bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base.\nYou can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement. We continue to manage our headcount growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement, and efficiency. A number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs.\nFor example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in labs, driven by hardware engineering and technical breakthroughs. We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through ads and Cloud, as well as subscriptions.\nPhilip will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. Google One now has crossed 100 million paid subscribers. In Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Those are the six points. Now let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months.\nAt Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Centrica, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart, and many more.\nOur differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded GenAI startups and nearly 90% of GenAI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. Customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs, along with our TPUs. This includes TPU V5P, which is now generally available, and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google-designed and ARM-based CPU.\nIn benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems. On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open-source models, and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers, as well as Image 2.0 at Cloud Next.\nWe shared that more than 1 million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying GenAI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their GenAI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications.\nIn Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University, and PennyMac are using Gemini in Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. We introduced Gemini for meetings and messaging, and Gemini Security for Workspace.\nCustomers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence, and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days. Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming.\nWe announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. On subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million music and premium subscribers globally, including trailers.\nYouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. Finally, in other bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix, with high customer satisfaction. We started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin. Overall, it was a great quarter, and there's more to come. I/O is in less than three weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. I want to thank our employees around the world, who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services, and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world.Thank you, Philip.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior VP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar. Hi, everyone. Google services revenue of $70 billion were up 14% year-on-year.\nSearch and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical, with particular strength from APEX-based retailers, which began in the Q2 of 2023. YouTube ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective.\nFirst, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types.\nWe've talked about how solutions like smart bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand, and how products like Broad Match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale, and drive ROI, just keeps getting better.\nWe're especially excited about the doors GenAI is opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment. Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into PMax. It's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet PMax asset requirements instantly.\nThis is available to all US advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English, and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. Those who improve their PMax ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with GenAI. Those adopting ACA see, on average, 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns.\nThere's DemandGen. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touchpoints like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail, and Discover.\nHollywood film and TV studio Lionsgate partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type would deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games, Ballad of Songbirds, and Snakes film. Over a three-week test, DemandGen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks, with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out DemandGen for two new titles. We're also bringing new creative features to DemandGen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps, with a few simple prompts.\nThis will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. There's obviously Search Generative Experience, which Sundar talked about. I'll add that innovation in the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers.\nWe saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. We shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on, and confident in the role SGE, including ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the Q1. In Q1, retail was again a top contributor.\nOur focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and offline, as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences. Highlights include continued upsides for retailers leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, PMax, or both.\nTake Home Goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across Search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and offline sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options, and more, all in one ad format.\nMoving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences, and build their businesses.\nIn 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with 3 million+ channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years.\nFrom a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in US streaming watch time for the last 12+ months. In the Q1, Living Room benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube.\nViewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats: their favorite creators, live sports, breaking news, educational content, movies, music, and more. Advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. This brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth. On the ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter.\nShorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, Living Room, and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. In the US, the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the Q1 alone.\nJust last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on Connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that pause ads are driving strong brand lift results, and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers.\nBefore I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across cloud and ads.\nPart of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply GenAI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system, already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including the Coca-Cola Company, L'Oréal, and Nestlé. We're just getting started here, and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock.\nWith that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. A huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter. Ruth, you're up.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philip.\nWe are very pleased with our financial results for the Q1, driven in particular by strength in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the Q1, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the Q1, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15%, or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth.\nIn terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the Q1 of 2023 of $2.6 billion, as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the Q1 of 2024.\nAs you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the Q1 of 2023 versus 2024.\nIn terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube, given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content. On an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues were up 13% year-on-year.\nOperating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing, and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting, first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expense primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud, and, second, in sales and marketing, a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales.\nOperating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%. Net income was $23.7 billion, and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the Q1 and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months.\nWe ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results, within Google services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21%, driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues.\nCAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%, and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI, and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our other bets for the Q1, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the other bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google services, first within advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth, driven by brand and direct response. Looking ahead, two points to call out.\nFirst, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the Q2 of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the Q2.\nSecond, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the Q1 of 2023. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices, we continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only one week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4.\nLooking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play, driven by an increase in buyers. With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions, as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools.\nThe growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively, while remaining focused on profitable growth. As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet. First, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than one point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the Q1. Second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1.\nTurning to margins, our efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods.\nYou can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months, and a much slower pace of hiring. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind, and technical infrastructure. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure.\nWe believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the Q1 was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers.\nThe significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to other bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program, as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases.\nThe core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business, as you have heard us talk about today, given the extraordinary opportunities ahead.\nWe view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program. Thank you. Sundar, Philip, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, I wanted to ask about overall search behavior. Philip, I know you've talked in the past about how overall query trends continue to grow. Can I ask you to drill a little bit more into monetizable and commercial query trends?\nHave there been any changes in sort of your commercial query trend growth as there's been all these new entrants moving around in e-commerce? Is my first one. The second one for Ruth, when you talked about sort of more efforts to moderate expense growth from here, can you just sort of give us some examples of areas where you still see the potential for more optimization or work streams in place to continue to durably re-engineer the OPEX space as we go throughout 2024? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Brian. To your first question, look, I think broadly, we've always found that over many years when things work well on the organic side, monetization follows. Typically, the trends we see carry over well.\nOverall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI Overviews, we are definitely, I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions as well, and in general, that all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it's still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience at front, but we are positive about what this transition means.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nOn the second question, in terms of the various work streams, as both Sundar and I said, we remain very focused on ongoing efforts to slow the pace of expense growth, what we've been calling durably re-engineering our cost base. I made this point in opening comments, but we are very cognizant of the increasing headwind we have from higher depreciation and expenses associated with the higher CapEx.\nThese efforts are ongoing. They're very much the same that we've talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure. These are ongoing. As an example, the work that Sundar talked about, combining devices and services with our platforms and ecosystems, product areas are a really good example because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency.\nThe other work streams we've talked to you about in the past, like all of the work around technical infrastructure, which Sundar alluded to, streamlining operations within the company through the use of AI, what we're doing with procurement with our suppliers and vendors, which he also referenced, the work you've seen on real estate optimization.\nThese are all ongoing work streams, which is why we have them under the umbrella durably re-engineering our cost base, and they are ongoing.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks for taking the question. Sundar, you talked about bringing more generative AI features into the main search page. Can you just talk about what kind of queries or scenarios you think that that's working best for so far, and just how we should think about the cadence of continuing to adopt more of those features within core search? Ruth, on CapEx spending, the $12 billion in Q1, can we assume that run rating that and above is reasonable for this year? I know it's very early, but should we generally expect higher CapEx next year as well?\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Doug.\nOn SGE and search, look, I think it tends to really—we are seeing early confirmation of our thesis that this will expand the universe of queries where we are able to really provide people with a mix of factual answers, link to sources across the web, and bring a variety of perspectives, all in an innovative way. We've been rolling out AI Overviews in the US and UK, trying to mainly tackle queries which are more complex, where we think the SGE will clearly improve the experience. We've already served billions of queries, and it seems to cut across categories, but we are still continuing our testing and will keep—we are metrics-driven in these areas.\nWe'll—but I am optimistic that it clearly improves the user experience.\nUsers are telling us that, and we are seeing it in our metrics, and we'll continue evolving it through the course of this year.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of CapEx, as I said in opening comments, we do expect the quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the $12 billion cash CapEx we had here in Q1. As I said, you can always have variability in the reported quarterly CapEx just due to the timing of cash payments, but roughly at or above this level. It really goes to Sundar's opening comment that we're very committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure to support the growth in Cloud, all the innovation in search that he and Philipp have spoken about, and our lead with Gemini.\nI will note that most, nearly all, I should say, of the CapEx was in our technical infrastructure. We expect that our investment in office facilities will be less than 10% of the total CapEx in 2024, roughly flat with our CapEx in 2023, but is still there. With respect to 2025, as you said, it's premature to comment, so nothing to add on that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sach\n\nThanks so much. Maybe just one question of the big picture nature for Sundar.\nSundar, if we come back to your earlier comments at the beginning of the call and framing up longer-term initiatives and longer-term narratives, wondered if you could talk a little bit about both the opportunities and the challenges of operating at scale in a time like this where there's a lot of technology innovation going on, and how you see the elements of trying to strike a balance towards moving the organization forward while still continuing to both invest for growth as well as balance margins. Thanks so much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Eric. Great question. Obviously, I think the AI transition, I think it's a once-in-a-generation kind of an opportunity. We've definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine we started building TPUs in 2016. We've definitely been gearing up for a long time.\nThe real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation which we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way, and it impacts the entire breadth of the company, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Cloud, be it Waymo, and so on. We see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. It's a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead.\nIn terms of the challenges, I think making sure we are constantly—I think it's been a mindset shift which we've been driving across the company to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity, but being very efficient in how we are approaching it, making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company, building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year on year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible. Making sure balancing all of that, moving forward in a very bold and responsible way at the same time, those are the important things to get right from my perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nAll right. Thank you so much. Hi, Philip.\nI think it's approaching the two-year anniversary for the launch of ads on YouTube Shorts, and I think you've given us an update on monetization pickup sequentially. With that in mind, I think YouTube has launched an array of ad products and automation tools to help advertisers transfer what they're doing to the vertical screen. How is this translating into buy-in among your advertiser clients? Secondly, based on what you've seen over the last two years, are there any structural reasons that you can cite as to why the monetization cannot match what is already the case on the horizontal screen? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior VP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah. Look, this is a great question. First of all, I mean, it started with the fact that YouTube performance was very strong this quarter.\nOn Shorts, specifically in the US, I mentioned how the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the last 12 months. I think that's what you were referring to. Yes, we're obviously very happy with this development. The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. You can assume that this wouldn't be happening unless it were to work for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That's an important part, I think. Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video.\nWe talked about the strong growth, averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels uploading has increased 50% year over year.\nAgain, very happy with this development. To your question, structural reasons, whether we can't get to a match here, I have a hard time seeing those at the moment over time.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. I'm going to ask another one about CapEx. It seems to be your biggest investment area. First, you saw the big uptick the last two quarters, but you've been investing in AI for years. Is the uptick because supply is getting easier to get, or do you see more opportunities with the available supply to really fuel AI? Has the GPUs and everything gotten better that you feel more investing more?\nThinking about the returns both for advertising and Cloud on the CapEx, do you feel like this is a higher cost of doing business, or do you think this is an opportunity to even get better returns on your capital spend than you've had in the past? Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThe increase in CapEx, as Sundar said and I said, really reflects the opportunity we continue to see across the company. It starts with all that we're doing in support of the foundational model, called the Gemini foundational model, but then also clearly the work across Cloud on behalf of Cloud customers and the growth that we're seeing with GCP and the infrastructure work there. Of course, as both Sundar and Philipp talked about, the application across Search, YouTube, and more broadly, the services that we're able to offer.\nIt's the growing application and our focus on ensuring that we have the compute capacity to deliver in support of the services and opportunities we see across Alphabet. It really goes to the second part of your question, which is that as we're investing in CapEx and applying it across our various businesses, it opens up more service and products, which bring revenue opportunities, and we're very focused on the monetization opportunity. It does underlie everything that we're doing in Google Services and Google Cloud.\nAs Sundar noted, we're at the same time very focused on the efficiency of all elements of delivering that compute capacity from hardware, software, and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\n[Analyst] (Evercore)\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nGreat. Thank you. This is Jan Lee for Mark Mahaney. A couple of questions.\nOne, just maybe an extension on the search query questions from before. More like search volume, and maybe in the context of the off-Google environment, like AI chatbot, for example, we've seen kind of Meta AI directing to Google Search results. Do you think there's actually a scenario where an AI system can create a step function change in search volume or use cases off Google? Do you think it gives us more color on what you're seeing right now or what you're expecting to see in that area? The second question, on just the comment of YouTube and Cloud exiting at a $100 billion run rate, what is informing this outlook of visibility for you?\nIf you can talk about, is it driven by any sort of Cloud demand inflection or step change in the GenAI workload demand?\nIf you can flesh it out a little bit, thanks a lot.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nOn your first question, look, I said this before, but to be clear, we view this moment as a positive moment for search. I think it allows us to evolve our product in a profound way. Search is a unique experience. People come and they get to be it if you want answers, if you want to explore more, if you want to get perspectives from across the web, and to be able to do it across the breadth and depth of everything they are looking for, and the innovation you would need to keep that up. I think it's what we've been building on for a long time. I feel we are extraordinarily well set up, particularly given the innovation path we are on. Overall, I view this moment as a positive moment.\nThat's how I would say it. On the second part, Ruth?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nI'm sorry, what was the—I think\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nthe—YouTube and Cloud.\n\n[Analyst] (Evercore)\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nYeah. In terms of your comment about $100 billion exit rate for YouTube and Cloud, what's driving this visibility for you, and any kind of inflection you're seeing in the Cloud demand?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nI would just say from Sundar's opening comments, it's just the ongoing momentum that we've seen in the business that we've been talking about, the ongoing growth, the strong performance. What we were really getting at in that comment, what Sundar was getting at, is that we've continued to build strong businesses over time, and that just helps dimension it. We had similar comments last quarter when you talk about our subscription business.\nWe're really proud of all the work that teams are doing across the company, building new strong opportunities, delivering for our users, for customers, for advertisers in profound ways. It was just helping to dimension what we have built over the years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you very much. Two, if I may. First, on GCP, you had a nice acceleration in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunities and constraints upon GCP's ability to continue to address that large addressable market and accelerate growth? Is it more sales-oriented? Is it more product-based solutions or both? Do you plan to address most of these organically, or could a partner approach work for you? The second one, just more detailed on YouTube and sports rights.\nCould you reiterate your view on further live sports rights? There's some larger, mostly in the US, league rights coming up soon and will be more over the next several years. Could you just talk about your philosophy there beyond NFL Sunday Ticket? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks. Look, on the Cloud side, obviously, it's definitely a point of inflection overall. I think the AI transformation is making everyone think about their whole stack, and we are engaged in a number of conversations. I think be it AI infrastructure, people really looking to Vertex AI, given our depth and breadth of model choice, or using Workspace to transform productivity in your workplace, etc. I think the opportunities there are all related to that, both all the work we have built up and AI being a point of inflection in terms of driving conversations.\nI think you will see us do it both organically and with a strong partner program as well. We'll do it with a combination. The challenges here always are, and there are switching costs to Cloud, and the challenges we see are how do we make it easier for people? There's a lot of interest, but there are definitely barriers in terms of people switching. That's an area where we are constantly investing to make it easier for our customers.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior VP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nWith regard to your sports rights question, look, I mean, we've had long-standing and significant partnerships with the most popular sports league here in the US, around the globe: federations, teams, athletes, broadcasters.\nObviously, these partnerships in combination with our very vast audience of sports fans drive investment and subscription experiences across many offerings: NFL Sunday Ticket, YouTube TV, YouTube Prime Time channels, and so on. There is nothing that we have to announce at the moment. We are obviously always looking at where we can create more value for our users, for advertisers, for creators, but nothing specific to talk about at this moment.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nAnalyst, Barclays",
    "content2": "Great. Sundar, I had a question about smartphone-based AI searches. You guys are powering all these new AI interactions and searches on Pixel and on Samsung devices. I think there is speculation that Gemini might be used on iOS in the future state.\nThe question is, if users start searching on smartphones and those searches are basically rendered on the model on the phone without accessing the web, how do you guys anticipate monetizing some of these smartphone-based behaviors that are kind of run on the edge? Any thoughts on that?\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, I think if you look at what users are looking for, people are looking for information and an ability to connect with things outside. I think there'll be a set of use cases which you'll be able to do on-device. For a lot of what people are looking to do, I think you will need the richness of the Cloud, the web, and you have to deliver it to users. Again, to my earlier comments, I think through all these moments, you saw what we have done with Samsung, with Circle to Search.\nI think it gives a new way for people to access search conveniently wherever they are. I view this as a positive way to bring our services to users in a more seamless manner. I think it's positive from that perspective. In terms of on-device versus Cloud, there will be needs which can be done on-device, and we should to help it from a privacy standpoint. There are many, many things for which people will need to reach out to the Cloud. I don't see that as being a big driver in the on-Cloud versus off-Cloud in any way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Colin Sebastian with Baird. Your line is now open.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThanks. Good afternoon. I guess first, a follow-up on some of the questions on SGE and, of course, search.\nI guess I'm wondering, along with some of those changes in behavior, is there a way to quantify that overall engagement shift, whether that's an increase in time spent, or increase in, over the level of increase in queries for both sort of traditional search as well as more generative answers? Secondly, on the hardware roadmap, I assume later this year we'll hear more about some of the products. Any areas of particular focus or that you would point out that we should keep in mind in terms of hardware launches in the back half? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, on the first question on search, not much more to add to what I said, but what we have seen, and remember we've been in live experiments just for a few weeks in the US and UK and on a slice of our queries where all indications are positive that it improves user satisfaction. We see an increase in engagement. I see this as something which will play out over time. If you were to step back, this moment, there were a lot of questions last year, and we always felt confident and comfortable that we would be able to improve the user experience.\nPeople question whether these things would be costly to serve, and we are very, very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries. People worried about latency.\nI think when I look at the progress we have made in latency and efficiency, we feel comfortable. There are questions about monetization. Based on our testing so far, I am comfortable and confident that we'll be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well. It'll play out over time, but I feel we are well positioned. More importantly, when I look at the innovation that's ahead and the way the teams are working hard on it, I am very excited about the future ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our Q2 2024 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call.\nThank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Google\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Q4 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors discussed in our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended 31st December 2023. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Google\n\nHello, everyone. Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One, our investments in AI, including how it's helping search. Two, Subscriptions, which reach $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5x since 2019. Subscriptions are growing strongly, powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV, and Google One. Three, Cloud, which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our GenAI and product leadership. Four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. First, AI and search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products, from search to ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already.\nLast year brought new excitement around GenAI, and I'm proud of how we responded responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. We closed the year by launching the Gemini Era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video, and code in a natively multimodal way, and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers. Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities, and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products. That starts with Search.\nWe are already experimenting with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Search Generative Experience, or SGE, faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the US. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE. It's available through Search Labs in seven languages. By applying generative AI to search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs, and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People are finding it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding, such as education, or even gift ideas. We are improving satisfaction, including answers for more conversational and intricate queries.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 series. Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment. In addition to search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers.\nThat includes our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of Search campaigns. There is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements Search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding, and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra. That's a good segue to Subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues. Available in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users, and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience.\nPeople love the navigation, Multiview, and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found its perfect home on YouTube, and Philipp will talk about that more. Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well, with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products, and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well, and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers. From here, we are going to bring in more AI features, and look forward to more strong growth to come. Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad GenAI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform, and our new Duet AI agents.\nIn Q4, our product and GenAI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands, including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility, and Verizon. Google Cloud offers our AI hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software, and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Anthropic, Character AI, Essential AI, and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it. For developers building GenAI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment, and deploy over 130 GenAI models, including PaLM, MedPaLM, SecPaLM, and Gemini, as well as popular open-source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption, with the API request increasing nearly 6x from H1 to H2 last year.\nUsing Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals. Victoria's Secret and Company will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI, search, and conversations. Customers are increasingly choosing Duet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform, to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. It'll incorporate Gemini soon. In Workspace, Duet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber, and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duet AI assists software developers and cybersecurity analysts.\nDuet AI for Developers is the only GenAI offering to support the complete development and operations lifecycle, fine-tuned with the customer's own code corpus and policies. It's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances, and Commerzbank write better software faster with AI code completion, code generation, and chat support. With Duet AI in security operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify, and Pfizer. Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud GenAI-enabled consultants, and Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence. Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube, and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure.\nThis infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base, and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers, and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our Devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit, and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pool resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio.\nAcross different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. Through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings. That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano, with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages, and more to come. In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips.\nIsomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together. From our partners across the Android ecosystem, who are on display at CES, to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses, and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI startups and developers, and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024. Philip.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in Retail and APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year. YouTube Ads revenue was up 16% year-on-year, driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 2% year on year. In Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23%, driven by strong growth in Subscriptions. Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth. Over the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment.\nFrom a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about Demand Gen momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant, visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail, and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over 3 billion users as they stream, scroll, connect, and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and, on average, seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns. As we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better-performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ad's context. Adoption was up, with strong feedback in Q4.\nIn addition to now being available in eight languages, more advanced GenAI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. Last week's big news was that Gemini will power a new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open in beta to US and UK advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality Search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs, who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. We can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes. As we shared last quarter, ads will continue to play an important role in the new Search experience and will continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant Ads alongside Search results.\nWe've also found that people are finding Ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful, as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter, Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber 5. In Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to 2 times the deals in the US versus last season, as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop shop deals destination, new filters like Get It Fast, and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber 5.\nOur proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large US Big Box retailer who drove a 60%+ increase in omni ROAS and a 22%+ increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber 5. A well-known global fashion brand drove a 15%+ higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through Pick Up Later on Shopping ads. Moving on to YouTube, we're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4, and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before. YouTube success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans, and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform.\nMore creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. Via Ads and Subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across four pillars: Creation, Viewers, Monetization, and Responsibility. First, Creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices. We've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. GenAI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area, from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to Allowed for AI-powered dubbing.\nThere's more to come. Number two, Viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube, with strong growth in Shorts and Connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we're averaging 70 billion in daily views. Connected TVs, or what we refer to as the Living Room, is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket, and a range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together, and YouTube is the must-have app on every Connected TV. Monetization is pillar number three and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here.\nWe've rolled out CTV-first formats like 30-second non-skippable ads and pause experiences, as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with Ads. For Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early, we're learning, but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. Our AI-powered video formats, from Video Reach and Video View campaigns to Demand Gen and Video Action, continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. Ninety-plus upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium perform well.\nPremium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boosts earnings for creators, music, and media partners, and YouTube itself. We have made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles, and other enhancements. We are also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including Multiview, has been great. We are excited to continue to innovate here. Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We will continue to focus relentlessly on this. As always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4.\nWe just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others, earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google-built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, or putting Google AI to work for more customers, I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024. I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success. To our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year. Ruth, over to you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Google\n\nThank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full-year results, with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter, with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year, in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year, as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023.\nIn terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in Other cost of revenues, and OpEx based on associated headcount. Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64.\nWe delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on 16th October that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023, and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results, within Google services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in Retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16%, driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%.\nSubscriptions, Platforms, and Devices revenues, which we previously referred to as Other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP, with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million, and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets for the full year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion, and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets.\nTurning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services, first within Advertising, we were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base. Within Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full year 2023, driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high-value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One.\nPlay had solid growth again in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation, while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio. Turning to Google Cloud, we are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area.\nIn terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team, with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. Turning to margins and expenses, as we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably re-engineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include, first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities, and to reallocate resources where we can. Second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity.\nBoth product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our headcount down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring. We will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent. Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization, and optimizing our real estate portfolio. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers.\nThe step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, Cloud enterprise customers, and governments globally, and the long-term growth opportunities that offers. In 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023. With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside, given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two for Philipp. Philipp, the first one is about sort of a lot of the new generative AI advertising tools. You obviously have a lot of irons in the fire here, even talking about some of the early momentum with tens of thousands of advertisers. The question is, can you sort of walk us through some of the hurdles and gating factors that we should be thinking through that dictate the pace at which these tools can really be rolled out broadly, just so we and advertisers can kind of get an understanding for when they could have a bigger impact on the whole business? Secondly, how do you think about the long-term salesforce intensity of the advertising business as you roll more AI-based tools like PMax, impacting the overall ad allocation? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nYeah, thank you. Thank you so much. I've covered this a little bit on previous quarters. AI has been at the core of our advertising products for a very, very long time, and the recent advances are really allowing us to drive more value for advertisers across a large range of different areas: bidding, targeting, creative, as well as our core advertiser and publisher experiences. We are seeing in core search ads, for example, the bidding side, the Value-Based Bidding as a very significant one, on the targeting side, the broad match, on creatives, Responsive Search Ads, Automatically Created Ad Assets. We're very happy with the progress we're seeing in those areas.\nI think I mentioned in one of the previous calls that when you ask about hurdles and gating factors, the AI Essentials play a huge role in this, trying to get everybody ready to really take full advantage of those tools. We talked about the progress on PMax as well that we were very happy with in Q4. Overall, I think we are on track with what we're expecting here. On the salesforce intensity side, we have done a few reallocations, or let me call it portfolio adjustments. As you know, we have two large different teams. One is our LCS, a Large Customer Solutions team that's really focused on transformational growth for our largest and most sophisticated customers.\nWe have our, we call them GCS, Global Customer Solutions Team, which is the channel where really every customer starts from some of our largest customers now to also the millions of smaller ones and SMBs. The GCS is really then scaling growth by dynamically delivering really the right treatment for every customer. Important to note, it's also our fastest growing channel, and it delivered particularly strong growth in Q4. We have done adjustments here to focus more resources on the GCS side. I also want to be clear, when we restructure, there's always an opportunity to be more efficient and smarter in how we service and grow our customers. We're not restructuring because AI is taking away roles. That's important here. We see significant opportunities here with our AI-powered solution to actually deliver incredible ROI at scale. That's why we're doing some of those adjustments. I look at salesforce intensity as a stronger focus going forward on the channels I mentioned here.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, Philipp.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Ruth and one for Philipp. Ruth, you're now into year two, observably re-engineering the cost structure. Can you just help us assess your progress so far, and are there any guideposts that we should be thinking about going forward? Then, Philipp, can you talk more about NFL Sunday Ticket and just what your key learnings were in year one? How are you thinking about the returns on the investment, both from an advertising perspective and also subscribers to both Sunday Ticket and YouTube TV? Thanks.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Google\n\nThanks for the question. We are very pleased with the progress we're continuing to make, and we're very committed to the framework to durably re-engineer our cost base, really, as we're investing to support the growth priorities. I tried to call out a number of them in opening comments, but really, as you're looking at the work being done across Google, across Alphabet, it does start with product and process prioritization to make sure we've got the right resources behind the most important opportunities. That creates the opportunity for reallocating resources where we can. We talked a lot this quarter about organizational efficiency and structure, and we're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. The combination of those two, product prioritization and organizational design work, has resulted in the slower pace of hiring. You can see that in our headcount numbers down year-on-year.\nYou can see it in some of the results that we delivered in the fourth quarter. It also goes to the announcements around the first quarter and much slower pace of hiring. At this point in the quarter, we do estimate that severance-related expense will be roughly $700 million in the first quarter as we've continued these efforts. As I said in opening comments, we will continue to invest in top engineering. That's sort of the big one if you start with product prioritization and organizational design, which is why I also made the note about the severance-related expense, which helps pave the way as we're continuing to do the work that we're doing.\nWe have a host of other work streams, which I talked about, everything with improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, which is a very large ongoing effort, streamlining operations across Alphabet through use of AI, all the work we're doing with our suppliers and vendors, the work we're doing optimizing our real estate portfolio. When we've described durably re-engineering, it's about continuing to build on work that started and that is ongoing.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nOn the NFL Sunday Ticket side, as I said earlier, NFL Sunday Ticket supports our long-term strategy and really helps solidify YouTube's position as a must-have app on everyone's TV set. You ask about some of the learnings, maybe I started with the viewing experience. We've received great feedback so far. People like the navigation, Multiview, the chat, the lack of latency, really, really positive feedback on this one.\nYou ask about the ads and the Subs. Maybe I started with the Subscribers. We're pleased with the NFL Sunday Ticket sign-ups in our first season, both as part of the YouTube TV bundle and as a standalone offering on YouTube Primetime Channels. Remember, you can access them via both. Nothing more to share on the Subs side today on this one. On the Ad side, as you know, advertisers can buy from an NFL lineup as part of our YouTube Select portfolio. This actually allows advertisers to reach football fans across YouTube's pretty unique breadth of NFL content, independently of whether you're viewing live NFL games on YouTube TV or Primetime Channels, or watching NFL highlights or post-game commentary on YouTube channels. We saw solid demand across the ad market around our YouTube Sunday Ticket offering here.\nWe're excited about the partnership ahead or the partnerships ahead. This is our first season. I mentioned over 90 upfront and scattered advertisers partnered with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game opportunities, which we really appreciate.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Sundar, a bigger picture question coming back to your comments earlier in the call on Search Generative Experience. When you think about the evolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search and things like the Google Assistant continue to evolve in a world of Search Generative Experience and Bard and what that might mean for elements of commercial and non-commercial search and how use cases might change in the years ahead?\nRuth, I just wanted to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around one-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments, but are more elements of Other Bets and Alphabet-level activities. I just wanted to confirm where elements of those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that would be called out this quarter as well. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Google\n\nThanks, Eric. Great question. Look, it is an exciting time. Clearly, as I said, as we are incorporating SGE in the product, the early feedback is positive. We've been iterating on it, and it clearly works for certain types of queries very well. We are expanding the set of queries where it works very well.\nIt definitely is answering a certain category of queries for the first time in a better way. That gives us direction to proceed as well. Overall, one of the things I think people underestimate about Search is the breadth of Search, the amount of queries we see constantly on a new day, which we have not seen before. The trick here is to deliver that high-quality experience across the breadth of what we see in search. Over time, we think Assistant will be very complementary. We will again use generative AI there, particularly with our most advanced models and Bard, and it allows us to act more like an agent over time if I were to think about the future and maybe go beyond answers and follow through for users even more. That is directionally what the opportunity set is. Obviously, a lot of execution ahead. I think we have a deep sense of what to do. All the work we have taken so far, the feedback has been super positive.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Google\n\nIn terms of your other question, on the real estate charge, the $1.2 billion in exit charges related to real estate, that is in Alphabet-level activities. The other comment I was making in opening comments is when you go through the various line items, R&D, etc., you see it spread there. We have a table, and IR can walk anybody through the technicals on that just to understand how it then gets arrayed across the various lines in the P&L.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. I have two for Philipp, I think. Given the importance of connected TV engagement in YouTube, can you talk about the opportunity outside the US for connected TV and what the company is doing at large to drive more adoption of YouTube or connected TVs, given the Google operating system? Anything you talk about outside the US. You have been consistent about the strength of Shorts over the past year. Can you talk a bit about the monetization challenges? Do you still see the headwinds that you saw at the beginning? Anything you can share about the density of the auction or advertising interest on Shorts? Help us with whether or not that's still a headwind to growth. Thanks so much.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nYeah, thank you so much for your question. On the connected TV side, I mentioned it actually continues to perform really well. I said before, YouTube is the leader in US. Streaming watch time. It's not just one audience group diving deep. It's really all audiences on the international side. It's something we are closely looking at. There's nothing specific I have to add at this moment in time on this one. On the Shorts monetization side, look, we built Shorts to respond to the huge demand from both creators and viewers for short-form video. We're very pleased with the growth we've seen. I mentioned $2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, $70 billion in daily views.\nSpecifically to the monetization question, Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. In fact, actually, since we introduced revenue sharing for Shorts, the total creator earnings generated from Shorts have increased every month. We expect this to continue and, similar, obviously, to our long-form videos. We're really committed here to a long-term partnership. You heard me say this before, right?When creators succeed, we succeed.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks, Philipp.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stephen Ju with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nStock Analyst, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you so much. Philipp, this is not a new question, but it's also been about two years since PMax was launched. It seems like there has been this long lineage of product development and rollout of things like Smart Bidding in your history, which I believe at the time was designed to help smaller advertisers more easily run Search advertising. Today, you're helping me generate creatives as well as manage my spend and maximize ROI across multiple Google surfaces. How are you feeling about enabling SMBs who otherwise could not advertise with you before? What kind of TAM expansion tailwind does that create for your revenue growth over the longer term? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Google\n\nLook, as you know, SMBs are a huge focus for us. We mentioned this several times before. They're part of our GCS channel. Not only is there more in this, but they've been under a ton of change over the last few years. Our focus has always been here on investing in solutions that really help level the playing field. You mentioned several of those. Actually, SMBs can compete with bigger brands and more sophisticated advertisers. The feedback we're always getting is they need easy solutions that drive value quickly. Several of the AI-powered solutions that you're mentioning are actually making the workflow and the whole on-ramp, the bidding, targeting, creative, and so on, you mentioned, so much easier for SMBs. We're very satisfied with what we're seeing here. We will continue to invest. I feel AI is really a helpful, very interesting future path to make life not only easier, but also much more productive and better ROIs over time, more level playing field for SMBs.\n\nStephen Ju\n\nStock Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Justin Post with BAML. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nSenior Internet Technology Analyst, BAML\n\nGreat. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Just on search growth, I think there are some concerns on use of competitive AI tools as an alternative to search. Just wondering if you've seen any changes in query volumes, positive or negative, since you've seen the year evolve and more Search Generative Experiences. What can really make Google stand out versus other AI tools? Ruth, CapEx was $11 billion, a step up, obviously. Any one-time items in there, or is that how we should think about the new run rate into 2024?Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Google\n\nThanks, Justin. First of all, look, we think about effects on Search, obviously, more broadly. People have a lot of information choices, and user expectations are constantly evolving. We've been doing this for a long time. I think what ends up mattering is a strong, continuous track record of innovation. Obviously, generative AI is a new tool in the arsenal, but there's a lot more that goes into search: the breadth, the depth, the diversity across verticals, the ability to follow through, getting actually access to rich, diverse sources of content on the web, and putting it all together in a compelling way. I think through the year too, when we test, we test Search Generative Experience, particularly against everything that's out there, and we can see the progress we are making and how much users are liking the experience better.\nI think I feel very good about the progress. Our roadmap for 2024 is strong, both on search and the underlying AI progress, including the models. I'm pretty excited about what's ahead of us in 2024.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Google\n\nWith respect to CapEx, the CapEx of $11 billion in the fourth quarter, as I indicated, was overwhelmingly investment in our technical infrastructure. To your question, there was no one-time item in there. What it really reflects is our outlook for everything, Sundar and Philipp. I've been talking about the extraordinary applications of AI within Google DeepMind, Google Services, and Google Cloud. It's across the board for users, advertisers, developers, Cloud enterprise customers, and governments. It's really the long-term opportunity that offers. Last quarter, we did note that CapEx would continue to grow in 2024.\nWe do expect 2024 full-year CapEx to be notably larger than 2023. As a note, I think you all know this, but timing of cash payments can affect the quarterly CapEx number. The main point is we're continuing to invest.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. I guess the question for, I don't know if this is Sundar or Philipp, if we go back to the DOJ trial that happened in the fall, there was a document that was disclosed from Google that said something along the lines of, why leaning on ad quality team to deliver 20% RPM growth in search is a fragile strategy. It was dating back to 2019. Your business has, I think, more than doubled since then. I guess as we sit here today in early 2024, how do you feel about Google's ability to drive Search RPM going forward? I guess in the context of what Ruth said tonight about the large revenue base, just how do you feel about the monetization? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Google\n\nLook, I think I have tremendous confidence in the quality-driven, both our workbeat, Search quality, Ads quality, our improvements on Search, our improvements on Ads RPM. All two foundational pillars are extraordinary focus on Ads quality so that we deliver the actual ROI to advertisers and improve the experience for users, and all underpinned by rigor and technical excellence, and go-to-market excellence, right? The fundamental attributes don't change. I think AI gives us opportunity both on the organic side as well as on the monetization side. I think we are in the early days of it. I think we'll be able to, taking a long-term view, serve information needs in a deeper way. I think about it with that long-term context. I'm pretty excited about what's ahead.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will be from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay. Thanks. One question on YouTube AI and one on cCoud. On Cloud first, there's just this volatility, this material deceleration last quarter, and then nice reacceleration this quarter. Is that explained by where we are in the optimization cycle and maybe Generative AI workloads starting to trickle in now and cause that growth curve to bend back up? Any commentary just on sort of the volatility, the deceleration, and the reacceleration that we've seen? Philip, I want to ask on the creative side, particularly on YouTube and Ads and using AI to improve the creative and really to offer SMBs who have been with Google forever, but offer them now performance-based video ad campaigns created by AI. Is that kind of a new growth area? How far along are you in terms of offering this out into the market? Do you think that this opens up a new area of spend that wasn't there before? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Google",
    "content2": "Thanks, Mark. On Cloud, let me take that. First of all, a combination of factors, I think. I think definitely excitement around the AI solutions on top of our foundational pillar, be it Data Analytics, Infrastructure, Security, etc. AI is definitely something which is driving interest and early adoption.\nAs you saw, greater than 70% of GenAI unicorns are using Google Cloud. I think it's an area where our strengths will continue to play out as we go through 2024, especially when I look at the innovation ahead from us on the AI front. I think there are regional variations, but the cost optimizations in many parts are something we have mostly worked through. I think that was a contributing factor as well. On your YouTube question, maybe let me start with a general view. YouTube's mission has enabled millions of creators around the world to share their voice, connect with audiences, and obviously build thriving businesses here. AI has been a very critical piece of this already.\nYou are obviously aware of the Made on YouTube announcement where we introduced a whole lot of new complementary creativity features on YouTube, including Dream Screen, for example, and a lot of other really interesting tools and thoughts. You can obviously imagine that we can take this more actively to the advertising world already. As you know, it continues already to power AI, a lot of our video ad solutions, and measurement capabilities. It's part of Video Reach campaigns, multi-format ads are. Actually, there is generative Creator Music that actually makes it easier for creators to design the perfect soundtrack already. As I said earlier, AI will unlock a new world of creativity.\nYou can see how this will, if you just look at where models are heading, where multimodal models are heading, where the generation capabilities of those models are heading, you can absolutely see how this will impact and positively impact and simplify the flow for creators, similar to what you see already emerging in some of our core products like ACA on the search side.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Google\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2024 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Q3 2023 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Form 10-K, including our risk factor section, and our Form 10-Qs. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\nOur comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. Now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'm pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrates strong growth in Search, in YouTube, and momentum in Cloud. Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century, and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about. Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube, and Made by Google. It's all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter. First, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring generative AI capabilities into Search.\nWe have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses, and generating imagery. We have also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive, with strong growth in adoption. In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan, with more countries and languages to come. As we add features and expand into new markets, we are engaging with the broader ecosystem, and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy, open internet. With generative AI applied to search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives.\nWe are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience. People are finding ads helpful here, as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use generative AI to create relevant, high-quality ads customized to every step of the search journey. The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here. It's a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search. Bard can now integrate with Google Apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and hotels.\nWe have also improved the Google It feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web. Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice, or images, and in the coming months, you'll be able to opt in on Android and iOS mobile devices. Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction. Third, we are enabling developers, businesses, and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI, and we'll share more there in a minute.\nWe are building and deploying AI responsibly so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online. Using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye, without reducing the image quality. Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they've been working on soon. As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term, sustainable financial value.\nAcross Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible, focused on their biggest priorities. Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3, NFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multi-view feature, which can livestream up to four games on a single screen. We have heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and livestream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale. I'm really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views, and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month.\nAt Made on YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dream Screen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to Shorts. YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing Shorts, longer videos, or both. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of infrastructure, data and AI, workspace collaboration, and cybersecurity solutions. We offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale. Today, more than half of all funded generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Ryder, and more.\nWe continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost-efficient and versatile accelerator to date. On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models, including popular third-party and open-source models, as well as tools to quickly build search and conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7x, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials. Duet AI was created using Google's leading large foundation models and is specially trained to help users to be more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of cloud products and services.\nWith Duet AI, we are helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity. We are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data, and customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within Slides, organizing data in Sheets, and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticário, Unilever, and Warner Music.\nWe also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations, and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running, and refining searches by seven times. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with generative AI, helping product customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry and Associates, and CoverMyMeds. Turning to hardware, we unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest-growing smartphone brand in our top markets, and the only one that grew in units sold year-over-year.\nOur portfolio of Pixel products are brought to life thanks to a combination of foundational technologies, AI, Android, and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It's designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones. New AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images, and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features. I also want to mention Chromebooks Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware with built-in Google apps, and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years, more than any other operating system.\nIn other beds, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride-hail city. Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products. Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. I'll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for ads: Google AI, retail, and YouTube, that we've identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Google services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year on year.\nIn Google Advertising Search and Other, revenues grew 11% year on year, led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube ads, revenues were up 12% year on year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In network, revenues declined 3% year on year. Google Other revenues were up 21% year on year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues. Let's start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models to LLMs to generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers, and more helpful, delightful experiences for users. We covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max, and new campaign types like Demand Gen. As Sundar said, we're continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE.\nIt's extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their search journeys. I'll highlight more ways we're innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business. In retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI, and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season. Let me share some themes.\nNumber one, with a maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, and expectations for many micro-peaks beyond Cyber Five, we're arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including OptiScore and Performance Planner, to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets, and targets to stay competitive, and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy. Number two, consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We've seen 4x deals queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they'll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings, like merchant promotions and fulfillment options. We're making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we'll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year.\nNumber three, no surprise, omnichannel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni-product solutions, including local inventory ads, omni-bidding, and PMax for store goals, retailers big and small are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers. Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images. Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It uses the best of Gen AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We're seeing early merchant testers using it to seasonalize their content for the holidays. Let's shift to YouTube.\nIt's worth repeating, our intense focus on creator success, coupled with our multi-format strategy, are at the center of how we think about YouTube's long-term growth. Shorts, Connected TV, and our subscription offerings are key drivers here. We're investing across each to solidify YouTube's position as the best place to create, the best place to watch, and the best place to deliver results. Sundar mentioned watch time and engagement momentum on Shorts, as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for Connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million plus people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the U.S.. Whether it's music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, Shorts, a continuous stream of Mr. Beast, or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety.\nWe're giving it to them all in one place. To help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens, and formats, we're bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions. AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From DreamScreen and YouTube Create, which Sundar talked about, to features that auto-adopt content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we're just getting started. We're also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments, launched last week, uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. There's Video Reach campaigns, which are expanding to InFeed and Shorts, and will be generally available in November.\nAI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost. With Video View campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across InStream, InFeed, and Shorts, and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they're driving 40% more views on average versus InStream alone. For YouTube and other feed-based services, there's our new Demand Gen campaign, which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today's social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll, and connect. It combines video and image ads in one campaign with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google, and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI.\nDemand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota. Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners. In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the U.S., our curated online news experience and licensing program with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed on to News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries today. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong. With that, I'll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication. Ruth, over to you.\nThank you, Philip.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nWe are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search, in YouTube, and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%. Growth here was primarily driven by content acquisition costs, mainly for YouTube subscription offerings.\nAs noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year. Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6%, reflecting the following: first, an increase in R&D expenses driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, sales and marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year. Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $146 million. Net income was $19.7 billion.\nThis reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits, which had an outsized impact on the third quarter rate because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods. We delivered free cash flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on 16 October 2023, we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to segment results, within Google services, revenues were $68 billion, up 11%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12%, driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%. Other revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV, followed by YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $12.6 billion, up 7%. Google services operating income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries, and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts.\nGoogle Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%. As to our other bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google services, first within advertising. After a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter. Second, within other revenues, in our YouTube subscription products, the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth. Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues, as well as associated content acquisition costs, will be reflected in Q4 results compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter.\nPlay had solid growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. With respect to hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments, as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter. Turning to Google Cloud, we are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP, Workspace, and the potential benefit of our AI solutions, including infrastructure and services such as Vertex AI and Duet. We continue to invest aggressively, given the significant potential we see, while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we're pleased with our operating performance.\nAs we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably re-engineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of work streams in place. First, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization, and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities. Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work, to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions. Third, we have engineering work streams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on efficiency of our operations there.\nWe are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI. Finally, there are ongoing work streams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization. To be clear, across the portfolio of other bet companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus, and to operate more efficiently and effectively. With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points. First, cost of sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches, as well as increased CAC for YouTube, as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year, in part to support product launches and the holiday season.\nFinally, our reported CapEx in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The growth in reported cash CapEx in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter to quarter. We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to deliver sustainable financial value. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone.\nTo prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been asked. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, maybe somewhat of a jump ball. There's somewhat of an investor debate about sort of the incremental return on capital to search when it comes to AI. I know it's early, but are there any examples that you're seeing with SGE Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement, just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments? The second one, Ruth, I know you've spoken a lot about durably re-engineering the cost base. I think in the past, you talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024.\nIs that sort of still the high-level way to think about it, or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nRuth, do you want to take the second part?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nSure. Thanks for that, Brian. Overall, that's sort of a truism, as you know well, that looking to grow revenues at a faster rate than expenses as we're focused on delivering sustainable financial value. That really takes us to the work streams, which I tried to tick through again. Those remain the driver. They're the real priority. Those are the efforts that are going to enable us to keep expense growth as moderated as possible while supporting the investment growth that is so exciting in front of us, in particular around AI.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nTo your first part, obviously, we see AI as a foundational platform shift, and we are excited about the opportunities across our business. It starts with search, and I've been pretty pleased with how the use of feedback has been on SGE. We are rolling it out to more users. Through it all, we are making sure the product works well, and we are generating value for our ecosystem, and that transition adds well. I think I view this as, with AI, the opportunity to evolve search and assistant over the next decade ahead. I think, as we've always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side. I do think over time, there'll be newer paths, just like we have done on YouTube.\nI think with the AI work, there are subscription models as a possible path as well. Obviously, all of the AI investments we are doing apply across cloud too, and I'm pretty optimistic about what's ahead there as well.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, you talked a lot about AI, and I was hoping you could talk more about Gemini and how it will differentiate from other models, some of the multimodal capabilities, and what new experiences or agents you think it could unlock, and how we should think about timing.\nJust on cloud, hoping you can talk about some of the factors there on the DSL and cloud, and what you're seeing in terms of optimizations, and is there any sign of new workload deployment taking place?\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks. Good question. On Gemini, obviously, it's an effort from our combined Google DeepMind team. I'm very excited at the progress there, and as we're working through getting the model ready. To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next generation series of models we'll be launching throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient at tool and API integrations, and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well.\nWe are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we'll be using it immediately across all our products internally, as well as bringing it out to both developers and cloud customers through Vertex. I view it as a journey, and each generation is going to be better than the other, and we are definitely investing, and the early results are very promising. On cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we have definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing, and that was a factor. We are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now. Just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7x.\nWe see signs of stabilization, and I'm optimistic about what's ahead.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you, Sundar.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you, sir, very much for taking the questions. Two, if I could. Sundar, you guys led over a year ago, starting with Performance Max. I wanted to know if we could get your updated thoughts on how AI might impact the broader advertising industry and how you're aligning Alphabet and Google's goals with AI and where it might take the advertising industry in the years ahead. That'd be the first question. About a year ago, Philip and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing.\nAs we start to lap those headwinds, how should we be thinking about a broad recovery in brand advertising versus elements of still headwinds that are being faced in the broader ad space, specifically with YouTube? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMaybe I take the first one. We're very pleased with how Performance Max is performing. It gives advertisers really maximum performance across all inventory from one really AI-powered campaign. It's probably the ultimate example of AI in action across our ads products. It's delivering excellent ROI. Those using it achieve, on average, over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action. Since rolling it out about two years ago, we've continued to expand the features, give advertisers additional ways to steer how it works. We have a lot of things like account-level negative keywords, other details here.\nWe launched new lifecycle goals, customer lifecycle goals, we call them, a revamped asset creation flow that really helps business adapt and scale their most successful creatives. I think that's one to watch. We will also continue to build other new PMAX features based on all the advertiser feedback we're seeing. We're very, very encouraged by the progress here. Overall, maybe there was a second part to your question a bit on what we're hearing from the customers out there. Look, driving ROI and efficiency is still top of mind for many, right? It's a rapidly shifting and still quite unpredictable consumer landscape out there. Our AI tools are very well received. AI, Gen AI are top of mind for everybody, really. There's a ton of excitement, lots of questions about it. Many understand the value.\nNearly 80% of our advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product. Yeah, we're hearing a lot of good feedback on, number one, our ads AI essentials, which are really helping to unlock the power of AI and set up for durable ROI growth on the advertiser side. Those are products like the foundation for data and measurement, things like Google Tag, Consent Mode, and so on. Obviously, search and PMAX, we talked about it, and then all the Gen AI products, all those different ones. There's a whole lot of interest in those products,\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nYeah. On to your second question regarding YouTube, as we said, overall year-on-year growth in revenues was driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Very much to your question, yes, there was a stabilization in spending by advertisers. We're really pleased about that.\nWe're particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the living room and on Shorts. As I said, that's both watch time growth and monetization. I would say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search, retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube. That really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor. Quite a number of things going on. Feel good about the results the team was able to deliver here.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. Great.\n\nLloyd Walmsley\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks for taking the question. Two, if I can, first, as we just think about the rollout of SGE across the user base, how far along is that, how do you balance the product rollout and consumer uptake versus monetization in that transition? The second one, also sort of generative AI related, how quickly are you guys finding new ways of optimizing, whether that's shrinking model sizes, chip efficiencies, or anything else? Do you think overall capital intensity of the business scales up, or do you just find ways to do this more efficiently as usage scales? Anything you could share there would be great. Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nOn the first part about SGE, we are still in very early days in terms of how much we have rolled it out, but we have definitely gotten it out to enough people, both geographically across user segments, and enough to know that the product is working well. It improves the experience. There are areas to improve, which we are fine-tuning. Our true north here is getting at the right user experience we want to, and I'm pretty comfortable seeing the trajectory. We've always worked through these transitions, be it from desktop to mobile, or from now mobile to an AI-enhanced experience. It's nothing new, and I feel very comfortable that as we go through it, the strength of our teams, both on the organic side, as well as ad side, to drive the right experience for users, including ads, will pay dividends.\nI think we'll continue to make improvements and make progress there. On your second question, at a high level, I would say all through the 20 we just celebrated 25 years, and of all the things I was proud about, when I looked at the strength of the work we have done across our infrastructure as a company, our technical infrastructure as a company, and at various given stages at a given moment in time, when we adopted new generations of technology, we have looked at the cost of it. The curves, the efficiency curves we have driven on top of it have always been phenomenal to see, and I see the current moment as no different.\nAlready through this year, we are driving significant efficiencies, both in our models, in training costs, and serving costs, and our ability to adapt what's needed to the right use case. I think we'll do everything that is needed to make sure we have the leading AI models and infrastructure in the world, bar none, and we'll continue driving efficiencies from there.\n\nLloyd Walmsley\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you. I'm going to ask you guys a multi-part question on YouTube TV. Firstly, what were the broader objectives for getting Sunday Ticket? How did it perform versus those objectives? What lessons have you learned from having the NFL Sunday Ticket, and how did that affect your appetite for more sports going forward? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP, Alphabet\n\nAs Sundar said earlier, we're several weeks into our first season, and we're very pleased with how it's going. I think in the broader context, you have to look at it as our overall YouTube subscription strategy. The great feedback we've gotten so far on the YouTube experience is very, very significant. People love the navigation, they love Multiview, they love the chats, and the polls. Frankly, people are very happy with the lack of latency here. The number one piece of concrete feedback the team has gotten is actually that people want the ability to pick their own games from Multiview, which is Multiview's awesome feature we started rolling out on YouTube TV that gives fans the ability to basically watch multiple streams here at once.\nYeah, overall, the teams are working hard to build a fantastic experience, and we are really trying to stay focused on getting our first season right and providing the best possible experience, really, for fans here.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thanks. A couple of questions on Q4. Can you provide any color on if there's been any pause in advertising around the Middle East conflict in October? Anything we should be aware of for Q4? Then, second, when we do think about the Sunday Ticket impact, I know you can't give us revenues or expenses, but overall, would that be a headwind to margins in Q4 or something we should be thinking about? Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nLook, on the first question, obviously, this is a tragic, tragic—there are no words to talk about what's going on. All of our focus has been on supporting our people there and how our products can be as helpful as possible in this very painful time broadly. Nothing really to add. In terms of the second question, Sunday Ticket, the only thing I tried to call out there is that clearly this is the first full quarter of Sunday Ticket that is contributing overall to the subscription revenues that we see. That's in part of other revenues. Also, obviously, it is contributing to higher CAC in the fourth quarter. Tried to make that really clear. As we look longer term, we expect to generate an attractive return over the life of the deal.\nWe're continuing to invest in support of this and excited about the additional opportunities that come out of it, working with partners to deliver clips and other opportunities. As we've said, we've heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. This is really a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence of scale and really leverage a lot of the extraordinary magic at YouTube and across Google. That's what we're excited about.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you so much. Two questions, if I may. First, how do you think about the future structure of AI-driven search capabilities? Will activity remain centralized in a search bar, or will it be decentralized and present in many different applications, including on third-party applications?\nYou alluded to Bard being integrated into multiple Google experiences early in the call. The second question is, any update on the Chrome cookie deprecation planned to begin in Q1 2024? What have you seen so far based on your early testing of Privacy Sandbox? What advertiser feedback have you received?\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nOn your first question, look, I broadly think of it as people are looking for information. They've always looked for it in many, many different ways. We've given the product search example. People can directly go to Amazon as an example or come to Google. If you zoom back and take an information view of the world, there's always been many different ways to get it.\nPart of our work we do in making search be world-class and give users what they're looking for is so that we can get at as much of that intent as possible. I don't see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways people could get information, but we worked hard to make search work better in the mobile world. Similarly, I view with AI, there will be many ways people will get information, but it also offers us an opportunity in search and in assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases which we couldn't have done before, and expand the diverse set of needs where we are a source. That's how I see the opportunity ahead.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP, Alphabet\n\nTo the second part of your question, yes, Chrome still plans to begin phasing out third-party cookies in the second half of 2024.\nIn the last several months, Chrome has really made significant progress on the Privacy Sandbox with APIs for developer testing, and they're now generally available in Chrome. Our ads team is testing these APIs. As we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interspace ads testing showed that a combination of what we call privacy-preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookieless future. We also recently announced that in Q1 2024, we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users. This will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies. We're overall encouraged by the ecosystem engagement on Privacy Sandbox. We'll continue to work with industry and regulators on how these technologies can support the transition to, frankly, a more private web.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you. Two questions, please. Ruth, you talked about these elevated levels of investments in Q4 and in 2024. I'm sorry, were you referring to just CapEx or CapEx and total expenses? On the comments around stabilization in cloud, is this something that you just started to see in the September quarter, or had you seen that starting earlier in the year? If you just started seeing it in the September quarter, would you have any thoughts on why you would have seen it, why Google Cloud would have seen it maybe later than some of the other hyperscalers? Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nI think what you're referring to is my CapEx comment.\nI was trying to make the point that we are committed to meaningfully investing in CapEx, given all the opportunities we see. We do continue to expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. It will be increasing in the fourth quarter. I talked about some of the difference in timing, muted timing in the third quarter due to the timing of supplier payments. I tried to make it clear that we will continue to grow CapEx in 2024, or more specifically to your question, 2024 aggregate CapEx will be above the full year 2023. That was the main one. As it relates to cloud, as Sundar said, what we're really excited about is the revenue growth does reflect healthy customer adoption across the portfolio, and that's infrastructure, data analytics, security.\nWhere I can't comment on others, we feel good about where we're sitting here and looking forward, and we'll let you do the forecasting. GCP growth in the third quarter was above the growth rate for cloud overall, and we feel really good about the work that they're doing there. Of course, in addition to that is all of the contribution from Google Workspace.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nHead of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2023 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, a`nd welcome to Alphabet's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\nI'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim. Hello, everyone. We are holding our call from London today. It's an important hub for us, and I'm excited to spend time with our local teams, including Google DeepMind, as well as leaders and partners from across the region. This quarter, we shared great progress at I/O, Brandcast, and Google Marketing Live, and we are looking forward to Cloud Next in August. The momentum across the company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in search and YouTube, ongoing strong growth in cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. We continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities. Today, I'll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI, and our excitement about the evolution of search.\nAt I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways. First, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful, models like PaLM 2, and soon Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make Search even more natural and intuitive. User feedback has been very positive so far.\nIt can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping-off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I'm proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we've boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We'll deliver even faster responses over time. We are engaging with the broader ecosystem, and will continue to prioritize approaches that send valuable traffic and support a healthy, open web.\nAds will continue to play an important role in this new search experience. Many of these new queries are inherently commercial in nature. We have more than 20 years of experience serving ads relevant to users' commercial queries, and SGE enhances our ability to do this even better. We are testing and evolving placements and formats, and giving advertisers tools to take advantage of generative AI. Philipp will talk more about how we are using generative AI in our ads products to better serve both advertisers and users. Second, we are helping people use AI to boost their creativity and productivity. One example is Bard, our experiment in conversational AI. Since launching in March, it continues to get better. We rolled out a number of exciting features and capabilities earlier this month. Bard is now available in most of the world, and over 40 of the most widely spoken languages.\nWe also added Google Lens capabilities so you can take an image and ask all kinds of questions, turn it into code, and more. This new feature has been really popular, and it's been great to see people sharing their experiences. Bard can now read its responses aloud, and you can adjust them for tone and style. We continue to see great interest in using Bard for coding tasks. On productivity, earlier this year, we introduced Duet AI in both Google Cloud and Workspace. It helps people collaborate with AI to code, write, and get better insights from data, and more. Today, more than 750,000 Workspace users have access to the new features in preview. Third, we are making it easier for others to innovate using AI. One way is by providing Google Cloud's high-performance infrastructure optimized for a range of generative AI models.\nIt's being used by thousands of customers and partners to transform their businesses. I'll give an update on the cloud business in just a moment. Finally, we are making sure we develop and deploy AI technology responsibly, so that everyone can benefit. Last week, we signed on to joint commitments with other leading AI companies at the White House, building on the principles that have guided our work for many years. To take advantage of the AI opportunities ahead, we have been sharpening our focus as a company, investing responsibly with great discipline, and finding areas where we can operate more cost-effectively. We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring, and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities.\nThis quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze's ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small, fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher-priority activities within the company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of GenAI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface, and many more.\nWe provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs, and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA's H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly two times better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market, and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open source, in our Vertex, Search, and Conversational AI platforms, with the number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June. Among them, Priceline is improving trip planning capabilities, Carrefour is creating full marketing campaigns in a matter of minutes, and Capgemini is building hundreds of use cases to streamline time-consuming business processes.\nOur new anti-money laundering AI helps banks like HSBC identify financial crime risk, and our new AI-powered target and lead identification suite is being applied at Cerebel to help enable drug discovery. Our generative AI capabilities also give us an opportunity to win new customers and upsell into our installed base of 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. I mentioned Duet AI earlier. Instacart is using it to improve customer service workflows, and companies like Xtend are scaling sales outreach and optimizing customer service. Customers confidently choose Workspace because of the safety and security we provide their distributed workforces. Our AI capabilities are helping us differentiate core products like cybersecurity. We have integrated AI throughout our portfolio, winning organizations like Pfizer, who are using Google Cloud to transform their security operations.\nChronicle Security Operations Suite, with Mandiant fully integrated, is helping customers stay protected at every stage of the security lifecycle. In the first half of 2023, we saw a 35% increase in incident response engagements compared to the same period last year. Finally, our AI capabilities are also expanding our partner ecosystem. With hundreds of ISVs and SaaS providers such as Box, Salesforce, and Snorkel, and the world's largest consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte, they've collectively committed to train more than 150,000 people on Google Cloud generative AI. Turning next to YouTube, earlier this year, we shared that revenues across YouTube products were nearly $40 billion for the 12 months ending in March. I'm really pleased with how YouTube is growing audiences and driving increased engagement. YouTube Shorts are now watched by over 2 billion logged-in users every month, up from 1.5 billion just one year ago.\nThe Living Room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time. We are reaching more than 150 million people on connected TV screens in the US, and seeing growth and momentum internationally. On subscriptions, there is good growth. Late last year, we announced over 80 million YouTube Music and Premium subscribers. Sign-ups for NFL Sunday Ticket kicked off in April, and we look forward to hosting our first football season on YouTube this fall. Finally, hardware and Android. Pixel continues to have strong sales momentum. We introduced new Pixel devices at I/O, including Pixel Fold, Pixel Tablet, and Pixel 7a, and we have had a great response. Android 14, our latest OS, will incorporate our advances in generative AI to personalize Android phones. The Pixel and Android teams are working together to advance the latest devices.\nThe Pixel Fold is a great example with its many hardware and software innovations. Before I close, you may have seen that we just announced some exciting news that Ruth is taking on the important new role of President and Chief Investment Officer. As our longest-serving CFO, she has helped guide the company through an amazing period of growth, a global pandemic, and the ongoing economic uncertainty that has followed. I'm excited to continue to work with Ruth, who will lead our 2024 planning and remain as CFO while we do a full search for a successor. It is business as usual now, and no change in approach for the future. I look forward to seeing the impact Ruth will have in our new role, driving our investments, engaging with our stakeholders, and creating opportunities for people and communities everywhere.\nTo close, I'm energized by the pace of innovation and the momentum across the company. With 15 products that each serve half a billion people, and six that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission. Thank you to our employees around the world for their great work this quarter. Over to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Happy to be here with you all today. Let's jump right into our performance for the quarter. Google Services revenues of $66 billion were up 5% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, search and other revenues grew 5% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand, followed by direct response, reflecting further stabilization in advertiser spend. In Network, revenues declined 5% year-on-year.\nGoogle Other revenues were up 24% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Let's now take a few minutes to cover our three key priority areas: Google AI, retail, and YouTube, which I've laid out in prior quarters as clear opportunities for long-term advertising growth. I'll then turn it over to Ruth for more details on our financial performance. Q2 was a big quarter for Google AI and our ads products. I/O, GML, and Brandcast were a testament to our deep commitment to building cutting-edge tools and solutions that help businesses navigate complexity in real time and deliver the results they need, all while improving the experience for users. Sundar covered some of these innovations. I'll share more.\nIt's worth reiterating that while generative AI is now supercharging new and existing ads products with tons of potential ahead, AI has been at the core of our ads business for years. In fact, today, nearly 80% of advertisers already use at least one AI-powered search ads product. Our approach to AI in ads remains grounded in understanding what drives real value for businesses right now, and what's most helpful for users. Advertisers tell us they're looking for a more assistive experience to get set up with us faster. At GML, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads powered by a LLM tuned specifically from Ads data to make campaign construction easier than ever. Advertisers also tell us they want help creating high-quality ads that work in an instant.\nWe're rolling out a revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max that helps customers adapt and scale their most successful creative concepts in a few clicks. There's even more with PMax. We launched new asset insights and new search term insights that improve campaign performance understanding, and new customer lifecycle goals that let advertisers optimize for new and existing customers while maximizing sales. We've long said it's all about reaching the right customer with the right creative at the right time. Later this year, automatically created assets, which are already generating headlines and descriptions for search ads, will start using generative AI to create assets that are even more relevant to customer queries. BroadMatch also got updates. AI-based keyword prioritization ensures the right keyword, bid, budget, creative, and landing page is chosen when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible.\nTo make it easier for advertisers to optimize visual storytelling and drive consideration in the mid-funnel, we're launching two new AI-powered ad solutions, Demand Gen and Video View campaigns, and both will include Shorts inventory. Sundar talked earlier about SGE and our early experiments with new ad formats. We're in active conversations with advertisers, publishers, and partners to get their input on how to make these solutions work best for them, and are excited to test and evolve this experience as we learn more. Let's pivot to retail, where we had a good quarter. Profitability remains a top theme for retailers, so solutions like PMax that drive bottom-line value continue to do well. We also continue to see success in helping businesses unlock efficient growth and deliver on their omnichannel goals.\nTake ACE Hardware, who tapped into AI-powered search and omni-bidding to capture increased seasonal demand leading up to Memorial Day. This drove increases across online sales, store visits, and in-store sales, resulting in 87% year-over-year growth in omni revenue from Google Ads, and led to one of the largest revenue weeks ever for ACE store owners. Q2 also brought innovation on the consumer and merchant front. We rolled out a new GenAI-powered virtual try-on tool that brings the fitting room experience online. Shoppers can try on women's tops across a wide array of models from brands like Anthropologie, Everlane, H&M, and Loft. Rich, visual, engaging content is a win-win for both consumers and merchants. In fact, product offers with more than one image see a 76% average increase in impressions, and a 32% increase in clicks.\nOur new Product Studio uses GenAI to help retailers create tailored, eye-catching imagery for free, and we are working towards optimizing for performance. We think this will be a game changer, especially for SMBs who can now create high-quality images to use both across Google and their own sites without spending a lot of time or money. As we continue to make Google a valuable place for merchants to grow their businesses and connect with users, Merchant Center Next is another win. We've seen 2x growth in the number of businesses using Merchant Center in the past two years, and we're now simplifying it by automating inventory management and giving a consolidated view of performance insights. Better tools mean better growth for merchants, and better experiences for users. Moving to YouTube. I've said it before, I'll say it again.\nYouTube starts with our creators, and it's their success and our multi-format strategy that will drive YouTube's long-term growth. In prior quarters, I've laid out how we think about this. Enabling our creators to make a living on our platform with more formats and awesome tools leads to more content, which leads to quality consumption of video content, another big focus of the team, and this leads to better opportunities for monetization and for advertisers to support this incredible ecosystem. As we think about growth, we're focused on Shorts, Connected TV, and our subscription offerings, all of which grew nicely this quarter. Let me double-click into Shorts and CTV. First, Shorts. Momentum remains strong. Watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction. Last year, we introduced ads on Shorts to help drive performance and direct response campaigns via Video Action, Performance Max, and App Campaigns.\nAs of Q2, brand advertisers can start testing Shorts ads and awareness campaigns. It's still early days, but we're excited by the results. La Neige, Asia Pacific's number one premium skincare brand, was an early adopter. It leaned into Video Reach campaigns and new creative over a 10-day test to drive a 21% increase in unique users reached from Shorts and In Feed, all at a more efficient CPM. Second, Connected TV. Substantial engagement by viewers and ROI for advertisers is driving monetization of the living room. We are very pleased with the growth we've seen and how we're delivering the reach, results, and relevance that businesses are looking for at scale. At Brandcast, we announced two new ad offerings for streaming. First, 30-second unskippable ads are coming to YouTube Select, which is landing 70%+ of impressions on the TV screen.\n30-second ads are a TV industry staple, and now YouTube is bringing our advanced audience capabilities and unparalleled reach to the format. We're also exploring new pause experiences so brands can drive awareness or action when you hit pause. Looking at YouTube holistically, according to our measurement partners, Nielsen, TransUnion, and Ipsos MMA, YouTube delivers higher ROI than TV and other online video on average. Take the Hershey Company. As part of a multi-year partnership to optimize its YouTube strategy, Hershey's brands have been tapping into CTV, efficient AI-powered formats, and made-for-platform creative, leading to YouTube becoming its number one ROI-driving media partner, producing a 65%+ increase in ROI from 2018 to 2023. One last highlight that bridges the power of YouTube with our continued efforts to bring the best across Google to our partners. With Warner Bros.\nDiscovery, we expanded our multi-year relationship across our entire Android ecosystem, including partnering on the launch of Max, a deepened, mutually beneficial relationship on Google TV, and plans to work together on new surfaces. YouTube's expanded deal for Max, inclusive of a Max NFL Sunday Ticket bundle on YouTube TV, also underscores our joint commitment to bring the highest quality content and experiences to our customers. I'll close by echoing Sundar, with a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their incredible passion and hard work, and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Ruth, over to you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philipp. Before I go into the results, first, Sundar, thank you very much for the opportunity. I'm very excited about the new role, and I look forward to it.\nTurning to the results, we're very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, which reflect an acceleration of growth in search, and momentum in cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $74.6 billion, up 7%, or up 9% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. Total cost of revenues was $31.9 billion, up 6%, driven by other cost of revenues of $19.4 billion, which was up 8%. Growth here was driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube subscription offerings, followed by hardware costs associated with Pixel family launches in the second quarter.\nAs noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we discussed last quarter. Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, up 4%. Operating income was $21.8 billion, up 12%, and our operating margin was 29%. I will cover our expense and margin performance in our outlook. Other income and expense was $65 million. Net income was $18.4 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $21.8 billion in the second quarter and $71 billion for the trailing 12 months, reflecting improved operating performance as well as the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023, as noted in our earnings release. We ended the quarter with $118 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nTurning to our segment results, prior period results have been recast for two changes that we made as of the first quarter. First, DeepMind is now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Second, we updated our cost allocation methodologies. In the second quarter, we then combined the Brain Team from Google Research with DeepMind to form Google DeepMind. Costs associated with the Brain Team, which were previously included in Google Services, are now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. We have not recast prior period results to reflect this additional change. Within Google Services, revenues were $66.3 billion, up 5%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were up 5%, led by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were up 4%, driven by brand advertising, followed by direct response, reflecting further stabilization in spending by advertisers.\nNetwork advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 5%. Other revenues were $8.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, primarily from subscription growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV, followed by growth in hardware revenues, primarily driven by the launch of the Pixel 7a in the second quarter. Finally, Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter. TAC was $12.5 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $23.5 billion, up 8%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $8 billion for the quarter, up 28%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries, and products. That being said, we saw continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimized their spend. Google Workspace strong revenue growth was driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud had operating income of $395 million, and the operating margin was 5%. As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $285 million, and the operating loss was $813 million. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain other bets. Turning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services, first, within advertising, we were pleased with the acceleration of search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Our continued ability to generate sustained growth reflects our unparalleled engineering innovation that creates extraordinary experiences for users, and capabilities for advertisers, and delivered with the deep expertise of our go-to-market team. In YouTube, we saw ongoing signs of stabilization in advertiser spending.\nWe are prioritizing product focus on increasing quality consumption of video content with both Shorts and in the living room, which is translating into improved monetization. Second, within other revenues, in our YouTube subscription products, the sustained strong growth in revenues reflects significant subscriber growth. You may have seen that last week we increased subscription prices for YouTube Music and YouTube Premium, which underscores the value of the products. Strong year-on-year growth in hardware revenues was due in large part to a timing change, given the Pixel 7a was launched in the second quarter, whereas the Pixel 6a launch occurred in the third quarter last year. Looking ahead, the launch timing change will be a headwind to hardware revenue growth in the third quarter. Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by a solid increase in the number of buyers.\nTurning to Google Cloud, we are particularly excited about the customer interest in our AI-optimized infrastructure, our large language models, our AI platform services, and our new generative AI offerings, such as Duet AI for Google Workspace, although we are still clearly in the early days. At the same time, we continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter for moderation in consumption growth as customers optimize their spend. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we remain very focused on durably re-engineering our cost base. Most evident to date are the actions we have taken to reduce the pace of headcount growth, including the workforce reductions we announced in the first quarter, and a slower pace of organic hiring, in part given our focus on reallocating talent from within to fuel our growth priorities.\nA quick comment on the sequential improvement in operating margins in the second quarter. There are two factors to note. First, the benefit from an acceleration in search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Second, the vast majority of the charges related to our workforce reduction and optimization of our global office space were taken in Q1. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, in Q2, the largest component was for servers, which included a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The sequential step-up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for two reasons. First, with respect to office facilities, we continue to moderate the pace of fit-outs and ground-up construction to reflect the slower expected pace of headcount growth. Second, there were delays in certain data center construction projects.\nWe expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure increasing through the back half of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. The primary driver is to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet, including investments in GPUs and proprietary TPUs, as well as data center capacity. With all that said, we remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term, sustainable financial value. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Our first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two.\nThe first one for Sundar. Sundar, I'd be curious to learn about some of your early learnings and surprises around consumer behavior on how people are using Bard versus Search. What new behaviors or consumer utility are you most excited about as you think about what Gemini could provide for people over the course of the next year or so? The second one for Ruth. Ruth, congrats on the new position. One question just about the durable expense comments. I think last quarter you talked about the idea that expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that still the right way to think about it? Just to confirm, does that include the impact of depreciation in those comments? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Brian. I'll take the first part. It's definitely early days, but both across Bard and Search and Native Experience, the feedback has been very positive from our users. I think we are definitely now able to serve, I would say, deeper and broader information use cases, which is very exciting. I wouldn't say surprise. For example, people really using it for coding is something we understood, but it's definitely on the new side. There's a lot of excitement around the integrated Google Lens into Bard. We have known how big Google Lens can be. We see that in the visual searches we get, and how much it has grown over the last two years. We've been doing this for a while.\nThat and Bard has been super well received, which gives me a sense that, given Gemini is being built from the ground up to be multimodal, I think that's an area that's going to excite users. I go back many years ago when we did universal search. Whenever for users we can abstract different content types and put them in a seamless way, they tend to receive it well. I'm definitely excited about what's ahead.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nOn your second question, Brian, we are really pleased with the operating performance in the second quarter. We've been saying for some time that we are focused on revenue growth ahead of expense growth and achieved that for the first time in some time. That is cost of sales plus operating expense overall. We do remain very focused on durably re-engineering our cost base.\nThere are a lot of work streams that are in flight, and I mentioned a couple of them in opening comments. This remains a major priority, as Sundar and I both commented on.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe one for Sundar and one also for Ruth. Sundar, can you talk a little bit about elements of open source versus closed and things like custom silicon and how you're thinking about AI offerings broadly developing over the next couple of years and what you see as some of the key differentiation points that Google, either through their cloud business or the consumer offerings, are going to bring to market and how we should think about differentiation playing out to a greater degree in AI in the years ahead?\nThat would be number one. Ruth, I'll echo Brian's congrats as well on the new role. Maybe both of you could talk to why this type of role might be important at this point in time for Alphabet. Ruth, what you're looking to sort of drive into the organization from this new role as you move into it in the fall? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Eric. On the first part, obviously a big topic. I would broadly say the investments for AI, when you look at the type of deep computer science work, the talent we have worked hard to bring to the company, and from the ground up, the infrastructure we have built from the earliest days. Google has been a company. We've thought about the switches in our data centers.\nWherever we think we can do the best and get an advantage by innovating, we have chosen to do so. We have done that on AI on the silicon side. What's important to us is really stay focused on our users and customers, and support all the innovations that's needed. For example, with cloud, we've really embraced an open architecture. We have embraced customers wanting to be multi-cloud when it makes sense for them. Similarly, you would see with AI, we will embrace, we will offer not just our first-party models. We'll offer third-party models, including open-source models. I think open source has a critical role to play in this ecosystem. Google contributes.\nWe are one of the largest contributors to, if you look at Hugging Face and in terms of the contribution there, when you look at projects like Android, Chromium, and so on, Kubernetes, and so on. We'll embrace that, and we'll stay at the cutting edge of technology. I think that'll serve us well for the long-term. On the second part of your question, first of all, I'm very grateful and thankful to all the work that Ruth has done for the company. It's too invaluable to capture in words. I am super thrilled that she's going to continue on an impactful new role.\nAt the scale of our company, with the broad changes in technology, I think it's more important than ever before to engage on these issues globally at scale and advocate on the economic opportunity of the investments we make across Alphabet and Google. I'm glad that she's going to continue as CFO, so no changes there. We'll take the time to find a successor, and Ruth will be closely involved, not just on that, but also our long-range planning, including 2024. Ruth, anything to add?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nJust to underscore, when you asked the point about impact, one of the places Sundar and I have discussed quite a bit is landing well the 2024 capital plan and the multi-year plan and completing all of the very important efforts we have underway.\nWe're excited about what they mean, setting the company up well to be able to invest for long-term growth. We're continuing to execute against those. I think Sundar summarized it well. We see technology can make such a difference in the lives of so many and the lives of economies. To be able to focus on the impact on economic growth and the opportunity for people, for organizations, for countries, I think is a privilege. I'm really excited about it, in particular with this amazing company. Focusing there as well as the investments that we make across Alphabet to drive economic growth globally across numerous sectors.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth.\nFirst, Sundar, I'm curious, how do you think about timing for more broadly integrating generative AI into Search? More specifically, what are some of the things you'll need to see to do that? Ruth, just on CapEx, the $2.2 billion CapEx lower than expected, as you explained, do you still expect modestly higher CapEx in 2023 versus 2022? I know it's getting a little bit ahead, but how should we think about timing of that real estate and office optimization efforts through 2023 and also into 2024? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, on the Search Generative Experience, we definitely wanted to make sure we're thinking deeply from first principles. While it's exciting new technology, we've constantly been bringing in AI innovations into Search for the past few years. This is the next step in that journey. It is a big change.\nWe thought about it from first principles. It really gives us a chance to now not always be constrained in the way Search was working before, allowed us to think outside the box. I see that play out in the experience. I would say we are ahead of where I thought we'd be at this point in time. The feedback has been very positive. We've just improved our efficiency pretty dramatically since the product launch. The latency has improved significantly. We are keeping a very high bar. I would say we are ahead on all the metrics in terms of how we look at it internally. I couldn't be more pleased with it. You will see us continue to bring it to more and more users. Over time, this will just be how Search works.\nWhile we are taking deliberate steps, we are building the next major evolution in Search. I'm pleased with how it's going so far.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of CapEx, I tried to lay out the cadence of CapEx. The point was an important one that the sequential step-up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for the two reasons I noted: one, the work that we're doing around office facilities, and then the delays in certain data center construction projects. That's why we wanted to be really clear that we do expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure.\nThat would be increasing through the back half of 2023, consistent with the comments we've made previously that we had expected 2023 to be higher, and given the slower start at the front half of the year, then continuing to grow into 2024. The primary driver of this, as you know well, is to support the opportunities we see in AI across the company, including the investments that we've already talked about, proprietary TPUs, all that we're doing with GPUs, as well as data center capacity. As we continue to see the pace of innovation accelerate, we just want to make sure we're positioned to address the opportunity across Alphabet.\nTo the other part of your question, when we look at real estate optimization, that's one of many work streams that are important when we talk about durably re-engineering our cost base to create capacity for investments and support long-term, sustainable financial value. We're continuing to work against that.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nLloyd Walmsley\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThanks a lot for taking the question. I wanted to just follow up on some of the SGE questions and just get a sense. I know it's early, but what are you seeing in terms of monetization? How do you guys think about that as you scale up the deployment of SGE? I think there's a lot of concern out there that maybe in the short-term, it's a bit of a headwind.\nOver the longer term, maybe query growth from a more useful product can kind of make up for that. How do you guys see that playing out? What can you share there?\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMaybe I can give some color here. We have obviously been focused on bringing this experience and making sure it works well for users. It's very clear to me, first of all, as a user myself, that there are certain queries for which the answers are so significantly better. It's a clear quality win. I think we are definitely headed in the right direction. We can see it in our metrics and the feedback we are getting from our users as well. The thing that doesn't change with these experiences is that a lot of user journeys are commercial in nature. There are inherent commercial user needs.\nWhat's exciting to me is that SGE gives us an opportunity to serve those needs again better, right? And better. It's clearly an exciting area. As part of that, the fundamentals don't change. Users have commercial needs, and they are looking for choices. There are merchants and advertisers looking to provide those choices. Those fundamentals are true in SGE as well. We have a number of experiments in flight, including ads, and we are pleased with the early results we are seeing. We will continue to evolve the experience. I'm comfortable at what we are seeing. We have a lot of experience working through these transitions, and we'll bring all those learnings here as well.\n\nLloyd Walmsley\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Great.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Just asked about the cloud. It really looks like revenue growth stabilized despite optimization. Could you talk about the pipeline and the client wins in the quarter, how you felt about those, and then any uptick are you seeing related to AI spending in the total revenues this quarter or in the second half? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Justin. Look, it is an exciting moment overall in cloud because there is definitely a lot of interest from customers on AI. They definitely are engaging in many more conversations with us. I would say, without commenting on the short-term, when I think about it long-term, I view the AI opportunity as expanding our total addressable market and allows us to win new customers.\nThe scale of investments that we can directly bring to Cloud now, as I said earlier, we have over 80 models across Vertex, Enterprise Search, and Conversational AI. We are taking all of them, translating it into deep industry solutions. I'm excited about it. Second, it gives us an opportunity to upsell and cross-sell into our install base. For example, if you think about Duet AI in Google Workspace now, it's a collection of all our generative AI-powered collaboration features. We can bring it and make it available to more than 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. Similarly, Duet AI in Google Cloud, again, allows us to go back to our install base and engage in deeper conversations. Finally, I think AI helps us differentiate our core products.\nFor example, if you take a look at cybersecurity, we are deeply incorporating AI to drive profound changes there. Overall, I'm excited. I view this as a long-term opportunity. All the investments we are doing in AI across Alphabet, including the work we are doing in Google DeepMind and Google Research on Gemini and so on, are directly applicable to cloud as well. Excited about it.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you. Maybe one follow-up for Ruth. Did the infrastructure cloud grow faster than workspaces again this quarter?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nI don't think we commented on that. Yes, in the second quarter, GCP growth was above the growth rate for cloud overall.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, Moffett Nathanson\n\nThanks. I have one for Philipp and one for Sundar. Philipp, can you talk about the ad market?\nIf you step back, you're seeing real signs now of weakness in linear TV, ad agencies, smaller digital companies. We're all slowing, and the macro backdrop's definitely cloudy. Yet you guys have accelerated your growth this quarter. What factors are you looking at? Do you see that will identify why are you growing while others are really struggling and slowing down? Sundar, I think you spent over $100 billion on R&D over the past five years. Yet there's a narrative that it's so competitive and so expensive to compete going forward. Can you talk a bit about how you're revisiting that R&D spend? Any near-term cadence updates you can give us for growth? Any factors that could change the growth going forward for research and development spending for you guys? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, maybe I can comment on how we think about R&D.\nLook, if anything, I think two things. We are always committed to driving deep computer science research and innovation. That's the foundation on which the company is built. Taking that and applying it and building new products and services and generating value is the virtuous cycle. You said nothing changes in that fundamental thesis. We are definitely, both, as Ruth mentioned, on AI investments, we are going to be committed to making sure we invest to realize the opportunity. All the work we are doing on efficiency and optimization applies to on the AI side as well. We are bringing all that lens there so that we do this responsibly. No overall changes in our philosophy or approach there. Maybe I'll let Philipp comment on the overall market dynamics.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYes. Look, I can't comment on others.\nOur focus continues, obviously, to be helping customers through whatever uncertainty or complexity they're facing. A lot of companies are focused on profitability, driving efficiencies, and they're carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. Our goal is really to help them maximize efficiency and drive strong ROI. I think we have the proven AI-powered tools and solutions to actually do it. I called out Search and other revenues being led by solid growth in the retail vertical. We talked about the DR and brand side on the YouTube side. I think those are the key points I would make.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, Moffett Nathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Ken Gawrelski of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYes. Thank you so much for the opportunity. I appreciate that. Can I ask on Performance Max? You've had great success there.\nCould you talk about any vertical or use case expansions? How long until we possibly get to the point of more automated AI-generated creative production?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah. Look, this is a great question. AI is a foundational component that really allows us to help users, advertisers, publishers, partners at scale. We've been on a journey for years, right, to take the key components of advertising, whether it's bidding, targeting, and creatives, as well as innovation, frankly, in the core advertiser and publisher experiences, and improve them dramatically through AI. Performance Max is an example of how all this comes together at scale for advertisers. They provide us with a business goal, a set of assets, and we can then take care of the rest to meet consumer demand and really deliver on advertiser ROI.\nAs you heard at GML, we've seen over many quarters, we've continued to build new AI features really on top of this. I think I talked a bit in my prepared remarks about where we're taking some of our products from a GenAI perspective. If you take a look at some of the things we announced there, it's fair to say whether you look at our revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max, whether you look at automatically created assets, whether you look at Product Studio, and so on, that we're on a right path to deliver some really exciting new innovation in automated, let me call it asset creation in the broader sense.\n\nKen Gawrelski\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay. Actually, I'll follow up on that last question, Philipp.\nYou pointed out AI has been used to improve the advertising mousetrap at Google for many years. Do you view generative AI as just a material accelerant of your ability to improve return on ad spend for the millions of marketers who use Google? If you think about where generative AI would have the most impact, could you peel it apart? What's your guess now over the next couple of years where it's going to have the most impact on the creative, on the audience creation, on the ad, the campaign optimization? Where do you think the most impact will come from generative AI just for all your advertising customers? Thanks.\nWell, look, as I said earlier, generative AI is supercharging new and existing ads products with really tons of potential ahead. We're really helping advertisers here make better decisions, solve problems, enhance creativity.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet",
    "content2": "I covered this earlier. For example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow in PMax I mentioned, the automatically created assets, the Product Studio, and so on. When I talk to customers, they're very excited about AI and understandably have some questions. One of the top questions is, for example, what's the next best step I should take? This is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It's a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI. It has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI-powered products. It really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success. Those are just some of the examples.\nIf you extrapolate this going forward, those are some of the examples where I see a lot of upside apart from the points that Sundar already mentioned.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nI think all of this is before we have multimodal capabilities really in the mix. Looking at the early innovations there, I think it's going to be an exciting couple of years ahead. Thanks, Mark.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you, Sundar. Thank you, Philipp. Congratulations, Ruth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJames Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2023 call. Thank you and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise.\nI'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with search performing well, and momentum in cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. On cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter, and we remain focused on long-term value creation here. Today, I'll give an update on the two themes I spoke about last quarter. One, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in search and beyond. Two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. I'll talk about our momentum in cloud and close with our progress at YouTube.\nFirst, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners, and for our business. I've compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago. Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. In our last call, I outlined three areas of opportunity: continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models, and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users, empowering developers, creators, and partners with our tools, and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances. We have made good progress across all three areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful, and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation. Lots more to come.\nFor developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models, and begin building new generative AI applications quickly. A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud Platform, Google Workspace, and our cybersecurity offerings. For years, we've been focused on making search even more helpful, from Google Lens, to multi-search, to visual exploration and search, Immersive View in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering search today. We have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. We'll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way. We'll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want, and our high standards for quality.\nWe'll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. As it evolves, we'll unlock entirely new experiences in search and beyond, just as camera, voice, and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration. AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max use the full power of Google's AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Philip will talk more about this in a moment. As we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles, and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work. As one example, our Perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on, with significant benefits for information quality.\nThis is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public. We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into one focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly. On to my second team, the company Shop and Focus. I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline, and to find areas where we can operate more cost-effectively and with greater velocity.\nWe have significant multi-year efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads and equipment where servers aren't being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. We are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs. We'll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings. Next, Google Cloud. I'm pleased with the ongoing momentum in cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product roadmap, and go-to-market organization, has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world.\nWe have consistently grown top-line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem, and our product leadership. Over the past three years, GCP's annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading startups, and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud. We have also built a strong partner ecosystem. Over the last four years, the number of Google Cloud partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud, compared to zero when we started.\nToday, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, Auxbotic to test its autonomous vehicles, and Litrix to quickly develop text-to-image features. In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft. This builds on our popular AI-powered Workspace tools, Smart Canvas, and Translation Hub, used by more than 9 million paying customers. Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI.\nNew advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty, Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI, and Mercedes-Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response, and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products help protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom, and Europe's Telepass. We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics. Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs, and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enables innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney, and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms.\nWe are the only cloud provider to announce the availability of NVIDIA's new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads such as generative AI. Turning next to YouTube, let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for nine years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter, with Neil Mohan, a longtime leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube. Here are a few highlights from the quarter. YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts posts.\nThe living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally. On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now cue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices, and auto-download recommended videos for offline viewing. We have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube primetime channels. We have announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences, and create new opportunities for creators. To close, across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses, and society reach their full potential with AI. We'll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products, including our Pixel devices, and share some exciting new developments for Android.\nThanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful is as urgent as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead. Over to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and CBO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hey, everyone. It's great to be here today. I'll kick off with Google Services performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas, and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance. Google Services revenue of $62 billion were up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search, and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment.\nIn YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization in performance, while in Network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Now let's double-click into the three areas I laid out last quarter, where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Number one, Google AI. Number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads, products, and services. Number three, YouTube. First, Google AI. I've said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses big and small respond in real time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts, and deliver measurable ROI when it's needed most. In Q1, we continue to innovate across our products. Take Core Search, for example.\nIn targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. In bidding, we improved our smart bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. In creatives, we opened our Automatically Created Assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads, and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to users' query, context, and to the advertiser's business. To then unlock Core Search further, and maximize conversions across all of Google, we're actively helping more advertisers pair it together with Performance Max.\nAdvertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up five points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching, and new formats like YouTube Shorts. I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for travel goals. Now, even the smallest hoteliers can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax. Like family-run Carissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just one month of using PMax for travel goals. There is more to come here as we add even more AI-powered features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May. Moving on to retail, where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on three pillars.\nNumber one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers, and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. Number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences. Number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products. In a macro environment of do more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel, and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, used target ROAS to uncap budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and a 31% jump in ROAS, leading to Caraway's best business day in history, and a robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1.\nFor omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing to online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers who are more likely to spend in store. Danish department store Magazine recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values coming from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, Magazine can now, with confidence, measure the full impact of its online investments on both e-commerce and physical store revenue. Turning to YouTube, creators fuel YouTube success. Across long-form and Shorts, music and podcasts, vertical and horizontal, YouTube is where creators are incentivized to make their best work, which means the best content, more viewers, and more opportunities for advertisers.\nAs I said last quarter, our creator ecosystem and multi-format strategy will be key drivers of YouTube's long-term growth. To support this growth, we're focused on, number one, Shorts, number two, engagement on CTV, number three, investing in our subscription offerings, and number four, a longer-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. First, Shorts. We're seeing strong watch time growth. Monetization is also progressing nicely. People are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates. Number two, connected TV. As Sundar said, we're seeing momentum globally. Viewers love watching YouTube creators and their favorite content on the large screen. Advertisers are leaning in. Zooming out more broadly for a second, across YouTube, we're helping brands benefit from our expansive reach and drive the profitability they're looking for.\nIn one of our largest marketing mix modeling studies to date, YouTube ROI is 40% higher than linear TV and 34% higher than all other online video, according to a custom analysis from January 2020 to March 2022 of Nielsen Compass ROI benchmarks across 16 countries and $19 billion of total media spend measured. This proves YouTube's ability to drive effectiveness at scale. Next up, our subscription offerings. The goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content across both ad-supported and premium services. Our launch of multi-view on YouTube TV and our first-of-its-kind à la carte access for NFL Sunday Ticket are two examples of how we're investing here. Expect more updates over the coming quarters. Number four, shopping on YouTube. It's still super early days. One highlight, last year, we brought shopping to more creators and brands by partnering with commerce platforms like Shopify.\nNow, more than 100,000 creators, artists, and brands have connected their own stores to their YouTube channels to sell their products. We're excited about the potential ahead. I'll close with an awesome example of how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners to accelerate innovation. Mercedes-Benz. In February, we announced a first-of-a-kind partnership to bring Google Maps Platform and YouTube into future Mercedes-Benz vehicles equipped with its next-gen MBOS operating system. Beyond enabling the luxury automaker to design a customized navigation interface, we'll also provide AI and data cloud capabilities to advance their autonomous driving efforts and create an enhanced customer experience. On that note, a big thank you. First, to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration. Second, to our Googlers for all of their incredible work this quarter. Ruth, over to you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philip.\nOur financial results for the first quarter reflect continued healthy fundamental growth in search and momentum in cloud. As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3%, or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by three factors. First, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on cost of revenues and operating expenses.\nSecond, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023. As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1-Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023. Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%, the biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations, and followed by content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions.\nOperating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to our segment results, these were affected by two additional changes outlined in our 8K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind, Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, as of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these two changes.\nThe highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results. Starting with Google Services, revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV, YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mixed shift between search and network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries, and products.\nGoogle Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our other bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, in terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment, and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates. With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of search was similar to last quarter.\nIn YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement, where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year. Turning to Google Cloud, our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization, and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results, as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop, which remains uncertain.\nIn terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in cloud while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity. Moving to other bets, in the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to headcount. I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to re-engineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company. First, as discussed on the fourth quarter call, we have efforts underway in three broad categories. Number one, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks, as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure. Number two, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively. Number three, continuing to optimize how and where we work.\nAs we've noted previously, all three work streams are ramping up this year, and we plan to build on these efforts in 2024 and in subsequent years. Second, with respect to headcount growth, the reported number of employees at the end of the first quarter includes almost all of the employees impacted by the workforce reduction we announced in January. We expect most of the impacted individuals will no longer be reflected in our headcount by the end of the second quarter. In terms of the outlook for headcount for the year, as we shared last quarter, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023, while still investing in priority areas, particularly for top engineering and technical talent.\nIn terms of our investments in AI, we are excited about the creation of Google DeepMind, combining the Brain team from Google Research with DeepMind, with the goal to accelerate innovation and impact. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, the costs associated with teams and activities transferred from Google Research will move from Google Services to Google DeepMind within Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, for 2023, we now expect total CapEx to be modestly higher than in 2022. As discussed last quarter, CapEx this year will include a meaningful increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. We expect the pace of investment in both data center construction and servers to step up in the second quarter and continue to increase throughout the year. Thank you. Sundar, Philip, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nAs a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Your first question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. First one for Sundar. Sundar, I guess, as you think over the course of the next 12 months and you have a lot of new AI tools to show us, what new behavior changes or capabilities are you most excited about for users, developers, and advertisers as these tools come out? The second one for Ruth, could you talk to us about how much of the AI tools have you incorporated internally to sort of drive more productivity out of your engineers, your sales force, your GNA?\nIs that sort of something to come over the next couple of years? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Brian. It is an exciting time. I do think we see an opportunity across the breadth of what we do at Google to improve our experiences. Obviously, in search, we've been using AI for a while. It's what has really helped lead search and search quality for the past few years using LLMs. We now have a chance to more natively use LLMs. I think the main way—by the way, as I said in my remarks, we are going to be deliberate. We are going to not start as getting it right for users, so we'll iterate and innovate as we have always done. The main area maybe I'm excited by is we do know from experience that users come back to search. They follow on.\nThey're engaging back on stuff they already did. For us to use LLMs in a way we can serve those use cases better, I think it's a real opportunity. Obviously, if it's YouTube, the chance to really improve experiences for creators and consumers in terms of how the videos are viewed, etc., I think you can expect changes. Workspace, we already have changes rolling out, and it's an area where I think we'll see the biggest advances, because I think productivity is a strong use case in which generative AI can help. Obviously, on cloud, this has been an important moment as pretty much every organization is thinking about how to use AI to drive transformation. Across the board, from startups to large companies, they are engaging with us. I view it as a point of inflection there as well. Ruth?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of the second part of your question, AI has been so much a part of what we've been doing for quite some time that there are a number of different ways to answer it. One is, as I noted, we have a number of efficiency efforts underway, and one of them is about using AI and automation to further improve productivity across Alphabet. That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization. It's helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use. One of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with cloud customers. Sundar just noted what we're doing within Google Workspace.\nWe obviously all live on Google Workspace, and so that's another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but it's also something that's available for users and enterprise customers more broadly. Finally, one of the areas that we've talked about is the opportunity with our compute capacity and all that we've done there and the infrastructure innovation, which again is helpful internally for what we do, but on behalf of our customers.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and then one for Ruth. Sundar, just as you think about integrating Bard into your search product over time, can you just talk more about what percentage of search queries you think would utilize large language model type responses?\nHow should we think about the costs of running search on these models relative to today? Ruth, I was just hoping you could follow up on your comment on CapEx, maybe if you could help us understand the modest step up in CapEx relative to three months ago. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Doug. Obviously, we have launched Bard as a complementary product to search, but we'll be bringing LLM experiences more natively into search as well. I do think, first of all, we'll be rolling it out in an incremental way so that we can test it, iterate, and innovate. I think we'll approach it that way. I think overall, I think it can apply to a broad range of queries.\nI think I'm excited that it can allow us to better help users in a category of queries maybe in which there was no right answer, and they are more creative, etc. I think those are opportunities. Even in our existing query categories where we get a chance to do some heavy lifting for the users and use AI to better guide them, I think you will see us exploring in those directions as well. It's early days, but I think there's a lot of innovation to come. On the cost side, costs of computers have always been a consideration for us. If anything, I think it's something we have developed extensive experience over many, many years. For us, it's a nature of habit to constantly drive efficiencies in hardware, software, and models across our fleet. This is not new.\nIf anything, the sharper the technology curve is, we get excited by it because I think we have built world-class capabilities in taking that and then driving down cost sequentially, then deploying it at scale across the world. I think we'll take all that into account in terms of how we drive innovation here, but I'm comfortable with how we'll approach it.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of CapEx, we do now expect that total CapEx for the year for 2023 will be modestly higher than in 2022. I tried to point out that we're expecting a step up in the second quarter, and that will continue to increase throughout the year. As we discussed last quarter, AI is a key component. It underlies everything that we do, and we're continuing to invest in support of AI, support of our users, advertisers, and our cloud customers.\nThat's what we're commenting on here. As we talked about last quarter, the increase in CapEx for the full year 2023 reflects the sizable increase in technical infrastructure investment. On the flip side, a decline in office facilities relative to last year.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much for taking the questions and hope everyone on the team as well. Maybe two, if I could. First on cloud, obviously one of the dominant themes, and you touched upon it, is this client optimization theme that's going on broadly in cloud computing.\nCan you give us a little bit more of your perspective on where we are in terms of the optimization theme broadly in cloud computing as a headwind to either revenue growth or backlog growth compared to the tailwinds of broader long-term consumption growth, and possibly the contribution of AI initiatives to cloud computing growth? Then second, on YouTube, obviously you've seen a lot of success with respect to engagement and consumption on Shorts. Can you give us an update on where we are on monetization trends in Shorts compared to the consumption you've already seen in usage shifts? Thank you so much.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of the cloud question, the point we're trying to underscore is there's uncertainty in the economic environment. We saw some headwind from slower growth of consumption, with customers really looking to optimize their costs given that macroclimate.\nI'll leave the forecasting to you on that, but both Sundar and I commented on really pleased with the momentum that the team has been delivering, and the breadth of what they've been working on.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nI do think I would add that we are leaning into optimization. I mean, there's an important moment to help our customers, and we take a long-term view. It's definitely an area we are leaning in and trying to help customers make progress in their efficiencies where we can. Philip?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and CBO, Alphabet\n\nYes. On the short side, look, Shorts viewership is growing rapidly. We announced 50 billion plus daily views on the Q4 earnings call, up from 30 billion last spring. We're pleased with our continuing progress and monetization. As I said earlier, people are engaging and converting on ads across Shorts at increasing rates.\nClosing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us as it's continuing to build a greater creator and user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via Video Action, App Discovery, and Performance Max campaigns, and via product feeds. Shorts are also shoppable. We're the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens, with multiple ways to make a living. As Sundar said last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. In February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner Program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry, and we continue to see strong creator adoption.\nUltimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts viewers and creators, and that's really what we're focused on right now.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Ross Sandler of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Internet Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. I'll just ask a tough question. Sundar, you came up in the group that structured a lot of the Android partnerships from inception, and I believe possibly the iOS agreement as well. How do you feel about Alphabet's ability to maintain the unit economics with these partnerships in light of Microsoft's ambitions to increase its share of paid search? Ruth, does this have any impact on your outlook for profitability of overall Alphabet over the long term? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMaybe I'll look. I think these dynamics have always been around.\nIt's important to remember, as far as I can remember, we've always been in a competitive environment for these deals. While I can't comment on the specifics of any of our partnership agreements, what has served us well is always, first of all, building the best product possible, focused on giving value to users. When we work with our partners, we work hard to create a win-win experience. Ultimately, partners end up choosing us because that's what their users want. It's always been what's helped search be widely distributed. I think it all starts with continuing to innovate and improve search, and making sure we are leading there. I think we've always approached it very robustly over the many, many years, and I'm comfortable that we'll continue to be able to do so.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of just longer-term profitability, I think I'll broaden out your question somewhat because the way we're looking at it is we continue to be committed to investing for growth, and we want to ensure we have overall capacity for growth. We have a number of work streams underway to, as we keep describing it, durably re-engineer our cost base. In particular, what we're excited about are long-term opportunities with AI and want to make sure we have the capacity to continue to invest there in the other areas where we see long-term growth in search and ads, cloud, YouTube, and hardware. That underscores our efforts to build in additional flexibility.\nAs we have said repeatedly, we want to ensure that expense growth is not growing out of revenue growth, and that means driving revenue growth and really being as disciplined as we can on these various work streams that we've discussed earlier in this call and last quarter as well to improve our expense growth trajectory.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question will come from Justin Post of BAML. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, BAML\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, you got the cost question on learning language models into search. Can you talk about revenues? I think on one hand, you'll see better relevancy and maybe better results with higher conversion, but on the other hand, there might be fewer areas for ads or fewer queries because people get answers more quickly. Are you optimistic on that transition? Maybe give us your thoughts there.\nRuth, backing out the one-time charges, it looks like OpEx growth is now 8%. Real progress there. Could you give us a flavor of where you are, you think, in your optimization cycle? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nFirst of all, throughout the years, as we have gone through many, many shifts in search, and as we evolve search, I think we've always had a strong, grounded approach in terms of how we evolve ads as well. We do that in a way that makes sense and provides value to users. The fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information, and in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. That's what drives this virtuous cycle.\nI don't think the underpinnings of the fact that users want relevant commercial information, they want choice in what they look at, even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, etc., users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. All those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. As I said, we'll be iterating and testing as we go. I feel comfortable we'll be able to drive innovation here like we've always done.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of our OpEx trajectory, yes, there was the elevated expense in OpEx from the $2.6 billion in severance and office space charges. There was also a $988 million benefit from lower depreciation due to the change in useful lives, but that obviously is an ongoing benefit.\nThere was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter. A little bit of complexity there, but at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various work streams that we've talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various work streams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we're doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we're doing around optimizing how and where we work. You've seen some of those announcements this quarter beyond the workforce reduction, things that we're doing in, for example, office services, and we're executing against each of these various work streams. Our view is that there's more to do.\nAs we tried to be clear, we're in execution mode. You'll see some of the benefit in 2023. You'll see more of it in 2024, and we're going to continue building against it beyond.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, BAML\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Michael Nathanson of Moffett Nathanson. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, Moffett Nathanson\n\nThanks. I want to Philip, one for Ruth. Philip, we're trying to get under the hood on search advertising and trying to understand changes in demand between sellers of goods and sellers of services. Can you give us any help looking at the service side? Has demand returned back to pre-pandemic levels? In terms of goods and e-commerce, have you seen a slowing of demand? Anything that helps kind of put this level set back to maybe pre-pandemic levels to understand services versus goods demand?\nFor Ruth, on the terms of efficiency and being more diligent, how does the significantly higher cost of capital impact the way you're imagining and evaluating the other bets assets? Anything there on how you may be rethinking some of the other bets and what are you doing and changing some of the structures of the other bets assets? Thanks.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nIt was a bit hard to hear you. You were breaking up. I think I'm going to start and address what I heard as the second question. As we're looking at higher cost of capital in this environment, how does that affect the way we're looking at other bets? Hopefully, we heard you correctly. It was crackling. Look, I think as we've talked about repeatedly, as it relates to other bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation.\nWe're very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we're looking at the returns we can generate. Yes, absolutely mindful of the higher cost of capital, but I think at its core, we're looking at what's the value creation and the return on those. As we indicated, when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the other bets. Some of them, as they're on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we're looking at what's the overall return on invested capital. We're continuing to work on these to make sure that we're delivering value.\nYour point is an important one that's part of a broader question about the underlying operating assumptions.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, Moffett Nathanson\n\nOkay. Until I've heard the first one.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and CBO, Alphabet\n\nYeah. On the first part, again, it didn't come across quite clearly, but I hope I understood correctly. In search, revenues grew modestly year over year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by decline in finance and media entertainment. Excluding the impact of FX, performance was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really search resilience with the, I'd say, ability of search to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There's really no additional color on other verticals. I'd say maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what's being reported elsewhere and across the headlines.\nMany companies are very focused on shorter-term profitability amidst this uncertainty, and some pull back at budgets as well.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, Moffett Nathanson\n\nOkay. Thanks. That's clear.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nOkay. Could I try two questions, please? I think, Philip, you talked about kind of more of a pullback in network ad revenue versus search and YouTube. Do you have any thoughts on why that was the case? Then, Ruth, the cloud business, even with the accounting changes, has shown this very steady march towards profitability. You turned the corner now. You talked about growing the business for long-term profitability. Are there any reasons why there shouldn't be sustainably profitable, kind of starting from here as the business continues to scale? Could it be that that profitability could be wobbly for a while before it's sustainably profitable, that segment cloud?\nThank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and CIO, Alphabet\n\nYeah. Why don't I just take both of those. In network, really, it's a continuation of what we talked about last quarter. We saw the ongoing pullback in advertiser spend. I would contrast that. Last quarter, we talked about both pullback in YouTube and network, and we were pleased that we saw the stabilization in ad spend. On a sequential basis in YouTube, we still saw ongoing pullback in network, which tends to be a mix of businesses, as you know well. In terms of cloud, I tried to make that clear in opening comments as well. I think it's a really important question. We are very pleased with the Q1 results. As both Sundar and I noted, we're intensely focused on all elements of the cost base, and the long-term path to attractive profitability.\nAt the same time, I think at the core of your question, what we were trying to convey is we will continue to invest to support long-term growth, in particular given the opportunities we see delivering AI capabilities to our customers. As I've said in the past, you shouldn't extrapolate from quarter to quarter, but we are very pleased to be at this level and are continuing to focus on profitability and long-term value creation here.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nThank you, Ruth.\nThank you. Our last question will come from Colin Sebastian from Baird. Please go ahead. Great.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you. Two for me as well. I guess, first, Sundar, the consolidation of the AI teams. I think you talked about that helping to accelerate innovation. I'm curious, specifically with that consolidation, what are the product milestones that we should look out for related to that?\nPhilip, regarding your comments on retail, specifically on shopping and payments, how should we think about that evolving across the platform this year? Maybe similarly, what are some milestones we should look out for on that front? Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and CBO, Alphabet",
    "content2": "Thanks. I'm quite excited by bringing the two world-class teams, I think, of both Brain and DeepMind. Their collective accomplishments in AI over the last decade have really set the stage for this moment.\nBoth getting access to pool talent so that they can work together in a coordinated way definitely will help us pool our computational resources too, which is going to be critical, and will help us build the core product. It is obviously building more capable models safely and responsibly and doing it taking into account all the capabilities our customers need, both on the consumer side and the cloud side, and being able to iterate and getting that virtuous cycle going. You already have seen us put out PaLM APIs, and we are incorporating PaLM across our products, but we'll continue that progress, and we'll keep you posted as we do. Retail is an important vertical and driver for us, and I called out the year-over-year increase in retail and search and other.\nI also talked earlier about the macroclimate and how we've established we can really drive value for retailers, even in challenging times, whether it's online, offline, or both. We're helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop. Maybe a little more on some key trends here. Retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match, or Key Lever are providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. I've talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory, fulfillment options, and optimize in-store visits and sales, for example.\nTo help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here. Making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards on Chrome is obviously important. Those are just some of the key points. Overall, we're giving retailers really the best, I hope, AI-powered tools and solutions to maximize reach, ROI, and really create a seamless experience, including where possible, on the payment side for their customers. This will continue to be our focus here.\n\nColin Sebastian\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any further remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2023 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, everyone.\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Q4 2022 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question and answer session. To ask a question during the session, you'll need to press star one one on your telephone. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThank you. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Q4 2022 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our forms 10K and 10Q filed with the SEC, including our upcoming form 10K filing for the year ended 31 December 2022. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon everyone. It's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging. We continue to have an extraordinary business and provide immensely valuable services for people and our partners. For example, during the World Cup final on 18 December 2022, Google Search saw its highest query per second volume of all time. Beyond our advertising business, we have strong momentum in cloud, YouTube subscriptions, and hardware.\nHowever, our revenues this quarter were impacted by pullbacks in advertiser spend and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll focus on two major things today in a bit more detail, and then I'll give a shorter than usual quarterly snapshot from across our business. First, how we unlock the incredible opportunities AI enables for consumers, our partners, and for our business.\nAnd second, how we focus our investments and make necessary decisions as a company to get there. First, the AI opportunity ahead. AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Our talented researchers, infrastructure, and technology make us extremely well positioned as AI reaches an inflection point. More than six years ago, I first spoke about Google being an AI-first company. Since then, we've been a leader in developing AI. In fact, our Transformers research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our pathbreaking work in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today.\nTranslating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always thrived on. Everyone working on the various projects underway is excited.\nWe'll pursue this work boldly, but with a deep sense of responsibility, with our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity at the core of all our work. We've been preparing for this moment since early last year, and you're going to see a lot from us in the coming few months across three big areas of opportunity. First, large models. We published extensively about LaMDA and PaLM, the industry's largest most sophisticated model, plus extensive work at DeepMind.\nIn the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting with LaMDA, so that people can engage directly with them. This will help us continue to get feedback, test, and safely improve them. These models are particularly amazing for composing, constructing, and summarizing. They will become even more useful for people as they provide up-to-date, more factual information.\nIn search, language models like BERT and MUM have improved search results for four years now, enabling significant ranking improvements and multimodal search like Google Lens. Very soon, people will be able to interact directly with our newest, most powerful language models as a companion to search in experimental and innovative ways. Stay tuned. Second, we'll provide new tools and APIs for developers, creators, and partners. This will empower them to innovate and build their own applications, and discover new possibilities with AI on top of our language, multimodal, and other AI models.\nThird, our AI is a powerful enabler for businesses and organizations of all sizes, and we have much more to come here. There's a few flavors of this.\nGoogle Cloud is making our technological leadership in AI available to customers via our Cloud AI platform, including infrastructure and tools for developers and data scientists like Vertex AI. We also offer specific AI solutions for sectors like manufacturing, life sciences, and retail, and we will continue to roll out more. Workspace users benefit from AI-powered features like Smart Canvas for collaboration, and Smart Compose for creation, and we are working to bring large language models to Gmail and Docs. We will also make available other helpful generative capabilities, from coding to design and more.\nFor our advertising partners, Philipp will discuss in detail how AI is powering dramatic campaign improvements and value-adding features for them. Of course, in addition to all this, AI also continues to improve Google's other products dramatically.\nWe'll continue our work with others outside Google, including joint research collaborations to develop AI responsibly and to apply AI to tackle society's greatest challenges and opportunities. For example, DeepMind's protein database of all 200 million proteins known to science has now been used by 1 million biologists around the world. We continue to invest in AI across the board, and Google AI and DeepMind are integral to a bright AI-first future.\nOver the past few years, DeepMind has been increasingly working across groups within Google and the Other Bets, and to reflect that progress, we'll be making a financial reporting change that Ruth will share more about in our comms. We are just at the beginning of our AI journey, and the best is yet to come. The second thing I wanted to discuss is our sharpened focus.\nWe are committed to investing responsibly with great discipline and defining areas where we can operate more cost-effectively. We are focused on methodically building financially sustainable, vibrant, growing businesses across Alphabet. For example, we are working to improve the economics and hardware as we focus more intently on the Pixel line and our overall cost structure there. Cloud remains very focused on its path to profitability, and there are many opportunities to build on our progress at YouTube over the years, starting with Shorts monetization. Overall, I see this as an important journey to re-engineer the company's cost base in a durable way.\nThere are several dimensions already underway, including prioritization of our product investments across Google and Other Bets. It also includes a careful focus on our hiring needs, reflecting these priorities, as well as efficiencies in our technical infrastructure and productivity improvements from our AI tools.\nAs part of this, we did a rigorous review across product areas and functions to ensure that our people and roles are aligned with our highest priorities as a company, and we announced a reduction in our workforce. I'm grateful to the Googlers leaving us for all of their contributions and their hard work to help people and businesses everywhere. Let me give a few quick updates from across the business this quarter. Just this week, we started bringing revenue sharing to YouTube Shorts, which is now averaging over 50 billion daily views, up from the 30 billion I announced on the Q1 2022 call.\nThis will reward creators and help improve the Shorts experience for everyone. Our subscription business continues to grow, with YouTube Music and Premium surpassing 80 million subscribers, including trialers. Together with YouTube Primetime Channel subscriptions and YouTube TV, we have good momentum here.\nYouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket will accelerate that by helping to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences, and create new opportunities for creators. Turning to hardware, many outlets and reviewers name Pixel 7 Pro the Phone of the Year. Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are incredible and help differentiate Pixel from others. 2022's Pixel 6a, 7, and 7 Pro are the best-selling generation of phones we have ever launched, and we gained share in every market we operate in this year.\nNext, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q4 revenue growing 32%. Our differentiated products and focused go-to-market strategy continue to drive customer momentum, beginning with real-time data, analytics, and AI. Customers are increasingly choosing BigQuery because we unify data lakes, data warehouses, and advanced AI/ML into one system and now analyze over 110TB of data per second.\nCustomers like Kroger can analyze data in multiple clouds without moving data in most cases, and MSCI processes unstructured and structured data at scale. In infrastructure, our global network and advanced TPU v4 AI supercomputer helps Snap triple the throughput for its business-critical ad ranking workload, while significantly lowering cost. Our machine learning infrastructure with Cloud TPU v4 pods can run large-scale training workloads up to 80% faster than alternatives, according to third-party benchmarks, which is helping customers like Bayer accelerate drug discovery.\nOur reliability advantages and open-edge cloud power the mission-critical 5G network of Telefónica Germany. As I mentioned, our suite of AI/ML solutions across verticals are a key differentiator. We help Wells Fargo automate the customer service experience for mobile users, and HCA continually improve the quality of patient care.\nIn 2022, Mandiant, which we are now integrating, helped over 1,800 customers prepare for or recover from the most critical cybersecurity incidents. In Workspace, the innovations mentioned earlier are helping drive new wins and expansions across geographies. In Other Bets, from Calico to Waymo, we are focused on investing sustainably across the portfolio and creating good businesses. Verily, for example, has recently honed its strategy and structure to more clearly focus its product development.\nTo close, we are all standing on the cusp of an era of amazing opportunities. We are going to be bold, responsible, and focused as we move into it. A healthy disregard for the impossible has been core to our company culture from the very beginning. When I look around Google today, I see that same spirit and energy driving our efforts.\nThanks to our employees, our partners, and people everywhere who use our services, I'm excited for what's next. Over to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar. Hello, everyone. It's good to be with you all. I'll start today with our Google Services performance in the Q4, and then dive deeper into our priority areas. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were down 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by sizable foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and other revenues were down 2% year-over-year, and YouTube Ads and Network had high single-digit revenue declines. Google Other Revenues were up 8% year-over-year, with strong growth in YouTube, non-advertising, and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues. I'll highlight two other factors that affected our ads business in Q4. Ruth will provide more detail.\nIn Search and Other, revenues grew moderately year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX, reflecting an increase in retail and travel, offset partially by a decline in finance. At the same time, we saw further pullback in spend by some advertisers in Search in Q4 versus Q3. In YouTube and Network, the year-over-year revenue declines were due to a broadening of pullbacks in advertiser spend in the Q4. I'll now zoom out to share more broadly where we're investing, and see clear opportunities for long-term growth.\nFirst, Google AI. It's important to recognize that our advertising business has obviously benefited over the past decade from the transition to mobile. More recently, we had outsized growth in advertising revenues during the pandemic, with 2022 advertising revenues $90 billion higher than in 2019. Going forward, we're focused on growing revenues on top of this higher base through AI-driven innovation.\nSundar highlighted the incredible opportunities underway with AI and the transformative impact it will have on businesses. Already, breakthroughs in everything from natural language understanding to generative AI are fueling our ability to deliver results that drive meaningful performance for advertisers, and are useful to users. Take Smart Bidding, which uses AI to predict future ad conversions and their value, helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand. In 2022, AI advances boosted bidding performance, allowing us to move advertiser outcomes down the funnel to drive better ROI and use budgets more efficiently. In search query matching, large language models like MUM match advertiser offers to user queries.\nThis understanding of human intent of language, combined with advances in bidding prediction, are why businesses can see an average of 35% more conversions when they upgrade exact match keywords to broad match in campaigns that use a target CPA. Google AI also underlies our creative products, like text suggestions in Google Ads, creative optimization, and responsive search ads. We're excited to start testing our automatically created assets better, which uses AI to generate headlines and descriptions for search creatives seamlessly once advertisers opt in. Of course, there's Performance Max, which offers the best combination of our AI-powered systems to our customers.\nWe're not stopping here, and these examples aren't exhaustive. AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade and will continue to bring cutting-edge advances to our products to help businesses and users. Number two, retail. Our foundation for delivering value over the long term includes three pillars. First, we're on a multi-year mission to make Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers, and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. This means constantly improving our consumer experiences, starting with a more visual, immersive, browsable search.\nSecond, we're empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ad experiences. In 2022, we saw an uptick in merchants, particularly SMBs, and product inventory coming onto Google. Adding more value for merchants remains a top priority. Third, to drive retail performance further, we focus on great ads products, from automation and insights, to bidding tools and omnichannel solutions, to AI-powered campaigns like PMax, helping retailers hit their goals and connect with customers no matter where or when they shop.\nTwo quick insights on PMax, which we upgraded the majority of advertisers to from smart shopping campaigns last year. First, advertisers on average see a 12% uplift from SSC to PMax. Second, it was a success story during the holidays and Cyber-Five. Its ability to scale and adapt to changing traffic over a volatile peak retail season drove strong results for many retailers, particularly mid-market advertisers. Moving on to YouTube. Despite ongoing revenue headwinds in Q4, we're confident in YouTube's long-term trajectory. Here's how we think about our strategy. It all starts with the creator ecosystem. Creators are the lifeblood of YouTube.\nIn 2022, more people created content on YouTube than ever before: long-form, short-form, audio, podcasts, music, live streams. What sets YouTube apart is we give creators more ways to create content and connect with fans, and more ways to earn money than any other platform.\nMore creators means more content, means more viewers, which leads to more opportunities for advertisers. The creator ecosystem and our multi-format strategy will continue to drive YouTube's long-term growth. To support that growth, we're focused on, number one, ramping Shorts, number two, accelerating engagement on a large screen, number three, investing in our subscription offerings, and number four, a long-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. First, Shorts. Viewership is growing rapidly, as Sundar said, 50+ billion daily views. We're also still pleased with our continuing progress in early monetization. On the creator side, it's been impressive to see the innovative ways creators are using Shorts to introduce their content and extend existing channels.\nWe're focused on providing creators with the best content creation and monetization tools, new, richer features, and analytics capabilities that help individualize and optimize their content strategies.\nIt's early days for Shorts, but we're confident the runway is long. Next, connected TV, where users are increasingly watching their favorite creators on the big screen at home. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the leader in US streaming watch time. Advertisers are leaning in. With AI-powered solutions, we're helping brands deliver efficient reach, ROI, and address pain points like frequency and measurement. There's our subscription offerings. It's clear the future of online video is about helping users seamlessly discover and watch content across ad-supported and premium services.\nOur goal is to be a one-stop shop for multiple types of video content. That's why we first offered YouTube Music and Premium, where 80+ million paid subscribers and trailers enjoy their favorite content and music ads free. We then expanded into YouTube TV, significantly improving on the legacy television experience.\nLast fall, Primetime Channels launched, making streaming subscription services available on YouTube on an à la carte basis. Given the potential we see in our subscription offerings, we recently announced a multi-year agreement to distribute NFL Sunday Ticket. As Sundar highlighted, we're excited about the opportunities this will open up. Lastly, is our focus on shoppable YouTube. It's still nascent, but we see lots of potential in making it easier for people to shop from the creators, brands, and content they love. I'll close with something I've said many times before. Our success is only possible because of our customers and partners.\nThe reality is we only do well when they do well. Since our earliest days, our revenue share models have been structured around ROI for our partners, from Play developers and online publishers to YouTube creators, artists, and media orgs around the world.\nOver the last three years, I'm proud to share that we've contributed more than $200 billion to these ecosystems. We remain as committed as ever to fueling the next generation of businesses, media companies, and creativity on the web. On that note, a big thank you to our partners and customers for their ongoing collaboration and trust, and to Googlers for their energy, focus, and dedication to helping our users, customers, and partners succeed, especially through these tougher times. Ruth, over to you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philipp. For the full year 2022, Alphabet delivered revenues of $283 billion, up 10% versus 2021, and up 14% on a constant currency basis, adding $37 billion to revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange. I will briefly cover the main points of our Q4 results, then turn to our outlook to give you more context for Sundar's comments on how we're focused on investing for growth, as well as on re-engineering our cost base for long-term success.\nFor the Q4, our consolidated revenues were $76 billion, up 1%, or up 7% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our total cost of revenues was $35.3 billion, up 7%. Other cost of revenues of $22.4 billion were up 15%. The increase was driven by two factors. First, hardware costs due primarily to $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges, and secondarily to strong unit sales. The charges reflect ongoing pricing pressures and changes in expected future inventory needs. Second, costs associated with data centers and other operations.\nOperating expenses were $22.5 billion, up 10%, reflecting an increase in R&D expenses primarily driven by headcount growth, followed by an increase in G&A expenses, primarily reflecting an increase in charges related to accrued legal matters. These increases were partially offset by a decline in sales and marketing expenses, primarily due to lower advertising and promotional spend. Operating income was $18.2 billion, down 17% versus last year, and our operating margin was 24%. Net income was $13.6 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16 billion in the Q4 and $60 billion in 2022.\nWe ended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $59 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2022. Turning to our segment results, starting with Google Services, revenues were $67.8 billion, down 2%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were down 2%. Search delivered moderate underlying growth in Q4, absent the impact of currency movements on reported results. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were down 8%. Network advertising revenues of $8.5 billion were down 9%.\nOther revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8%, reflecting several factors. First, significant subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium, and YouTube TV. Second, strong growth in hardware revenues, primarily from the Pixel family. Offsetting growth in these two areas was a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind in APAC, as well as the impact of reductions of Play Store fees. TAC was $12.9 billion, down 4%. Google Services operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%, and the operating margin was 31%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $7.3 billion for the quarter, up 32%.\nRevenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both infrastructure and platform services. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. In Q4, we saw slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $480 million. As to our Other Bets for the full year 2022, revenues were $1.1 billion, and the operating loss was $6.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business, in 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected by a number of challenges. First, we faced very tough comps given the outsized recovery in 2021 from the impact of the pandemic.\nSecond, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout the year. Third, we were operating against the backdrop of a more challenging economic climate that also impacted many of our customers and which remains ongoing. Within Google services, we are focused on investing in the opportunities we see for long-term revenue growth. First, within advertising, we are focused on using advances in AI to drive new and better experiences for users and search, as well as to deliver better measurement, higher ROI, and tools for more compelling creative content to advertisers. In YouTube, we are prioritizing continued growth in Shorts engagement and monetization, while also working on other initiatives across our ad-supported products.\nAs to our outlook for other revenues, in Play, 2022 results reflected the particularly sizable impact from foreign exchange, lapping the uplift in user activity during the pandemic, and the impact from the fee reductions we introduced. We remain optimistic about the longer-term prospects for mobile apps and gaming, although remain more cautious near-term given industry trends. With YouTube subscriptions, we're optimistic about building on its momentum across YouTube Music Premium, YouTube TV, and Primetime Channels. In hardware, we continue to make sizable investments, particularly to support innovation across our Pixel family, while working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies across the portfolio.\nFor Google Cloud, we remain excited about the long-term market opportunity and the trajectory of the business. Enterprises and governments are increasingly turning to us for their digital transformation initiatives across verticals and geographies. While investing for growth, we remain very focused on Google Cloud's path to profitability. In terms of Other Bets, as Sundar mentioned, we will be making a financial reporting change as it relates to DeepMind. To reflect the increasing DeepMind collaboration with Google services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, beginning in the Q1, DeepMind will no longer be reported in Other Bets and will be reported as part of Alphabet's corporate costs.\nI'll now walk you through the key elements of our efforts to deliver a durable re-engineering of our cost base in order to slow the pace of operating expense growth. We expect the impact will become more visible in 2024. First, with respect to Alphabet headcount, we are meaningfully slowing the pace of hiring in 2023 while still investing in priority areas. In Q4, we added 3,455 people. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. With respect to our recent announcement that we are reducing our workforce by approximately 12,000 roles, most of the impact will be seen in Q1.\nWe will take a severance charge of $1.9 to 2.3 billion, which will be reported in corporate costs. We will continue hiring in priority areas, with a particular focus on top engineering and technical talent, as well as on the global footprint of our talent. Second, we have a longer-term effort underway to re-engineer our cost base in three broad categories. First, using AI and automation to improve productivity across Alphabet for operational tasks, as well as the efficiency of our technical infrastructure. Second, managing our spend with suppliers and vendors more effectively.\nThird, optimizing how and where we work. In the Q1 of 2023, we expect to incur approximately $500 million of costs related to exiting leases to align our office space with our adjusted global headcount look. This will be reflected in corporate costs. We will continue to optimize our real estate footprint.\nTurning to CapEx for 2023, we expect total CapEx to be generally in line with 2022, with an increase in technical infrastructure versus a decline in office facilities. Our ongoing investment in technical infrastructure is obviously a critical component of supporting our long-term growth opportunities. Finally, I will point you to our earnings release, in which we noted that we adjusted the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment starting in Q1 2023. We expect these changes will favorably impact our 2023 operating results by approximately $3.4 billion for assets in service as of year-end 2022. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated.\nOur first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one around AI and sort of the cost of AI. I appreciate all the color about all the AI tools that are to come. I guess first question is, how should we think about the potential impact on CapEx and the higher compute intensity of these AI tools to come potentially impacting margins over the next couple of years? The second one, Ruth, really appreciate the conversation about long-term efforts underway to improve efficiency. How should we think about potential impacts of those efforts in 2023 and in 2024? Have you sort of run any sizes of what types of savings we could see roll through the P&L over that period? Thanks.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks for the question.\nStarting on your question about AI and CapEx, as I think Sundar and Philipp both noted, AI is already incorporated in many of our products, products like Performance Max, Smart Bidding, and Cloud, as Sundar said. It is more compute intensive, but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, for advertisers. That being said, we're very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that's across all elements, data centers, servers, and our supply chain. We're continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital. As I indicated in opening comments, when we look at CapEx for 2023, we do expect it's going to be generally in line with 2022, with an important makeshift.\nWe're increasing our investments in technical infrastructure, and that's not just for AI. That's to support investments across Alphabet, in particular, and Cloud as well. At the same time, we're meaningfully decreasing our CapEx for office facilities. With respect to the overall efficiency opportunities, yes, very keen focus on the three areas that I noted. One of the key elements of it is using AI and automation to improve productivity and efficiency of our technical infrastructure. We noted that we want to be focused, and we are focused on durable improvements to our expense base. That's because if you go through the items, the work streams that we have in flight, they take longer to implement, execute.\nThey're in process now, and they continue to build on themselves and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact on 2024 than in 2023. We're continuing to work through them.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks, Ruth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. I have two. For Sundar and Philipp, you both mentioned the NFL in your remarks and the opportunities it opens up. Can you come in and help us define, what do you see as that longer-term opportunity? Why is it so critical to have the NFL? Is this the first of many sports I feel that we had? Anything just to help us understand why this is so important to you. Philipp, you've said in the past about the scaling of monetization, YouTube Shorts. What are the sticky factors? What's taking the time to really bring advertisers on? What are some of the things you've seen in terms of what you've solved to make this a more quickly monetizable product? Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah. Thank you so much for the question. We think there is a lot of great opportunities to differentiate the user and creator experience with our unique capabilities. It basically means that every YouTube viewer who's interested in the NFL, can now have one-click access to the full offering of Sunday Ticket as an add-on package on a YouTube TV subscription, and as a standalone offering on Primetime Channels. This will be the first time that Sunday Ticket is actually available à la carte for fans.\nOn YouTube TV, we're building the ability for subscribers to, for example, watch multiple screens at once. On YouTube CTV, we'll be adding new features specific to the Sunday Ticket experience, like comments, chats, polls, and so on. On the creator side, imagine all the innovative ways they can create with exclusive NFL content, behind-the-scenes event access, and so on.\nWe're really excited to see what they'll do across long-form, Shorts, live streams, and more. On your second question, on the Shorts side, as I said earlier, viewership is growing rapidly, 50+ billion daily views, up from 30 billion last spring. We're still pleased with our continuing progress in monetization. Closing the gap between Shorts and long-form is a big priority for us, as is, of course, continuing to build a great creator and user experience, which we're paying a lot of attention to. Ads on Shorts are now available and give you a bit of a sign for the progress. We have video action, app discovery, Performance Max campaigns, and via product feed, Shorts are also shoppable.\nAgain, we're the only destination where creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats, across multiple screens, and really with multiple ways to make a living. Sundar shared just yesterday we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube partner program. Ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators. That's really what our focus is at the moment.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. One for Sundar and one for Ruth. For Sundar, can you just talk more about how you can bring the AI products to market with the principles and integrity that you talked about and how you can do that without kind of sacrificing quality or trust along the way? Ruth, clearly the language around re-engineering the cost structure in a durable way and everything that went along with it is different than what we've heard in the past. Is there any way at all to help us quantify how you're thinking about these efforts? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Doug. On the AI side, it is a really exciting time. I think we've been investing for a while, and it's clear that the market is ready. Consumers are interested in trying out new experiences. I think I feel comfortable with all the investments we have made in making sure we can develop AI responsibly. We'll be careful. We'll be launching more as labs products in certain cases, beta features in certain cases, and just slowly scaling up from there. Obviously, we need to make sure we are iterating in public. These models will keep getting better, so the field is fast changing. The serving costs will need to be improved.\nI view it as very, very early days, but we are committed to putting our experiences both in terms of new products and experiences, actually bringing direct LLM experiences in search, making APIs available for developers and enterprises, and learn from there and iterate like we've always done. I'm looking forward to it.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nOn your second question, when we talk about being focused on delivering sustainable financial value, that obviously means that expense growth cannot be growing ahead of revenue growth. We're focused on revenue upside, as well as durable changes to the expense base, to really ensure we have the capacity to invest in that growth.\nClearly, the emphasis for revenue growth, there's a lot that's exciting ahead of us within Google services, all of the AI advancements that are improving advertiser ROI and the search user experience, and more broadly, as we've talked about, across the key product areas. Very importantly, on expense growth, we have a very strong commitment to, we keep emphasizing, durably re-engineer our cost base. That will benefit all of the segments across Alphabet.\nThe key components: slowing the pace of hiring is a starting point, product prioritization across Google, as Sundar said, is key, improving economics in hardware as we focus intently on the Pixel line and cost structure, then using AI and automation to improve productivity for operational tasks as well as for the efficiency of our technical infrastructure where we have a number of work streams.\nManaging our spend, as I said, with suppliers and vendors, then optimizing how and where we work. You saw part of that with the real estate consolidation given the slower headcount growth. All of those not only benefit Google services, but many of those similarly drive a greater efficiency across Alphabet. As we've said, in Cloud, we remain very focused on the path to profitability. That's a revenue and margin driver. With Other Bets, we're similarly focused on investing sustainably.\nTo go back to it, the durable nature of change and some of the elements that I've talked about here where work is ongoing, you start to see impacting in 2023, but to really get full year run rate and the benefit of it, there is work ongoing. That's why we've emphasized this notion of it comes in and then really you see the run rate in 2024.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nHead of US Internet Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you so much. Maybe two, if I could. Sundar, for you, continuing on the AI theme, how do you think philosophically about capturing the opportunity set that you see in front of you, given all the investments you've made over the last five-plus years that we've been talking about, going back to a lot of Google I/Os, versus potentially disrupting the user experience or the monetization arc in your existing product set, and striking the right balance between the opportunity set and being disruptive to yourself when you think about looking forward over the next couple of years?\nRuth, maybe just following on some of the questions and debates on the cost structure. Obviously, Other Bets is an area where the losses continue to be sort of higher than what some of us think from the outside looking in, but then you showed some improvement in the losses in the Cloud division this quarter. How should we be thinking about the rationalization of the cost structure and aligning costs with opportunity sets across some of the divisions of Alphabet when you think for the medium to long term? Thanks so much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Eric. Look, I do think, first of all, it's such a foundational technology, and we've been investing not just in terms of research, but actually getting it all production scale ready.\nWe had already deployed, if you look at the impact, things like BERT and MUM have had on search quality, making search multimodal, driving the usage of products like Google Lens. I feel like we've been scaling up well. In Google Cloud today with Vertex AI, we've already been bringing AI APIs to enterprises, and they are on a pretty healthy growth path. We do see secular opportunities ahead, both in terms of putting these APIs out, making sure every developer, every organization in the world can use it. As I said earlier, we are in very, very early days, and I think there's a lot of room ahead.\nIn terms of search too, now that we can integrate more direct LLM type experiences in search, I think it'll help us expand and serve new types of use cases, generative use cases. I think I see this as a chance to rethink and reimagine and drive search to solve more use cases for our users as well. Again, early days, you will see us be bold, put things out, get feedback, and iterate and make things better.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of your question about Other Bets investment levels, as we've talked about in prior calls, our goal for Other Bets is to use our deep technology investments to drive innovation with real potential for value creation. At the same time, we are very focused on the overall pace of investment and the financial returns. What we're really looking at here is what are the opportunities for monetization and commercialization?\nAs I've said in prior calls, there is no monolithic approach across the portfolio, but we are very focused on what's the pace of investment, opportunities for monetization, and commercialization. Just a bit more with respect to the DeepMind move, to be very clear, we consolidate another bet into Google only when that bet supports products and services within Google, or for Alphabet broadly.\nYou saw us do that some time ago when we moved Chronicle, as an example, into combining with our Cloud business and really the cybersecurity offering that is now in Cloud, and that was very effective. With AI, this is obviously an Alphabet strategic priority, and we see huge opportunity ahead. DeepMind's research is core to that future across the product areas in the Alphabet portfolio.\nThis reporting change reflects the strategic focus in DeepMind, the support of each one of our segments. That's why I indicated that beginning Q1, DeepMind financials will be reported within our corporate cost segment.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you for taking my question. Just digging into search, kind of low single-digit growth, XFX. Can you talk about the pressures there of volume versus pricing or CPCs? What's really driving the slowdown is kind of almost back to 2009 recession levels. Just think about that. Any signs that we're near a bottom, any stabilization in growth rates you can talk about, or how your outlook is for 2023 on that? Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nOverall, as we've indicated, we remain very excited about all that we're doing in search, the utility for all of us. That's why you've heard so many comments about the application of AI and what that means for the ongoing opportunity. You had a number of different questions in there. I think one was on volumes. In the 10K that we'll be filing shortly, you'll see that for the full year 2022, CPCs were down 1% versus last year. As we've talked about in prior quarters, the change in CPCs can reflect a number of different factors: geographic mix, property mix, all sorts of things.\nClicks were up 10% in 2022, reflecting a number of factors, including increased engagement, primarily on mobile devices, and improvements in ad formats. I think overall, we're really excited about what we see ahead.\nWe're not going to predict the global environment. We did say the challenging backdrop is ongoing, and you can see that, but we're very focused on what we can control. I think most important and what we're really excited about here is innovation to help advertisers overall, and our cost re-engineering that really gets us to align this long-term sustainable value creation.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director and Internet Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah, just a question on the hardware business. Pixel is doing quite well, but it seems like there's been issues around other areas with this inventory write-down. Could maybe you guys just talk about, in your mind, the strategic importance of having the wide range of hardware products that you have in that segment as it relates to your overall AI initiatives? Thanks a lot.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Ross. First of all, very, very pleased with how Pixel has performed through a challenging macro environment. Look, I think our computing portfolio is incredibly important. It's what allows us to, for us to invest and drive innovation forward. You have to put it all together as a product and ship it. I think it ends up playing a very, very big role in guiding the ecosystem as well. Increasingly, I think users are thinking beyond phones and thinking through a holistic ecosystem.\nTo give you one example, us undertaking Pixel Watch and as part of that, integrating Fitbit and bringing it to our ecosystem as well, partnering closely with Samsung on Wear OS, the combination is what has driven over a 300% increase in actives on Android watches ecosystem. Just to give you context on that.\nWe are very thoughtful about how we are approaching this area. As Rick mentioned, across all these areas too, we are working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies in the portfolio. Obviously, we work through a challenging supply chain environment as well as a challenging environment on the demand side. We'll continue focusing on improving all of this in a durable way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHey, I'll just ask one question on Rick. You mentioned a couple of times getting Google Cloud to profitability. Just talk through how that gets done. You had almost 40% growth in Google Cloud. The operating loss level stayed about the same from 2021 to 2022, so the growth is there.\nWhat are the factors that need to be solved in order to get pretty nice profitability out of that segment, sort of anywhere akin to what Azure and AWS have been able to show over the years? Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks for the question. As we've talked about on prior calls with Google Cloud, we've really been investing ahead of our revenues given the growth in the opportunity overall, and the desire to ensure that we're equipped, able to support customers across segments around the globe. There's been meaningful investment to position ourselves to really have the momentum that the team has continued to deliver. That being said, they are, as both Sundar and I have noted, extremely focused on the path to profitability in every element of that.\nSome of the items that I noted that benefit Alphabet generally most certainly are relevant here for Cloud as well. Everything from our efficiency with our technical infrastructure, which we're very excited about, all the efforts that they're doing there, and more broadly. This has been really to ensure, first and foremost, given the scale of the opportunity and the speed with which it's moving, that we're positioned to be present with our customers to provide them with the analytics, the skills, and the capabilities that are needed to build for long-term growth. We're at a position now where we've meaningfully closed the gap to profitability, but still are working through as we continue to invest for growth while narrowing what this is on our march to profitability.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you, Ruth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader, Software, and Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon. Ruth, can you give us a sense of what you're seeing in Q1? Is this year a little more seasonal than historic? Are you observing any different patterns just over one month into the year? Can you give us any color in terms of how you're framing this quarter?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nI think, as you know well, we don't tend to, we don't provide exit run rates. What we tried to do is give you the context within which we're approaching the overall business and the priorities that we have as we're looking at revenue upside, the growth levers there, as well as how to re-engineer our expense base to deliver attractive returns. Not really much to add to the comments that you've heard to date, and we're continuing to execute across each one of the elements we discussed.\n\nBrent Thill",

Its real power is inside, where it does things other phones can't do, which is how it screens your calls for you and searches what you see. Takes stunning photos in the dark and shows skin tones as they really are. It's why it can edit annoying items out of pictures, like your ex and your ex-ex. Why it can turn your nosebleed seats into courtside pics. Shoot extreme close-ups and unblur faces. Why it'll keep getting even better as you use it. Why it'll even put some of that genius in your ears or on your wrist. Beautifully, of course. Introducing the new Google Pixel Watch, Google Pixel Buds Pro, and our newest Google Pixel phones.\nYo, boy, you see what's going on over there?\nHello.\nOh, OK. I see you.\nWhat?\nY'all want to run?\nOK, I see you. I see you.\nOne, two, three, ho!\nWe at the park. We hooping. We need one more person who's going to pull up.\nHey, Google, call Kenny. Already on the way.\nGet down!\nCome on, man. Who wants to fix this RAM now?\nYou got another one?\nOK, I see you!\nWhat started off as a neighborhood pickup game has turned into a spectacular event.\nHey, Nav, is that Jimmy Goldstein?\nYes, but does he have one of these?\nThis could be the best pickup game of all time.\nReally, bro?\nOK, Team Pixel, who else wants to run?\n\nOperator\n\n2022 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Google\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC, as updated in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended 30 September 2022, expected to be filed with the SEC later today. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.\nA reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in search and momentum in cloud. Our reported results reflect the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year's elevated growth levels, and the challenging macro climate. We are sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. The product announcements we have made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to search powered by AI, new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts, which will support the creator ecosystem, a strong series of hardware launches, and a new partnership and product announcements at Cloud Next. These will all drive value for users, partners, and our business.\nWe have also started our work to drive efficiency by realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities. Over the past quarter, we have made several shifts away from lower priority efforts to fuel higher growth priorities. Our Q4 headcount additions will be significantly lower than Q3. As we plan for 2023, we'll continue to make important trade-offs where needed, and are focused on moderating operating expense growth. Throughout Google's history, periods of dedicated focus have enabled us to emerge strongly and unleash new eras of computing innovation. For example, over a decade ago, focusing the company's efforts on mobile helped us to build and grow our business for the shift to mobile computing. We are at a similar point now with AI, another transformational technology.\nOur investments in AI and deep computer science mean that we can deliver a wide range of breakthroughs across our products and services to help people, businesses, and communities. Turning to the quarter, first, our core information products. At our Search On event, we shared how we are using AI advances to deliver a more natural and intuitive search experience. These advancements will soon help to surface things you might find helpful before you've even finished typing. We are also making visual search more natural than ever before. People now use Google Lens to answer more than 8 billion questions every month using just a photo or an image. Now, we are supercharging our visual search capabilities to help people find what they are looking for at businesses nearby. Philipp will also talk in more detail about our work to make it easier to shop on Google, a key focus.\nGoogle Lens also has an amazing translation feature. It can now blend translated text seamlessly into the background of images, like menus or street signs, in just 100 milliseconds, shorter than a blink of an eye. Through advanced language models, AI is unlocking new experiences that support more natural and conversational ways to interact with computing. Lambda is one of our most promising models for this. It's now available to demo in our AI Test Kitchen, which offers a way for people to experience and give feedback on emerging AI technology. DeepMind also debuted its most helpful and safest language model yet. Sparrow can talk to users, answer questions, and provide evidence-based answers using Google Search. Moving to YouTube, another big priority, we remain focused on long-term growth for our community of viewers, creators, and advertisers.\nTo that end, we announced some exciting changes at our Made on YouTube event last month. First, improving the monetization of Shorts. This is a big deal for creators and for our business. We'll introduce revenue sharing on Shorts early next year. This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long, and live formats at scale. Shorts continues to show great user momentum. We continue to invest in our mobile video tools for creators. We are seeing mobile-first creators investing more in the platform, creating content that helps the broader community grow. TV is a big area for us as well. Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the US in September for the first time. Turning next to hardware. Hardware is an important area of investment for us.\nWe are investing deeply from the silicon to the OS to powerful software experiences because it's a big opportunity to move computing forward and build deeper relationships with people who love using Google products. It also really helps to guide the Android ecosystem beyond just building the underlying platform. Earlier this month, we introduced the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7 Pro, and the very first Pixel Watch. We've also previewed more detail about the Pixel tablet, which is coming in 2023. Pixel combines our foundational technologies, AI, Android, and our Google Tensor G2 processor, to bring state-of-the-art AI directly to the device. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro offer industry-leading photography features that can unblur or sharpen photos, and shoot cinema-quality videos. We recently had our highest-selling week ever for Pixel, and I'm really proud of the positive reviews so far.\nAlong with great devices, we introduced our latest release of Android. Android 13 offers new personalization features, improved privacy controls, and a more seamless experience with connected devices. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q3 revenue of $6.9 billion, with Google Cloud Platform's revenue growth rate above aggregate. I've long shared that cloud is a key priority for the company. The long-term trends that are driving cloud adoption continue to play an even stronger role during uncertain macroeconomic times. Google Cloud helps customers solve today's business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs, and unlock new growth engines. At Cloud Next, we unveiled more than 100 new products, and announced new and expanding relationships with Toyota, Prudential, Coinbase, and AppLevel. The shift to hybrid work continues, with organizations evolving to support an increasingly distributed workforce.\nI'm proud to share that Google Workspace is now used by more than 8 million businesses and organizations worldwide. That includes Korean Air, as well as the US Army, which is transitioning 250,000 personnel to our secure communication and collaboration platform. In the past year, we have announced nearly 300 new capabilities to support hybrid work. Empowering a distributed workforce brings an increased need for cybersecurity to keep workers, data, and critical business systems safe and secure. It's top of mind for nearly every CEO I speak with. Customers, including the city of Los Angeles, Roche, and Bernarté, put their trust in Google Cloud's industry-leading products. Our new Chronicle Security Operations Suite unifies security analytics, automation response, and threat intelligence. This has helped Vertiv analyze 22x more security data while cutting investigation time in half.\nIn September, we closed our acquisition of Mandiant and are proud to welcome more than 2,600 colleagues to Google. With Mandiant, we add industry-leading threat intelligence and incident response capabilities to help customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. Customers partner with Google Cloud because we offer a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Our leadership here is winning customers across industries, including the state of Hawaii and the Australia Securities Exchange. Our capabilities help solve difficult business challenges like supply chain and logistics, while also creating new growth opportunities. As companies globally are looking to drive efficiencies, Google Cloud's open infrastructure creates a valuable pathway to reduce IT costs and modernize. In addition, with our new media CDN product for large media streaming workloads, we are helping Major League Baseball and Paramount Plus deliver flawless experiences to their customers.\nWith Google Cloud Edge, Rite Aid is more efficiently helping patients in their pharmacies. Across all of these areas, I'm proud of the trust and enthusiasm our customers are placing in Google Cloud. Briefly on our other bets, Waymo announced that Los Angeles will be its third rider-hailing city, joining Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo will begin by mapping several neighborhoods in LA as it prepares to serve people there. Wing just surpassed 300,000 commercial deliveries. It's servicing new areas in Australia, and announced its first drone delivery trials in Ireland. To close, times like this are clarifying. As we head into 2023, we are going to focus on our most important priorities as a company. To support our growth, we'll continue to invest responsibly for the long-term, in a way that is responsive to the current economic environment.\nI want to thank our employees around the world for their contributions over the last quarter. We help people, our partners, and society when we focus on what we do best and execute on that really well. Over to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. It's great to be joining you all today. Google Services revenues of $61 billion were up 2% year on year, negatively affected by a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Search and other revenues grew 4% year-over-year to $40 billion, led by travel and retail, while both YouTube ads and network had modest year-over-year revenue declines. Other revenues were up 2% year-over-year, with growth in YouTube non-advertising and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues. Play revenues were lower due to a number of factors, including a decline in user engagement in gaming from the elevated levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Among other factors, this shift in user behavior also created downward pressure on our advertising revenues, with lower revenues from app promo spend on YouTube, network, and Play ads in Search and other.\nI'll highlight a couple of other trends that affected our ads business in Q3, and Ruth will provide more detail. On the second quarter earnings call, we noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers in YouTube and network, and these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. In search and other, the largest factor in the deceleration in Q3 was lapping the outsized performance in 2021. In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas in search ads. For example, in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage, and crypto subcategories. There's no question we're operating in an uncertain environment, and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways depending on where they are in the world. When it comes to how we're helping, our focus remains unchanged.\nThe same AI driving breakthroughs in everything from protein folding, flood forecasting, and language understanding is also fueling innovation across our ads products. Via insights, automation, and easier-to-use advertising tools and formats, we're helping businesses stay agile, build resilience, anticipate the future, and show up for customers in more connected, visual, and consistent ways. We're helping them understand demand, deal with inventory challenges, increase loyalty, and much more. In challenging times like these, advertisers are carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. Search tends to do relatively well in such an environment, given its strong measurability and focus on delivering ROI. It's also well-suited to quickly adjust to changes in consumer behavior. When search is coupled with our automation products across bidding, creatives, targeting, or Performance Max, it can drive performance even further. Let's talk retail, an important vertical for us.\nNo matter where shoppers are buying, whether it's in store, online, or both, we have the solutions to help them deliver results wherever their customers are. Take online fashion retailer Revolve, who used its global influencer network, along with our category insights and automated tools, to acquire new customers at lower costs. As festivals and events returned to summer, Revolve used lower-funnel solutions across search and shopping to engage with consumers in high-demand apparel categories, helping across $1 billion in trailing 12-month net sales for the first time. There's Magazine Luiza, a large Brazilian retailer who embraced omnichannel by measuring and bidding directly to store sales. Coupled with in-store pickup and rotations via PMax, Magazine Luiza drove a 38% ROAS over 30 days, and has since expanded the strategy to all eligible products, including $8 million+ new offers.\nWhether shoppers know exactly what they're looking for or are just seeking inspiration, we're innovating to make it easier and more engaging for people to shop online across our services. From finding the best deals across all types of merchants, including $200 million+ available daily deals in Q3, to new ways to search, know when you type shop followed by whatever item you're looking for, you'll unlock a visual content stream of ideas that feel just like window shopping, but online. Then there's YouTube. Not only can users know by more products and videos, but shopping as entertainment experiences are bringing the magic of our creators to the shopping experience. Like in September, when Kylie and Kris Jenner hosted an exclusive shopping stream event to celebrate the debut of a new Kris collection for Kylie Cosmetics.\nAt Ad Week last week, not only did we announce that product feeds are coming to Discovery, but that creators will soon be able to tag products from brands across their videos, Shorts, and live streams. This means viewers can shop products seamlessly while they watch their favorite content, while merchants can drive incremental reach and engagement for free listing offers when tagged by creators that viewers love and trust. I already touched on YouTube's performance in the quarter. Let's deep dive into what we're focused on. First, we're helping advertisers understand how they can drive effectiveness with every campaign they run on YouTube. Full funnel is a key way to do this. Buying YouTube across consideration, awareness, and action allows marketers to meet customers at different stages in their purchasing journey, which we know are increasingly complex, while delivering towards a key business goal.\nCreative and media work together across the funnel to create new demand and convert current demand. Castlery, a Singapore furniture retailer, activated the full funnel approach as part of its US expansion. It used brand and action formats, identified its most relevant audiences, and built a robust measurement framework to boost sales and awareness, including a 65% increase in US brand searches. Castlery is using the same strategy for the upcoming holiday season. Two other areas where we're continuing to invest: connected TV and shorts. First, on CTV, eyeballs keep moving away from traditional TV. On average, global viewers are watching 700 million plus hours of YouTube content on TV daily. According to Nielsen, during the 2021-2022 US broadcast seasons, YouTube reached more viewers during prime time on CTV than any linear TV network. Brands continue to take notice.\nLike Instacart, who tapped into CTV to maximize its TV screen strategy for its \"The World is Your Cart\" brand campaign featuring Lizzo. It drove breakout searches for its product and above-average brand lift across awareness, consideration, and purchase intent. It also engaged a significant increase in audience on top of TV, with 66% lower CPMs. There's shorts. 1.5 billion users every month, 30 billion daily views. Engagement is strong. We've always said that we focus on building great user and creator experiences first, and then follow that with monetization over time. As of September, ads on shorts have officially launched via video action, app, and Performance Max campaigns. As Sundar mentioned, we also extended the YouTube Partner Program, and announced our revenue-sharing model for shorts creators, the first of its kind for short-form content.\nIt's early, but we're encouraged by the progress we've made this year in Shorts monetization and support for sustaining the creator ecosystem. I'll close with something I've said before, and I think it's worth reiterating. Our success is only possible when our customers and partners succeed. Whether it's helping individual YouTube creators or Play developers make a living and build thriving businesses, or bringing the best across Google to our partners, our focus on driving growth for our partners and key ecosystems remains steadfast. I'm proud that over the past three years, we've paid creators, artists, and media companies over $50 billion. In terms of how we're helping our partners innovate, I'll share two highlights.\nFirst, a transformative partnership with Transsion, the number one OEM in Africa and Pakistan, will help it close the digital divide by doubling annual activations by 2025 and build helpful products for the next billion users. In commerce with FEMSA Digital in Mexico, we're bringing together solutions across ads, cloud, maps, Waze, and beyond to bolster its data and analytics capabilities so it can better reach and retain its beverage and retail customers. On behalf of many, a massive thank you to our customers and partners for their collaboration, trust, and feedback. Another massive thank you to our sales, partnerships, product engineering, and support teams. The hard work, dedication, and ingenuity of Googlers, especially during more challenging times, is truly second to none. On that note, over to you, Ruth.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in search, and momentum in cloud. Our reported results clearly reflect the effect of foreign exchange. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.1 billion, up 6%, or up 11% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, up 13%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.3 billion, up 20%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by hardware costs. Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, up 26%, reflecting the following. First, the increases in R&D and G&A expenses, which were driven primarily by headcount growth.\nThe growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promotions, followed by headcount growth. Operating income was $17.1 billion, down 19% versus last year, and our operating margin was 25%. Other income and expense was a loss of $902 million. Net income was $13.9 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16.1 billion in the quarter and $63 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $116 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. As a reminder, we provide fixed foreign exchange revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. All segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. Starting with our Google Services segment, total Google Services revenues were $61.4 billion, up 2%.\nAcross our advertising revenues, the year-over-year deceleration in growth rates versus the third quarter of last year was largely driven by lapping very strong performance, most notably in search and other revenues. Additionally, the year-on-year deceleration on YouTube and network reflects a pullback in spend by some advertisers, as we first noted last quarter. In terms of the revenue lines, Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.5 billion in the quarter were up 4%. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.1 billion were down 2%. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 2%. Other revenues were $6.9 billion, up 2%, reflecting several factors. First, subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV continued to drive ongoing strong growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues. Second, we delivered solid growth in hardware revenues, primarily from sales of the Pixel 6a.\nFinally, the growth in these two areas was offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels in gaming compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $11.8 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $19.8 billion, down 17%, and the operating margin was 32%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $6.9 billion for the second quarter, up 38%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $699 million. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $209 million, and the operating loss was $1.6 billion.\nLet me close with some comments on our outlook. Our results in the third quarter reflect an increased headwind from foreign exchange, given the ongoing strengthening of the US dollar versus last year. Excluding the revenue benefit from hedging, there was a 6-point headwind year-on-year, or 5 points with the hedge benefit, compared with a slight tailwind in the third quarter of 2021. Looking to the fourth quarter, based on strengthening of the US dollar quarter to date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. In addition, as we have previously said, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the US, with most of our R&D efforts located here.\nTurning to our segment results, within the Google Services segment, Search and other revenues had healthy fundamental growth in the third quarter, which was affected by the impact of currency movements. As I already noted, the largest driver of the deceleration in year-on-year growth of Search, compared with Q3 2021, was lapping the outsized growth in 2021. The sequential deceleration in the year-on-year growth of Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was also driven by lapping, with an additional headwind from pullback in advertiser spend in some areas. In YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in the third quarter versus the second quarter primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues.\nWithin other revenues, we expect an ongoing headwind from the slowdown in buyer spend on Google Play due to a number of factors, including lower levels of user engagement in gaming that impacted results in the second and third quarters. As Philipp mentioned, among other factors, this shift in user behavior was also a headwind to advertising revenues, with lower revenues from app promo spend on YouTube, network, and Play ads in Search and other. Turning to Google Cloud, our results reflect momentum across GCP and Workspace. Customers globally are adopting our products and services to digitally transform their businesses. We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption, and we continue to invest accordingly. We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability.\nIn terms of profitability, we have an effort underway to ensure we redeploy investments against our most compelling opportunities. As we noted on our second quarter call, our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 12,765 people in the third quarter, including more than 2,600 of those joining Google Cloud as part of our acquisition of Mandiant. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. In the fourth quarter, we expect headcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3. Within this slower headcount growth next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent. Turning to CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technical infrastructure, with servers as the largest component. Thank you.\nSundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one one on your telephone. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you very much. Maybe two questions, if I can. Sundar, first, I think what investors are very curious about is how much this change in terms of aligning investment against your priorities is a reflection of what you expect to happen over the next 6 to 12 months in the broader macro environment versus a longer-term perspective of maybe maximizing for productivity and efficiency. We'd love to get your philosophy on that. Philipp, a lot of comments in there about YouTube and the potential for growth going forward. Can you go a little bit deeper on what you're seeing in terms of both the opportunity set to drive revenue and turn a possible headwind to a tailwind with respect to shorts and connected TV over the medium to long-term? Thanks so much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks. I would say it's a combination. Obviously, as a company, over time, we've had periods of extraordinary growth, and then there are periods where I view this as a moment where you take the time to optimize the company to make sure we are set up for the next decade of growth ahead. I view this as one of those moments. It gives us a chance to make sure we are, with clarity, identifying what are the most important areas, and making sure we are directing our incremental investments towards those, as well as where we can realign. I view this as an opportunity to do that and also being responsive to the current macro environment we are seeing.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYes. From my side, Eric, in the third quarter, as I mentioned, there was a further pullback in spend by some advertisers across both brand and direct response. Overall, I feel YouTube remains in a really good position to continue to benefit from the streaming boom. In direct response, we think there's a lot of room to run to make really YouTube more shoppable, more actionable, from video action campaigns to product feeds, app campaigns, and live commerce features. Advertisers are turning to YouTube to convert intent into action and really drive performance at scale. Product feeds are coming to Discovery ads soon, and recently expanded to Shorts. We were already seeing results. In fact, on average, video action campaigns with product feeds saw an over 70% increase in conversions on Shorts versus those without.\nOn the brand side, as I said earlier, eyeballs are moving away from linear TV, and we are helping brands move beyond traditional to efficiently, really achieve their reach and awareness goals. Obviously, you mentioned that as well. Connected TV is an important part of this strategy. When you think about it, YouTube is really the best place for advertisers to reach new consumers across multiple formats and screens, from Shorts to long-form, podcast, music, all the way to CTV.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please, Brian Nowak.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one for Sundar or Ruth. Sundar, just to go back to the comment about earlier in the quarter becoming 20% more efficient. I thought tonight your comment on investing responsibly over the long-term, about being responsive to the environment, is helpful. If I look at sort of the Excel sheet, I think you'll have added about 51,000 new people to the company since the start of last year. Can you give us some examples of internal KPIs or quantifiable analysis you're running just to ensure you're generating ROI for investors from all your hiring as you sort of run through these analyses? That's the first one.\nThe second one, Philipp, just on Shorts, are you seeing Shorts lead to incremental time spent from those users, or is it more so you're seeing the time shift from other forms of YouTube over to Shorts?\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nBrian, I think we gave some, we've been clear that we are going to moderate our pace of hiring going into Q4 as well as 2023. I think we are seeing a lot of opportunities across a whole set of areas, and every time, talent is the most precious resource. We are constantly working to make sure everyone we have brought in is working on the most important things as a company, and particularly so, and that's a lot of what sharpening our focus has been about. We are reviewing projects at all scales pretty granularly to make sure we have the right plans there, and based on that, the right resourcing and making course corrections. This will be an ongoing thing. It is something we'll continue doing going into 2023 as well.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYes. To the second part of the question, as we discussed before, we've always focused on building a great user and creator experience first, followed by increasing monetization over time. We continue to experience a slight headwind to revenues as Shorts viewership grew as a percentage of total YouTube watch time. As I alluded to earlier, the initial progress on Shorts monetization has been encouraging, and we're focused on closing the monetization gap between Shorts and long-form content on YouTube over time. More specifically, consumers are increasingly consuming short-form video. We're seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube. As I said earlier, Shorts are being watched by 1.5 billion+ logged-in users every month.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your question, please, Doug Anmuth.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the question. Ruth, you highlighted momentum in cloud, and growth accelerated in Q3. Are you seeing any changes in cloud demand as existing or potential customers perhaps rethink their priorities? How should we think about the pace of investments at cloud going forward? Do you still believe that you're in more catch-up mode, or should we expect a more stable rate of investment and greater profit improvement? Thanks.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nThanks for the question. Yes, we are pleased with the ongoing momentum. It's across a wide range of industries and geographies, and it really comes back to the team's focus on helping them solve unique business issues and innovate in new areas as they digitally transform. I think more to your question, we talked about this last quarter. In some cases, certain customers are taking longer to decide, and some have committed to deals with shorter terms or smaller deal sizes, which we attribute to more challenging macro environments. Some are impacted due to reasons that are specific to their business. Overall, as you can see from the results here again, we're pleased with the momentum in cloud, and do continue to be excited about the long-term opportunity. That's why I made the comment that we do continue to invest meaningfully in this business.\nWe're still focused very much so on the path to profitability and free cash flow strength here, we are continuing to invest in the business. This fits within Sundar's overall comments as we're looking at how we prioritize, and they're certainly making sure they're focused on every element within their business. Fundamentally, to the heart of your question, we're continuing to invest here.\n\nDoug Anmuth\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Your line is open, Michael Nathanson.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. Sundar, one for you and then one for you, Ruth. I want to ask you about TikTok, but not as it relates to YouTube, more about search. It looks like younger consumers are spending more time on TikTok searching for product reviews, recommendations, advice. I'm interested in learning if you've seen any changes in your search behavior by demographics at Google. Do you think search has become more visual and less text-based going forward in order to maintain more relevance for younger users? That's one. Ruth, can you kind of just dig in a bit on the OpEx growth in Google services? You called out how the cost of revenue is being up 20%. It looks like as a percentage of revenues, it's nearly an all-time high.\nCan you talk a bit about how much of that cost base is fixed versus variable, and anything on outlook and what's driving kind of the spike this quarter, and maybe what we expect going forward there on the cost of revenues? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nLook, I think it's always important that we try and understand our user segments and their needs so that we can make sure the products are helpful and working for them. We ourselves conduct thousands of studies a year to understand how user needs are evolving. As part of it, there are some studies which obviously show people, particularly younger users, insert in categories, maybe fashion inspiration as an example, look for more visual ways to engage. These are all learnings we are constantly taking in, and we use it to improve search. If you saw Search On, we had many explorations and product directions which move in that direction. I think it's a healthy way of iterating and innovating to build the best products and services for our users.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of your question regarding margins, two parts really. On other cost of revenues, the biggest driver of the year-on-year increase in other cost of revenues does continue to be data centers and other operations. The change really here this quarter in Q3, the second largest driver was hardware, and then CAC moved from its usual number two spot down to number three. There were really two key factors for the change in the rank order between hardware and CAC. Probably pretty self-evident, but just to spell them out, the year-on-year decline in YouTube ads revenues obviously muted the growth in CAC. The growth of Pixel phone sales, due primarily to the launch of Pixel 6a, drove that shift.\nWhat we're looking at overall, sort of to your broader question about profitability in Google Services, is the overall pace of investments and how we're looking at how, with the mix change and ongoing opportunities to drive revenue growth, it flows through all the way to up-ink growth. To Sundar's opening comments, and as we've been talking about, some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues with a very strong growth of revenues, and there was a lag in investments. What we're focused on here is how do we continue to manage on a go-forward basis to deliver durable, long-term results.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler of Barclays. Your question, please, Ross Sandler.\n\nRoss Sandler\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, guys. I hate to beat the dead horse on the Google Services margin, but Ruth, you just mentioned mix shift. I think that's a lot of what's going on here. Given the trajectory that you're seeing in Search and in Play, which we estimate are where most of the profit's coming from in that segment versus some of those lower margin items, YouTube subscription, hardware, et cetera, maybe you could help frame the next couple of years. Is this going to land below pre-pandemic, which I think was around where we are here at 32%? Could we see the Q2 2020 low of 27% for Google Services margin? Any help just framing where that might land would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nWell, I'll, as I'm sure you would expect, leave the modeling to you, but there are two elements of it. I think Sundar and Philipp really talked about the first part, which is the ongoing opportunity we see with Search, with YouTube, with some of the actions that we're taking. The opportunity with AI applied to both, the opportunity as we continue to build out monetization on YouTube Shorts in particular. We're continuing to focus on both the driver here, revenue, as well as the investments that we're making. I want to make sure to Sundar's comments about sharpening our focus that we are economizing, utilizing resources as effectively as possible. It is both the efforts we're taking around expense management and building for durable performance, as well as the efforts we're taking, which are in the investment line, but drive top-line performance.\nI would say we also contextualize it, and I tried to do that in response to Michael's questions. We said this last year, we've noted it, that some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues. We had a very strong growth in revenues, a surge in revenues, and a lag in investments that we said was a timing difference. You are seeing some of that here. To the main point, we're looking at both what we can do to continue to support long-term revenue growth, while doing so, being mindful of the pace of investment. I'll leave the modeling to you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Your line is open, Brent Thill.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nRuth, on the pullback by some advertisers, is there a common thread that you can draw, and common underlying characteristics that are pulling back versus those that are continuing to lean forward? Can you talk about that dynamic and what you're seeing?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nWhy don't I start, then I'll pass it to Philipp for a bit more color potentially, because I want to make sure that one of the comments that we made in the opening comments was very clear, which was the year-on-year story in ads was really lapping the very strong third quarter. To get to your question, you're really talking about sequential decline on year-on-year growth. I think what's notable in search, we had really healthy growth in Q3, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The sequential deceleration in search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was, again, primarily driven by lapping. I just want to make sure that was clear. There was some pullback from advertiser spend in some areas. Philipp noted that in opening comments.\nIn YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in both the second quarter and the third quarter versus the second quarter was really further pullbacks in advertiser spend.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah, that's exactly right. As I said earlier, in search and other ads revenues, while lapping the outsized performance was the largest factor in Q3, we did see some advertiser pullback in certain areas in search ads. I think the example I called out was in financial services, in the areas of insurance, loan, mortgage, crypto subcategories. We also noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers in YouTube and Network. These pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. We also noted lower revenues from ad promo spend on YouTube and Network.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Mark Mahaney. Apologies, we'll need to go to the next question that comes from Maria Ripps. Maria Ripps of Canaccord, your line is open. Please stand by.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nHolding to see if there are technical difficulties. Thank you all. If the operator could keep us posted here, maybe even drop it.\n\nOperator\n\nYes, ma'am.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you so much for your patience. Again, our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney, please go ahead.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nJust checking, can you hear me?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nThank you.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHello?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nWe can hear you, Mark. Thank you.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ruth. Okay, two questions, please. One, Sundar, you've been with the company for a long time. You've seen these cycles before. Can you put any context as to the, as economic conditions wax and wane, the impact that has on Google? How does this environment look to you versus prior cycles that the company has managed through? Ruth, on the cost side, I understand the comments. We understand the comments about the headcount ads and what you plan to do in the fourth quarter. Could you talk about non-headcount-related costs and the opportunity you see or the need you see for managing those down? Do you see that there are significant opportunities to do that as well? Again, non-headcount costs. Thank you very much.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Mark. A couple of things. I think compared to the past, going through this, I mean, there is, as we have said before, more uncertainty as we go through. We definitely see indicators on both sides, so that makes it a bit more unique. Number two, I would say the strength of search, both as a product for users, as well as for advertisers in terms of delivering ROI through a tough time in the ad market, is great to see. Third, just like when we went through it last time, ahead of us was a decade of mobile and the opportunities it brought. To me, sitting now, looking at all the work that's going on in AI, we've been an AI-first company for the past seven years and all the investments, it looks like a big opportunity ahead.\nKeeping all that in mind, focused on the long-term, using this moment to be disciplined, prioritize, and focus, I think will set us up well for the next decade ahead.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of your second question, I think the core to Sundar's comment is with the rapid pace of growth that we've experienced, we see opportunities to focus more. That drives opportunities to redeploy amazing talent we have into the highest priority efforts that we have, and to be as effective and efficient as possible. There are obviously, to your question, non-payroll associated expenses that also then attach. In an operating environment like this, it adds urgency to prioritization. We want to make sure we're using all resources as effectively and efficiently as possible. At the same time, as we've tried to be very clear, there are very exciting areas that we will continue to invest in. Part of this is resource optimization, constraint optimization, however you want to describe it.\nWe want to free up where we can to ensure we have capacity to invest as needed in opportunities that deliver these durable, long-term results that we've talked about. We're trying to be smart about redeploying where we can, finding efficiencies where we can, while still investing for long-term growth.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maria Ripps of Canaccord. Maria Rips, your line is open.\n\nMaria Ripps\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Canaccord\n\nGreat, thanks so much for taking my questions. First, you talked about strength in retail and travel. Can you maybe talk about automotive advertising and whether you're seeing any signs of recovery as supply has been normalizing? If so, how might this rebound sort of compare to prior cycles? Secondly, just on Performance Max, it seems like it continues to do pretty well here. Based on your conversations with advertisers, are there any specific features or functionality that you would call out as significant drivers of the product's attractiveness? Is there any color you can add maybe around relative ROI of PMax?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYes, there's really no additional color. Thank you very much for your question, but there's really no additional color on other verticals apart from the ones I mentioned already that I think we should share here at this moment. On the Performance Max side, which we touched on earlier and in prior quarters, and just as a little reminder, it's our fully automated Google Ads campaign type with the most channel and inventory coverage that really helps advertisers deliver a better ROI. We've been listening to feedback from advertisers and have continued to roll out more features since its initial launch to increase transparency and help advertisers steer the automation more effectively. There are more future updates to come.\nIn July, we launched a number of new settings, including a seasonality setting that lets marketers make quite typical adjustments for seasonal campaign bidding, and an optimization score setting that gives an indicator for performance improvement, and gives recommendations for better results. All in all, we're excited about what's ahead for PMAX, the further simplification of our product in general, and, frankly, the value we can keep driving for businesses of all sizes, especially when they need it most.\n\nMaria Ripps\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Canaccord\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Justin Post, your line is open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks. I guess a follow-up about artificial intelligence. First, CapEx is up 31% year-over-year. Can you talk about a little bit what's driving that, and can that be pulled back a bit? Is that cloud or really building out the AI capabilities? Maybe, Sundar, as you think about search where it is today, and you have much better visibility on AI capabilities than we do, how could some of those capabilities be mixed into search, and when would we as investors maybe see some of those benefits? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet",
    "content2": "Thanks, Justin. Look, I mean, I think on the AI front, we are still in very early innings. We've been very good about, as our research teams are making progress, bringing it into search. Pretty much the transformer-based models, including BERT and MUM, are in search now. It's driven a massive improvement in search quality and helped us extend the lead in quality over other products. We are definitely using it to make it multimodal. I think going back to some of the earlier questions about making sure search is visual, things like Google Lens, bringing visual search into being able to point your phone at things and ask questions, all that really helps set up search well for the future of where computing is headed. AI not only affects search, it affects all our products. It makes YouTube better, ads better.\nThrough cloud, we are bringing it to other companies as well. We'll keep that in mind. Maybe to, we'll keep that in mind. Thanks.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nRuth, on the CapEx, where's most of that going to, and how do you think about that going forward?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nCFO, Alphabet\n\nThe majority of CapEx does continue to be for our technical infrastructure. As we've talked about on prior calls, servers really have been the largest driver of the investment dollars. The technical infrastructure team has consistently focused on levers to improve utilization and efficiency, and they continue to do so. We are investing, to Sundar's comments, in building out the compute in support of all that we're doing with our AI teams, and are excited about that. Obviously, you had seen some more activity earlier in the year regarding real estate. We feel good about where we are. We're continuing to fit out our offices, etc., for utilization in this new return to hybrid work environment. We're trying to make sure that we're doing that at an appropriate, measured pace. That's really it. Thank you very much.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you, Ruth. Thank you, Sundar.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Jim Friedland for closing remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Google\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our fourth quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames H. Friedland\n\nDirector of IR, Alphabet Inc.\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\nWith us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler and Ruth Porat. Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO & Director, Alphabet Inc.\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm proud of how our teams continue to build helpful products and experiences for people and partners. Reflecting this, our performance in Search in the second quarter was strong. We are also seeing momentum in Cloud.\nWith an uncertain global economic outlook, our strategy to invest in deep technology and computer science to build helpful products for the long term is the right one. Our ability to take the long view stems from our timeless mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\nAt Google I/O in May, I talked about 2 key ways we move that mission forward, advancing both knowledge and computing. Those goals are at the heart of what we do. We know that our services are particularly helpful to people and businesses during uncertain moments, whether it's using Search or YouTube define anything from anywhere or highly efficient tools like Search Ads that help businesses of all sizes reach customers or Google Cloud, which helps companies adapt to hybrid work and find efficiencies.\nWe'll continue to invest in areas like AI, Search and Cloud, and we'll do it responsibly and in a way that is responsive to the current environment. Earlier this month, I announced that we'll be slowing our hiring and sharpening our focus as a company. We are focused on hiring engineering, technical and other critical roles. And we are working to improve productivity and ensure that the great talent we do hire is aligned with our long-term priorities.\nTurning now to product highlights. Years ago, we made a big bet on AI. We believe that it would be transformational for our business and for the world. We are still in the early days, yet AI already underpins many of our most helpful products and services.\nFor example, AI is helping us create entirely new ways to search. People are using Google Lens to do visual searches more than 8 billion times per month. A new feature called multisearch helps people find what they need using words and images at the same time.\nLater this year, multisearch will be able to help people find local results near them. AI is also helping improve translation. With the new monolingual approach to translation, we've added 24 new languages to Google Translate, spoken by 300 million people. And a new immersive view in Maps uses computer vision, AI and billions of images to create high fidelity representations of places around the world.\nBeyond AI, we are also seeing a new frontier with augmented reality. We have been testing exciting prototypes in our labs like the device we shared at IO that puts real-time translation and transcription in your line of sight. It's one example of how AR can solve real needs in the real world.\nAnd last week, we announced that we will soon begin early testing of AR prototypes in real-world scenarios. Our goal is to learn how they can help people in their everyday lives. Our investments in commerce are another way we deliver helpful experiences. People are shopping across Google more than 1 billion times each day. We see hundreds of millions of shopping searches on Google Images each month.\nMerchants will soon be able to submit 3D images of their products to appear directly on Google Search. So customers can try before they buy. We're also focused on bringing together hardware, software and AI in a range of helpful devices.\nAt IO, we announced great new products, including Pixel 6A, Pixel Buds Pro and Pixel Watch. We are currently taking preorders for Pixel 6A and Pixel Buds Pro. It's been great to see the positive feedback so far.\nAnd on platforms, I'm proud that Android remains the world's most popular operating system with more than 3 billion monthly active devices worldwide. Last year alone, consumers activated 1 billion Android phones. We are making it easier for Android users to share photos and communicate with friends and family with a modern messaging standard called Rich Communication Services or RCS.\nAcross our platforms and beyond, we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. Safe browsing on Chrome browsers help protect billions of people every day by warning them when they try to access dangerous sites or files.\nEarlier this year, we rolled out a new machine learning model that identifies more than twice as many potentially malicious sites and phishing attacks as the previous model, helping to contribute to a safer and more secure web.\nWe've also unified our password managers across Chrome and Android. Now stored passwords can be grouped and protected across devices, apps on the web.\nTaking a closer look at YouTube. YouTube Shorts are watched by over 1.5 billion signed-in users every month with more than 30 billion daily views. In Q2, YouTube TV surpassed 5 million subscribers, including trailers. There's also a lot of potential for shopping on YouTube. Just last week, we announced a partnership with Shopify.\nIt will help creators easily connect their stores to YouTube and enable shopping across their live streams and videos. There's more to come here.\nMoving on to Cloud, which surpassed a $6 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Q2 revenue grew to $6.3 billion, with momentum across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace.\nWe saw continued demand in all geographies with global brands like Target in North America, H&M Group in Europe, Banco BV in Latin America and BioPharma in Asia. We launched Google Public Sector in June, expanding our commitment to help U.S. government agencies and public institutions accelerate their digital transformations from New York State and Arizona State University to the U.S. Forest Service and the state of Rhode Island.\nCustomers are choosing Google Cloud as their technology partner because of our leadership in 4 areas. First, we continue to lead in the data cloud market because we unify data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud.\nCompanies like S.C. Johnson, Northwell Health and the Golden State Warriors choose Google Cloud for our strength in data analytics. Our capabilities helped Swiss Air optimize its flight operations. They're also helping Engie explore ways to optimize wind energy management and (inaudible) to create smarter factory floors.\nSecond, companies like BetaBank and Mayo Clinic choose their open cloud infrastructure to modernize their IT systems on our cloud at the edge or in their data centers. Our infrastructure scales to help customers like Deutsche Telekom modernize its network, Wipro to modernize its core systems and Garvan Institute of Medical Research to process 14,000 genomes in under 2 weeks. Our multi-cloud strategy remains a differentiator for customers like Elevance Health formerly known as Anthem and AMD.\nThird, cybersecurity. Google has always provided a secure cloud infrastructure, and we continue to introduce new cybersecurity products that help customers deduct, protect and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats.\nCustomers like GitLab, Highmark Health and Iron Mountain protect their critical systems and data with our products. [Carryable Coffee] and Etsy are among the 5 million websites protected by our cybersecurity technology. Finally, Google Workspace's easy to use and secure communication and collaboration tools continue to be chosen by many organizations as they return to hybrid work. Google Workspace helped St. Luke's Medical Center, a leading health care system in the Philippines address a 38% increase in telehealth visits during the pandemic.\nResults like this are driving growth in many customer segments around the world, including digital natives like Canva, large enterprises like Travis Perkins plc and public sector institutions, including the Central Dutch Government.\nFinally, our other bets. Waymo expanded rider-only testing with employees to include Downtown Phoenix and started testing at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. It also began charging trusted tested riders in San Francisco, a step closer to launching a commercial service with fully autonomous trips.\nWaymo also opened a new facility to support Waymo Via, their autonomous Class 8 trucking solution as they continue to increase their operations and investment across the Southwest region. Calico is testing an investigational drug treatment in patients with ALS, developed in collaboration with AbbVie. It's an early step of many in the development process.\nWing recently surpassed 250,000 commercial deliveries and unveiled a series of delivery drone prototypes able to carry different sized packages. There is good progress here and will continue to be intentional across the portfolio. To close, while the economic outlook is uncertain, it's been great to see people gathering in person again.\nWe are pleased to see people coming back into the office more often, resulting in more opportunities for collaboration. It's a privilege to build technology that's helpful in both good times and uncertain ones. And I want to thank everyone at Alphabet and Google for their work and support of people, businesses and all of our partners everywhere. Over to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSenior VP & Chief Business Officer, Google LLC\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. It's always great to be with you all. As Sundar indicated, we're as focused as ever on helping businesses navigate complexity and operate from a position of confidence.\nAI-powered tools, insights and automation are arming customers and partners with the ability to stay agile and responsive so they can capture short-term opportunities while also building for the long term. You've seen our own commitment to the long term in our latest innovation announcements at IO, Google Marketing Live and Brandcast.\nSundar covered a number of these. I'll dive deeper into a few more, including how we're improving our advertiser experiences and building simpler, more useful products for our partners.\nWithin Google Services, Search delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by performance in both travel and retail. In travel, users appetite continued to remain strong heading into the summer season. Searches for places to visit in summer were up 2x globally year-over-year, while searches for last-minute hotel deals were up 50%.\nHowever, as we've all seen in the news recently, the travel sector has been experiencing some challenges. As always, we're committed to helping our travel partners navigate this with insights and new tools.\nThen there's retail, where we had another solid quarter. At GML, we highlighted how we're continuing to innovate to help merchants make the most of how quickly consumer shopping is evolving, like Best Buy was embracing a full omnichannel approach from measurement to bidding to using omni ad formats across Google.\nBy adopting omni across its local inventory ads portfolio and showcasing curbside and in-store pickup, Best Buy increased in-store revenue from Google Ads by 34% last year.\nToday's customers expect to shop wherever, whenever, and they care as much about local as they do about finding inspiration for the next purchase online. In Q2, searches for open now, near me were up 8x globally year-over-year, while searches for designer outlet jumped 90%. We also saw strong interest in apparel categories like women's clothing and in beauty categories like perfume and fragrances.\nWith AI-powered tools like Performance Max, which local and smart shopping campaigns will upgrade too in time for the holidays, we're helping businesses move at speed and scale to reach new and existing customers wherever they are in their shopping journey with relevant, useful content.\nWe've seen strong momentum with P-Max. Advertiser adoption is up 5x year-to-date. Sustainable Apparel brand, Rothy's drove a 59% increase in conversions and a 60% increase in revenue after turning to P-Max. By leveraging its creative assets and showing them at scale, Rothy's reached more customers in a way they hadn't been able to do before.\nInnovating across Search and YouTube also remain top priorities. Sundar mentioned new 3D AR features. Target and Wayfair are testing these to help customers see and shop products in real life.\nWe launched new ad formats for more visual browsy search experiences. And then there's cool live commerce capabilities like live direct which let creators start a shopping live stream on their channel and then redirect viewers to a brand's channel for more.\nLet's dive deeper into YouTube. In the second quarter, the biggest factor in the year-over-year comparison was the lapping of a very strong second quarter in 2021 when we experienced a strong recovery from the impact of COVID in early 2020. Ruth will provide more details on this later on.\nAs we continue to help advertisers manage through uncertainty, I would point out 3 key highlights for YouTube. First, Brandcast joined the upfronts in New York in May for the first time ever, a reflection of how digital and linear TV worlds are converging for both viewers and advertisers. As the #1 streaming video platform to reach viewers across all devices with billions of hours of video watched every day, YouTube remains well positioned to deliver the reach, results and relevance that advertisers need.\nIn fact, even in TV's biggest moments, YouTube is still delivering huge incremental reach. According to Comscore, 49.9% of adults that saw a Super Bowl ad on YouTube on the day of the Super Bowl did not see the add-on TV. And as more advertisers tap into connected TV, they're also driving results.\nAccording to Google Commission Nielsen meta-analysis of MMMs that measured YouTube CTV and TV across U.S. consumer packaged goods, on average, YouTube CTV effectiveness was 3.1x greater than TV. Take GSK Consumer Healthcare, now Haleon, who piloted CTV campaigns across its top 10 global markets to drive effectiveness at scale and tap into the shift to streaming. The results, 73% of campaigns drove substantial lift in brand and unbranded searches, and viewers were up to 14x more likely to search for Haleon related terms.\nAdding CTV to its existing plans also led to greater efficiencies and savings. Haleon has since opted its 2022-2023 investment and is now expanding CTV across LATAM and EMEA markets.\nSecond, as Sundar said, our momentum in Shorts continues. Last quarter, we shared that we're in the early stages of testing monetization with ads, and we continue to be encouraged by the results so far. Third, there's full funnel, which we've covered before, and more advertisers are embracing.\nOn average, YouTube advertisers using a full funnel strategy experienced 80% unique reach across brand and action campaigns. With this incremental reach across upper and lower funnel formats, advertisers meet different audiences based on where they are in the purchase journey.\nEstee Lauder Taiwan's recent campaign for its advanced night repair serum is a great example. Branded content collaboration with top creators raised awareness, while YouTube shopping shelf feature boosted consideration and to generate new leads and sales, a series of well-orchestrated action formats did the trick.\nThis full funnel strategy drove 29% more unique visits to its website and a 95% increase in sales. With our performance products, advertisers can confront demand. With our massive reach products, they create net new demand at scale. Lastly, an update on how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners and key ecosystems.\nFirst, in gaming to help Bandai Namco entertainment drive immersive gaming experiences and build a more robust IP strategy. We're partnering across Cloud, Geo, Ads, YouTube and more. And then there's news. Google News Showcase now has 1,500-plus partnerships with publications across 17 countries, including recent agreements with publications in the U.K., Romania and Slovakia.\nI'll close, as I always do with gratitude for customers and partners and for Googlers across sales, partnerships, product engineering and our many, many support teams. Thank you for your tireless commitment to making a positive impact around the world. Ruth, over to you.\n\nRuth M. Porat\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Alphabet Inc.\n\nThank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the second quarter reflect strength in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise.\nI will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.7 billion, up 13% or up 16% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, up 15% primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.9 billion, up 17%.\nThe biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting the following: first, the increase in R&D expenses, which was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo followed by headcount growth.\nAnd finally, the growth in G&A, which reflects increases in both professional service fees and in head count, partially offset by a decline in charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $19.5 billion, flat versus last year, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $439 million. Net income was $16 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $12.6 billion in the quarter and $65 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $125 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $62.8 billion, up 10%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.7 billion in the quarter, were up 14%, driven by both travel and retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.3 billion, were up 5%.\nThe modest year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping the uniquely strong performance in the second quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion, were up 9%, driven by AdSense. The quarter-on-quarter deceleration in both YouTube and network advertising revenues primarily reflects pullbacks in spend by some advertisers.\nOther revenues were $6.6 billion, down 1%, reflecting a year-on-year decline in Play, primarily driven by the fee changes we have discussed previously. We also saw a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels compared with earlier stages of the pandemic.\nIn terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12.2 billion, up 12%. Google Services operating income was $22.8 billion, up 2%, and the operating margin was 36%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.3 billion for the second quarter, up 36%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud had an operating loss of $858 million. As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $193 million and the operating loss was $1.7 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In terms of the Google Services segment. We are pleased with our performance in Search in the second quarter, which continued to deliver strong results.\nAs a reminder, the 2022 revenue growth rates are presented against particularly tough comps as we lapped the recovery in the second quarter of 2021 from the impact of the pandemic in early 2020. Going forward, the very strong revenue performance last year continues to create tough comps that will weigh on year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues for the remainder of the year.\nIn YouTube and Network, the pullbacks in spend by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors that are challenging to disaggregate. Within other revenues in the third quarter, we expect an ongoing headwind from the fee changes and the slowdown in buyer spend that impacted results in the second quarter.\nTurning to Google Cloud. Customers are transforming their businesses, utilizing GCP's secure infrastructure with data, analytics and AI capabilities, uncovering real-time insights and leveraging the collaborative tools of Workspace. They are in the early days of this transformation, and we continue to invest in our products, go-to-market capabilities and cloud regions.\nIn terms of foreign exchange, our second quarter results reflect the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year from a significant tailwind last year to a 3.7 percentage point headwind in 2Q. Looking to the third quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. As a reminder, all segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. We provide fixed FX revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region.\nIn addition, as we've said previously, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. With respect to Alphabet head count, we added 10,108 people in the second quarter with the majority of hires for technical roles.\nGiven the uncertain global economic outlook and the hiring progress achieved to date, as Sundar previously announced, we intend to slow the pace of hiring. We expect our actions on hiring to become more apparent in 2023. Our headcount additions in the third quarter will reflect we already have a strong number of commitments, including new graduate hires.\nAs a reminder, we also expect the acquisition of Mandiant to close by the end of the year, which will further increase head count on top of hiring. Although we expect the pace of headcount growth to moderate next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent.\nTurning to CapEx. The largest investments in the second quarter were in servers followed by data centers and office facilities. After several large transactions closed in the first quarter, investment in office facilities was once again focused on fit-outs and ground-up construction on existing projects. We continue to expect an increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year.\nFor the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet Inc\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's First Quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. And now, I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet Inc\n\nThank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the last few months, guided by our mission, we continue to develop helpful technologies with a view to its empowering both people and businesses. Even as more people return to in-person activities, we are seeing hybrid approaches to learning and working are here to stay, and our products are helping partners seize these new opportunities. To help support our own flexible work plans, this year we plan to invest approximately $9.5 billion in our U.S. offices and data centers, creating at least 12,000 new Google jobs in the U.S. in places like New York and Atlanta. To enable our long-term growth, we are investing in areas like cloud, AI, YouTube, search, and beyond. In 2020 and 2021 combined, we invested $40 billion in research and development here in the U.S..\nBeyond the U.S., we have announced new office investments in London and Warsaw, and a new product development center in Nairobi. We are excited for the product development they will support. We'll share more about these investments at Google I/O, our annual developer conference on May 11, and I encourage you to tune in. Turning now to product highlights, AI continues to be at the heart of our core search and information products. We launched multi-search in Google Search this quarter. It's a new way people can find what they need using both images and words. For example, you can snap a photo of a shirt pattern and then type the word \"green\" to find a green shirt with that pattern. We also shared new features in search to help people find healthcare providers who take their insurance and book appointments online.\nWith ads automation, search ads powered by AI are helping our customers quickly respond to the market conditions most relevant to their business. Philip will discuss this in more detail. Let's move to YouTube. We continue to support our community of creators, advertisers, and viewers. With over 2 billion monthly signed-in users, we are well-positioned to do this. YouTube, over the past two years, has seen significant growth and has become a central destination for entertainment, learning, and educational content. And even as people have returned to in-person activities, time spent on YouTube has continued to grow. Just as YouTube evolved from desktop to mobile and that created huge opportunities, we are excited about the new opportunities we see now. Short-form video is one. YouTube Shorts is now averaging over 30 billion daily views. That's four times as much as a year ago.\nIn the first quarter, we added new capabilities to video editing, and we are continuing to invest in making Shorts a fantastic experience for creators and viewers alike. As we have always done with products, we focus on building a great user experience first, and we will work to build monetization over time. The living room is another area of opportunity. On average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on televisions every day. And in the year ahead, we will give YouTube's connected TV viewers new smartphone-controlled navigation and interactivity features, allowing people to comment and share content they are watching on television directly from their devices. Turning next to our computing platforms. A few weeks ago, we marked a big milestone, our 100th release of Chrome and Chrome OS.\nOver the years, we have worked with developer and OEM partners to improve speed, simplicity, and security, and move the web forward. It's a great example of what we mean when we say we are building for the long term. And on Android, we'll showcase at I/O the many helpful features and services that Android and its platforms provide. Over the coming years, we will continue to invest in new form factors, seamless multi-device experiences, and raising the bar for user privacy while giving developers the tools they need to succeed on mobile. As you know, we have made changes to our Google Play pricing model to help all developers on our platform succeed. Today, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less.\nWhile this impacted our short-term results, we think it's the right long-term approach to support the ecosystem and to be the most developer-friendly app store and gaming platform available. We are also exploring alternative billing options, and as we do this, we'll continue to uphold high safety standards that protect personal data and sensitive financial information. Earlier today, we launched the Data Safety section in Play, where people can access more information about how apps collect, share, and secure their data. In hardware, Pixel 6 is a huge step forward for the Pixel portfolio, and it's been great to see the response from Pixel users. It's the fastest-selling Pixel ever, and we are building broad consumer awareness of the brand and making good progress. I'm excited about the products we have coming and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O.\nNext, onto Cloud, where Q1 revenue grew 44% year over year with continued strong performance across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We continue to deliver differentiated products across four distinct areas. First, cybersecurity, where we introduced new offerings, including assured workloads to address digital sovereignty in the European Union. Virtual machine threat detection, a first-to-market agentless malware detection capability. An advanced intrusion detection system for network threat detection. Organizations like T-Mobile and DoorDash are protecting their critical systems and data with Google Cloud's trusted cybersecurity products. These include Security Command Center, which helps many companies, including UKG, Ultimate Chronos Group, and Ocado Group, monitor and manage their security posture and risk. Our leading threat detection and response platform, Chronicle, is now paired with Simpli.fi to more quickly automate incident detection and resolution.\nWe also announced our intent to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, to help protect customers from the most advanced threats. Second, we continue to evolve a leading data cloud with Serverless Spark to run batch Spark workloads. BigLake, a new storage engine that unifies data warehouses and lakes, and DataPlex, which provides unified management and governance of data across data warehouses and lakes. Our unified data cloud and AI platform is helping organizations like KeyBank, LG Electronics, and Macy's work intelligently with data across multiple clouds. BigQuery, our leading solution for analytics, is helping customers like Kraft Heinz, Mercado Libre, and Verta help create more personal consumer experiences. BT Group, UPS, and other leading brands continue to tap our deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to power their organizations.\nThis includes our contact center AI platform, which helped the Home Depot improve their call containment by 185%, creating a more positive customer support experience. We are proud to share that more than 700 technology partners power their applications with our data cloud. Third, our open, secure infrastructure remains a differentiator as it enables customers to run their workloads and apps where they need them. This is winning global brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Boeing, and Kyocera. Our product leadership continued with the release of TAO VMs, which powers price performance that's more than 40% better than any other leading cloud. And Google Distributed Cloud Edge, a new edge solution designed to run telecommunication networks at scale, which is helping Bell Canada evolve its 5G network. And we further expanded our regional footprint globally.\nLeading companies like Mahindra are choosing us for large-scale IT transformations and migrating their data centers to Google Cloud, while Sony's Crunchyroll uses our infrastructure and networking capabilities to power the largest anime streaming service in the world. Our scalability enables NinjaVan, the leading logistics provider in Southeast Asia, to handle more than 10x their normal traffic during peak times. Finally, we continue to advance Google Workspace. To support hybrid work, we recently introduced new collaboration features, including bringing Google Meet directly into Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. You can now see and hear your team as you collaborate in real time without the need to schedule meetings. Google Meet can now livestream to up to 100,000 people who can also participate in Q&A and polls.\nWe also launched the next wave of innovation in Google Docs with Smart Canvas, including auto-generated summaries in pageless format in Docs, Smart Chips, and automating workflow using Gmail. Smart Canvas has seen very rapid uptake, with more than 6 million checklists and 6 million Smart Chips being added to documents each week. These innovations are helping employees adapt to hybrid work at large enterprises like Equifax and Ocean Network Express, digital natives including Flipkart, and organizations like the University of Alberta. Finally, our other bets. This month, Waymo became the first company to run fully autonomous ride-hailing operations in multiple locations simultaneously. Today, employees can take rider-only trips in San Francisco, joining the growing number of public Waymo One riders in Phoenix. Wing launched its on-demand drone deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In the first quarter of 2022, Wing completed over 50,000 commercial deliveries.\nThat's up more than 3x year over year. As you know, sustainability continues to be a big focus for us. In addition to our own ambitious goals to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we recently joined Frontier, a new coalition with Stripe and many others, jointly committing more than $900 million to accelerate carbon removal solutions. Before I close, we remain deeply concerned about the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. While I was in Warsaw, Poland, last month, I met with many leaders across Central and Eastern Europe to reaffirm our commitment to the region. We are finding ways for our products and platforms to be helpful, including enhanced features on search to help refugees find resources. Across all these efforts, I feel inspired by the ways that our teams at Google work to help people in moments big and small.\nWith that, let me thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions this quarter. Over to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. As always, it's great to be with you all. I want to start by echoing Sundar. The war in Ukraine and the deepening humanitarian crisis across the region is heartbreaking. As with our response during the global pandemic, we remain focused on how we can help. Whether it's air raid alerts on Android phones to help Ukrainians get to safety, refugee centers live on Maps, or new attributes that let hotels share if they're offering free or significantly discounted accommodations for those in need. Or whether it's helping via Insights, which enabled Ukraine's largest person-to-person marketplace, OLX Ukraine, to pivot its product strategy nearly overnight to help people find essential products and services.\nLet's take a quick look at our performance this quarter before we dive into the trends that drove it. In Google Services revenues, we were pleased with the growth in the first quarter, up 20% year over year. Retail was, again, the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business in Q1, followed by travel. Speaking of travel, people are seemingly back on the move, whether they are searching for planes, passports, or their next vacation destination. Q1 travel searches were above Q1 '19 pre-pandemic levels. Query growth in categories like beaches and islands were up 27% versus 2019, while vacation rentals rose 37%. Compared to last year, global searches for passport online jumped 80%, while searches for travel insurance surged 2x.\nWe continue to launch new tools to help travel partners reconnect with customers and to help users find the trusted info they need to plan their next trip. In March, free hotel booking links expanded to Search and Maps. Travel partners can extend their reach; users get a more comprehensive set of options. And earlier this month, we made it possible for hoteliers to easily share their rates and availability directly on Google via Business Profile. Let's talk Performance Max, our newest AI-powered campaign that allows businesses to harness the best of automation to drive the most optimal performance across all Google Ads inventory. Since launching globally in November, PMaX has seen strong customer adoption, particularly among smaller businesses.\nPMaX's simplicity shows how we're moving from a model in which businesses needed to understand the complex language of campaigns, keywords, CPC, and so on, to a model where we understand the company's goals and actively help them achieve their business objectives. Take AssistCart, a leading LATAM travel assistance company who first tested PMaX to accelerate its recovery in Argentina. Initial tests to drive sales yielded a 40% lower cost per acquisition and a 15x higher conversion rate versus other campaigns with the same goals. Early success led AssistCart to rapidly expand PMaX to nine other countries, including Brazil, Spain, and the U.S., and significantly increased spend on the new format in 2022. Moving on to retail, where we had another strong quarter. Consumers are finding a new balance between online and in-person. Google Maps searches for \"Shopping Near Me\" were up 100% globally year over year.\nPeople want to buy from brands that provide a seamless experience wherever and whenever they prefer to shop. For local businesses and big-box retailers alike, this remains a big opportunity. Omnichannel is still a winning strategy. We're also continuing our investments to make shopping on Google as effortless, delightful, and as engaging as possible. With rich, more immersive content, including more visual and browsable results for apparel and fashion searches, and new advancements like multi-search and Google Search, which launched in beta for shopping queries earlier this month, we're helping people go beyond the search box to search anywhere and anyway. Take AR Beauty, which is still in its early days but a great example of the innovative and cool experiences we're building to benefit both users and brands.\nShoppers can now virtually discover and try on thousands of products from 90-plus brands, including Maybelline New York, MAC, and Charlotte Tilbury, as well as from retailers like Ulta Beauty right in Google Search. Let's move on to YouTube. Our brand business had a strong quarter. However, we did see more modest growth in direct response. For brand, we're enthusiastic about what's ahead for connected TV. Brands are turning to us to tap into the shift to streaming and reach new audiences in smarter and more efficient ways. Over 135 million people in the U.S. were reached via YouTube on connected TVs in December. We've recently rolled out new tools to help advertisers consistently plan and measure their CTV spend across platforms. And later this year, in partnership with Nielsen, we'll help brands directly compare their YouTube reach to linear TV, including the ability to measure co-viewing.\nThis apples-to-apples comparison will be a game changer in helping advertisers make smarter investment decisions. According to Nielsen, in the U.S., YouTube accounts for over 50% of ad-supported streaming watch time on connected TVs among people ages 18 and up. And over 35% of viewers in this group can't be reached by any other ad-supported streaming service. In other words, we're seeing that when users choose to watch ad-supported CTV, they choose to watch YouTube, and YouTube delivers CTV audiences that advertisers can't reach anywhere else. Brands are taking notice, like Warner Brothers, who leaned into YouTube to help drive awareness among key audiences for The Batman. By using a combination of best-performing video creative, connected TV media, and video ad sequencing, Warner Brothers expanded its target audience in the two weeks leading up to its release, helping contribute to its successful 134 million opening weekend.\nFor direct response, we continue to believe there's great opportunity to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns, app campaigns, product feeds, and new live commerce features. As Sundar mentioned, Shorts is another area we're really excited about. Engagement is strong, and we're focused on delivering great experiences for users, creators, and advertisers. In fact, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like App Install and video action campaigns. And while it's still early days, we're encouraged by initial advertiser feedback and results, which brings me to our partners and how we're closely collaborating with them to grow and evolve healthier, sustainable ecosystems and bring them the best of Google. We continue to focus on accelerating growth in India's digital ecosystem and are excited about our expanding partnerships with a number of partners in the region. Then Sundar mentioned Sony's Crunchyroll.\nBeyond cloud, we're working across Android, Google Play, Google TV, and more to help Sony and Crunchyroll acquire and retain more users and fans and strengthen its leadership in the direct-to-consumer anime streaming market. As always, I want to extend deep appreciation to our customers and partners for their collaboration and trust, and to our product, engineering, partnership sales, and many support teams. Thank you. Your relentless focus on helping our users, customers, and partners makes our success possible. Now over to Ruth.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nThank you, Philip. We had a strong first quarter with revenue growth led again by search and cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.\nFor the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were 68 billion, up 23%, or up 26% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was 29.6 billion, up 23%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was 17.6 billion, up 22%. The biggest factors here were costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for subscription content and then costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content. Operating expenses were 18.3 billion, up 24%. Headcount growth was the primary driver of expense across all three categories: research and development, sales and marketing, and G&A. Growth in sales and marketing also reflects an increase in advertising and promo expense as we ramped back from the lower levels of spend last year. Operating income was 20.1 billion, up 22%, and our operating margin was 30%.\nOther income and expense was a loss of 1.2 billion, which was driven by unrealized losses in the value of investments in equity securities given market volatility. Net income was 16.4 billion. We again delivered substantial free cash flow with 15.3 billion in the quarter and 69 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with 134 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased a total of 52 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in the last 12 months. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were 61.5 billion, up 20%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of 39.6 billion in the quarter were up 24%, led again by retail, followed by continued recovery in travel.\nYouTube advertising revenues of 6.9 billion were up 14%, reflecting ongoing strong growth in brand and more modest growth in direct response. The deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping of the exceptional performance of direct response that we called out in the first quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of 8.2 billion were up 20%, driven by AdSense and AdMob. Other revenues were 6.8 billion, up 5%. The growth rate reflects substantial growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, driven by subscriber growth in YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV, which were largely offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, primarily as a result of the pricing changes that we've discussed with you previously. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was 12 billion, up 23%. Google Services operating income was 22.9 billion, up 17%, and the operating margin was 37%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were 5.8 billion for the first quarter, up 44%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of 931 million. As to our other bets for the first quarter, revenues were 440 million, and the operating loss was 1.2 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter, which reflect the benefit of investments we've made over many years. We remain committed to investing to continue to build helpful technologies in support of long-term growth, notwithstanding the uncertainty in the global outlook.\nThe most visible reflection of our focus on long-term performance is our continued investment in talent and compute capacity across the company. In terms of outlook by segment for Google Services, the revenue growth rates we delivered in 2021 in our advertising businesses benefited from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. Obviously, we will not have that tailwind for the rest of this year. As discussed in prior calls, the largest impact from COVID on our results was in the second quarter of 2020, which means that in the second quarter of 2022, we will face a particularly tough comp as we lap the recovery we had in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, the second quarter results will continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia.\nWithin other revenues, in the first quarter, the substantial growth in YouTube subscription revenues was offset by a decline in Play revenues versus the first quarter last year due to the fee changes we previously announced. These fee changes will continue to affect our results throughout 2022 until we lap the introduction of the changes. Turning to Google Cloud, Cloud's performance in the first quarter reflects growing deal volume and strength across multiple industries and regions. Customers are increasingly choosing Google Cloud to help them digitally transform their businesses using our global infrastructure offerings, our data analytics and AI capabilities, and the collaboration benefits of Workspace. We continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see.\nAt the alphabet level, reported revenues in the first quarter reflect that the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year, with a three-point headwind in Q1 compared with a two-point tailwind in the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, the impact from foreign exchange rates will have an even greater impact on year-over-year comparisons given both the larger tailwind last year and the increase we expect in the headwind in Q2 versus Q1 based on current spot rates. With respect to alphabet headcount, we added 7,400 people in the first quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. The biggest increases in headcount this quarter across product areas were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Turning to CapEx, the investment in the first quarter reflects the timing of closing for several large acquisitions of office facilities, which converged in the first quarter.\nMore specifically, of the total, nearly 4 billion covers the purchases in New York, London, and Poland that we had mentioned previously. We continue to expect a meaningful increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally, with servers as the largest component. As stated in our press release today, our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $70 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Thank you. And now, Sundar, Philip, and I will take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press stars and one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key.\nTo prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. And our first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one, Ruth, I wondered, could you talk to us at all about sort of the shape of the ad business growth throughout the first quarter, understanding there's some uncertainty around Ukraine, etc.? And then what have you seen sort of quarter to date in the overall search business from a growth perspective? And then the second one for Philip, appreciate all the color on Performance Max. Can you just talk to us a little bit strategically about how long we should think about it takes to drive broader adoption of this type of tools with your sales forces at months, quarters, years?\nWhere are you in SMB adoption, and how long do you think it takes to get broader and meaningful adoption of a product like that? Thanks.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks, Brian. So in terms of the ad business, I would say, as I did in opening comments, we were very pleased with the year-on-year search revenue growth in the first quarter, up 24%. And it really reflected the strength that we've seen in retail, as Philip and I commented on. I would say, as you're asking how are we looking forward, I would say the revenue growth rates that we delivered in 2021 in search and across our advertising businesses more generally, as I said in opening comments, did benefit from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. So I think one key point is that we're not going to have that tailwind for the rest of this year.\nAnd as I noted, one of the key areas to focus is Q2 of 2020. That was where we had the largest impact from COVID. So that means in the second quarter of 2022, we're going to face a tough comp, as I said. I would say, in addition, the second quarter results are going to continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. And then I noted the impact of foreign exchange. So as we're looking at it generally, we'll feel good about what we're doing in the business, a couple of key points that I called out there.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nAnd to your question on Performance Max, which we covered last quarter as well, maybe just a quick recap, it really brings together the best of Google's automation to help advertisers maximize their reach and efficiency across our channels.\nUsing the same input, we can now serve campaigns on multiple inventory formats, expanding an advertiser's reach with the same effort. And by the way, just today, we announced new features for Performance Max, including new customer acquisition goals, new campaign-level insights, more details about the one-click upgrade tool for smart shopping and local campaigns. So we're very, very committed to helping Performance Max deliver for our advertisers and have been very open to advertiser feedback, how we can do this. And specifically on your time axis, I don't think there is a material difference to the time axis that we've looked at in previous rollouts, as always focused on generating the maximum value and performance for our advertising partners.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nPartner and Managing Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much for taking the question.\nMaybe one follow-up to Brian's question. Other industry players have called out pockets of weakness in brand advertising globally in the quarter that you just reported. Did you see any of that from a volatility standpoint, especially around maybe the war in Ukraine for a period of time in March? And then sticking with all the commentary you gave on YouTube, how should we be thinking about the strategic goals of driving longer engagement and user growth and monetization for YouTube against some of the initiatives you called out versus how to think about the performance of the business as we go through '22, short-form video versus long-form video, or maybe mix of direct response versus brand advertising?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks so much. Great. So I'll start on the first question and revenue impact. I think you were asking from the war and anything else that was relevant there.\nI would say the most important, as both Sundar and Philip said, is what a tragic humanitarian crisis this is. And across Google, we're doing a lot to provide support. In terms of revenues, the most direct impact is the fact that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia, as we announced in early March. And to your question about 1% of Google revenues were from Russia in 2021, and that was primarily from advertising. In addition, from the outset of the war, there was a pullback in advertiser spend, particularly on YouTube in Europe. So a couple of impacts from the war. I guess over to Philip with respect to YouTube and trends there.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nSo maybe to dig a little deeper into the part of your questions around Shorts, Shorts went global, rolled out to over 100 countries, and as Sundar mentioned, now has 30 billion daily views, which is four times higher than a year ago. And if we take the creator view, we're taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their short-term videos. The first step, I think, is our 100 million YouTube Shorts fund, which is now unavailable in over 100 countries globally. And over 40% of creators who received payment from the Shorts funds in 2021 weren't in the YouTube Partner Program, just as an interesting number. And then on the advertiser view side, as I mentioned earlier, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like App Install and Video Action campaigns that are encouraged by the early results.\nAnd so all in all, I think we're deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators here on YouTube and are very actively working on what monetization could look like in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions. I have two. First, just on advertising, just thinking about industry conversations, it seems pretty clear that you were able to capture some dollars that shifted to search from social related to Apple's iOS privacy changes. Just curious if that dynamic continued in one queue, and then if you can comment at all just how you think about sustainability of those dollars going forward.\nRuth, in terms of spending and on the margin side, operating margins continue to be strong at 30%, even with the greater headcount of the past couple of quarters. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you mean by considered investments and in what areas are you able to offset and gain more efficiencies in the business? Thanks.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks for the question. With respect to search and ATT, there's really nothing to highlight. We haven't seen a noticeable shift in spend. In terms of overall margins and how we're thinking about investing, what I tried to make clear is we do continue to plan to invest aggressively this year. I made that point in opening comments with respect to both ongoing hiring at a rapid clip as well as ongoing investment in technical infrastructure.\nI would say in terms of margins, we do remain focused on investing for long-term value creation. As we noted last year, in 2021, our margins did benefit from substantial revenue growth while at the same time, expense growth ramped more gradually during the year. In certain respects, as we talked about last year, margins benefited from what I describe as a bit of a timing difference between revenue growth and expense growth. There were two other benefits worth calling out that we talked about last year that affected operating margin. The first was the impact from the change in useful lives that we called out last year, and that benefited the year-on-year growth and expenses last year.\nThe second was the impact of foreign exchange, which was a tailwind last year, but as I noted, has really flipped to a headwind given the strength of the U.S. dollar. As a reminder, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenue, given our expense base is weighted toward the U.S., with most of our R&D efforts located here in the U.S.. The main thing is the key point. We are very focused on long-term value creation, and in our view, given the opportunities we see, there are some key investments that we're continuing to make.\n\nDouglas Anmuth\n\nEquity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nThank you. Very helpful.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nInternet Analyst, Merrill Lynch\n\nGreat. Thank you. A couple of things. First, on YouTube, quite a ramp in Shorts activity.\nHas that been a little bit of a headwind for growth as you've ramped that up? We can try to guess on monetization later. Secondly, when you think about regulation in Europe, there's a lot of headlines about the Digital Markets Act and other things. How do you think about the regulatory environment and the evolution over the next couple of years? Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks for the question. In terms of YouTube, I think there were a couple of questions in your question. In terms of the deceleration in the year-on-year revenue growth rate relative to the first quarter, the largest factor was lapping an exceptionally strong quarter in direct response, as we noted last year. In addition to that direct response lapping, there were a couple of other items worth noting.\nFirst, as I've already mentioned, the war that did have an outsized impact on YouTube ads relative to the rest of Google. That was both from suspending the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia, as well as, as I noted earlier, the related reduction in spend primarily by brand advertisers in Europe. In addition, as we mentioned on the Q3 earnings call, we continue to experience a headwind from ATT, primarily in direct response. The dollar impact from ATT has been consistent since it was implemented in April of last year. Then there's the FX headwind I've already commented on. I would say to the other part of your question, we're experiencing a slight headwind to revenue growth as Shorts viewership grows as a percentage of total YouTube time. We are testing monetization on Shorts, and early advertiser feedback and results are encouraging.\nThe team is focused on closing the gap with traditional YouTube ads over time. So we're excited about the new opportunities with Shorts, but a slight headwind.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet Inc\n\nOn the second part of the question about DMA and regulation, look, we support a number of DMA's goals, including expanded consumer choice, interoperability. Obviously, the implementation details will be important. We are still, it's too early to tell, but we'll be working, as we have done over the past many years, we'll be engaging constructively, including regulatory dialogue to understand and make progress.\n\nJustin Post\n\nInternet Analyst, Merrill Lynch\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. I'll stick, please, with YouTube questions. That kind of brand softness in Western Europe, Ruth, does that look like that has already abated? Does that look like that's continuing?\nIf you step back and just look at overall YouTube usage, and I know you mentioned some numbers in the prepared comments, just given the much broader array now, I think, of content options, including in short-form video and long-form video, are you seeing the overall growth, any impact on the overall growth in YouTube users or in engagement per YouTube user?Thank you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nIn terms of the first question, impact from the war, I think it's too early to comment. Tragically, it is still ongoing, so too early to comment there. Overall, in terms of YouTube and engagement, I noted on both YouTube's advertising business, as well as the subscription businesses, the performance there. I'd say over the past few years, we've seen significant investment in online video. There's been a ton of innovation. We think innovation is positive.\nBroadly, we continue to benefit from the fact that there are 2 billion logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month, and people are creating content on YouTube at a very active rate. We're really pleased with what we see there. And our team does remain focused on innovating and helping creators grow. As Sundar said, Shorts now has 30 billion daily views. That's four times higher than a year ago. And I think that really goes to your question about the level of activity that we're seeing.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Moffett Nathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. I have one on YouTube, of course, and then one for Ruth. On YouTube, I think what we're hearing is that there's an emerging concern that TikTok is a competitor to YouTube's mobile position.\nAnd I know you called out the strength of Shorts, but can you talk big picture? If you're seeing any meaningful shift in consumer demand for the mobile YouTube product and any type of advertising maybe shift on mobile because of TikTok? And then to Ruth, it's an odd quarter because if you look at APAC, the APAC region underperformed EMEA, which had Russia and Ukraine in there. Is there anything you want to call out about Asia Pacific specific this quarter? Why it could have been softer or any other product that may have led to a bit of a slower quarter for APAC? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nLook, maybe I start on the first part of your question. And it's very similar to what Ruth said before. I mean, we've seen significant investment in online video, and there's been a ton of innovation.\nThere are two billion-plus logged-in viewers who visit YouTube every single month. And more people are creating content on YouTube than we've ever seen before. And the team remains very focused in trying to help creators grow, trying to innovate. And just to give you a number, in 2021, the number of YouTube channels that had made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year over year. And we're heavily investing in Shorts and the connected TV and shopping. You heard the stats from Sundar on the 30 billion daily views. So we continue to invest in new monetization options for creators beyond ads are a big part of what we're doing. And as I said before, we're testing ads on Shorts are encouraged by initial results.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nIn terms of geographic color, just to even broaden out your question a bit more and go through the various regions. So in the U.S., we were pleased with the 27% year-on-year growth. And I think nothing to call out there. In Europe, as you noted in your question, the slightly bigger impact from the war in Ukraine than in other regions. And then the sizable delta between fixed and floating really reflects the meaningful strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. I guess to the heart of your question with respect to APAC, the main thing there is to take you back to a year ago. We were lapping a substantial 39% growth rate in constant currency. And so this really reflects lapping that sizable growth relative to more muted ads performance in APAC this Q1. And it really takes you just back to last quarter.\nIn other Americas, it was much more about the FX headwind more than anything else.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nSenior Research Analyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks, Ruth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nSoftware and Internet Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood afternoon. For Sundar, just on Google Cloud, if you could just walk through the next leg of growth, where you're most excited for the rest of 2022. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet Inc\n\nWell, thanks. Look, overall, across the board, I'm excited because you saw in my earlier remarks, there is a lot of product innovation across the key areas, be it data analytics, cybersecurity, our open multicloud, as well as Google Workspace. So when I look at the innovation and the product pipeline and the overall demand we are seeing and how early our journey is, there's definitely a lot to look forward to. Cybersecurity has been a particular focus.\nWe obviously are excited about our acquisition of Mandiant, which I think will help us serve customers deeper as well. But overall, the execution has been great. We are scaling up, particularly in our go-to-market as well. I think that will play out well. Over time, as we focus on converting bookings to consumption as well, I think it'll play out well. Taking a long-run view and methodically scaling up and executing better. So that's what I'm excited about.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nSoftware and Internet Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Jue from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen Jue\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nOkay. Thank you. Sundar, I think your search team recently released a blog post talking about the desire to help your users out with their management of money.\nI think we talked about some of this last time with the rollout of TAS in India and the evolution to Google Pay. But can you talk about your ambitions to add more utility to the service so that it becomes a more, hopefully, indispensable service for your user base, and particularly as you hope that this theoretically becomes your next billion-user product? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks, Stephen. Obviously, we've been focused on making sure payments work well. One way you can step back and think about it is that our payment strategy is very similar to the strategy we have for commerce overall. We want to make all of this work easier, both on the merchant and the financial institution side, and making sure they can connect with customers well. You mentioned the work in India. That was certainly what really got everything started.\nWe are now 150 million people across 40 countries that are using Google Pay. And to your questions about making, first of all, we are making sure it works across the board, works well, easy to use for all the sides. And then over time, we will innovate and build new digital experiences. Simple examples you saw was we rolled out the ability for users to pay for parking on Google Pay with their voice just using Google Assistant. So really building for scale, building for simplicity. And then over time, we will layer on additional helpful features. But we are definitely focused on the first part now, making sure it works well for as many users across the world.\n\nStephen Jue",
    "content2": "Equity Research Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our last question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from BMO. Your line is now open.\n\nDan Salmon\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BMO\n\nGreat. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions.\nFirst, I'd like to ask about Google Analytics, where there's been a transition ongoing for a year or so now to a new version of the product and where you'll begin sunsetting the older version next year. That's always a really important tool for advertisers and publishers to measure the impact of your advertising. So could you tell us a little bit more about those changes, how they may or may not be related to the deprecation of cookies in Chrome and how you plan to ensure its smooth transition? And then second, one last one on YouTube. You mentioned the strong performance and subscriptions, Ruth. Any products that you would highlight that are driving that strength in particular?\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks. So I can take the one on the Google Analytics side. This is something we've been working on for a very long time.\nThere is no specific relation to what you've mentioned. This is one of the normal upgrades to our products that we're doing on a quite regular basis. We're very excited about it. Advertisers are excited about it. Our partners are happy about it. So yeah, this is a nice one. We like it.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet Inc\n\nAnd then in terms of the YouTube subscription businesses, as I said, they continue to deliver substantial revenue growth. And that was driven by subscriber growth for both YouTube TV as well as YouTube Music and Premium. So pleased with what we're seeing there.\n\nDan Salmon\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, BMO\n\nOkay. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet Inc\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our second quarter 2022 call.\nThank you and have a good evening.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet Inc\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."

Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. To ask a question during the session, you will need to press star one on your telephone. If you require any further assistance, please press star zero. I'm now adjourning the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Alphabet's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Ruth Porat. Now, I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations, and financial performance, including the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on those areas, may be considered forward-looking, and such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC, including our upcoming Form 10-K filing for the year ended 31 December 2021. During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our investor relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. I'll turn the call over to Sundar.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Jim. Happy New Year, everyone. The last few months have been challenging for communities everywhere because of Omicron. I'm grateful for the frontline healthcare workers who are helping us through it, and glad to see signs that this wave is receding in many parts of the world. Whether it's helping people find a COVID testing center, learn a new skill, or launch a new business, our mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it's ever been. In 2022, we'll stay focused on evolving our knowledge and information products, including Search, Maps, and YouTube, to be even more helpful.\nInvestments in AI will be key, and will continue to make improvements to conversational interfaces like the Assistant. I'll begin by touching on a few highlights from Q4. Our new AI models are helping to create information experiences that are truly conversational, multimodal, and personal. For example, Multitask Unified Model, or MUM for short, has improved searches for vaccine information. Soon, we'll introduce new ways to search with images and words simultaneously. In October, we introduced a new AI architecture called Pathways. AI models are typically trained to do only one thing. With Pathways, a single model can be trained to do thousands, even millions, of things.\nFrom MUM to Pathways, to BERT, and more, these deep AI investments are helping us lead in search quality. They're also powering innovations beyond search. For example, DeepMind's protein folding system, AlphaFold, was recently recognized by Nature and Science magazine as a defining breakthrough. To illustrate the scale of the team's achievement, it took scientists more than 50 years to figure out the structure of 150,000 proteins. The DeepMind team has now expanded that number to 1 million, and they think they will get to more than 100 million this year. Philipp will talk in great detail about our advertising business, which also benefits from our investments in AI.\nIt's been a very strong quarter for ads. Our teams have helped millions of businesses of all sizes, and launched dozens of important features to help them get the most out of their online marketing spend. These businesses are the backbone of our global economy, and the heart of our community, so helping them thrive is more important than ever. We're also seeing exciting momentum with YouTube. YouTube Shorts continues to drive significant engagement. We just hit 5 trillion all-time views, and have over 15 billion views each day globally. This is helping our creator community reach newer and bigger audiences.\nIn fact, more people are creating content on YouTube than ever before. Last year, the number of YouTube channels that made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year. We are continuing to improve support for artists and creators. More creators than ever are earning money from our non-ads products like Super Chat, and channel memberships. The Shorts Fund is now available in more than 100 countries. Another big area for investment is combining the best of AI software and hardware to deliver helpful experiences across our family of devices. In Q4, we set an all-time quarterly sales record for Pixel.\nThis came in spite of an extremely challenging supply chain environment. The response to Pixel 6 from our customers and carrier partners was incredibly positive. AI is making Pixel even more helpful. As one example, Live Translate detects whether a chat message is in a different language and automatically translates it in up to 48 languages. We are also focused on ensuring devices across the Android and Chrome ecosystems work well together. For example, at CES last month, we announced that we are working with Acer, HP, and Intel to bring great experiences to their devices.\nAlso announced at CES, the new Ripple Open Standard will broaden the capabilities of radar technology, opening the door for new products and services. Another priority is ensuring our products and services are private, secure, and safe. To that end, I'll note our new Privacy Sandbox proposal called Topics API. We think it'll be a big improvement for protecting user privacy while also ensuring businesses are able to thrive online. We'll begin testing this year and look forward to feedback from the industry. Next on to Cloud. It's been a big year, so let me go a bit deeper this quarter.\nIn Q4, Cloud revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $5.5 billion. Alphabet's backlog increased more than 70% to $51 billion, most of which is attributed to Google Cloud. This growth comes from many leading businesses, including Albertsons and LVMH, digital natives including Box and Spotify, and public sector agencies including the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Defense Innovation Unit, and the USDA. Our sales force, which we have more than tripled since 2019, delivered strong results across geographies, products, and industries. We continue to invest.\nFor the full year 2021, compared with the full year 2020, we saw over 80% growth in total deal volume for Google Cloud Platform, and over 65% growth in the number of deals over a billion dollars. Our partner ecosystem is helping accelerate our growth. For the full year 2021, compared with the full year 2020, the number of customers spending more than $1 million through the marketplace increased by 6x. Customer spend through channel partners on GCP more than doubled, and the number of active certifications within our top global systems integrators more than doubled as well.\nOur product leadership continues with more than 2,000 new cloud products and feature releases in the last year. These were in four categories. First, our data cloud and our AI/ML platform is helping organizations like Cartier, Groupe Rocher, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries understand and use their data intelligently across multiple clouds. Our fast, secure data sharing capability helps the National Cancer Institute advance breast cancer research. Our unified data lake and data warehouse, which brings together unstructured and structured data, helps TELUS and Tyson Foods improve their understanding of customers.\nOur AI/ML platform helps CN deliver better customer experiences. Second, our open multi-cloud infrastructure enables customers like BBVA and Wells Fargo to run mission-critical systems on our cloud. We believe new autoscaling in our Kubernetes Engine, which allows customers to run 15,000 node clusters, outscales the competition by up to 10 times. Our Edge Cloud helps us grow in telecommunications, driving partnerships in Q4 with Indosat, Ooredoo, Hutchison, Telenor, and Verizon. They join existing customers and partners, including Ericsson, Reliance Jio, and Nokia.\nThird, our cybersecurity products are helping protect organizations like ANZ Bank, Meditech, and Wayfair as a trusted cloud provider. VirusTotal helps protect organizations from software supply chain vulnerabilities. Chronicle and Security Command Center help organizations detect and protect themselves from cyber threats. Our fraud prevention and identity verification solutions are protecting over 5 million websites.\nFinally, our secure communication and collaboration platform, Google Workspace, is helping public sector organizations like USAID and the US Air Force Research Laboratory, as well as global brands including Colgate and Roche, adopt secure hybrid work. Our new WorkSafer program, launched in Q4, provides the highest security for email, meetings, and documents by bringing together Google Workspace, Titan Security Keys, Zero Trust, and other security advances. Customers come to Google Cloud because of our expertise in bringing enterprises and consumer ecosystems closer together. One example is Shopify.\nFrom Black Friday through Cyber Monday, Shopify reported $6.3 billion in global sales by 47 million customers, all safely transacted on Google Cloud. Importantly, we have made progress operating 24/7 on carbon-free energy and continue to provide customers the cleanest cloud in the industry. On to our other bets. October marked the one-year anniversary of our Waymo One, fully autonomous commercial ride-hailing service in Arizona. In San Francisco, hundreds of riders are using Waymo One as part of our trusted tester program, with many more on the waiting list. Waymo Via continues delivering freight in the southwest US and developing partnerships with key industry players.\nBefore I close, I want to say how proud I am of Google's work to help with economic recovery around the world. Nearly a third of small business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close their business during the pandemic. Digital skills have also been a lifeline to help people find jobs and grow their careers. Since 2014, we have provided digital skills training to over 90 million people around the world.\nIn the months and years ahead, technology will help unleash new opportunities globally, especially as hundreds of millions more people come online in places including Southeast Asia and Africa. With that, let me thank Google as everywhere for their contributions this quarter and throughout 2021. Over to you, Philipp.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Sundar. Hi everyone. It's great to be here today. We're pleased with the growth in Google services revenues in the fourth quarter. Year-on-year performance was driven by broad-based strength in advertiser spend, and strong consumer online activity. In the fourth quarter, retail was again by far the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business. Finance, media and entertainment, and travel were also strong contributors. Before we dive into some of the trends that drove this quarter's performance, let's zoom out for a second.\nQuarter after quarter, for the last 20-some months, we've said that the world is in flux, that the recovery is uneven, that uncertainty is the new normal. Q4 proved no different. What we know for certain, though, is that businesses are the lifeblood of a thriving economy, and our role in helping them remains more important than ever. AI continues to power our ability to help via insights, new tools, and automation. In fact, the same cutting-edge AI that's advancing our understanding of everything from search to protein folding is also driving innovation across our ads products.\nLet's start with automation. It's become a key differentiator for businesses in navigating complexity and efficiently reaching customers wherever they are, in a privacy-first way. Our newest campaign, Performance Max, went global in November and has been quickly embraced by advertisers. It brings the best of Google Ads, AI, and automation together to let brands promote their businesses across all Google services from a single campaign, helping them drive more online sales, leads, and/or foot traffic. It's also an example of how we're radically simplifying our products and making them easier for customers to use.\nFrench children's wear retailer Petit-Bateau tested PMax over a three-week period, return on ad spend jumped 35%, click-through rates increased 40%, and valuable insights were gleaned into what messaging resonated most. We've also evolved our insights tools. Four new features launched in Q4, including Demand Forecast, which uses ML to help businesses predict forward-looking trends and better understand what goods to stock and what services to offer when. Whether it's insights, automation, or new features, our work to help businesses more easily connect with their customers has been nonstop.\nOn top of the 100-plus enhancements made to our ads products every quarter, we've launched 200-plus features and tools since March 2020. A recent example: we made it easier for businesses to claim and verify their business profile on Google Search and Maps, and respond to customer messages directly in Search. In Germany, completed business profiles receive an average of over five times more calls versus those that aren't. For an SMB, that can be really meaningful. Let's transition to retail, where we had a terrific quarter.\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen ongoing shifts in consumer spending patterns. Pre-COVID, each year, we saw increased spikes in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. What's interesting is that in 2020 and again in 2021, we actually saw shoppers start shopping earlier and spending more throughout the quarter. In Q4, we also saw a parallel lead year-over-year retail query growth, with hobbies and leisure a close second. I've said it before, I'll say it again: the future of retail is omnichannel. We continue to invest in new features and next-gen experiences so merchants and shoppers can benefit.\nGlobal searches for gift shops near me jumped 60% year-over-year in October, with searches for gifts near me up 70% in Google Maps. People increasingly want to know what's available nearby before they get to the store. Our new in-stock filter helps with just that. Shoppers can find local stores that carry the products they want right from Search, like a new tennis racket or that last-minute birthday gift. Showing in-store availability helps businesses attract local customers. They've caught on. One in four local offers across shopping and Google.com are taking advantage of our curbside pickup badge. People also want deals. They're looking for value.\nFor shoppers, we made it possible to browse and discover the hottest deals for major moments like Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Search. For merchants, we made it even easier to list promotions via automated imports from third-party integrations like Shopify and WooCommerce. Moving inventory, attracting new customers, and building brand loyalty during the holidays and beyond got a lot easier.\nIn Q4, the number of merchants using promo features jumped 280% year-over-year. Retailers are also turning to us to help them transform and accelerate growth. Take Warby Parker, who drove a 32% year-over-year increase in its Q3 sales by not only opening stores and expanding its contact lens business, but also by tapping into Google across surfaces. Omnichannel bidding, smart shopping campaigns, and an expanded presence in Maps to promote in-store eye exams contributed to Warby's success. It's since launched its first-ever brand awareness campaign on YouTube, which brings me to YouTube, where our commerce opportunity remains really exciting.\nWe're making it easier for viewers to buy what they see and simplify advertisers to drive action with innovative solutions like product feeds, video action campaigns, and emerging formats like live commerce. Backcountry.com generated a 12-to-1 return on ad spend with product feeds in 2021 and plans to double its investment in 2022, while Samsung, Walmart, and Verizon partnered with creators to host shoppable holiday livestream events in the US. As for our brand business, momentum remains strong. We continue to make inroads in unlocking TV brand budgets, and we're still in the early innings of what's possible with connected TV.\nLet's take a minute to double-click into the full funnel trend I talked about last quarter. YouTube's ability to drive both massive reach and action is becoming more clear to more advertisers. In a recent study, DR advertisers who added YouTube branding formats not only drove increased reach, but also averaged 9% more conversions. At the same time, we see more brand advertisers adding action, like Nike Korea, which saw higher conversion rates and drove 50%+ incremental reach by adding video action. Another huge focus for us is continuing to deliver for our partners and key ecosystems, all while delighting users.\nOur expanded partnership with Snap to deliver a first-of-its-kind quick tap-to-Snap feature is a great example. On Pixel 4a with 5G or newer Pixel phones, users can access Snapchat directly from their lock screen, making Pixel the fastest phone to make a snap. Across our Pixel and AR teams, we're working with the NBA to create exciting, immersive experiences for fans using 3D and AR technology. The delighting doesn't stop there.\nWith Adobe, we're collaborating on a multi-year journey to bring Photoshop, Illustrator, and its other flagship products to the web, a testament to the web as a first-class platform for creativity and productivity. As we close out another extraordinary and challenging year, I want to express deep gratitude to our customers and partners for their trust and collaboration. Our success is only possible because of their success. I also want to say a gigantic thank you to our product, engineering, partnership, sales, and many support teams for their outstanding work and unwavering commitment to helping our users, customers, and partners. Ruth, over to you.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nThank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year, which reflected broad-based strength in advertiser spend, strong consumer online activity, as well as substantial ongoing revenue growth from Google Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. We will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results, and conclude with our outlook.\nFor the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $75.3 billion, up 32%, or up 33% in constant currency, rounding out a strong year. Our total cost of revenues was $33 billion, up 26%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.6 billion, up 25%. The biggest factors here were, first, content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content, followed by costs for subscription content. Second, hardware costs. Third, costs associated with data centers and other operations, including depreciation, were offset in part by the impact of the change in useful lives made at the beginning of 2021.\nOperating expenses were $20.5 billion, up 35%. In terms of the three component parts of OpEx, first, the increase in R&D expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promo for the 2021 holiday season, in contrast to the sizable pullback in the fourth quarter of 2020. Finally, the increase in G&A reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters, as well as charitable contributions. Operating income was $21.9 billion, up 40%, and our operating margin was 29%.\nOther income and expense was $2.5 billion, which primarily reflects unrealized gains in the value of investments in equity securities. Net income was $20.6 billion. We continue to generate strong free cash flow, with $18.6 billion in the quarter and $67 billion in 2021. We ended the year with $140 billion in cash and marketable securities. We also repurchased a total of $50 billion of our shares in 2021.\nLet me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google services segment, total Google services revenues were $69.4 billion, up 31%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $43.3 billion in the quarter were up 36%, with broad-based strength across our business, led again by strong growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.6 billion were up 25%, reflecting strength in both direct response and brand advertising. The deceleration in the growth rate versus the third quarter of 2021 was driven primarily by lapping a strong recovery in brand in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nNetwork advertising revenues of $9.3 billion were up 26%, driven by AdMob. Other revenues were $8.2 billion, up 22%, driven primarily by growth in hardware, which benefited from the successful launch of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, as well as the addition of Fitbit revenues, followed by YouTube non-advertising revenues. In terms of Google services cost, tech was $13.4 billion, up 28%. Google services operating income was $26 billion, up 36%, and the operating margin was 37%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $5.5 billion for the fourth quarter, up 45%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, and that reflects significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $890 million.\nAs to our other bets, for the full year 2021, revenues were $753 million. The operating loss was $5.3 billion for the full year 2021 versus an operating loss of $4.5 billion in 2020. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We are nearly two years into a global pandemic that has brought unprecedented change and uncertainty in the macro environment. Throughout these difficult times, Googlers have remained focused on delivering helpful services for users and partners, as well as on driving innovation for long-term growth.\nIn terms of outlook by segment for Google services, we are very pleased with our year-on-year revenue growth in Q4 and for the full year 2021, which continued to be driven by broad-based advertiser strength, and strong consumer online activity. The year-on-year growth rate also reflected a benefit from lapping COVID-related weakness in 2020, which obviously will not be a factor in 2022. Within other revenues, we are pleased with the momentum from Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, reflected in our hardware revenues in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, hardware revenues in 2021 also reflected the acquisition of Fitbit, which we lapped a couple of weeks ago.\nWith respect to Play, the underlying consumer spend and engagement trends remained healthy in the fourth quarter. That being said, in 2022, Google Play's contribution to revenue growth will reflect the fee changes we started to implement in the third quarter of 2021. In terms of investment levels within Google services, we are focused on investing meaningfully in the many opportunities we see for growth. Turning to Google Cloud, 2021 represented another year of substantial growth.\nOur investments in our go-to-market organization, product innovation, and partner ecosystem have been paying off as we help customers with their digital transformation. You can see that Google Cloud revenues increased by 47% for the full year 2021 compared to 2020, with GCP revenues continuing to grow at a faster rate than Cloud overall. While Cloud operating loss and operating margin improved in 2021, we plan to continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see. We do remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability, and, over time, operating loss and operating margin should benefit from increased scale.\nAt the Alphabet level, in the first quarter, based on current spot rates, we expect the foreign exchange impact on reported revenues to be a headwind. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added nearly 6,500 people in the fourth quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. We continue to attract great talent, and expect a strong pace of hiring in 2022 across Alphabet. Turning to CapEx, the results in the fourth quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure, most notably in servers, to support ongoing growth in both Google services and Google Cloud.\nWe also increased the pace of investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction of office facilities. In 2022, we expect a meaningful increase in CapEx. In technical infrastructure, servers will again be the largest driver of spend. With respect to office facilities, after fairly muted CapEx over the past two years, we are re-accelerating investment in fit-outs and ground-up construction. Recently, you have also seen us pursue real estate acquisitions where they make sense.\nFor example, last month, we announced plans to purchase for $1 billion a previously leased headquarters building in London. In the first quarter, we have completed the $2.1 billion purchase of a New York office building that we announced in the third quarter of 2021. Thank you. Now, Sundar, Philipp, and I will take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press the pound key. To prevent any background noise, we ask that you please mute your line once your question has been stated. Our first question comes from the line of Doug Amick from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\n\nDoug Amick\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks for taking the questions, one for Sundar and one for Ruth. Sundar, first, I was just curious to get your view on Web3 and just how you're thinking about Alphabet's approach and where your primary efforts here may lie going forward. Ruth, you mentioned the $6,500 increase in headcount. I think it was the biggest that you've seen in any quarter ever. I know you're catching up on hiring from the last several quarters, but can you just help us understand a little bit more on where these investments are going in tech and how to think about the cost structure in 2022? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks. Look, anytime there is innovation. I find it exciting, and I think it is something we want to support the best we can. The web has always evolved, and it's going to continue to evolve. As Google, we have benefited tremendously from open-source technologies, and we do plan to contribute there. There are several areas of interest. AR is a big one at the computing layer. We've been investing there for a long time and will continue to play a role. It is something both not just at the computing layer, at the services layer, be it Maps, YouTube, Google Meet, et cetera, I think will contribute a lot.\nOn Web3, we are definitely looking at blockchain and such an interesting and powerful technology with broad applications, so much broader, again, than any one application. As a company, we are looking at how we might contribute to the ecosystem and add value. Just one example, our Cloud team is looking at how they can support our customers' needs in building, transacting, storing value, and deploying new products on blockchain-based platforms. We'll definitely be watching the space closely and supporting it where we can. Overall, I think technology will continue to evolve and innovate, and we want to be pro-innovation and approach it that way.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of headcount, we do continue to be a magnet for great talent. The number of applications is up year on year. As I said, as you noted, we added almost 6,500 people in the fourth quarter. We do expect the strong pace to continue. It really goes to comments from Sundar, from Philipp, and from me. We're excited about the opportunities ahead of us. In particular, Google services, Google Cloud, we're adding. We intend to ensure we have the scale that we need to execute well. We're continuing to hire, as I said, the majority were again in technical roles, and really pleased with the opportunities we see ahead.\n\nDoug Amick\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much. Maybe two questions, if I can. First, following up on Doug's question, Susan's been writing a fair bit on YouTube and the way it's exposed to the creator economy and what you're trying to build for the medium to long term. Can you talk about elements of the creator economy and how it sort of fits into your products, both on the advertising side and the commerce side over the medium to long term? Ruth, maybe just one follow-up on the expense side. Was there anything of a one-time nature in Q4?\nJust looking at some of the corporate expense or some of the elements of the core margin, just trying to make sure if there were any one-timers that needed to be called out, because I think you talked about legal and charitable donations as well, just so we could model that right. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nOn YouTube, look, one of the YouTube from day one, it's been very focused on making sure we can support creators well. It's been a big part, and even recently, if I mentioned in my remarks earlier about the growth we are seeing, not just in ads, but beyond ads with Super Chat, channel memberships, and so on. Susan mentioned in her creator letter that while early, they'll be taking a look at NFT and so on, with the view towards making sure the user experience works, but there is value. We are constantly thinking about how we can support and do more for creators. That's going to be an integral part.\nI think all the commerce experiences we are thinking about in YouTube is a whole additional layer of opportunity. Again, it's another area where it all feels very early to me. We are seeing tremendous traction in YouTube across newer areas, be it podcasts, gaming, learning, or sports. Across all these areas, we'll kind of take a vertical-specific look and see how we can support creators better.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of expense, I gave a number of the items. R&D was mostly an increase in headcount. In sales and marketing, I would note that sales and marketing was elevated in the fourth quarter by ads and promo, in part to support the holiday season, and more so than last year. The additional items to note that I called out is in the fourth quarter, we did have a one-time well-being bonus. We also had a year-on-year increase in charitable contributions, including a higher Googler gift match. In fact, I would say that it's more helpful, in particular, on the corporate costs unallocated to think of that line on a trailing 12-month basis, because it can be lumpy to your question.\n\nEric Sheridan\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Maybe the first one for Philipp. You've made so much progress over the last 12 to 24 months about improving the retail and e-commerce search product for advertisers. As you look across the other verticals of search, where are you most excited or see the most opportunity for innovation to really drive more value for advertisers in non-retail verticals as we go into 2022?\nThe second question, either Philipp or Sundar, you both talked about the commerce shopping opportunity on YouTube. Can you just sort of talk to us a little bit about what aspects are already built out versus what areas of innovation or hurdles you still have to clear to really realize that commerce opportunity on YouTube? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nThank you so much for your question. Look, consumers now have a lot of different ways to access information, more than they've ever had before. Search is just one of them. We're constantly trying to innovate and improve the experience for both users and advertisers over the long term. As I've discussed previously, I can share some of the questions we actually ask ourselves to give you a sense of how we think about the opportunity. The first one, obviously, is are we the best place users turn when they need information or want to discover and be inspired? Things like queries and Discover.\nWe're focused on providing better and more comprehensive answers to more types of questions. We need to obviously deliver high-quality, relevant info for all types of queries, including ones where they may be looking for a specific brand or product or just look for an inspiration. How people search is changing, and it needs to become more multimodal, more conversational. What does that mean for ads, for example? Getting user experience right across commercial queries is essential, way beyond, obviously, the area that you mentioned. There is a lot of innovation that goes into this.\nThe second part is really, are we providing the most relevant ads when and where consumers are? We only want to show ads when they're helpful to people. On 80% of the searches, actually, we show no top ads, and most of the ads that you see are on searches with commercial intent. For those with commercial interest, the question is really, how do we provide the best answer in a way that's meaningful to users and where advertisers actually have something relevant to offer? The last, the third point is really the questions around, and this goes again for the vertical you mentioned, but for many, many beyond, are we delivering the most conversions for advertisers at the best ROI?\nThere's a lot of intelligence in our auction to deliver great ROI for advertisers, but there's always more we can do. Are we delivering the most relevant users by leveraging our users' signals? Are we building the best creatives by combining advertisers' assets in ways that make it compelling for a user? Have we predicted the value of the user for that advertiser so we can help appropriately bid for each search with the unique user and query combinations we need? Can we fully measure what users do after they click on ads, from buying something to making phone calls, to downloading apps, and all across devices? Those are a lot of different things, how we think about the runway ahead.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nMaybe quickly on YouTube and commerce. Look, one thing I would say is across both Search, YouTube, and other areas, there's a lot of common infrastructure that's getting done, right? This is focused on merchants, onboarding merchants, and all the backends so that we can have the broadest, and the most comprehensive, inventory available. There are partnerships with other e-commerce platforms as a basic foundational layer we are putting in. Specifically on YouTube, while pretty early, there's a lot of pilots underway.\nWe have introduced a creator tagging pilot program so that viewers get a choice to browse, learn, and shop products featured in the favorite videos, piloted shopping live streams with brands like Walmart and Target, and more broadly, including product feeds more globally in Video Action campaigns. There's a lot more to do. Super early also on testing how shopping can be integrated with Shorts. Again, early, but I find the opportunity space here pretty broad, and it's exciting.\n\nBrian Nowak\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe one for Sundar and one for Ruth. First, on search, very strong growth. Maybe you could help us understand where you are in kind of the AI cycle of improvements there. There's still a lot of room to go there. You have highlighted in several earnings reports. Is there any fundamental reason why search could be higher growth today than it was pre-pandemic? Over to Ruth, Cloud had impressive growth. I'm assuming the infrastructure layer is highest in the sector, and it grew $500 million plus quarter over quarter, but margins did come down. Just kind of understanding what drove that and what it's going to take to really show good leverage there. Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nIn the first part, we obviously are investing deeply in AI R&D across both Google AI and DeepMind. We take that and apply it across the company, particularly in the context of search. That's what underlies BERT, MUM, Pathways, and LaMDA to power conversational experiences. When I look at the tip of the tree as to where the research on the AI side is progressing, it's progressing at an incredibly rapid pace. We are committed to leading there. We have real good interfaces between the AI teams and our core product area teams, including search, to kind of productize this. Primarily, I think you're going to continue to see us lead in search quality.\nI just find the world of information is only continuing to grow, and it's getting increasingly multimodal in nature, just like we took the leap from text to images, thinking through video, audio, incorporating it, and then providing it back to users regardless of whether they are typing, speaking, or looking at something, wanting an answer. That's the journey between AI and search, and we'll continue doing that.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of Cloud, if we step back, the comments that both Sundar and I made, overall, we're very pleased with the ongoing progress in the business, and that's reflected in the revenue growth, as you noted, our backlog, the breadth of customer wins, the industry verticals. Our view is that we're in an extraordinary time to help customers digitally transform their businesses. The key thing is we believe it remains very early innings. As a result, our focus remains on revenue growth and investing as needed as we're looking over the long term. We're continuing to invest aggressively, and it's in our go-to-market capabilities, our products, and our infrastructure.\nWe do remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability, but we are continuing to invest here as we're seeing early innings and pleased with the ongoing progress.\n\nJustin Post\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. I'll try two questions. I just want to follow up on Justin's question about search growing faster than pre-pandemic. I think, Philipp, you talked about a couple of areas within search, and retail was at the front of the list. I think you mentioned a few other categories. Travel was always a big category. Do you feel like travel has come back full, or is travel still sort of underperforming for macro reasons versus where it was pre-COVID?\nRuth, just on the share repurchases, I think that was a record level in the quarter. How should we think about these share repurchases going forward? To what extent is it opportunistic versus, I don't know, systematic or systemic way you think about returning cash to shareholders as every year your free cash flow rises? Thank you.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nYeah, thank you. I said earlier that travel was a contributor to our year-on-year ads growth in Q4. We were encouraged by the performance we saw throughout much of the quarter, but we found that user behavior tends to reflect what's going on in the world. Demand really continues to vary based on location and type of activity. This has been more pronounced in light of Omicron. We've seen changes in traveler search behavior as preferences have evolved. Searches for outdoor destinations like beaches, parks, and camping have increased, while searches for museums, for example, have declined.\nOverall, I think it's fair to say that travel has generally been sensitive to outbreaks, and that there's still unevenness that makes it too soon to say what trends are here to stay and which pre-pandemic habits are coming back. That said, as people think about where they want to go next, they're coming to us to help them navigate a patchwork of information. In fact, from the end of August to the end of October, searches for travel rules were up over six times globally year-over-year. We've launched a ton of new features to make it easier for people to understand changing travel restrictions and requirements.\nSimilarly, for travel partners, we've pivoted our product strategy in big ways to help, whether it's with Flight Demand Explorer and Travel Insights to help partners predict demand, or making it free for hotel and travel companies, and now tour and activity operators, to list their booking links. I'm sure you also saw our big sustainability news in October: new info on CO2 in Google Flights, eco-friendly hotels, and new eco-friendly routes in Maps. Lots of important work is being done here, actually, to help our users and businesses drive more sustainable choices and just overall help our travel partners and the industry at large.\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nIn terms of the share repurchase, as we've talked about on prior calls, we do view the share repurchase program as valuable and are pleased that we were able to increase the authorization to $50 billion last year. You've seen that we've increased the pace quite a bit over the last several years, from $18 billion back in 2019 to $50 billion, as I said, for the full year 2021. We are just continuing to execute against it. We do have additional capacity under the existing authorization and just are continuing to execute against it, do view it as incrementally valuable.\n\nMark Mahaney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThanks. I have a couple, Sundar and Philipp. Sundar, I'm just interested in the decision you announced last week to move away from federated learning and go to topics. Could you talk a bit about the reason and the rationale why you're making that change? When FLOC was first announced, it was patterned to be very effective relative to cookies as a signal for advertisers. Where do you think it's going to be impacted as you go away from cookies to topics on ROAS and budgets? Philipp, I think during the pandemic, one of the big growth spurts has definitely been connected TV.\nCan you talk a bit about what YouTube has seen with connected TV, and how important of a driver is that? As hopefully we get back to normal, what are you doing on the product side to make YouTube on CTV even more engaging as time goes on? Thanks.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nI can take the one for Sundar. The Chrome team has been really focused and working independently on Privacy Sandbox, which you all know is our initiative to build privacy-preserving on-device technologies that will power the future of digital advertising and, obviously, as a result, the free and open web. Just last week, we announced our newest Privacy Sandbox proposal called Topics. Topics was informed by our own learnings, plus widespread, let me call it, community feedback from our earlier FLOC trials, and will now actually replace our FLOC proposal.\nI urge you all to read last week's blog for the details, but basically, the Topics API will allow advertisers to show relevant ads to people based on their interests, inferred from the websites they visit, all in a more private way for users. From an advertiser's perspective, which is a big part of your question, it's obviously way too early to share more because we're just opening this up to the world. We expect to make it available for testing by the end of Q1, but we're really focused on designing for both parties, from an advertiser and a privacy point of view, and are committed to making sure goals are met on both sides.\nOn the second one, the connected TV opportunity, streaming in the living room has exploded. We've seen it firsthand. Connected TV is our fastest-growing screen, and we think there's a ton of runway ahead. Brands are getting the best of all worlds, the precision of digital with the scale of linear, and a lot more relevance. They can personalize ads at scale and use video ad sequencing to tell powerful stories. We've recently added action to the mix. Video action campaigns were upgraded in October to automatically include CTV inventory, which means users get a more helpful viewing experience, and brands get to drive more online sales and/or leads.\nJust think about it like the traditional TV screen, the \"dead screen\" that viewers have essentially stared at for decades is now starting to come alive with the ability to drive conversions, and it's pretty cool. Measurement is also obviously a key component to success here, and we want to make sure that advertisers can fully measure their YouTube CTV video investments across YouTube and YouTube TV for an accurate view of true incremental reach, frequency, and so on. US advertisers actually can do this now via Comscore and Nielsen. All in all, we're excited by the opportunities ahead with connected TV. I think we're just getting started.\n\nMichael Nathanson\n\nAnalyst, MoffettNathanson\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader in Software and Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nRuth, it sounds like there was a good Q4 ad flush, the concept of spend it if you got it. I'm just curious about seasonality this year, and if you expect the year to be more back-end loaded, or do you feel like it's a little more balanced as we go through this year?\n\nRuth Porat\n\nPresident and Chief Investment Officer, Alphabet\n\nOverall, we did see strength as we're going through the year. As I indicated, there was broad-based advertiser strength, strong consumer online activity, and those were really the primary drivers. I think the one place that comment might be more relevant is really in understanding the year-on-year within YouTube relative to last year, where there was strength this year relative to there was real strength this year, but what we saw last year was more in line with, I think, your question, which was after a weak beginning of the year, a very strong fourth quarter.\nLast year, we were lapping that very strong quarter last year, and that explains some of the year-on-year growth comparisons. Overall, the key driver was the backdrop of broad-based advertiser support and spending.\n\nBrent Thill\n\nTech Sector Leader in Software and Internet Research, Jefferies\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\n\nDan Salmon\n\nManaging Director of US Internet and Media Equity Research, BMO Capital Markets",
    "content2": "Great. Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions for Sundar. First, Sundar, you mentioned that investment in artificial intelligence has helped the ads business significantly. What are the two to three ways that you think AI has helped your advertisers, and thus your ad revenue growth, the most? Second, we've seen a variety of new bills introduced in the US Congress recently that seem to take aim squarely at large technology companies like Alphabet. What do you think that these bills have right, and what do you think that they have wrong? Thank you.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nTwo things. On AI and advertising, after I answer the second part, I'll pass it to Philipp to give more details. Definitely, again, the overarching thing is the same AI advancements. We want to make it simpler for advertisers to run campaigns, and there's a lot that goes behind it to drive that simplicity. Philipp can give a bit more details there. On your question about congressional antitrust bills, as a company, we have always been constructive in how we have approached, and we are open to sensible, updated regulations. It's important that technology is beneficial to society. For example, there are many areas where there is widespread agreement.\nWe have called for privacy regulations, particularly at the federal level, updating protections for children, and so on. On some of the current proposals, they quite don't address those issues. There are areas where we are genuinely concerned that they could break a wide range of popular services we offer to our users, all the work we do to make our product safe, private, secure, etc., and in some cases can hurt American competitiveness by disadvantaging solely US companies. Broadly, when we think about building many features, do we have to think on each feature? We ship 3,000 features in search alone every year. How do we make sure that complies with all the regulation?\nWhere do we proactively need approvals, and so on? Those all can have unintended consequences. We are very worried about the impact on small business and local retailers, as well as their customers as well. Having said that, we are committed to approaching it constructively. We always want to engage and do things in a way that's beneficial for society. We urge Congress to take time to consider the unintended consequences. I think we'll remain focused on building great products for our users.\n\nPhilipp Schindler\n\nSVP and Chief Business Officer, Alphabet\n\nBack to the first question you asked on AI and the impact on our ads products. We covered Performance Max. We talked about it. We talked about Insights Page. In search, I would say we see an emergence of a real, let's call it a better-together story fueled by machine learning and automation. Advertisers are leaning more into automation, using responsive search ads to create and select the best-performing creatives, matching with more relevant search queries using broad-match keywords, setting optimized bids with auction-time signals via smart bidding. Those are a few examples.\nWe're using more AI to help advertisers measure their results and bid intelligently with data-driven attribution, for example, which uses very advanced ML to more accurately understand how each marketing touchpoint actually contributed to a conversion, all obviously while respecting user privacy. Broad-match keywords are a big part of this. We have responsive ads on display and discovery. They use text, image, and video assets from advertisers, and predict the best combination of assets to show in any size or format on Google properties or the display network.\nYeah, I think AI and ML will only get better, and so will our tools. We're helping advertisers lean into automation and identify new opportunities as a central part, really, of their recovery and growth strategies.\n\nDan Salmon\n\nManaging Director of US Internet and Media Equity Research, BMO Capital Markets\n\nThat is more than two to three. Thank you, Philipp, for that, and thank you, Sundar, for your comments as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\n\nStephen?Ju\n\nEquity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you so much. I'll stick to one. Zooming out a little bit on the big picture, Sundar, I think it was almost four years ago when Google released a blog post about the next billion users and how developing products for India and other emerging markets will hopefully inform what you should be doing everywhere else. I think you have previously talked about TES being a pretty notable example there. Can you talk about whether we should continue to be looking overseas to think about what direction you might take across your various products and services? Thanks.\n\nSundar Pichai\n\nCEO, Alphabet\n\nThanks, Stephen. Great question. I think that trend is going to continue. You mentioned, obviously, payments, and definitely it's informed our payment strategy globally. In general, we are trying to think deeper about these newer markets, both because it really lines up with our mission of building a more equitable internet for everyone. A couple of the things we have done recently, a year ago, we announced a $10 billion Google for India Digitization Fund. It is a reflection of our confidence in the future of India, its digital economy, and our desire to build products there, which we think will help us globally. Last year, in October 2021, we announced a plan to invest $1 billion in Africa.\nAgain, with the goal of supporting entrepreneurs, helping businesses with their digital transformation, and beginning to build products in Africa for African users, which I think will help us take learnings outside. I already see it. When I look at YouTube in India, some of the commerce ideas we talked about earlier, you may see us first try it in India first because we can get quicker feedback, very dynamic, youthful population. We will do it there and then roll it out globally. We are constantly looking for opportunities like that.\n\nStephen?Ju\n\nEquity Analyst, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That concludes our question and answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.\n\nJim Friedland\n\nDirector of Investor Relations, Alphabet\n\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our first quarter 2022 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now."

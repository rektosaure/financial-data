Good morning and welcome to the Campbell's Company Q1 Fiscal 2026 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the call over to Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell's. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nChief Investor Relations Officer, Campbell's Company\n\nGood morning and welcome to the Campbell's Company Q1 Fiscal 2026 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Campbell's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Joining me today are Mick Beekhuizen, Chief Executive Officer, and our new Chief Financial Officer, Todd Cunfer. Today's remarks have been pre-recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A.\nThe presentation, a transcript of management's prepared remarks, and today's earnings press release are available on our website at thecampbellscompany.com in the Investor section. A replay of the webcast will be posted at the same location following the Q&A, with a full call transcript, including the Q&A session, available within 24 hours. Slide two outlines today's agenda. Mick will provide insights into our Q1 performance as well as our in-market performance by division. Todd will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the full fiscal year 2026. Please note that all references to the Q1 in-market performance refer to the 13-week period ending 2 November 2025, compared to the 13-week period ending 3 November 2024.\nIn addition, beginning in fiscal 2026, we are reporting share of our Cape Cod and Kettle Brand chips against the total potato chip category, replacing the prior comparison to the Kettle-cooked potato chip category. Late July will be compared against the total tortilla chip category rather than the natural and organic tortilla chip segment. We believe these updates more accurately reflect our brand's in-market performance and underscore their strong positioning within the broader chips category. Finally, beginning in fiscal 2026, the snacking and meals and beverages retail business in Latin America is managed under our meals and beverages segment. Through the Q4 of fiscal 2025, the company's Latin America retail business was managed under the snack segment. Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect this change. On our call today, we will make forward-looking statements which reflect our current expectations.\nThese statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide three of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation. And now it is my pleasure to turn it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Mick Beekhuizen. Mick.\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Q1 fiscal 2026 earnings call. Before we review our results, I want to take a moment to welcome Todd Cunfer, our new CFO. With more than two decades of food industry experience, Todd brings the expertise and perspective we need.\nThroughout his career, he has demonstrated a proven ability to drive change and deliver superior financial results. I'm confident he'll be a strong business partner and a tremendous asset to our company. Welcome, Todd. Now, let's review our Q1 results, which were in line with our expectations as we continued to navigate a dynamic operating environment. Organic net sales were down 1%, driven by a 2% decline in consumption, with the difference mainly due to retailers building inventory in snacks ahead of upcoming promotional activities. We have an attractive brand portfolio that meets the key attributes consumers are seeking, whether supporting at-home cooking, providing flavor-forward options, premium experiences, or health and wellness benefits. While our total in-market consumption was down 2%, our 16 leadership brands' consumption was down 1%, and collectively, they held share for the eighth consecutive quarter.\nWithin meals and beverages, our leadership brands benefited from consumers' ongoing cooking-at-home behaviors and the growing demand for elevated meal experiences. However, our snacks business remained under pressure as consumers continued to be increasingly intentional with their purchases. Since the start of the fiscal year, we have made significant progress on our cost-savings initiatives, improved overall productivity, and implemented selective in-market pricing increases. However, these actions were not sufficient to offset cost increases and top-line headwinds, resulting in a decrease in our adjusted EBIT margin and an 11% year-over-year adjusted EBIT decline. We continue to be laser-focused on mitigating cost pressures while maintaining marketing support for our brands. Finally, as outlined in our press release, we reiterated fiscal 2026 guidance, which continues to include the expected tariff impact and the related mitigating actions. Todd will provide more details on our guidance in a moment.\nAs highlighted last quarter, we're strengthening our focus on consumers and their evolving needs. I want to remind you of the framework we shared last quarter and underscore the strategic lens we apply when shaping how our brands show up. Our brands are uniquely positioned to compete and excel in these growth areas. While we use this framework to guide consumer-led innovation, it also guides our brand activations. A great example is our Rao's sauces campaign, which focuses on the elevated Rao's experience, highlighting the origin of its high-quality ingredients supporting the unique nature of the food we make. Additionally, we recognize that continued focus on providing an attractive value proposition is critical to be successful.\nAn example of this during the past quarter is our multi-pack Goldfish focus during the back-to-school period, where we've seen double-digit increases in consumption for its prior year through strong retail execution and promotional support during an important consumer occasion, meeting the need for a wholesome, convenient snack at the right value. By concentrating our efforts and executing with clarity and discipline, our diverse and advantaged portfolio can build deeper consumer connections, meet their evolving needs, and unlock meaningful, sustainable growth. We remain committed to crafting high-quality food at the right value, as well as investing in omnichannel execution, brand activation, and innovation. Turning to slide seven, total company leadership brands saw stable share performance in Q1, with consumption down 1%. As a reminder, our leadership brands represent approximately 90% of our enterprise net sales.\nThe Q1 marked the ninth consecutive quarter that our meals and beverages leadership brands have held or grown share. Consumers' at-home cooking behavior was once again a tailwind for several of our brands within the division, especially our condensed cooking soups, broth, and Italian sauces. Turning to snacks, consumers are still snacking, but how people are snacking is evolving. We are maintaining our solid share position within snacking as consumers choose snacks that meet their needs within premiumization, flavor exploration, and health and wellness. In Q1, four of our eight snacks leadership brands grew or held share. We believe our powerful portfolio of snack brands remains distinctly advantaged in today's environment, and we are staying close to consumers' evolving needs through our brand activations, innovation, and strong omnichannel execution. Let's take a closer look at each division, beginning with meals and beverages on slide eight.\nOrganic net sales decreased 2% for the quarter. Unfavorable volume and mix of 3% reflects the elasticity impact of tariff-related pricing actions, which was partially offset by favorable net price realization. Additionally, although the in-market consumption of our leadership brands was flat, our overall consumption within the division was down 1%. Turning to slide nine, our total soup portfolio slightly lagged the category on share as cooking varieties within our condensed soup portfolio and broths remained strong, while eating soups remained under pressure. In the Q1, broth consumption grew for the ninth straight quarter, driven by segment momentum that included increased households and buy rates, as well as distribution gains and healthy velocities. Younger generations continued to drive the majority of the momentum, with Swanson posting six consecutive quarters of millennial buy rate gains.\nOur Pacific brand also performed well, with dollar consumption growth up 25% and volume consumption up 31%. Our condensed soup portfolio grew share for the eighth consecutive quarter. Dollar share gains in condensed were fueled by a focused strategy to drive more occasions for Campbell's cooking soups into the repertoire of consumers' at-home cooking behavior. Our condensed cooking momentum led to a continued household penetration gain within the overall condensed portfolio and added over 2 million new buyers, including 1.2 million millennial, and Gen X households versus a year ago, pointing to the strength of our cooking soups across cohorts. In the ready-to-serve segment, the headwinds we experienced in the past quarters continued in Q1, with dollar share down in the quarter. On the positive side, Pacific and Rao's were strong performers, gaining share on both a dollar and volume basis.\nHowever, select price increases put pressure on our mainstream RTS portfolio consumption, resulting in market share declines. In addition, our RTS results reflect the last quarter of impact from the discontinuation of Well Yes!. We believe that the pricing action is the right approach to be able to support this segment of our portfolio while we're experiencing disproportionate tariff-related inflation. However, we are conscious of the importance of providing appropriate value in the marketplace, particularly during the critical soup season. Turning to slide 10, from holiday classics like the green bean casserole to new and fresh recipes, side dishes made with Campbell's products were served at Thanksgiving tables across the country. Over half of our condensed soup portfolio is cooking soups, including soups like Campbell's Cheddar Cheese Soup, used to make America's fastest-growing side dish preferred by Gen Z, Mac and Cheese.\nOur condensed cooking soups grew dollar share and consumption for the past five quarters, and we believe there continues to be ample opportunity for growth driven by recipes for the holidays and everyday occasions. Rao's continued its growth in both consumption and overall share. During the quarter, Rao's outpaced the Italian sauce category by delivering low single-digit dollar consumption growth, with growth in both dollar and volume share, and remained the number one brand in the category. We continue to be encouraged by the growth potential of this great brand, driven by sustained household penetration gains and high repeat rates as consumers continue to prioritize elevated experiences at home. Earlier this morning, we announced we entered into agreements to acquire a 49% interest in two La Regina entities, the privately held producer of Rao's tomato-based pasta sauces.\nFounded in 1972 with the philosophy of producing the highest quality Italian homemade premium and super premium tomato pasta sauces, La Regina has been a key partner of Rao's since 1993. What makes Rao's the best pasta sauce in the world is the ingredients, the recipe, and the care with how it's prepared. Rao's sauces are simmered slowly and made in small batches with only the finest ingredients, like Italian olive oil and naturally ripened tomatoes from Southern Italy. Rao's sauces have no tomato blends, no paste, no water, no starch, no filler, no colors, and no added sugar. The result is an authentic, nutritious, delicious tomato sauce consumers can rely on to serve as a restaurant-quality meal at home. With this transaction, we are solidifying our strategic partnership with the Romano family to continue to fuel Rao's momentum.\nOver the years, La Regina has perfected its proprietary cooking process, invested in state-of-the-art capacity, and maintained a commitment to excellence, ensuring every jar of Rao's sauce delivers a premium and unique experience. Campbell's investment in La Regina secures access to unique, high-quality ingredients, expands our innovation capabilities, and reinforces our commitment to producing Rao's sauces with only the finest ingredients. Together with the Romano family, we look forward to continuing this journey. We could not be more excited about the momentum and growth trajectory of our Rao's brand. Now, let's turn to our snacks business on slide 12. While snacking occasions are growing, consumer preferences continue to evolve to health and wellness, and the desire for worth it experiences, many of which are aligned with the consumer growth pillars I discussed earlier.\nWe believe our powerful portfolio of brands remains advantaged in today's environment, especially in terms of premiumization and flavor exploration. We are taking steps to further improve the health and wellness benefits of our snacks leadership brands, for example, by providing consumers with avocado oil in our chips portfolio, and we have an exciting innovation pipeline for both the short and long-term. Organic net sales declined by 1%, driven by volume declines, which were partially offset by positive net price realization, reflecting pricing actions taken to address input cost inflation, primarily in cocoa and eggs. The headwind from partner and contract brands was about one point to net sales, as expected. The difference between the year-over-year decline in net sales and consumption is driven by shipments and timing of holiday-related activities.\nAs shown on slide 13, we held or gained share in about half of our portfolio with solid performance in Pepperidge Farm Cookies, Snack Factory, and Late July, and are focused on accelerating share recovery in pretzels and crackers. To support this momentum, we are prioritizing delivering clear consumer value, including leveraging price-pack architecture while accelerating our innovation pipeline. We're also strengthening in-market omnichannel execution with targeted activation during key drive periods such as the holidays and upcoming sport championships, where snacks play a big role in gatherings. Let's talk more about our Pepperidge Farm fresh bakery and cookies business, which held share and was relatively flat from a consumption perspective.\nI will start with a standout performance in cookies, where we outperformed the category and gained share in both dollars and volume through successful innovation launches, including the fall LTOs like Pepperidge Farm Milano Pumpkin Spice, Milano Chai Latte, and Soft Baked Pumpkin Cheesecake. The double-digit consumption growth we are driving in Milano continues to contribute materially to overall category growth for the third consecutive quarter. Within our fresh bakery business, dollar and volume share were both relatively flat. However, the overall category remained under pressure as consumers are more selective in their purchases of fresh bread, favoring premium differentiated products. Our latest innovation in Farmhouse, Thin Sliced, is outpacing sandwich segment trends, delivering strong repeat rates, reflecting consumer demand for healthy products without compromising on taste. Now, let's talk about our salty portfolio.\nIn chips, we held share with relatively flat consumption due largely to sequential improvement in our Late July brand as we continue to be well-positioned with consumers that are looking for better-for-you offerings. We're also benefiting this quarter from a club promotion that shifted into the Q1 from Q2 last year. Our Kettle Brand held market share while Cape Cod lost share against the broader potato chips category. In pretzels, we experienced overall share and consumption pressure as strong performance of our Snack Factory franchise was not sufficient to offset the softness in Snyder's of Hanover. Snack Factory saw share and volume gains for the quarter driven by the innovation of Pop-Ins and Bites. Additionally, as consumers are increasingly seeking flavor experiences, our Pumpkin Spice LTO was a great driver of growth for Snack Factory in the quarter.\nAnd we are excited about the White Peppermint LTO that's on the shelves now, in time for the holiday season. The softness in Snyder's of Hanover was driven by our intentional removal of less effective promotions as well as continued competitive pressure. However, with core expansion at Club, impactful holiday messaging, and an upcoming new visual identity to drive shelf presence, we have a lot of conviction in both our pretzel brands. Now, let's talk about crackers. In crackers, we are encouraged by Goldfish's successful back-to-school campaign, which beat key competitors in the 10-week back-to-school window. The success of the campaign helped Goldfish finish Q1 as the cracker share leader over the last 13 weeks. Despite the great back-to-school campaign, consumption declined in the quarter, which shows we still have more work to do.\nI am confident that our strategy of incremental marketing support, exciting innovation, and a strategic approach to value will return this flagship billion-dollar brand back to growth. As we enter the holiday season, our snacks portfolio will play an important role in driving moments of connection and celebration. Our Pepperidge Farm cookies, crackers, and bakery items remain a staple of holiday gatherings. Additionally, we are leaning into holiday activations like white cream and peppermint Snack Factory pretzel crisps, Snyder's of Hanover holiday cabin kits, and brown sugar vanilla tortilla chips from Late July to capture heightened seasonal demand while maintaining a sharp focus on execution and in-store displays. Collectively, these actions will position our snacks business to deliver strong engagement throughout the season and support our broader commitment to consistent, profitable growth.\nBefore turning it over to Todd, I would like to highlight again how we're delivering today while building for tomorrow. As the operating environment remains dynamic and consumer preferences continue to evolve, strong day-to-day execution is critical. Our portfolio is well-positioned. We remain confident in our leadership brands and our ability to serve delicious at-home cooking options, better-for-you options, and elevated experiences that delight and excite consumers. We are committed to crafting high-quality food at the right value with a continued focus on omnichannel execution, brand activation, and innovation. Specifically, in meals and beverages, we remain focused on brands and offerings that will continue to shape at-home cooking momentum because we believe it's a trend that's here to stay. While we continue to enhance our snacks portfolio, reigniting Goldfish is a top priority.\nWe continue to focus on productivity and cost-savings initiatives across the organization to mitigate elevated inflation and invest in our brands while we strengthen our overall foundation as we drive change to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. With that, let me turn it over to Todd.\n\nTodd Cunfer\n\nCFO, Campbell's Company\n\nThank you, Mick, and good morning, everyone. As Mick mentioned, our Q1 performance was in line with our expectations and reflected focused execution amidst a dynamic operating environment. At a high level, organic net sales decreased 1%. Adjusted EBIT decreased 11% to $383 million, primarily due to lower adjusted gross profit, partially offset by lower adjusted administrative, marketing, and selling expenses, while adjusted EPS decreased 13% to $0.77. Now, let me provide more details on our financial performance and guidance. Turning to slide 18, net sales were $2.7 billion, a decrease of 3%.\nOrganic net sales decreased 1%, primarily due to unfavorable volume and mix, partially offset by net price realization. On slide 19, Q1 adjusted gross profit margin decreased 150 basis points to 29.9%, driven by cost headwinds of 520 basis points, inclusive of cost inflation, other supply chain costs, and the impact of gross tariffs. These costs were partially offset by cost savings, supply chain productivity improvements, and favorable net price realization. Gross tariffs had a 200 basis point negative impact on the adjusted gross profit margin in the quarter. In the Q1, Campbell's made progress towards its fiscal 2028 cost savings target of $375 million by delivering approximately $15 million in new savings, bringing total cost savings achieved to $160 million. The company intends to use these savings as one of several levers to help offset tariff headwinds.\nAs we look at the Q2, we expect an increase in both promotional activity and marketing investment to further strengthen top-line performance. Turning to slide 20, Adjusted marketing and selling expenses decreased 2% versus prior year, primarily due to lower selling expenses, the benefit from cost savings initiatives, and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher marketing expenses. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses were 9% of net sales, consistent with the prior year. In the Q2, we expect marketing and selling expenses to be at the upper end of our targeted range of 9% to 10% of net sales. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 9%, mainly driven by the benefit from cost savings initiatives and lower incentive compensation. As shown on slide 21, Q1 adjusted EBIT decreased 11%, primarily due to lower adjusted gross profit, partially offset by lower adjusted administrative, and lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses.\nOn slide 22, adjusted EPS decreased 13% to $0.77, driven by lower adjusted EBIT. Lower interest expense provided a $0.01 benefit, offset by a 60 basis points increase in the adjusted tax rate, which was EPS dilutive of $0.01. The divestiture of noosa also had a $0.01 negative impact for the quarter. As a note, the gross impact of tariffs to Q1 adjusted EPS was $0.14, while the net impact of tariffs was $0.04 through EPS for the quarter. Turning to slide 23, Meals and Beverages Q1 reported net sales decreased 4%. Excluding the impact of the noosa divestiture, organic net sales decreased 2%, mainly driven by declines in US soup, Canada, SpaghettiOs, Pace Mexican sauces, and V8 beverages, partially offset by gains in Rao's. An unfavorable volume mix decline of 3% was partially offset by favorable net price realization of 1%.\nQ1 operating earnings in the division decreased 13%, primarily due to lower gross profit and the impact of the noosa divestiture. Operating margin was lower by 190 basis points, primarily due to lower gross profit, inclusive of a 280 basis point gross impact from tariffs, cost inflation, and other supply chain costs. This was partially offset by cost savings, supply chain productivity improvements, and favorable net price realization. On Slide 24, Snacks reported a 2% decrease in net sales, which includes the impact of the Pop Secret divestiture. Organic net sales decreased 1%, driven primarily by lower net sales in third-party partnering contract brands, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels, Fresh Bakery, Goldfish Crackers, and Cape Cod potato chips, partially offset by gains in Pepperidge Farm cookies. Organic net sales were impacted by unfavorable volume mix decline of 3% and favorable net price realization of 2%.\nSnacks Q1 operating earnings decreased 10% while operating margin decreased 100 basis points. The margin contraction reflected cost inflation, other supply chain costs, gross tariff impact, and unfavorable volume mix, which more than offset benefits from cost savings, supply chain productivity improvements, and favorable net price realization. Turning to slide 25, we generated $224 million in operating cash flow in the Q1, in line with prior year. We continue to prioritize reinvestment back into the business to drive incremental growth with Q1 capital expenditures of $127 million. We also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders, with $120 million in dividends paid and $24 million in anti-dilutive share repurchases in the quarter. As of 2 November 2025, the company has approximately $174 million remaining under its anti-dilutive share repurchase program.\nOur net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of Q1 was 3.7x. We remain committed to deleveraging the balance sheet towards our goal of 3x leverage. At the end of Q1, the company had approximately $168 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.4 billion available under our revolving credit facility. With respect to the La Regina transaction Mick mentioned earlier, we anticipate closing in H2 fiscal 2026. The transaction is expected to be neutral to the reaffirmed guidance for fiscal 2026 adjusted EPS. Further details on the acquisition can be found in the company's Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based on the company's Q1 performance, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2026 guidance ranges provided on 3 September 2025.\nFiscal 2026 guidance ranges are based on the exclusion of the additional week in fiscal 2025, which represented approximately 2% to net sales, 2% to adjusted EBIT, and $0.06 to adjusted EPS. In fiscal 2026, we continue to expect a significant impact from tariffs. Gross tariffs are projected to be approximately 4% of cost of product sold, approximately 60% related to Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, and the remainder largely from global IEPA tariffs. We continue to expect to mitigate approximately 60% of this impact in fiscal 2026 through a number of actions, including continued inventory management, supplier collaboration, alternative sourcing opportunities, productivity and cost savings, and, where absolutely necessary, surgical and responsible pricing actions. I will close by saying that just 50 days in, I share Mark's conviction in the strength of our leadership brands, our capabilities, and our people.\nMaintaining focus on our strategic priorities will be key as we continue to navigate short-term macroeconomic challenges while investing to build long-term shareholder value. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, let's turn it over to the operator and begin the Q&A session.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw any questions, please press star one again. Our first question today comes from Tom Palmer from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood morning, Mick and Todd. Thanks for the question. And Todd, welcome. I wanted to follow up on the La Regina announcement. Perhaps we could get some added detail on the reason for the acquisition and the timing, and also perhaps some added details on the option on the remaining 51%, such as how the purchase price would be determined. Thank you.\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nYeah. Good morning, Tom. So when I look at the La Regina investment, first of all, it obviously supports our conviction around Rao's. And as we've obviously talked in the past about sauce boss for Rao's, so partnering up with the proprietary producer of the tomato-based sauces is absolutely critical from my perspective. Rao's has had a long relationship with La Regina, as I described earlier. And since the acquisition, we've also been developing that relationship with the Romano family. This investment is really strengthening that partnership with both La Regina, but also with, as you're pointing out, the Romano family. And I'm really looking forward to bringing that relationship to the next level. On the one end, it's obviously secure supply. And we describe a lot of the uniqueness of the product, and we've talked about that.\nIt's obviously a key component of Rao's and Rao's growth, the unique ingredients, but overall also the process with which we're making the sauce and with which the sauce is cooked, as we described earlier. So making sure that we have supply of the high-quality Rao's sauce is absolutely critical. That's what this investment helps us with. That's what this supports. It kind of supports the overall conviction around the growth story. On top of it, also the partnership with the Rao family will allow us to continue to work closely together in areas like innovation, really a kind of mutual interest in order to continue to support the growth of this amazing brand, which I personally think has a long way to go. And if you look at, we obviously described some of the details. We were currently acquiring 49% of La Regina for $286 million.\nThis represents a high single-digit EBITDA multiple. As Todd also described in his prepared remarks, we expect it to be EPS neutral in fiscal 2026. I personally think this comes at an opportune time where we have integrated the Rao's acquisition, and we have continued to build this relationship. Back to your question around timing, we've continued to build this relationship. As a result, this is a very logical, call it like addition to building that overall conviction around the Rao's brand. I don't know, Todd, any additional thoughts around the option that we have?\n\nTodd Cunfer\n\nCFO, Campbell's Company\n\nYeah. So just to be clear on the timing, so the first payment, again, we anticipate closing sometime in the second half of this year, $146 million cash payment immediately. One year later, there'll be a second payment of $140 million. That gets to the $286 million for the 49% ownership portion.\nAfter that first year, we do have a call option. We can purchase the remaining 51%. There will be likely a premium depending on the performance of up to 20% of premium on the second half of the piece. So the valuation approaches around $600 million ultimately if we exercise that option. And the Romano family has a put option four years after we close on the transaction for us to purchase the remaining. So again, close to around a $600 million ultimate valuation. As Mick pointed out, high single-digit multiple. Just super excited about this opportunity. It's going to be a great partnership. It's going to improve the margins of the Rao's brand. So it's a win-win for everybody.\n\nTom Palmer\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks for all the detail.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks so much. And welcome, Todd.\nI think last quarter, Campbell spoke about its intention to stabilize the snack segment in the second half of the fiscal year. It looks like you're still expecting that to be the case. I guess based on the data we can all see, it doesn't seem that trends improved maybe as much sequentially in the fiscal Q1 as you might have expected. I was hoping you could go through what gives you the conviction in a back half stabilization. And how do you think this has impacted, if at all, from a key snacks player talking more about affordability going forward? Thanks so much.\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nYeah. Thank you, Andrew. So maybe stepping back first with regard to the overall categories.\nWhen I look at the snacks categories that we participate in, in the aggregate, the dollar consumption trend was sequentially relatively stable, i.e., it didn't deteriorate further in the Q3 for the Q3 in a row. I do expect as a result that you're basically going into next quarter, you're going to continue to see that category pressure. I don't expect that to immediately change within the next couple of months. However, as we're getting into the second half, arguably comps should become a little bit easier. That should allow categories overall to start to stabilize. That being said, we're obviously, as I described also during my prepared remarks, we're focused on what we control. We clearly see that snacking is evolving.\nAnd I described it extensively in my prepared remarks, but we are very focused on making sure that we continue to evolve our portfolio with that. When I look specifically at our portfolio performance in Q1, if you look at bakery and cookies, one of the things that actually worked well is the innovation, and particularly the cookie innovation. And that really is something that we got to make sure that we keep that momentum going. If I look within salty, within chips, some benefit from timing of certain promotional activities. So I expect that we're going to continue to feel a little bit of pressure on chips. Also a relatively competitive, call it like subcategory within salty. Within pretzels, we have great results around Snack Factory. They're really encouraging. We got to make sure that we keep that momentum going a lot around innovation, but also in market execution.\nWith regard to Snyder's of Hanover, we still got some work to do. And then when I look at crackers, which is the third major category within our snacks portfolio, it's really coming back to making sure that we reignite Goldfish. Now, when I look at Goldfish in Q1, as we also described, the back-to-school performance was quite good and encouraging. Really also focused back on price-pack architecture. I mentioned that in the past and the importance of that during the right moments, making sure we provide the right value to the consumer. And that came through with the multi-pack execution during the back-to-school period. So there's definitely some green shoots throughout. That being said, making sure that, for instance, we are getting Goldfish back to growth is absolutely critical for not only the cracker performance within our cracker category, but also more broadly within our snacks portfolio.\nSo that's something that we are very focused on. When I look at Q1, we made some progress. We got still more work to do. As I pointed out, there's some proof points that we are going to continue to amplify throughout the year. I also think it's going to be really important to make sure that we see some of these proof points come together in Q2. And that will inform us around the second half trajectory of our snacks business. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of context around kind of our performance.\n\nAndrew Lazar\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGreat. Thank you. Just to follow up on salty snacks, I know you won't be surprised to hear that people are really thinking about megatrends with regard to salty snacks right now.\nAnd obviously, GLP-1 usage, people are concerned that that's going to be ramping into 2026. And then, of course, there's that issue that some cite about COVID-era overpricing, just a hangover, particularly within certain income cohorts. I'm wondering if you feel like these factors are relevant more to some subcategories. I know that salty snacks right now overall is up 1% in the latest dollar sales that we see ending November 30. So it doesn't look like it's that bad of a category. So it's a little bit confusing, too. It sounds worse than it is, so to speak. But I'm wondering how you're thinking about those megatrends and how they might interact with certain subsegments and how you're perhaps thinking about that going into 2026. So thanks.\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thanks, David. It's something that we are very focused on.\nAnd you heard me talk a little bit about this in the beginning of the prepared remarks as well. And I really kind of, that focus on the consumer value across those different occasions or those distinct needs, as we've described it on one of the pages, is really the way that we are approaching it. First of all, and this has been a focus since I became the CEO, is really making sure that we elevate the focus on the consumer needs across the organization. You see that come through in these different megatrends that we've identified around whether it's premiumization, flavor exploration, health and wellness, and cooking and comfort. For snacking specifically, people are still snacking, as you're describing; however, snacking is evolving.\nWe see that really taking place within those three key pillars that I described earlier, whether it is that elevating the experience or people want an exciting experience, which comes back to premiumization or flavor exploration, or the focus on health and wellness. Our brands, call it premium snacking brands, really have a place to win within those different trends. We just need to make sure that when we innovate, we're very conscious of what the consumer is looking for. That allows us to continue to evolve our portfolio. At the same time, from a messaging perspective, when we communicate or connect with the consumer, we need to make sure that we bring it back to these core focus areas that we know the consumer is focused on. We're working through that. Definitely some areas are working.\nOthers, we got some more work to do. The one thing that is an overarching, call it like important piece that I pointed out also when I talked about Goldfish is to continue to focus on value. And that you see across the overall consumer spectrum. And that's something that goes for both divisions.\n\nDavid Palmer\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, folks. Thanks for the question. I guess I really have two. I wanted to know, Mick, you said two things about the soup business. You said that it's important for you to raise price to cover costs, but also you recognize the importance of providing value and that there's been some share losses in eating soup. So these two things kind of clash with each other.\nDo you think you'll need to improve affordability of eating soups? And how have competitors responded to the price increases?\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nYep. Yep. So definitely something we're very conscious of, right? And by the way, Rob, maybe stepping back for a minute, if you look at our total soup portfolio, obviously on the one end, cooking, cooking is really working. And we're really feeling some of that pressure on the eating side. Within cooking, that's really coming back to broth on the one hand. We are seeing, by the way, the private label is recovering. And as a result, although I still expect continued one growth of the category, but also growth for us, I do expect that we're going to feel some of that share pressure that we've talked about in the past to start to materialize as private label continues to recover.\nNow, from a condensed perspective, the condensed portfolio is really split in two. It's interesting when you peel that back and you really see the growth on the cooking side of condensed, which you're really back to a lot of the creams, for instance, that are being used in recipes as ingredients. Then some of the more eating-focused, oriented products within our condensed portfolio, that's where you're feeling some of the pressure in general. When I get to RTS or ready-to-serve soups, which is a broader portfolio for us, right? That includes Chunky, it includes Homestyle. It did include in the past Well Yes!, which we've now discontinued. That's where we felt the most pressure, which is on the one end because of what I described earlier, a little bit of that pressure on eating soups in general.\nAnd then in combination with some of the pricing actions that we have taken that, listen, we've taken them, we talked about it last quarter. We've been really surgical about it. But because of the disproportionate inflation, we did believe it was important to implement some of the pricing. Elasticities have materialized the way that we expected. We also believe that it's important for, as you're pointing out, the long-term value of our brands. Although in the short term, and particularly during the beginning of this quarter, it's definitely led to some pressure from a consumption, as well as overall share, perspective, which you saw on one of the slides. Now, that being said, we're also very conscious, to bring it back to your piece around value, is important and value is important when it really matters.\nSo going into the soup season, we have taken selective incremental actions in order to make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace. And if you look at the L4 trend, you actually see that RTS is growing slightly and that share declines are much more subdued.\n\nRobert Moskow\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. In the interest of time, I'll take my second question offline. Thanks.\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nThank you. Good morning. Just wondering if you could come back to La Regina for a minute. You mentioned the margin benefit, but I suppose at 49%, would that still come through in operations or would that only occur if and when you have full consolidation? And then in either case, maybe could you just touch a little bit on what, if any, implications the deal has for top-line momentum?\nIt's always been a strong brand, but it certainly, as it gets bigger and bigger, grows a little bit more slowly. How do we think about just what you can do to keep the momentum going on the strength of the top line as well?\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nMaybe I'll start off with the top line and thoughts, if you can then add a little bit around the consolidation piece and the margin piece. So from an overall growth perspective, you did see that we continue to have growth this past quarter. We talked about this in the past as, call it net to high single-digit growth has always been the focus going into this fiscal year. We had 4% consumption growth this past quarter.\nA little bit of timing of promotional activity between Q1, Q2, and I still am very comfortable that we're going to see that mid- to high-single-digit growth trajectory materialize.\n\nTodd Cunfer\n\nCFO, Campbell's Company\n\nFrom a P&L impact, because of the call option that we have, we will actually consolidate 100% of the P&L into our business. So we will get the full gross margin impact. It'll be significant for Rao's, obviously not terribly significant for the entire company, but we'll have a very favorable impact on the brand. We will then back out 51% of the earnings of La Regina through a minority interest line. And then obviously, we'll have any additional interest expense coming through as we finance the purchase. As we talked about earlier, for this year, it should be a washed EPS over time. Obviously, we believe it'll be accretive.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAnd can I add a quick follow-up? If that's the case, then you've got greater margin opportunity and flexibility. Does that do anything to impact how you might think about funding ANC?\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nIt gives us more to come, Michael. It gives us, obviously, flexibility from lots of aspects to invest in the business as you intimate. Innovation, channel, strategy, just gives us a lot more flexibility on the brand. And so we think it's going to be a great impact for us.\n\nMichael Lavery\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hope you're doing well. So Todd, I kind of had a broader question for Todd.\nAnd I guess I know it's only been a few weeks, but maybe just some initial perspectives as you step into this role, kind of where you see the biggest opportunities for improvement, just as where you see them today and whether that be in growth, profitability, and cash flow. What kind of stands out to you?\n\nTodd Cunfer\n\nCFO, Campbell's Company\n\nYeah. Look, I took this position for a couple of reasons. One is I think the brands are just incredible, powerful, absolutely have a right to win, slightly declining today, but I'm very confident they're going to be growing in the future. And I want to be a meaningful part of that. The people here that I met through the interview process, amazing. And as I continue to meet more people through this organization, the people here are just terrific.\nThat's, quite frankly, when you work every day, that's 80% of the battle: coming in and making sure you're working with people that you really appreciate and want to work with. Look, this is a big business. It's a complex business. I think I can add value in streamlining analysis, making sure we focus on the right things, making sure we have the right people working on the right things, making the right investments. Having worked for 20 years for a similar-sized company, that being Hershey, and then working for two $1 billion companies over the last eight years gives me, I think, a unique perspective on both larger cap food companies and then the advantages of smaller companies who are higher growth and how they think, how they act, and how they're more nimble.\nSo hopefully, I can bring some of that perspective to the company over the next several years.\n\nPeter Grom\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Jim Salera from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nJim Salera\n\nResearch Analyst, Stephens\n\nHey, Todd. Thanks for taking our question. I wanted to maybe circle back on Goldfish because it sounds like that's going to be really the key lever to reigniting the snack segment growth as a whole. Can you just walk us through: has Goldfish lost households, or have you seen consumption frequency step back among existing households? And maybe if you could give us some detail on what the focus of the incremental marketing is going to be there.\n\nMick Beekhuizen\n\nCEO, Campbell's Company\n\nYep. Yep. Sure. So you're absolutely right. Making sure that we get Goldfish right is really important.\nObviously, one of our billion-dollar brands across our broader portfolio, and making sure that we have that growth back, will help snacks, but obviously will help our broader organization. When I look at the Goldfish itself and I look at kind of the key focus areas, first of all, maybe specifically to your question, household penetration relatively stable. It's really buy rate that we felt a little bit more of the pressure. When I think about what you, as a result, are going to do about it, making sure that we provide, one, a clear message with regard and reminder of what Goldfish is and that Goldfish is here and what Goldfish provides. At the same time, from an innovation perspective, making sure that we give people also choices within the Goldfish portfolio.\nOne of the examples of that is, for instance, the Goldfish pretzel innovation that is coming out. So making sure that we provide kind of the full power of the franchise is really important in order to support that buy rate in combination with reminding people what Goldfish stands for. At the same time, and so that comes back to innovation, brand, messaging. At the same time, as I described earlier, and I described this also in the past, price-pack architecture, I think, is really important, which brings it back to making sure that we have the right value at the right moment. That's something that we're very focused on across not only Goldfish, but the broader portfolio, but that also is really important for Goldfish itself.\nAnd a proof point of that is what you saw with the multi-pack growth during the back-to-school period this past quarter. And then the last thing that I'd say is call it like the daily blocking and tackling. I refer to omnichannel execution in my prepared remarks as well. I really look at it as making sure we have really good execution in the marketplace, is absolutely critical. So it's really those different components that should allow us to get back to growth with Goldfish in a brand that arguably has a right to win in the marketplace.\n\nJim Salera\n\nResearch Analyst, Stephens\n\nGreat. Thank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nChris Carey",
    "content2": "Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about margins. I think this is a historically low gross margin in the quarter going back some time.\nAnd so I wanted to get a sense of how the quarter, from a gross margin perspective, has come in relative to your own expectations, and whether you think that the rest of the year gross margin relative to current levels, whether on an absolute basis or a year-over-year basis, see some steady improvement. I ask that in the context of, I think this is going to be the peak inflation quarter relative to your guidance anyways, and there potentially is some relief through the rest of the year. So it's kind of how it came in relative to expectations and phasing from here. And then as you look at the business and you've handled this inflation cycle, just any thoughts on the prospects for margins over time? Thanks so much.\n\nTodd Cunfer\n\nCFO, Campbell's Company\n\nSure. Look, so obviously, incredible inflation, both from just normal inflationary input costs, labor costs, plus a very large impact from tariffs in the quarter and throughout the majority of the year. So it came in exactly as we expected it would be. And as we had in our slides, over 500 basis points of total cost pressures with 200 basis points approximately of that being tariffs. Inflation throughout the entire cost system also was a similar amount to the tariffs for the quarter. And then we had incremental depreciation, higher logistics costs, and a number of other items that put some additional pressure on it. Now, the good news is the supply chain team is doing an incredible job and was able to offset 70% of those costs. So kudos to them. We would be in much worse shape if not for their incredible efforts.\nThis inflation will remain for the vast majority of the year. There'll be a similar impact in Q2. Just FYI, gross margins, which was down 150 basis points in Q1, will be down a similar amount, maybe even a little bit more in Q2. Probably will get a little bit better as we get into Q3. And then, as we begin to lap some of the tariff impacts that we started to have in Q4 and some of the cost improvement opportunities that the supply chain is working on now come to full fruition, as second half comes together, we will see improvement throughout the quarters, particularly in Q4, again, because we will be lapping some of those tariff impacts. Look, we're not happy about where the gross margins are, clearly.\nWe know we need to get them well above 30% over time, and we have a number of cost initiatives in place to ensure that happens.\n\nChris Carey\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. All right. Great. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe are out of time for questions today. This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell's.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Campbell's Company Fourth Quarter Fiscal '25 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Campbell's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Joining me today are Mick Beekhuizen, Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer. Today's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A.\nThe presentation, a transcript of management's prepared remarks and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, thecampbellscompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the entire call, including the Q&A within 24 hours.\nSlide 2 outlines today's agenda. Mick will provide insights into our fourth quarter performance as well as our in-market performance by division. Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the full fiscal year '26. Please note that all references to in-market performance refer to a 13-week period for the fourth quarter and a 52-week period for the full year for comparative purposes. I would also point out that beginning in fiscal 2026, we will change how we report share of chips for our Cape Cod, Kettle brand and Late July brands. Cape Cod and Kettle brand will be compared against the total potato chip category replacing the current comparison to the Kettle cooked potato chip category. Late July will be compared against the total tortilla chip category, replacing the current comparison to the natural and organic tortilla chip category. We believe these changes will better reflect the in-market performance for our brands and will highlight their favorable positioning within the chips category.\nIn addition, beginning in fiscal '26, the Snacking and Meals & Beverages retail business in Latin America is managed under our Meals & Beverages segment.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation. And now it is my pleasure to turn it over to our Chief Executive Officer, Mick Beekhuizen. Mick?\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal '25 earnings call. Our fourth quarter earnings performance was slightly ahead of our expectations as we continue to successfully navigate the dynamic operating environment. Meals & Beverages in-market consumption continued to outpace the category. Our Snacks business saw sequential improvement in net sales and in-market consumption along with better sequential share performance across several key brands. Collectively, the in-market performance of our 16 leadership brands was in line with overall category performance.\nAs we have seen over the last few quarters, consumers remain cautious and intentional with their spending. They continue to seek value in a variety of ways, such as cooking at home, a behavior that fuels growth in our Meals & Beverages business. Consumers are also increasingly seeking flavor forward offerings, premium experiences and health and wellness benefits. These trends are the backdrop for exciting innovations and incremental brand support across both divisions.\nFinally, as outlined in our press release, we issued fiscal 2026 guidance reflecting the anticipated tariff impact while continuing our commitment to prioritize innovation and increase marketing investments to support our amazing portfolio of brands and deliver increased cost savings. Carrie will provide more details on our guidance in a moment.\nNow let's turn to the key highlights from our fourth quarter and full year results. In-market consumption during the quarter declined 1%, while organic net sales declined 3%, with the bulk of the difference being driven by the favorable shipment timing in the third quarter, reversing in Q4. As a reminder, the organic net sales result excludes a 7-point positive impact from the additional week in the quarter and a 3-point negative impact related to our portfolio optimization strategy, specifically the Pop Secret and Nusa divestitures. Overall results for the quarter were slightly ahead of our expectations with net sales up 1% and adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS down 2% versus prior year. On a full year basis, net sales grew 6%, primarily due to the positive impact from the Sovos acquisition, while adjusted EBIT increased 2%. Full year volume declined 1%, but if we had owned Sovos for the full period, pro forma year-over-year volume would have been flat. Adjusted EPS of $2.97 included a slightly better-than-expected impact of $0.02 due to tariffs.\nBefore reviewing the performance of our divisions and brands, I wanted to highlight the framework we use to guide how we connect with our consumers across our portfolio. As consumers become increasingly deliberate in their choices, it's more important than ever that we are equally intentional in how we engage them. Specifically, our portfolio has a right to win across 4 key areas highlighted on the page here. These are areas where consumer demand is growing and where our brands are well positioned to lead. Capturing this growth requires not only having the right products, but also ensuring we deliver the right innovation and messaging to meet evolving consumer expectations. By leaning into these areas with focus and discipline across our differentiated portfolio, we can create meaningful connections with our consumers and drive outsized growth opportunities.\nWith the launch of our new growth office, we are focused on meeting these consumer needs to ensure our innovation pipeline is clearly aligned to what matters most. We see this shift reflected in the strong performance of our recent innovation launches, which highlights how consumers are prioritizing health and elevated taste experiences. Just look at our avocado oil Kettle brand chips and our Pacific flavored Bone broth and Pepperidge Farm Milano White Chocolate Cookies.\nIn fiscal '25, innovation contributed approximately 3% to net sales, and we expect this momentum to increase as we continue investing in our brands and creating food and beverages that meet consumers where they are.\nAnother step we're taking is removing FD&C colors from my portfolio. As you may have heard me say before, our use of these colors is limited. In the second half of fiscal '26, in line with consumer preferences, Campbell's will no longer produce any of our food or beverages with FD&C colors. These are a few examples of how this consumer-led approach informs how we work across our leadership brands in both divisions, ensuring we bring forward offerings that resonate with consumers and their evolving preferences.\nTurning to Slide 8. The in-market contribution of our 16 leadership brands representing approximately 90% of total net sales remained stable in the fourth quarter with 7 of our brands gaining or holding share. As I mentioned earlier, the consumer environment remained relatively consistent in the fourth quarter with at-home cooking continuing to be one of the ways consumers define value. This once again was a tailwind for our Meals & Beverages business, especially for our condensed cooking soups, broth and Italian sauces. As a result, our Meals & Beverages leadership brands outpaced category consumption, gaining 0.2 share points as 5 of our 8 leadership brands grew or held share in the quarter. Our broth business as a whole, continued its strong performance, though Swanson share eased in Q4 primarily due to a promotional timing shift. In total, Meals & Beverages leadership brand consumption increased by 1% in Q4 and 2% for the full year. Conversely, the consumer environment remained a headwind for our categories in snacks, though our consumption improved sequentially and driven by improvement in half of our Snacks leadership brands during the quarter.\nIn snacks, 2 of our 8 leadership brands grew or held share. Pepperidge Farm held share, while Snack Factory, which has a presence in both the deli and snack house, grew share by 0.7 points. Given the category trends and aggregate share headwinds, our overall Snacks leadership brand consumption declined by 2% in the quarter. In fiscal '25, the growth in both consumption and share in our Meals & Beverages business offset the consumption and share decline in Snacks, underscoring the strength, resilience and balance of our combined leadership brands portfolio.\nLet's take a closer look at each division, beginning with Meals & Beverages on Slide 9. Organic net sales decreased 3% for the quarter with volume and mix down 4%. This was primarily due to the favorable timing of customer shipments in Q3, reversing in Q4, as I mentioned earlier. Year-over-year consumption grew by 1%, aided by Rao's return to high single-digit consumption growth. On a full year basis, including the pro forma contribution from Sovos, organic net sales grew 1%, fueled by volume growth, while [indiscernible] consumption grew 2%.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our soup portfolio performed largely in line with the category in Q4. Campbell's total [indiscernible] share declined by 0.8 points as a discontinuation of our well yes brand more than offset aggregate share gains across the remainder of the portfolio. Similar to prior quarters, consumers continue to cook at home, fueling gains in both dollars and volume for the broth category. We maintained strong in-market performance with 7% broth consumption growth, driven by increased usage per buyer, particularly among millennials and boomers, segment momentum and private label service challenges.\nOur condensed portfolio continued its strong performance with its seventh consecutive quarter of dollar share growth and increases in both dollar and volume consumption, driven by the strength of our condensed cooking soups. Finally, our ready-to-serve in-market consumption declines were driven by category headwinds, increased competitive promotional intensity and the discontinuation of our Well Yes brand product line. Bright spots in our ready-to-serve portfolio included our Chunky, Pacific and Rao's brands, which all gained share in the quarter.\nOn Slide 11, you can see the dollar consumption in the Italian sauce category grew 2% year-over-year in Q4, similar to the past 2 quarters. Campbell's Italy and Salt portfolio outpaced this mark, growing dollar consumption by 4%. This was driven by strength in Rao's as dollar consumption for the brand returned to high single-digit growth in Q4, while Prego dollar consumption was flat. Rao's also grew dollar share by 1.2 points in the quarter as we continued our focus on increasing distribution, household penetration and awareness of the brand.\nOur strong lead in the Italian salt category continues as Rao's, which will soon become our fourth billion-dollar brand and Prego, both at top 2 spots in dollar share, and we are excited about the prospects for future growth with these great brands.\nTurning to Slide 12. As I mentioned earlier, consumer preferences continue to evolve, and so does our approach to innovation across our portfolio. Campbell's broth and stock have delivered strong performance over the past couple of years with volume share growth in 7 of the past 8 quarters. In the fourth quarter, our broth offerings outpaced category growth in both buy rate and trips per buyer. I'll share 2 examples of great consumer-led innovation driving the continued relevance of our broth portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we introduced an exciting innovation to drive the ongoing at-home cooking trend with Swanson's first-ever Raman broth offering. Homemad Raman is one of the fastest-growing usages of broth and our team developed a national new product to meet consumers' needs. Additionally, earlier this year, in e-commerce channels, we our Pacific flavored bone broth offerings by launching the ginger turmeric and black pepper flavor, continuing to provide consumers focus on health and wellness with an excellent and easy way to increase the protein content of their meals.\nNow let's turn to our Snacks business on Slide 13. Pressure on snacking categories remained in the fourth quarter, but we were encouraged that our in-market results improved sequentially, resulting in a 2% consumption decline versus the prior year. Organic net sales declined by 2%, driven by lower volume and mix, but improved versus Q3 due to favorable net price realization. Dollar consumption in the quarter was in line with full year totals, while organic net sales were slightly better.\nTurning to Slide 14. You can see our Snacks portfolio performed relative to each respective snacking category. While we saw share losses in parts of the portfolio in Q4, 5 of our 8 leadership brands saw sequential share improvement and 4 of 8 saw sequential dollar consumption gains compared to Q3. In Cookies, we gained share as we grew consumption during the quarter, outperforming the category through successful innovation launches, most notably our Milano white chocolate lineup. We are excited to continue to expand our white chocolate product line with seasonal LTOs, such as the popular Milano Chai Latte flavor and expect to drive sustained growth in the category with increased innovation. Although consumption declined during the quarter in our fresh bakery business, we continue to hold share driven by positive momentum in our farmhouse buns and rolls. This is a great example of consumers selecting premium options even while their spending habits have become more intentional throughout the year. While our Prego chips and crackers businesses experienced share losses in the quarter, we saw several key brands improved sequentially compared to Q3.\nSnack factories saw in-market consumption growth and for the second straight quarter, share gains with the successful innovations of [indiscernible] and Bites. In chips, we saw sequential improvement in our Kettle and Late July brands, resulting in consumption growth as the attractiveness of better-for-you offerings resonates with consumers. Notably, Cape Cod, Kettle brand and Late July all gained market share against the broader potato and to tortilla chips categories, giving us confidence that our brands are well positioned for growth and reside in advantageous subcategories. In crackers, Goldfish as 1 of our flagship billion-dollar brands, continues to exhibit healthy brand fundamentals with sequential improvements in both dollar consumption and dollar share performance in the fourth quarter. new flavors, limited time offerings and improving multipack performance have helped us to begin reigniting the brand, though we still have more work to do.\nI am confident that with incremental marketing support and strategic promotional activity, we will get this important brand back to its historical growth trajectory.\nTurning to Slide 15. I'm excited to share the impact of our Milano white chocolate innovation, a fantastic example of how the convergence of premiumization and value is resonating with consumers. It helped drive both incremental improvement in our cookies business as well as fuel the entire cookies category. In the fourth quarter, while the cookies category declined by 1%, total Milano dollar consumption increased 27% versus prior year and lifted our overall Pepperidge Farm cookies business dollar consumption to 3%. In fact, over the past 2 quarters, Milano white chocolate has been the #1 driver of category dollar and volume growth. I'm incredibly proud of the team for the insights that led to this innovation and how they are building momentum on this early success.\nBefore turning it over to Carrie, I'd like to briefly highlight how we're delivering today while we build for tomorrow. In this dynamic operating environment, day-to-day execution is critical. We've made great progress over the past couple of years, and we'll continue to execute our near-term priorities across the organization to deliver results. In fiscal '26, we plan to increase marketing support and new product innovation across our leadership brands. Specifically, in Meals & Beverages, we'll maintain momentum by investing in brands aligned with the growing at-home cooking trends. In snacks, we are focused on reigniting Goldfish with incremental investment, leveraging brand strength. In addition, we have well defined and immediate action plans to mitigate more than half of the tariff impact and we'll continue pursuing additional mitigation opportunities. Finally, we are expanding our organizational capabilities. A key step was establishing the growth offers focused on elevating core commercial strengths in consumer insights, integrated marketing, innovation and revenue growth management. These capabilities will help drive enterprise-wide growth over time and top-tier performance. We're also continuing to invest in digital transformation to boost agility, efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, as Carrie will discuss, we're expanding our cost savings program to further optimize our cost structure and provide few for further investment in our leadership brands. All in, we're driving change to deliver growth. I am confident that our focus on day-to-day execution and the actions we are taking to strengthen our foundation will lead to sustainable, profitable growth.\nLet me now turn it over to Carrie to go over the Q4 and full year fiscal '25 results and fiscal '26 guidance in more detail.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mick. Turning to our Q4 results. As Mick said earlier, our fourth quarter performance was slightly ahead of our expectations. As a reminder, our Q4 and full year results include the contribution of an additional week in fiscal '25. Q4 reported net sales increased 1% with the contribution from the additional week. Organic net sales, excluding the impact of the additional week, currency and the Pop Secret and Nusa divestitures decreased 3%, which was driven by the expected reversal of favorable third quarter shipment timing in Meals & Beverages and continued pressure on snacking categories. As a reminder, the Sovos acquisition was fully included in organic growth in the fourth quarter following the anniversary date of the acquisition in Q3. Adjusted EBIT decreased 2%, including the benefit of the additional week, with adjusted EBIT margin down 50 basis points, including a 30-basis-point impact from tariffs. Adjusted EPS of $0.62 was lower by 2% with the additional week contributing $0.06, partially offset by an approximate $0.02 headwind from tariffs and an approximate $0.02 impact from divestitures in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 19. For the full year, net sales increased 6%, primarily driven by the contribution of the Sovos acquisition. Organic net sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year, driven by modestly lower volume and mix and net price investment. Full year adjusted EBIT increased 2% driven by the contribution of the acquisition and the additional week in fiscal '25, partially offset by lower adjusted EBIT in the remainder of the business. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% driven by increased interest expense. The modest Q4 headwind from tariffs and the full year impact of divestitures offset the benefit of the additional week in our full year adjusted EPS results.\nThe Sovos acquisition performed well in fiscal '25, with Rao's delivering high single-digit net sales growth on a pro forma basis as if we had owned Rao's for all of fiscal '24, and we overdelivered integration synergies with the acquisition accretive to our fiscal '25 adjusted EPS.\nMoving to Slide 20. Organic net sales for the fourth quarter declined 3% due to unfavorable volume and mix, partially offset by higher net price realization. The 1% increase in reported net sales in the quarter reflected a 7-point contribution from the additional week, partially offset by a 3-point impact from divestitures.\nOn Slide 21, fourth quarter adjusted gross profit margin declined 90 basis points to 30.5%, driven by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, inclusive of an approximate 30-basis-point impact from tariffs. This was partially offset by supply chain productivity improvements, favorable net price realization and the benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nTurning to Slide 22. The total combined dollar spend on adjusted marketing, selling and administrative expenses remained flat at approximately 15% as a percentage of net sales. Advertising and consumer promotion expenses increased 12%, primarily driven by the contribution of the additional week. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 4% compared to the prior year as the benefit from our enterprise cost savings initiatives, including benefits from the integration of Sovos and lower incentive compensation, partially offset higher general and administrative cost, inflation and the additional week.\nAs shown on Slide 23, fourth quarter adjusted EBIT decreased 2%, primarily due to lower adjusted gross profit and higher adjusted marketing and selling expenses, which were partially offset by lower adjusted administrative and other expenses.\nOn Slide 24, adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.62, which is reflective of the lower adjusted EBIT. Higher interest expense due to the additional week in the quarter was offset by lower tax expense from a lower adjusted effective tax rate.\nShifting to segment performance, our Meals & Beverages results are summarized on Slide 25. Meals & Beverages reported fourth quarter net sales flat to prior year, which includes the contribution from the additional week and the impact of the Nusa divestiture. Excluding these impacts, organic net sales decreased 3%, mainly driven by declines in Rao's pasta sauces and U.S. soup. Lower sales in Rao's were primarily due to the expected reversal of third quarter favorable customer shipment timing in connection with the integration of Sovos into Campbell's ERP system. Declines in U.S. soup were primarily the result of lower consumption and customer inventory reduction in ready-to-serve soups.\nLower volume and mix of 4% was partially offset by favorable net price realization of 1%. Fourth quarter operating earnings in the division decreased 5%, primarily due to lower gross profit. Operating margin was lower by 100 basis points, which was primarily driven by higher inflation and other supply chain costs, inclusive of a 50-basis-point impact from tariffs. This was partially offset by supply chain productivity improvements, favorable net price realization and the benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nTurning to Slide 26. Snacks reported a 2% increase in net sales, which includes the contribution from the additional week and the impact of the Pop Secret divestiture. Excluding these impacts, organic net sales decreased 2%, driven primarily by lower net sales of third-party partner and contract brands and Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels. Organic net sales were impacted by unfavorable volume and mix of 5% and favorable net price realization of 2%. Snacks Q4 year-over-year organic net sales improved sequentially from Q3 due to improved net price realization.\nSnacks operating earnings in the quarter were comparable to prior year, while operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 14.2%. The margin contraction reflected higher marketing and selling expenses, which offset gains from stronger gross profit and lower administrative and other expenses.\nTurning to Slide 27. We generated $1.13 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal '25, slightly lower than the prior year period, driven by changes in working capital, in part due to tariff mitigation strategies. Capital expenditures were $426 million for the year, 18% lower than prior year. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders with $62 million in share repurchases during the year and $459 million of dividends paid, including a 5% dividend increase that was effective in the third quarter of fiscal '25. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the fiscal year was 3.6x, down from 3.7x at the end of fiscal '24. At the end of the fourth quarter, the company had approximately $132 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.5 billion available under our undrawn revolving credit facility.\nTurning to Slide 28. In fiscal '26, we expect a more significant impact from tariffs. Growth tariffs are projected at approximately 4% of cost of products sold, approximately 60% related to Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, and the remainder largely from global AIFA tariffs. Despite the ongoing uncertainties around the AIFA tariffs, we are still assuming that they remain in place for the year. We expect to mitigate approximately 60% of this impact in fiscal '26 through a number of actions, including continued inventory management, supplier collaboration, alternative sourcing opportunities, productivity and cost savings and where absolutely necessary surgical and responsible pricing actions.\nMoving to Slide 29. We are intensifying our focus on additional cost savings initiatives. If you recall at our Investor Day in September 2024, we announced our $250 million enterprise cost savings program that runs through fiscal '28. We refer to this program as Peak. In fiscal '25, we delivered approximately $145 million of cost savings. The majority of these fiscal '25 savings were driven by accelerated synergies related to our Sovos integration and efficiencies gained through manufacturing and warehouse network optimization initiatives. Today, we are increasing our cost savings target to $375 million by the end of fiscal '28, a 50% increase over the previous estimate. Peak will continue to focus on 4 areas: network optimization, integration synergies, technology and organization effectiveness and indirect spend management.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 30. As Mick mentioned earlier, consumers are making thoughtful food choices, focusing on elevated experiences, labor exploration, prioritizing health and wellness and cooking at home. Our portfolio of brands is well positioned to meet these needs, supported by incremental brand investment and continued innovation. At the same time, we are in a dynamic operating environment resulting in input cost pressures, primarily driven by tariffs, which, despite significant mitigation efforts, are expected to be headwinds to our earnings outlook for the upcoming fiscal year. However, we do expect to make progress towards sustainable growth in fiscal '26 while mitigating some of the near-term cost pressures. With that as context, let me walk you through our guidance for this coming year.\nOur fiscal '26 guidance ranges are presented on a comparable basis, excluding the additional week in fiscal '25 to simplify year-over-year comparisons. Guidance also includes the impact of the divestitures of Nusa and Pop Secret. The divestiture impact is estimated to be a 1% reduction to both reported net sales and adjusted EBIT and dilutive by $0.04 to adjusted EPS in fiscal '26. Full year reported net sales are expected to be down 2% to flat, inclusive of the impact of the divestitures. Full year organic net sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1%, reflecting continued momentum in Meals & Beverages and stabilization in Snacks in the second half of the year at the midpoint of the range, with modest positive net price contribution compared to fiscal '25.\nWe expect adjusted EBIT to decline 9% to 13% and adjusted EPS to be down 12% to 18%, inclusive of the impact of the divestitures. On a comparable 52-week basis, and excluding the divestiture impact, approximately 2/3 of the year-over-year decline in fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS guidance at the midpoint of the range is attributable to the estimated net tariff impact. The remaining 1/3 is driven by year-over-year changes in the base business. Our assumptions in the base business reflect the net sales assumptions I've already touched on increased marketing and selling investment in the range of 9% to 10% of net sales and a normalization of the onetime benefits realized in fiscal '25, including a return to targeted payout levels of incentive compensation expense, which is estimated to be a 3-point headwind to the year-over-year change in adjusted EBIT.\nWe expect full year core inflation, excluding tariffs, to be in the low single-digit range. We are intensifying our focus on productivity with planned initiatives of approximately 5% and of cost of products sold, including tariff mitigation actions, and we expect approximately $70 million of enterprise cost savings.\nMoving to items below EBIT. Full year net interest expense is expected to be between $320 million and $325 million, and our effective tax rate is assumed at 24%. And finally, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 4% of net sales.\nTo wrap up, we believe we are well positioned to navigate the challenges ahead, including mitigating the impacts of tariffs over time, while continuing to capture opportunities for growth. We are taking a balanced, disciplined approach to protect and expand our market-leading positions across both divisions, while maintaining a focus on execution, delivering continued cost savings and driving strong cash flow generation with financial rigor. We believe in the strength of our portfolio and our ability to continue to execute our strategic priorities even in a dynamic environment with the goal to deliver long-term sustainable value creation.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's begin Q&A.",

Mick?\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter earnings performance exceeded expectations, driven by solid contributions from our Meals & Beverages business due to strong in-market performance and a benefit from favorable shipment timing, which we expect to normalize in the fourth quarter. The performance of our Snacks business was mixed this quarter, reflecting continued category softness and an increasingly competitive environment. That said, we have an attractive snacking portfolio with a clear right to win, and we have been refining our plans to improve our in-market performance.\nIn the current dynamic macro environment, consumers are making thoughtful spending decisions, which is materializing in our categories. Consumers continue to cook at home and focus their spending on products that help them stretch their food budgets, and they are increasingly intentional about the discretionary snack purchases. These behaviors supported growth in our Meals & Beverages categories and increased headwinds in our Snacking categories. Collectively, our 16 leadership brands in market performance was in line with overall category consumption, with Meals & Beverages consumption ahead of categories and Snacks behind, driven by heightened competitive pressures.\nGiven our performance year-to-date, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2025 guidance ranges. That said, we now expect adjusted earnings to be at the low end of the guidance range due to the slower-than-anticipated recovery in the Snacks business, consistent with what we said during our last earnings call and given the fluid operating environment, this guidance excludes any impact from the imposition of import tariffs government and potential retaliatory actions taken by other countries as the trade environment remains uncertain.\nWe have separately estimated the fiscal '25 tariff impact, which Carrie will talk through in a few moments. We remain focused on near-term in-market execution and mitigating tariff impact while investing in our brands, leveraging our scale for growth, elevating senior leaders to key roles and advancing critical capabilities for long-term value creation.\nNow let's turn to key highlights from our third quarter results on Slide 6. Organic net sales growth of 1% was driven by volume growth, marking 5 consecutive quarters of flat or positive volume across the enterprise. Organic net sales growth was ahead of in-market consumption driven by timing of shipments, which we expect to normalize in Q4. The organic net sales growth was led by our Meals & Beverages division, which more than outweighed the ongoing pressure in our Snacks business. It's important to note that the Sovos acquisition moved into organic net sales in the middle of the third quarter.\nWe delivered 4% net sales growth, reflecting the aforementioned organic net sales growth and contribution from Rao's during the first half of the third quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased 2% versus prior year, which resulted in a slight margin decrease as lower net pricing realization was only partially offset by spending reductions. Adjusted EPS was down 3% with a net positive EPS contribution from the Sovos acquisition in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7, the in-market contribution of our 16 leadership brands representing approximately 90% of total net sales remained stable in the third quarter, with more than half holding or gaining share. As we mentioned last quarter, we started to see consumer sentiment softening in January. This continued throughout Q3, with consumers making more deliberate choices with their spending on food. The key outcome is a growing preference for home-cooked meals, leading to the highest levels of meals prepared at home since early 2020.\nAdditionally, consumers are favoring ingredients that help stretch tighter food budgets. Both provided a tailwind for our Meals & Beverages business, especially for our condensed cooking soups, broth and Italian sauces. As a result, our Meals & Beverages leadership brands continued to outpace category consumption and grew dollar share by 0.4 points, 6 of our 8 Meals & Beverages leadership brands grew or held share in the third quarter. In total, Meals & Beverages leadership brand consumption increased by 2% in the quarter.\nConversely, the consumer environment was a continued headwind in the quarter for some of our more discretionary categories in Snacks, such as crackers and chips. However, while value is important, consumers favor better-for-you segments and are willing to selectively splurge when the benefits are clearly worth it, as evidenced by the momentum of some of our recent innovation launches.\nIn Snacks, 3 of our 8 leadership brands grew or held share. Pepperidge Farm bakery and cookies brands held share, partially driven by our successful innovation. Snack Factory, with a presence in both the deli and snack aisles now, grew share by almost 0.5 point and our Lance sandwich crackers maintained momentum with the second consecutive quarter of share growth. Given the category trends and aggregate share headwinds, our overall Snacks leadership brand consumption declined by 3% in the quarter.\nWe remain confident in the strength and long-term growth potential of our Snacks brands and the plans we have to stabilize share while navigating the dynamic operating environment.\nLet's take a closer look at each division, beginning with Meals & Beverages on Slide 8. Organic net sales increased 6% for the quarter, led by volume and mix growth of 7%. Specifically, organic net sales increased year-over-year due to consumption growth of 2% and timing of customer shipments in our base business at the end of the quarter as well as Rao's, in connection with the implementation of our existing SAP enterprise resource planning system for Sovos Brands.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our soup portfolio continued its strong performance in Q3, benefiting from the increased at-home cooking trends I mentioned earlier. Campbell's total wet soup grew dollar share by 0.4 points and saw the sixth consecutive quarter of volume share growth driven by household gains, particularly among younger cohorts as they increasingly cook at home.\nThe broth category has grown since 2020 and more recently further accelerated, fueled by the uptick in cooking behavior, making our broth business a continued bright spot within the portfolio. In Q3, we significantly outpaced category consumption and grew dollar share by nearly 3 points in the quarter.\nSwanson saw strong consumption and volume growth and has now gained or held millennial households for 7 consecutive quarters. Our strong performance in the broth category is further emphasized by Pacific's continued double-digit consumption growth. The pace of the private label recovery has been slower than we originally anticipated, though we expect it to continue to recover. Our supply chain team has done an outstanding job of meeting customer demand in the face of private label supply constraints, and we are confident in our ability to continue to do so.\nOur ready-to serve in-market consumption declines were driven by increased competitive promotional intensity and our discontinuation of our Well Yes! brand, Our Chunky, Pacific, Rao's and Homestyle brands all gained share in the quarter. Finally, our condensed portfolio continued its strong performance during the quarter with a sixth consecutive quarter of dollar share growth and increases in both dollar and volume consumption. Our brands outperformed the segment and grew share, partially driven by the successful Mac and Cheese activation.\nIn the current economic environment, we are constantly looking to provide consumers with exciting new options that let them use our products in more versatile ways to cook meals at home. A great example of that is our Mac and Cheese marketing activation. In the third quarter, we introduced a new easy and delicious way to make this household classic. This activation helped drive the 11th consecutive quarter of condensed cooking soup share growth and added approximately 1 million households to Campbell's condensed cooking portfolio, the highest household penetration gains for condensed in any quarter over the past 4 years.\nMore than half of these new buyers were millennials, displaying the brand's growing popularity with this generation. This is a great example of our purpose at work, connecting people through food they love, and demonstrates the growth we can unlock by continuing to highlight the versatility of our condensed soups in making delicious, affordable and stretchable meals.\nYear-over-year, the Italian sauce category grew roughly 2 points in Q3 and was relatively stable to Q2. Prego trailed dollar consumption for Q3, largely due to a shift in the timing of promotional activity. However, on a Q3 year-to-date basis, Prego consumption was more in line with the Italian sauce category and well ahead on share when excluding the ultra distinctive segment.\nRao's dollar consumption growth in Q3 was in line with the overall category but underperformed our initial expectations. The main drivers of the lower-than-expected Rao's sauce growth in Q3 can be attributed to a couple of points of headwind from certain prior year promotional events we decided not to repeat this quarter because they were below our premium price guardrails, combined with slightly increased consumer spending sensitivity and increased competitive promotional activity.\nThat said, the Rao's brand remains strong, and we still have significant opportunities to increase distribution, household penetration and awareness of Rao's when comparing it to Prego. While we have made considerable progress growing the brand since acquiring it last year, there is still a significant opportunity ahead. We have a history of category growth and leadership and believe that the distinctive premium nature of Rao's sauces will allow us to continue that success. Rao's sauce is reaching a point of maturity on core distribution, so we're investing in other levers to sustain growth, including marketing, focused on highlighting the Italian origin of Rao's ingredients, continued innovation and sharpened sales execution.\nNow let's turn to our Snacks business on Slide 13. In the third quarter, the pressure on Snacking categories increased sequentially, which combined with heightened competitive activity, resulted in year-over-year 3% lower in market consumption. Organic net sales declined by 5%, driven by lower volume and mix. The bulk of the 2-point variance to consumption was driven by partner / contract brands as we continue to reshape our portfolio to focus more on our differentiated leadership brands.\nTurning to Slide 14. You can see how our Snacks portfolio performed relative to each respective Snacking category and key brand specific action plans to navigate the current landscape. In bakery and cookies, we outperformed category consumption through sustained momentum in Pepperidge Farm Fresh bakery and cookies, resulting in stable in market consumption. Coming off a successful winter holiday, we elevated innovation and unlocked growth by giving consumers the indulgences they are looking for.\nIn pretzels, consumption grew in the quarter in the salty aisle, although at lower levels than the broader category. We are meeting consumer needs through 2 distinct brands: Snyder's of Hanover for pretzel traditionalist and Snack Factory, which reimagines pretzels. On Snyder's of Hanover, we continue to proactively manage our assortment to higher-performing items and invest in expanding convenient portion-controlled packs, but this was not enough to offset the category competitive pressures.\nWith Snack Factory, we are pleased with the results of its expansion into the salty snack hour, including the successful launch of Pop'ums and Bites, which have garnered strong repeat purchases. We expect this momentum to fuel consumption for our pretzels portfolio.\nIn crackers, reduced overall consumer sentiment has put pressure on the category. The outsized consumption decline for our business was partially driven by lapping the significantly supported Goldfish crisps launch in the prior year, which peaked in Q3. While there were bright spots within Goldfish, especially related to the Harry Potter Butterbeer limited time offering, we have more work to do to reinvigorate this brand and get it back on its historical growth trajectory. We plan to focus on core relevancy through marketing support, strategic promotional activity and a critical back-to-school season.\nFinally, our chips portfolio is well positioned, but continues to face strong competitive pressures. We have seen positive consumer and customer response to our product innovation and have increased household penetration through some of our better-for-you offerings such as Kettle Brand Avocado Oil and Air Fried options. And while in-market consumption fell short of our expectations compared to the narrower kettle cooked chips segment, it was in line with the broader chip category. We have specific plans to drive incremental volume growth through optimized distribution, promotion and continued limited edition innovation ahead of the all-important summer chip season.\nMoving to Slide 15. We are pleased to share the latest results in our efforts to reignite Pepperidge Farm, one of our billion-dollar brands. In Q3, our Pepperidge Farm Bakery business delivered the highest volume and dollar share growth in 9 quarters, driven by the Farmhouse Brioche platform. This platform now includes delicious items in Sandwich Bread, Buns & Rolls and Swirl breakfast bread.\nGrowth in our Pepperidge Farm Cookies business is coming from Milano cookies, which had the strongest household penetration gains in 9 quarters in Q3, driven by the Milano White Chocolate platform launch. This has helped fuel the core Milano brands, attract a younger demographic, maintain its trajectory coming out of the winter holiday and resulted in strong dollar and volume growth. Other Milano innovation included the on-trend limited edition Caramel Cafe au Lait and the return to the popular London Fog variety. We are excited about the recent results and additional upcoming opportunities to innovate and provide consumers with the touch of premium indulgence that they seek from our bakery and cookies portfolio.\nBefore I turn it over to Carrie, I wanted to thank the entire Campbell's team for their focus on delivering solid Q3 results in such a dynamic operating environment. Our Meals & Beverages division had strong in-market performance fueled by growing consumer demand for home cooking. Our Snacks results were mixed as consumers are being more intentional with discretionary dollars and the categories are increasingly competitive. We recognize that we need to continue to sharpen our execution to win in the marketplace and drive future growth.\nAs we look to the fourth quarter, we will continue to navigate the current environment and stay focused on near-term in-market execution while we actively work to mitigate as much of the potential direct impact of tariffs as possible. These dynamics are also pushing us to focus on what matters most to our customers and consumers and invest in the capabilities that will position us for long-term growth. We are building a stronger foundation for the future by improving our efficiency and effectiveness across the organization to facilitate growth.\nWith the creation of the growth office supporting both divisions, we are taking advantage of our scale while we elevate the focus on growth across the organization. The growth office will elevate capabilities within consumer insights, brand activation, innovation and revenue growth management. Additionally, we have hired a Chief Digital and Technology Officer to accelerate digital tools and capabilities to improve our efficiency and effectiveness.\nFinally, we remain focused on identifying incremental productivity and cost savings opportunities to create more fuel to invest in our brands. All told, our focus remains firmly on disciplined short-term execution as we lay the groundwork for consistent, sustainable growth.\nLet me turn it over to Carrie to go over the Q3 results in more detail.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mick, and good morning, everyone. As Mick said earlier, our third quarter performance exceeded our expectations. The overperformance in the quarter was primarily attributable to our Meals & Beverages division, which benefited from timing of customer inventory orders.\nReported net sales increased 4%, driven by the sales contribution from Sovos brands. Organic net sales, excluding the impact of currency, the Pop Secret and noosa divestitures and approximately half a quarter of Sovos increased 1% as overdelivery in Meals & Beverages more than offset continued pressures in our snacks business. As a reminder, Sovos moved into organic growth mid-quarter as we lapped the anniversary date of the acquisition on March 12, 2024.\nAdjusted EBIT increased 2%, primarily due to the contribution from the acquisition, offsetting lower base business performance. Adjusted EBIT margin was down 30 basis points with limited impact from tariffs. Adjusted EPS exceeded our expectations at $0.73, down 3% from the prior year. The impact of the acquisition was accretive to adjusted EPS in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 19. As mentioned earlier, organic net sales for the third quarter were up 1% due to favorable volume and mix, partially offset by planned lower net price realization. The favorable volume and mix component was attributable to both Sovos as well as over delivery within our base Meals & Beverages business, which I'll discuss more in a moment. Reported net sales in the quarter of 4% reflected a 4-point net contribution from acquisitions and divestitures, which included 6 points from the Sovos acquisition and negative 2 points from the Pop Secret and noosa divestitures.\nOn Slide 20, third quarter adjusted gross profit margin declined 110 basis points with margin in the base business down 100 basis points and a negative 10 basis point impact related to the acquisition. Base business margins were impacted by approximately 80 basis points of net price investment and 20 basis points of other cost headwinds as inflation and other supply chain costs were largely mitigated by productivity improvements, cost savings and favorable volume and mix. As mentioned earlier, the direct tariff impact to the business was not material in the quarter.\nAs of the end of the third quarter, we delivered approximately $110 million of total savings under the $250 million cost savings program announced at our Investor Day in September of 2024, of which approximately 30% were realized in cost of products sold.\nTurning to Slide 21. The total combined dollar spend on adjusted marketing and selling expenses and admin expenses increased slightly compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the integration of Sovos. However, these combined expenses improved as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior year.\nWithin adjusted marketing and selling expenses, advertising and consumer promotion expense increased 3%, primarily reflecting the acquisition of Sovos. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased 4%, mainly driven by the benefits from cost savings initiatives. These savings include the benefits of the integration of Sovos, which continues to exceed expectations. As of the beginning of the fourth quarter, we have now transitioned the Sovos business into our Campbell's ERP system, which will unlock additional back-office savings in IT, finance and order management into fiscal '26.\nAs shown on Slide 22, third quarter adjusted EBIT increased 2%, primarily due to lower adjusted administrative R&D and other expenses along with higher adjusted gross profit, which were partially offset by an increase in adjusted marketing and selling expenses.\nOn Slide 23, adjusted EPS decreased 3% to $0.73 as adjusted EBIT growth was more than offset by higher adjusted interest expense primarily due to higher levels of debt and higher average interest rates on the overall debt portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, the Sovos acquisition was accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 24. Meals & Beverages reported a 15% increase in net sales growth, including the contribution of the acquisition and net of the divestiture impact of noosa that was completed earlier this calendar year on February 24. Organic net sales increased 6% compared to the prior year, driven by favorable volume and mix of 7% in U.S. soup, Rao's and Canada, partially offset by a 1 point lower net price realization. Approximately 1/3 of the organic growth was attributable to growth in condensed, broth and ready-to-serve soups and Rao's sauces, which benefited from the continued shift to at-home meals that Mick mentioned earlier. The remaining growth was related to the timing of customer shipments at the end of the quarter in our base business as well as in Rao's in connection with the integration of Sovos into Campbell's ERP system. We expect inventory orders to normalize in the fourth quarter.\nThird quarter operating earnings in the division increased 8%, primarily due to the benefits of the acquisition, partially offset by a decline in the base business. Meals & Beverages operating margin was lower by 100 basis points, which was primarily driven by lower realized net price and in part due to the mix impact of the Sovos acquisition not being included in our base for half the quarter. The remaining cost headwinds, including higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs were offset by favorable volume and mix, productivity and cost savings as well as reduced marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales.\nTurning to Slide 25. Snacks reported an 8% decrease in net sales. Excluding the impact of the Pop Secret divestiture, organic net sales decreased 5%, driven primarily by lower net sales in Goldfish crackers, third-party partner and contract brands and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels. As a reminder, we lapped the launch of Goldfish Crisps in the prior year. In addition, net sales were also lower in Late July snacks due to a promotional shift versus prior year, and Lance sandwich crackers as we lapped a pipeline fill in the prior year due to a change in pack sizes.\nSnacks organic net sales were impacted by unfavorable volume and mix of 5% and neutral net price realization. Snacks operating earnings in the quarter declined 13% due to lower gross profit as the impact of lower volume and mix, inflation and other supply chain costs were only partially offset by supply chain productivity, benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower administrative expenses. Q3 operating margin for Snacks decreased 90 basis points to 14.3%, mainly driven by higher selling expenses as a percent of net sales and lower gross profit. Notably, Snacks operating margin sequentially improved 300 basis points compared to Q2, driven by an improvement in supply chain cost as expected.\nTurning to Slide 26. We generated $872 million in operating cash flow year-to-date, slightly lower than the prior year period, driven by changes in working capital. Capital expenditures were $296 million year-to-date and reflect investments in chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business, network optimization for our Meals & Beverages business and enhancements to business capabilities.\nWe remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders with $343 million of dividends paid reflecting a 5% increase in the third quarter and $60 million in anti-dilutive share repurchases year-to-date. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter was 3.6x, a slight improvement from our ratio at the end of the second quarter as we continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet towards our goal of 3x net leverage. At the end of the third quarter, the company had approximately $143 million in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $1.5 billion available under our undrawn revolving credit facility.\nOur full year fiscal 2025 guidance provided on March 5, 2025 remains unchanged, excluding the impact of tariffs. Adjusted earnings are expected at the low end of the guidance range due to the slower-than-anticipated recovery in the Snacks business. We have estimated the net incremental headwind of tariff-related costs to be up to $0.03 to $0.05 per share to fiscal '25 adjusted EPS. This is not factored into our fiscal '25 guidance as the trade environment remains uncertain. This estimate reflects our assumption that the current tariff actions stay in place and incorporates the proactive steps we're taking to minimize the overall impact, including strategic inventory management, working in close partnership with our suppliers, pursuing alternative sourcing and product cost optimization and where absolutely necessary, consideration of surgical pricing actions.\nTo finish out the discussion of fiscal '25 guidance, as a reminder, fiscal '25 comprises 53 weeks, 1 additional week compared to fiscal '24. The benefit of the 53rd week is included in our fiscal '25 guidance and is estimated to be worth approximately 2 points of growth to reported net sales and adjusted EBIT along with approximately $0.05 of adjusted EPS. Although we expect an increase in core inflation in the second half as compared to the prior year and a sequential increase from the first half, we expect core inflation for the full fiscal year to remain in the low single-digit range and to be mitigated by productivity improvements and higher expected cost savings.\nWe are increasing our cost savings expectation for the full year from $120 million to $130 million as a result of our continued strong year-to-date performance. This includes savings from the integration of Sovos and several previously discussed network optimization projects across both divisions. Capital expenditures for fiscal '25 are expected to be approximately 4.5% of net sales compared to our prior guidance of 4.7% due to timing of expenditures.\nTo wrap up, our Q3 performance exceeded our expectations, driven by over delivery by the Meals & Beverages division. And while we are not satisfied with the results of our Snacks division, we remain confident in the strength of our Snacks portfolio and continue to take steps to regain our momentum. We remain focused on delivering high-quality, high-value food that consumers trust, while advancing our productivity and cost savings initiatives. Our long-standing supply chain excellence and scale position us to effectively navigate a dynamic operating environment. We're committed to driving long-term growth and maintaining capital discipline to deliver value to our shareholders.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to turn the call over to Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell's. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Second Quarter Fiscal '25 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Campbell's Chief Investor Relations Officer. Joining me today are Mick Beekhuizen, Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, thecampbellscompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nSlide 2 outlines today's agenda. Mick will provide insights into our second quarter performance as well as our end market performance by division. Please recall that effective first quarter fiscal '25, we are using Circana MULO+ in-market data. Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the full fiscal year '25.\nAs we noted in this morning's press release, the company's guidance does not reflect any impact from the imposition of import tariffs by the U.S. and potential retaliatory actions taken by other countries as the tariff and trade environments are rapidly evolving at this time.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation.\nAnd now, it is my pleasure to turn it over to Mick Beekhuizen, our new Chief Executive Officer. Mick?\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone. Before I review our Q2 results, I want to start by expressing how honored and energized I am to lead the Campbell's team as CEO and accelerate the strategy that has been fueling our performance. Having helped shape Campbell's strategy since joining the company in 2019, most recently as President in our Meals & Beverages division, I'm committed to building upon the strong foundation we have in place.\nThat starts with our talented people who are engaged, accountable and committed to winning. We have the best portfolio in the industry with category-leading brands in both divisions. These brands are important to our customers and highly relevant to our consumers. I am confident that we are well prepared to deliver top-tier formats.\nSimilar to the first quarter, our Q2 earnings performance was in line with our expectations despite the dynamic operating environment. Unfortunately, the anticipated recovery of some of our snacks categories did not materialize during the quarter. And as a result, our top line was slightly below expectations.\nWe continued to invest behind our brands, resulting in good overall in-market results with an aggregate stable market share. 10 out of our 16 leadership brands grew or held share in the quarter, a testament of the overall strength of our leadership brand portfolio.\nGoing into the second half of the year, we are focused on maintaining the momentum within our Meals & Beverages division; while in our Snacks division, we are focused on successful innovation, select brand support and price-pack architecture to meet consumer needs.\nFrom an operational perspective, we continued to make substantial progress on the Sovos integration and advanced various cost savings initiatives throughout the organization.\nOn the flip side, our Snacks margin fell short of our expectations, driven by unfavorable mix and some operational headwinds in our fresh bakery business during the important holiday period. We are actively addressing both areas, and, combined with a normalization of our commercial support, we expect our Snacks margin to improve sequentially throughout the second half of the fiscal year.\nAs reported in our press release this morning, we updated our full year guidance to reflect the slower-than-anticipated recovery of our snacking categories, impacting the outlook for our second half. We are committed to investing in our brand portfolio, while accelerating certain cost savings initiatives to manage through the current consumer environment.\nWe expect organic net sales to be in the range of down 2% to flat, adjusted EBIT of plus 3% to plus 5% and an adjusted EPS range of $2.95 to $3.05. Carrie will provide more details in a moment.\nThis updated guidance does not reflect any impact on our business from tariffs or other regulatory changes. This is a fluid situation, and we are working through mitigation plans for a variety of scenarios.\nOverall, we have work to do, but I feel confident in our plans for the second half. We have a strong brand portfolio supported by great talent that's focused on delivering results by partnering with our customers and meeting consumer needs.\nNow let's turn to key highlights of our second quarter results. Turning to Slide 6. We delivered 9% growth in net sales, reflecting the contribution from Sovos. Organic net sales were down 2% driven by relatively consistent performance within Meals & Beverages and weaker-than-anticipated snacking categories amid a competitive environment.\nImportantly, volumes in the second quarter remained flat, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of flat or increasing volume for the total enterprise. Adjusted EBIT increased 2% versus prior year and adjusted EPS was $0.74. The Sovos acquisition was slightly accretive to adjusted EPS in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7. In Q2, we saw stable performance with total company leadership brands flat on consumption, while the majority grew or held share. As a reminder, our leadership brands represent approximately 90% of our enterprise net sales.\nOur Meals & Beverages leadership brands continued to demonstrate their strength with dollar consumption up 1%. 7 of 8 leadership brands grew or held share in the second quarter. And although Swanson broth consumption continued to grow during the quarter, the modest share decline was driven by the anticipated private label recovery.\nIn Snacks, we made progress versus Q1 from a share perspective in a couple of key areas, such as Pepperidge Farm cookies, and, although still down year-over-year, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels. Similar to the first quarter, total Snacks consumption for our leadership brands was down about 1%. We have a strong differentiated portfolio of brands within our Snacks division, and while we need to continue to evolve with the consumer, they provide the strong foundation for long-term growth.\nAs shown on the next page, consumers continue to turn to some of our key brands during the holidays, driven by strong in-market support, including our successful sides season cooking and holiday cookie campaigns. Although dollar consumption for our holiday-focused brand was flat during the period, the dollar share increased by 30 basis points.\nSpecifically, our Campbell's condensed cooking products had a successful holiday season, growing both dollar and volume share as well as volume consumption. The broth category was a top 3 driver of food growth during the holiday period, and Swanson and Pacific broth grew consumption, with share declines driven by the anticipated private label recovery.\nAs planned, we made significant investments in our Snacks brands to drive loyalty and win this important period. While both the bakery and cookie categories were soft, pepperidge Farm, 1 of our 3 billion-dollar brands, delivered strong holiday performance, outperforming categories via innovation and best-in-class execution across both cookies and stuffing.\nTurning to our Meals & Bridges division on Slide 9. Organic net sales declined 1% for the quarter, with continued volume and mix growth of 1%, which was consistent with the first quarter. On a pro forma basis, with the addition of Sovos Brands, Meals and Beverages' organic net sales were flat, with in-market dollar consumption increasing 1%.\nDuring second quarter, we experienced a supplier disruption related to SpaghettiOs, which contributed a 1-point decline to organic net sales.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our soup portfolio continues to benefit from increased at-home cooking activity, leading to growth in both condensed cooking and broth. However, eating soup categories, both within condensed eating and ready-to-serve, was slightly weaker. That being said, we marked our fifth consecutive quarter of volume share growth in Campbell's total wet soup, including Rao's.\nCampbell's condensed segment maintained its positive trajectory, continuing to gain share driven by strong performance of our cooking portfolio used in meal prep, especially during lay season, and strong household penetration growth.\nWe have a broad and strong RTS portfolio with Chunky, Pacific and Rao's, all of which performed well in the quarter, gaining or holding share. This was offset by pressure in our RTS convenience portfolio and about a point of share headwind related to the delisting of our Well Yes brand.\nIn broth, we benefited from continued category growth, particularly as private label has not yet fully recovered. We expect private label to continue to recover throughout the remainder of the year, resulting in slight share pressure in the second half. However, if category growth continues and private label recovery remains slow, we are well positioned to meet increasing consumer demand with the strength of our supply chain network.\nWith the #1 and #2 leaders, Campbell's total Italian sauce portfolio, shown on Slide 11, outpaced the category in Q2, with dollar consumption of plus 5% and a share gain of 1.4 points. With Prego and Rao's, we have 2 of the best-positioned brands in Italian sauce, both of which are performing well against their roles in our portfolio.\nStarting with Prego, we saw steady growth both in dollars and volume consumption, and we grew dollar share by 20 basis points in the second quarter. Prego grew household penetration in the second quarter year-over-year with growth across all generational cohorts.\nOur ultra-distinctive Rao's sauce continued to outpace the Italian sauce category resulting in 1.3 points of share gain in the quarter. First quarter of fiscal '25 benefited from a shift in promotional timing, specifically in the club channel. On a first half basis, consumption increased by 11% and share was up 1.5 share points. The strong performance reinforces the strategic rationale for the acquisition and is a proof point of the successful inpatient of Sovos.\nTurning to Slide 12. Rao's sauce delivered high single-digit net sales growth in the second quarter and low teens growth for the first half. We continue to expect pro forma year-over-year growth in fiscal '25 to be slightly above 10%. Over the long term, consistent with what we shared at Investor Day, we expect Rao's to grow in the mid-single to high single-digit range.\nRao's brand equity remains exceptionally strong in terms of key metrics: awareness, household penetration, repeat and loyalty. What's particularly exciting is the substantial runway for expansion. Despite leading the ultra-distinctive Italian sauce category in dollar share, Rao's currently reaches only half as many households as our Prego brand and maintains just 60% of Prego's product assortment.\nWe're accelerating Rao's brand awareness initiatives and expanding our innovation pipeline, having launched 10 new sauce products in the last year. You may have seen the latest activation, which brings consumers along the Rao's Homemade journey, to experience what makes each jar of Rao's so special and is a major point of difference from our competitors in the ultra-distinctive space.\nMillennial household adoption continue to surge at more than twice the category pace, reinforcing our conviction in Rao's long-term growth. Compelling value proposition of Rao's compared to mainstream Italian takeout continues to fuel incremental growth, allowing the brand to source volume from a significantly larger addressable market across a broad range of consumer income levels.\nWith our strategic growth initiatives firmly in place, we remain confident in Rao's becoming our next $1 billion brand.\nNow let's turn to our Snacks portfolio. As previously mentioned, we delivered some encouraging in-market progress in key brands, particularly during the holidays. However, the anticipated category recovery did not materialize, resulting in organic net sales decline of 3%. About half of that came from our planned reduction in partner and contract brands.\nA key driver for overall performance was the 1% decline in consumption of leadership brands, which was consistent with our performance in Q1. Although Carrie will go through the details in a moment, I would like to talk about our Snacks margin for a minute.\nThe volume for our Snacks business was down 370 basis points year-over-year, about half was driven by a planned increase in commercial investment to support incremental promotional activity and marketing during the holiday season. The remainder was for short-term operational supply chain headwinds, particularly in our fresh bakery network, that resulted in increased manufacturing and logistics costs to maintain service levels during the holidays and unfavorable mix.\nWe are proactively addressing Snacks margin and anticipate a recovery in Q3, with a gradual improvement throughout the second half of fiscal year. In fact, we are starting to lap more normalized promotional and marketing activity and are already seeing improvements from a supply chain perspective.\nOur Pepperidge Farm bakery business continued its in-market momentum from previous quarters as we maintained our overall share position. Additionally, we made sequential share progress on our Pepperidge Farm cookies business, driven by the holiday activation.\nWithin the deli aisle, Snack Factory held share despite category headwinds. We continue to be excited about Snack Factory expanding into the snack aisle with Pop'ums and Bites, our unique munchable and big flavor innovations that will now sit alongside Snyder's of Hanover distinct platforms.\nIn salty snacks, our brands hold leading positions in attractive segments that are growing much faster than the total chips categories. Although new entrants and stepped-up promotions are putting pressure on shares, we have plans in place to continue to strengthen our position.\nIn crackers, Lance continue to expand share and grow consumption. Within Goldfish, we experienced weaker category permits and increased competitive promotional activity. Going into second half of this fiscal year, we have integrated plans in place to support our Goldfish brand, with a focus on innovation, marketing support and price-pack architecture initiatives.\nOur snacking categories are attractive and resilient, and we are well positioned with an advantaged portfolio of relevant leadership brands. We have confidence in the action plans we have in place to improve our in-market performance and build momentum in the second half of the year, starting with a robust innovation pipeline to deliver against consumer market trends, including better-for-you choices with products like Kettle Brand chips made with avocado oil.\nWe're driving innovation and differentiation with new Goldfish LTOs, such as Harry Potter Butterbeer Grahams, and other differentiated flavors. We are also strategically expanding accessibility and enhanced value across our Snacks portfolio by introducing new pack sizes and price points that provide consumers more choices for their favorite snaps, from Pepperidge Farm Chessman and Mini-Nantucket cookies in single-serve multipacks to Goldfish and small-size packs, offering an attractive opening price point.\nOverall, I'm excited about the opportunities within our Snacks portfolio.\nBefore I turn it over to Carrie, I want to highlight our core focus areas as we move into the second half of fiscal '25. We plan to continue to support the long-term growth of our 16 leadership brands through highly relevant, compelling innovation and marketing to drive excitement awareness and volume.\nIn our Snacks division, we continue to stay focused on navigating consumer and competitive category dynamics. Specifically, in the second half, we are focused on select brand support, successful innovation launches and some price-pack architecture to stabilize our top line by the fourth quarter, while we sequentially improve our snacks margin.\nIn Meals & Beverages, we're focused on maintaining the at-home cooking momentum throughout our portfolio, which includes managing our broad business as we expect private label supply to continue to recover. Additionally, we are focused on sustaining Rao's growth by driving brand awareness and innovation while we complete the integration.\nAcross the company, we are intensifying our efforts to improve efficiency and effectiveness to support top line growth and maintain a healthy margin profile. As mentioned, addressing margin performance in our Snacks division is a top priority.\nFinally, we remain stedfast in our disciplined capital allocation strategy, ensuring we balance growth investments with shareholder returns as we navigate the dynamic consumer environment.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Carrie to go over the Q2 results and our updated guidance in more detail.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mick, and good morning, everyone.\nOur second quarter adjusted EPS was in line with our expectations despite the dynamic operating environment discussed earlier. And while the anticipated recovery of snacks categories did not materialize to the extent we expected, and this translated into a softer top line with some added pressure on adjusted gross margin, our adjusted EBIT was in line with our expectations as well.\nReported net sales increased 9%, driven by the strong sales contribution from Sovos. Organic net sales, excluding the impact of the Sovos acquisition, the Pop Secret divestiture and currency, decreased 2%. Adjusted EBIT increased 2% due to the contribution from the acquisition, while adjusted EPS declined 8% to $0.74 due to higher interest expense from higher debt levels. The impact of the acquisition was slightly accretive to adjusted EPS in the quarter, which continued to exceed our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 19. As mentioned earlier, organic net sales for the second quarter were down 2% due to planned net price investment of 2% in support of the holiday season, with flat volume and mix. Sovos has contributed 13 percentage points to reported net sales growth.\nOn Slide 20, second core adjusted gross profit margin declined 100 basis points, with margin in the base business down 60 basis points and a 40 basis point impact related to the acquisition. Base business margins were impacted by cost inflation and other supply chain costs and unfavorable net price relation, partially mitigated by productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives.\nThe second quarter, we delivered approximately $65 million of total savings under the $250 million cost savings program announced at our Investor Day in September 2024.\nTurning to Slide 21. The total combined dollar spent on adjusted marketing and selling expenses and admin expenses increased compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting the integration of Sovos. However, these combined expenses remained flat as a percentage of net sales to the prior year.\nWithin adjusted marketing and selling expenses, advertising and consumer promotions increased 25%. Adjusted administrative expense increased 2%, driven by the benefits from cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition.\nAs shown on Slide 22, second quarter adjusted EBIT increased 2%, primarily due to higher adjusted gross profit, partially offset by an increase in adjusted marketing and selling expenses. On Slide 23, adjusted EPS decreased 8% to $0.74, as adjusted EBIT growth was more than offset by higher interest expense primarily related to the acquisition.\nTurning to Slide 24. Meals & Beverages reported a 21% increase in net sales growth due to the contribution of acquisition. Organic net sales declined 1% compared to prior year. With a planned 2% investment in net realized price to support incremental promotional activity during the important holiday period, soup season and innovation launches, and favorable volume and mix of 1%.\nSecond quarter operating earnings in the division increased 18%, primarily due to the benefits of the acquisition, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses in the base business. Q2 operating margin for Meals & Beverages decreased 60 basis points to 17.3%, driven primarily by the impact of the acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, operating margin in the base business was essentially flat year-over-year, as increased marketing investment was largely offset by higher adjusted gross profit margin and lower adjusted administrative and R&D expenses.\nSecond quarter organic net sales in snacks decreased 3%, driven primarily by declines in third-party partner and contract brands, Goldfish crackers and Snyder's of Hanover pretzels. Sales were impacted by lower net price realization of 1% and volume and mix declines of 2%. About half of the sales declines were the result of lower third-party partner and contract brand sales.\nSnacks operating earnings in the quarter declined 29% due to higher marketing and selling investments and lower gross profit, as the impact of inflation and other supply chain costs, unfavorable volume and mix, and lower net price realization were only partially offset by supply chain productivity and benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nQ2 operating margin for Snacks increased 370 basis points to 11.3%. Roughly half of the margin decline compared to the prior year was driven by planned increased promotional and marketing investments to support our brands during the critical holiday season. The other half resulted from increased supply chain cost, which Mick mentioned earlier, primarily in our fresh bakery network as well as unfavorable mix.\nAlthough we continue to advance our cost savings and productivity initiatives, these were not sufficient to offset these headwinds. We do anticipate Snacks margins to improve sequentially throughout Q3 and Q4 as compared to Q2.\nSupply chain costs already shown improvement since the beginning of the calendar year. Marketing spend as a percentage of sales is expected to decrease post the holiday period, and we will have easier net price comparisons and expect a more favorable mix, particularly in Q4. Additionally, we are focused on driving SG&A efficiencies to further support margin going forward.\nTurning to Slide 26. We generated $737 million in operating cash flow in the second quarter year-to-date, 8% increase from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $211 million year-to-date and reflect investments to support growth, asset sustainability and initiatives to drive productivity, cost savings and enhanced business capabilities.\nWe also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders, with $227 million of dividends paid and $56 million in anti-dilutive share repurchases year-to-date.\nOur net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was 3.7x, reflecting the financing of the Sovos acquisition, which is similar to our ratio at the end of the first quarter. We remain committed to investment-grade ratings and our goal is to return to our 3x net leverage target in fiscal '27.\nAt the end of the second quarter, the company had approximately $829 million in cash and cash equivalents, and approximately $1.85 billion available under our revolving credit facility.\nBased on year-to-date performance and the slower-than-anticipated recovery in some snacking categories, we are updating our full year fiscal 2025 guidance. Our updated guidance also reflects the divestiture of noosa, which was completed on February 24. As Mick mentioned earlier, our guidance does not incorporate the impact that may result from tariffs or other regulatory matters.\nWe are now expecting full year reported net sales to increase approximately 6% to 8%, which includes a 1 point impact from the noosa divestiture. Full year organic net sales is expected in the range of down 2% to flat, excluding the 53rd week. The lower organic net sales expectation is a result of a more muted volume mix contribution in the second half following the weaker-than-anticipated recovery in snacking categories in the second quarter.\nAs a reminder, Sovos moves into organic growth in mid-Q3, and our base Meals & Beverages business will be cycling the broth net sales benefit in fiscal 2024, resulting from private label supply constraints. We expect adjusted EBIT growth of 3% to 5%, inclusive of the impact of the divestiture of noosa.\nWhile the slower recovery in snacking categories has translated into lower top line for the full year, we are driving a digital momentum in our enterprise cost savings initiatives to help mitigate some of this pressure on earnings and margin.\nAs a result of our strong year-to-date performance, we are increasing our cost savings expectations for the full year from $90 million to $120 million. This includes savings from the integration of Sovos and several pre-discussed network optimization projects across both divisions. Combined, our cost savings program and our planned 3% productivity initiatives are expected to more than offset inflation, which we anticipate to remain in the low single-digit range.\nAdditionally, we expect adjusted marketing and selling expense for the full year and second half to be at the lower end of our targeted range of 9% to 10% of net sales. Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in a range of $2.95 to $3.05, inclusive of the $0.01 dilutive impact of the divestiture of noosa.\nFull year net interest expense is expected to be between $325 million to $330 million, reflecting the benefit of the after-tax proceeds from the noosa divestiture, which will be used to reduce debt. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we expect second half organic net sales growth to sequentially improve from Q2, turning positive in the fourth quarter. And we would expect second half adjusted EPS to be more equal distributed, excluding the 53rd week.\nFinally, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 4.7% of net sales, a slight change to reflect cash timing.\nTo wrap up, we believe in the strength of our portfolio and our ability to continue to execute our strategic priorities. Looking ahead, we are focused on the elements within our control. We are committed to a balanced, disciplined approach to protect and expand our market-leading positions across both divisions, while maintaining operational excellence and delivering continued cost savings.\nWe have a flexible balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and financial discipline. We have proven our resiliency navigate challenging environments, and I'm confident in our team's ability to deliver our second half plans, while exiting our road map for long-term sustainable value creation.\nBefore turning it over to the operator, I'll close by thanking the entire Campbell's team for their hard work and contributions, particularly as we maneuver through this dynamic environment.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell's. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the Campbell's Company First Quarter Fiscal '25 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Campbell's Chief Investor Relations Officer. And joining me today are Mark Clouse, Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer. Today's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The prepared remarks, the slide deck and earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, thecampbellscompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nSlide 2 outlines today's agenda. Mark will provide insights into our first quarter performance as well as our in-market performance by division. Please note, effective first quarter fiscal '25 and going forward, we are using Circana MULO+ for end market data. Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the full fiscal year '25, which we reaffirmed last night.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\nBecause we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation. Before I turn it over to Mark, one last time, I wanted to personally thank you, Mark, for your extraordinary leadership and unwavering commitment to excellence.\nAnd now with that, Mark, .\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nBefore we review our results, I want to take a moment to address last night's announcement of my plans to retire from Campbell's and transition with the incoming CEO over the next 2 months. I'd like to congratulate Mick Beekhuizen on becoming the 15th CEO in Campbell's 155-year history. The Board and I have full confidence in his readiness to lead this great team and company.\nAs I prepare to step back, Campbell's could not be better positioned for the future. I believe that Campbell's has the top leadership team in the business. They are experienced, engaged and fully committed to setting the standard for performance. Together, we've built the best portfolio in all of food and transformed the company. This enables me to make this decision with the utmost confidence in the company's trajectory going forward. With our strategy firmly rooted and our team highly engaged and aligned, I'm certain that Campbell's future is bright.\nLeaving Campbell's was not an easy choice. Since I was a boy, sports have played a very important part of my life, and the idea of working in the world of sports and in particular, the NFL has been a lifelong goal. It is truly a once-in-a-lifetime moment to become the team President of the Washington Commanders. I'm incredibly grateful to Josh Harris and the Washington Commander's ownership group for the opportunity to lead this iconic franchise into a new chapter of growth.\nI look forward to supporting ownership and the entire Commanders team and doing everything in our power to build a championship caliber organization. These last 6 years have been an incredible privilege and honor as well as the most rewarding professional experience in my nearly 30 years of working in the food industry. Without question, what made it so special is the entire Campbell's team seeing their passion and commitment day in and day out was a great source of inspiration for me through what proved to be an incredible journey. I'd also like to thank the Campbell's Board of Directors and investors for their trust and support over these last 6 years.\nNow let's turn to Campbell's first quarter results. We began fiscal '25 with the first quarter generally in line with our expectations with net sales up 10%, reflecting the momentum that Sovos added to our top line performance. Organic net sales were down 1%, reflecting a continued dynamic consumer environment and some impact due to movements in retailer inventory levels, influenced by the later timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year.\nWe delivered 6% year-over-year growth in adjusted EBIT and an adjusted EPS of $0.89. Excluding Sovos, end-market performance was flat, in line with expectations with the difference between our organic net sales and in-market consumption explained by the later Thanksgiving holiday that I mentioned earlier for meals and beverages and lower partner brands net sales in Snacks.\nImportantly, our 16 leadership brands showed growth in both dollar consumption and share in the quarter, including Sovos on a pro forma basis, in-market dollar consumption was positive 2%. The team continues to do an excellent job navigating the complex environment while delivering strong productivity, cost savings and remaining ahead of our plans on the integration of the Sovos business. We reaffirmed our fiscal '25 guidance, which reflects our expectation of steady progress and incorporates an appropriate level of pragmatism. The upcoming second quarter, which includes the critical holiday season will serve as an important milestone for progress in delivering our full year commitments.\nWe expect sequential top line and market share momentum in Q2 with continuing progression into the second half of our fiscal year. Carrie will provide more details on guidance in a moment.\nOn Slide 6, I want to briefly expand upon the material benefit we are experiencing with the integration of Sovos. While our Q1 organic net sales declined 1% from the prior year with flat volume and mix, when including the pro forma contribution from Sovos, total company net sales would have been flat to the prior year with positive volume and mix. The growth of Sovos and specifically the Rao’'s brand is exceeding our expectation and adding important momentum to our Meals and Beverages division and the company.\nThe overall food sector continues to reflect improvement with favorable trends across multiple fronts, starting with improving consumer confidence. We're seeing further stabilization in food volumes as prices continue to normalize, and we continue to anticipate ongoing recovery throughout fiscal year '25. Although not every category is recovering at the same pace, we continue to be encouraged by this overall progress. And with 75% of our portfolio in growing categories, we continue to be in an advantaged position as the consumer recovery continues.\nAs we recently discussed at our Investor Day, we have transformed Campbell's portfolio and have evolved the way we talk about our most important brands. We call these 16 brands, our leadership brands with 8 in Meals and Beverages and 8 in Snacks. In the first quarter, these brands represented the majority of total enterprise net sales and segment operating earnings, and held advantage #1 or #2 positions in almost all of their respective categories.\nIn Q1, Leadership Brands grew dollar consumption by nearly 2% with positive share growth. We continue to experience pockets of competitive pressure in certain snack categories from new entrants and some continued trade down to private label in salty snacks and cookies. However, we remain confident in the strength of our leadership brands and our plans throughout the balance of the year.\nNow let's take a closer look at each respective division. Moving to our Meals and Beverages division on Slide 9. Organic net sales were flat compared to the prior year, with volume and mix growth of 1%. Net sales were impacted by movements in retailer inventory driven by the later timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year. This is evident in the higher 2% dollar in-market consumption growth, reflecting a 200 basis point difference to organic net sales growth.\nOn a pro forma basis, with the addition of Sovos Brands, Meals and Beverages net sales grew 2%, fueled by 3% volume and mix growth with in-market dollar consumption increasing 5%.\nTurning to Page 10, our Soup portfolio strengthened in Q1 as expected, with Campbell's dollar consumption increasing modestly ahead of or in line with the category average. This is the third consecutive quarter of dollar share growth driven by broth and our condensed cooking segments, along with improving ready-to-serve trends as we head into soup season.\nIn broth, Swanson continued to benefit from the combination of increased category usage and private label service challenges. Private label is recovering, and we expect modest share headwinds in the second quarter with that increasing in the second half of the fiscal year as private label fully recovers. As we have said previously, although we expect share to normalize over the next 12 months, the incremental growth in households we added to our brands during this period gives us an excellent opportunity to retain more of those consumers going forward.\nOur condensed soup segment grew share for the fourth consecutive quarter, led by our red and white cooking soups, growing share and outpacing private label as consumers continue to cook at home with quality brands they trust. We expect condensed eating soup to improve with colder weather. And finally, as expected, we saw stabilization in our ready-to-serve portfolio. We gained share led by strong performance in Chunky, Rao's and Homestyle, driven by our focus on innovation, marketing and in-store execution across the entire ready-to-serve portfolio. This growth also includes the planned delistment of Well Yes! representing just under a share point of headwind in the quarter.\nLooking at our Italian sauce portfolio on Slide 11, the combination of Rao's and Prego continues to deliver exceptional momentum across this billion-dollar platform. The remarkable performance of Rao's stands out with in-market consumption maintaining a robust 15% growth. This momentum pairs beautifully with Prego, which delivered a 5% increase in market by positioning these powerhouse brands to serve distinct consumer segments and price tiers, we've created an impressive platform to expand our market presence and fulfill diverse consumer preferences.\nOur sauce portfolio exemplifies our ability to capture growth across multiple segments while maintaining strong brand equity in both the premium and mainstream spaces. Rao's continues to perform better than expected, and now we expect pro forma growth in fiscal '25 to be slightly above 10% versus the previous guided high single digits.\nOver the long term, we continue to expect Rao's growth to settle in at a mid-single-digit growth range. Additionally, integration is progressing exceptionally well as the distinctive brands team drives both operational excellence and strategic advancement across the portfolio. What excites us most is a substantial headroom for expansion. While Rao's leads the Italian sauce category in dollar share, it achieves this despite reaching only half as many households as Prego and maintaining just 60% of the SKU assortment of Prego.\nOur research shows particularly strong momentum with millennial household adoption surging at more than twice the category's pace. This remarkable traction with younger demographics strengthens our conviction about Rao's long-term potential. We are also excited about expanding into promising segments like Alfredo varieties and even more premium offerings such as white truffle marinara, which we believe will further accelerate household penetration.\nOne area that continues to fuel incremental growth is the strong value and quality comparison between Rao's and mainstream Italian takeout. This position allows Rao's to source volume from a far bigger addressable market and a broader range of consumer income levels.\nTurning to our Snacks business on Slide 14. We delivered encouraging progress in several key areas despite facing a 2% decline in organic net sales. Worth noting is that organic net sales were impacted by approximately 1 percentage point from our planned reduction in Partner Brands, reflecting our strategic and deliberate portfolio reshaping efforts discussed at our recent Investor Day. This strategy allows us to concentrate resources on our differentiated leadership brands where we see the greatest potential for sustainable growth and margin enhancement.\nAs shown on Slide 15, in Q1, we saw overall snacking categories beginning to recover as expected. We held or grew share in several areas with solid performance in our crackers, fresh bakery and deli snack segments while navigating a more competitive environment in the salty snack segment and cookies.\nLet me start with what's working well. Goldfish held its #1 position with teens in the first quarter during the important back-to-school season, and consumers' continued enthusiastic response to platforms like Goldfish Crisps, validating the extendability of this $1 billion brand. Pepperidge Farm Bakery continued its momentum from the fourth quarter growing both in volume and share as both innovation and in-market execution continue to fuel momentum.\nAnd in deli, Snack Factory, including our seasonal pumpkin spice pretzels, delivered in-market growth and share gains. We are incredibly excited about Snack Factory expanding into the pretzel aisle with Pop ‘ums and Bites, unique munchable and big flavor additions that will now sit alongside our Snyder's of Hanover unique platforms.\nIn salty snacks, although new entrants and some stepped-up promotion are putting pressure on shares, the competitive environment has remained constructive. We have fully integrated plans in Q2 that include innovation, marketing and some increases in appropriate promotion to remain competitive and defend in key core segments.\nIn cookies and pretzels, we've experienced more pressure from private label. And these areas will remain disciplined on pricing while ramping up advertising and innovation, especially as we head into the key holiday season. These past weeks, you would have seen our full line of Pepperidge Farm holiday cookies is on display with our first-ever collectible holiday cookie jars, Fancy Santa returns to help support the launch of White Chocolate Milano's and get ready to build Snyder's Pretzel log Homes and give the Gingerbread people a break this holiday season.\nIn summary, consumer trends and category recovery continue to make progress, although not every category is recovering at the same pace, we continue to expect an improving environment through the balance of our fiscal '25. Our first quarter results were generally aligned with our expectations, propelled by the Sovos Brands acquisition, strong leadership brand performance and continued best-in-class execution. We are ensuring that we are well positioned in Q2 for the key holiday season and expect Q2 to demonstrate sequential improvement as we maintain our pace toward delivering our full year fiscal '25 guidance.\nWe've made significant progress with the Sovos Brands integration. And behind the strength of the Rao's brand, we now expect the acquisition to be accretive to adjusted EPS in fiscal '25. Overall, with our continued confidence in the team, portfolio and execution, we remain well positioned to continue to navigate the environment as it continues to improve.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Carrie.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results were generally in line with our expectations with overperformance from Sovos Brands and an earnings performance in line with expectations.\nReported net sales were up 10%, driven by the strong sales contribution from Sovos. Organic net sales, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency decreased 1%, reflecting a continued dynamic consumer environment and some impact due to the movements in retailer inventory levels, influenced by the later timing of the Thanksgiving holiday this year.\nAdjusted EBIT grew 6%, reflecting the strong contribution from the acquisition, while adjusted EPS decreased 2% to $0.89 due to higher interest expense stemming from higher levels of debt. The impact of the acquisition was approximately neutral to adjusted EPS in the quarter, which continued to exceed our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 21. As mentioned earlier, organic net sales for the first quarter were down 1%, this was driven by flat volume and mix, offset by anticipated unfavorable net price of 1%. Sovos Brands added 12 percentage points to reported net sales growth.\nOn Slide 22, first quarter adjusted gross profit margin declined 70 basis points, primarily driven by a 60 basis point impact from the acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, our base business adjusted gross margin was down a modest 10 basis points with productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, largely offsetting inflation and other supply chain cost and planned unfavorable net price realization.\nFor the full year, we expect our planned productivity and cost savings initiatives to be more than sufficient to offset the impact of low single-digit core inflation for the full year. In the first quarter, we delivered approximately $30 million of savings under the new $250 million cost savings program, of which approximately $9 million was Sovos integration savings.\nTurning to Slide 23. Marketing and selling expenses and admin expenses increased in total dollar spend from the prior year, reflecting the integration of Sovos Brands. However, both expense areas remained flat as a percentage of net sales. Within marketing and selling expenses, advertising and consumer promotion expenses rose by 13%, primarily driven by the impact of the acquisition.\nAdjusted administrative expenses increased 9% again, driven by the impact of the acquisition as well as higher general administrative costs and inflation, partially offset by the benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nAs shown on Slide 24, first quarter adjusted EBIT increased 6% primarily due to adjusted gross profit, partially offset by an increase in adjusted marketing and selling expenses and adjusted administrative and R&D expenses.\nOn Slide 25, adjusted EPS moved modestly lower to $0.89, primarily as EBIT growth was more than offset by higher interest expense related to the acquisition and the refinancing of $1.15 billion of our outstanding bonds. As was mentioned earlier, the acquisition was approximately neutral to adjusted EPS in the quarter.\nTurning to Slide 26. Meals and Beverages first quarter reported net sales increased 22% due to the contribution of the acquisition. Pro forma Q1 net sales growth for the division as if we had owned Sovos for all of Q1 fiscal '24, would have been approximately 2% driven by the respective pro forma Q1 growth of Sovos of 14%.\nOrganic net sales were flat to prior year, driven by gains in Prego pasta sauces, Canada and foodservice, offset by later Thanksgiving timing-driven inventory declines. Positive volume and mix of 1% was offset by unfavorable net price realization. U.S. soup in-market consumption was positive 1% compared to a decline in U.S. Soup organic net sales with the difference driven in part from the impact on retailer inventory of the later Thanksgiving holiday this year.\nAdditionally, first quarter operating earnings in the division increased 17%, primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition and lower marketing and selling expenses in the base business. Q1 operating margin from Meals and Beverages decreased 60 basis points to 19.8%, driven by the impact of the acquisition as expected. Excluding the acquisition, operating margin improved year-over-year.\nFirst quarter organic net sales in snacks decreased 2%, driven by declines in partner and contract brands, Pepperidge Farm Cookies, Goldfish Crackers and Late July snacks. Sales were impacted by volume and mix declines of 1%, reflecting an approximate 100 basis point headwind from lower partner and contract brand sales and lower net price realization of 1%. Snacks operating earnings in the quarter declined 12% due to lower gross profit as the impact of inflation and other supply chain costs and lower price realization were partially offset by supply chain productivity.\nQ1 operating margin for Snacks decreased 120 basis points to 13.3%. This was driven by lower gross profit margin and higher marketing and selling expenses as a percent of net sales. We expect stronger operating earnings growth and margin performance in the second half of the year, reflecting improving volume trends, a more neutral second half net price impact compared to the prior year, favorable mix with stronger contribution from leadership brands and a higher benefit of productivity and cost savings, net of core inflation and other supply chain costs.\nTurning to Slide 28. We generated $225 million in operating cash flow in the first quarter, a 29% increase from the prior year. We continue to prioritize reinvestment back into the business to drive incremental growth, productivity and enhanced business capabilities with Q1 capital expenditures of $110 million. We also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders with $116 million of dividends paid and $54 million in anti-dilutive share repurchases in the quarter.\nWe also announced a 5% increase in our regular quarterly dividend for dividends payable on January 27, 2025, reflecting confidence in our earnings, cash flow and long-term growth potential. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 3.7x, reflecting the financing of the Sovos acquisition and in line with our ratio at the end of fiscal '24. We remain committed to investment-grade ratings and our goal is to return to our 3x net leverage target in fiscal '27.\nAt the end of the first quarter, the company had approximately $808 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.85 billion available under our revolving credit facility. On October 2, we completed the issuance of $1.15 billion in bonds to refinance existing debt.\nBased on our Q1 performance, we are reaffirming our fiscal '25 full year guidance provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. Accordingly, guidance ranges reflect a balance between expected sequential progress and pragmatism as the company continues to navigate the current environment. The upper end of the range anticipates a quicker normalization of the consumer landscape, while the lower end of the range assumes a slower, more conservative pace of recovery.\nAs Mark mentioned, and like other companies in the food industry, we continue to operate in a dynamic macroeconomic and consumer environment. To continue to meet this near-term challenge, we have planned for less than 100 basis points of net price investment for fiscal '25 with a step up in Q2 to support the crucial holiday period. To balance this need, we have a robust pipeline of savings and performance opportunities to support this investment. These opportunities include the following: First, an acceleration in full year fiscal '25 cost savings pursuant to our new 3-year $250 million program. Savings for fiscal '25 are now expected to be in the range of $90 million, up from our prior expectation of $70 million.\nSecond, full year adjusted net interest expense is now expected to be in the range of approximately $340 million to $345 million, a $10 million improvement from our prior guidance primarily driven by the lower coupons on the debt issued to refinance $1.15 billion of debt that matures later this fiscal year.\nAnd third, as was mentioned earlier, Sovos brands, specifically Rao's, continues to perform better than anticipated. Accordingly, Sovos' pro forma growth for fiscal '25 is now expected to be slightly above 10%, an increase from our earlier expectation of high single-digit growth. The acquisition is now expected to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the second half and for the full fiscal year. Collectively, these 3 areas provide confidence to maintain our guidance range while also creating the necessary room to continue to invest behind our brands and stay competitive while navigating this dynamic environment. The second quarter will be an important indicator of progress in meeting our expectations. Should the consumer recovery be prolonged beyond the second quarter, the lower end of the company's sales and adjusted EPS guidance would become more likely.\nSpecifically for Q2, we expect to see sequential improvement from the first quarter with organic net sales growth to be relatively flat versus the prior year with positive volume and mix. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the low $0.70 range, reflecting a sequential step up in investment levels in both marketing and selling expenses as a percent of net sales and net price to support holiday and innovation launches and to maintain competitiveness.\nLooking at the second half of fiscal '25, we expect organic growth to modestly improve from the first half, reflecting the contribution of Sovos Brands moving into organic growth as of March 12, 2025 and improving trends on the base business, partially offset by lower expected net sales of our broth portfolio as we cycle outsized growth in the second half of fiscal '24 related to a competitor's supply issue.\nIn addition, we continue to expect adjusted EPS progress in the second half of fiscal '25, reflecting a more neutral net price and marketing expense impact compared to the prior year, higher net benefit of productivity and cost savings, including savings from the integration of Sovos, a lower year-over-year headwind from interest expense and a $0.07 benefit from the 53rd week in Q4. Recall, on November 12, we announced the planned divestiture of noosa. Our full year fiscal '25 guidance does not yet reflect the impact of the pending divestiture, which is expected to close in the first quarter of calendar year 2025. We'll plan to update our guidance on our next regularly scheduled earnings call following the closing of the transaction.\nnoosa's trailing 12 months of net sales through the end of October was $177 million, and the transaction is expected to be dilutive to earnings per share by approximately $0.01 in fiscal '25. All other underlying guidance assumptions remain unchanged.\nTo wrap up, we were pleased with our Q1 performance, which was generally in line with expectations with strong results from Sovos Brands. We remain focused on delivering value to our consumers and partnership with our customers, making progress on our productivity and cost savings initiatives while continuing our capital discipline and consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders.\nFor the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance and are taking a measured, balanced approach to a more competitive environment by building out a pipeline of additional savings that enable us to continue to position our brands for the long term.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. Before turning the call over to the operator, I want to congratulate Mark on his new opportunity, and I look forward to working with Mick and his new capacity as Campbell's future CEO.\nOperator, let's open the call for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell, and joining me today are Mark Clouse, Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation.\nSlide 4 outlines today's agenda. Mark will provide insights into our fourth quarter and full year performance as well as our in-market performance by division. Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the fourth quarter and full year fiscal '24 in more detail and outline our guidance for the full fiscal year 2025, which we provided this morning.\nAs a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands on March 12, and as such, the full fiscal year 2024 financial results include a partial year contribution from Sovos Brands. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. In Q4, we continued to successfully navigate the evolving consumer and delivered solid results, including sequential volume improvement across both divisions, a second consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year adjusted EBIT growth and adjusted EPS growth, underpinned by sequentially improving margins on both businesses. It also marks the end of a dynamic year, during which we drove significant progress against our strategic plan.\nIn addition, we continue to see momentum on the Sovos Brands business and advance the integration of the best growth story in food into our Meals & Beverages business.\nEnd market performance was still mixed, but improved for both divisions, with substantial volume-driven progress on Meals & Beverages and sequential improvement on snacks. While the snacks category recovery is unfolding at a somewhat slower pace than we'd like, it continues progressing in the right direction.\nFinally, we also introduced fiscal '25 guidance today, which reflects our expectation of steady progress and incorporates an appropriate level of pragmatism as we continue to navigate the recovery of snacks in the first half of the year. Carrie will provide more details in a moment.\nWhile we remain vigilant as we head into fiscal '25, we have also never been more confident in the strength and long-term trajectory of our business. We remain steadfast in our view that consumer behavior will continue to normalize, and that we are uniquely positioned to deliver sustained and dependable growth with one of the best portfolios in all of food. We look forward to sharing more of this story at our Investor Day on September 10 in New York.\nTurning to Slide 7, organic net sales in the fourth quarter declined 1% compared to the prior year. As we expected, volume improved sequentially, and both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS increased by double digits. The Sovos Brands acquisition was approximately neutral to adjusted EPS, which again exceeded our expectations. In-market consumption was essentially flat compared to the prior year, and the 1 point of difference in organic net sales versus consumption was primarily driven by headwinds from partner brands and some trade phasing, both of which were in our snacks business.\nOn a full year basis, we were down slightly on top line, while growing adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. I'd note that adjusted EPS at $3.08 for the full year put us roughly at the midpoint of our most recent guidance.\nAs I mentioned, the trend of sequential volume and mix improvement we've experienced over the past 2 quarters continued in Q4. We were encouraged to see growth in Meals & Beverages of 2%, and snacks remained stable in the quarter. This trend continues to reflect the improving consumer dynamics, including total Foods moved this quarter into positive territory for both dollars and units. Strong consumer metrics support this continued progress, including roughly 70% of edible categories growing household penetration, similar to Q3. And for the first time in a while, the recovery is beginning to extend to lower and middle income households. The one negative indicator was a modest reversal in consumer confidence in the fourth quarter, signaling the somewhat fragile state of the consumer and why being prudent on expectations still makes sense. However, overall, as we've said before, we continue to see the recovery of the consumer environment, not as a question of if, but rather a question of when.\nOn Slide 9, I want to briefly expand upon the material benefit we're experiencing with the integration of Sovos. While our Q4 net sales declined 1% from the prior year on an organic basis, including the pro forma contribution from Sovos, total company growth would have increased 150 basis points. There's also a 110-basis-point benefit to volume and mix, resulting in an approximately 2% pro forma growth rate on volume and mix for the total company. This growth continues to pace ahead of our initial estimates, and reflects the strength and the resilience of the Sovos' business' growth, especially the [indiscernible] brand.\nMoving to our Meals and Beverage division on Slide 10. We achieved growth of 1% in organic net sales in the quarter compared to the prior year. More importantly, that growth was fueled by a 2% volume growth, offset by a point of planned net pricing investment. On a pro forma combined basis with the addition of Sovos Brands, Meals & Beverages net sales grew 4%, also fueled by volume mix growth and consistent with end market consumption. This is the second quarter of strong performance across our legacy Meals & Beverages businesses and Sovos Brands, both fueled by volume growth, an important indicator that's building confidence in the improving potential of our Meals & Beverages division going forward.\nMoving to more good news on Page 11. Our soup business also strengthened in Q4 and is building even more momentum in the latest 4 weeks, with dollar consumption up 2% and 6%, respectively, as we head into soup season. Campbell's wet soup dollar consumption increased 2 points during the fourth quarter, surpassing the category average by approximately 1 point. Notably, we did experience robust share gains in our Swanson broth business as a major private label supplier was experiencing supply constraints. It's important to note that although our share was helped by this dynamic, the category trends were also very healthy, up double digits, creating a great opportunity for Swanson to add new households.\nUnderlying category growth continues to benefit from the consumers pulling back on eating meals away from home in favor of home cooking. The one remaining area of focus on soup is ready-to-serve, where we're experiencing category pressure and some trading down. We expect both dynamics to improve as the weather changes and the role of ready-to-serve at lunch becomes more relevant. We're already seeing some stabilization and are confident about our robust pipeline of innovation and marketing across our Chunky, Pacific and [indiscernible] brands. Overall, this quarter, we also answered a very important question about soup, can soup grow volume mix after COVID and inflation, and it did, up nearly 2%.\nTurning to Italian sauces. Slide 12 highlights our 2 market-leading brands at the forefront of our $1 billion sauces portfolio, RAYOS and Prego. I could not be happier with the continued strong growth of Rayos with in-market consumption in the high teens range. RAYOS complements the steady performance of Prego, which was up 2% in-market. This combination of brands that address different occasions and price points gives us a fantastic ability to grow overall share by meeting multiple consumer needs. We'll provide more details on our expectations for [indiscernible] at our Investor Day, but we remain very confident in our previously stated ongoing growth rate of mid-single digits, with a high single-digit growth expectation for fiscal '25. The team on Sovos has done an excellent job during the integration, not only maintaining the business, but advancing the growth and strategy across the portfolio.\nSlide 13 outlines a few reasons why we are confident in the continued growth of [indiscernible]. Despite ranking as the #1 Italian sauce brand in terms of dollar share, Rao's has about 50% of the household penetration and 60% of the SKU assortment of Prego. There's also a significant opportunity to continue to build brand awareness as the team readies new marketing and innovation for fiscal 2025. We Additionally, the brand is growing share across all economic demographics and is thriving amongst millennial consumers. In fact, Rao's is growing with millennials at a rate 2.8x faster than the category. We are thrilled to see younger consumers embrace this ultra distinctive brand, and believe this provides a strong foundation for us to build Rao's into a household staple in the future.\nFinally, on Slide 14, just to remind everyone that our Meals & Beverages division also includes brands like PACE, Pacific and V8 Energy, all of which represent great opportunities for additional growth as leading brands in their respective advantaged categories or segments.\nTurning to our Snacks business on Slide 15. Despite the 3% decline for the quarter, we saw many encouraging indicators. We were pleased to see continued improvement in vol mix as well as in-market results compared to Q3. We did see some competitive pressure in salty snacks that we're addressing with targeted plans in place in Q1. It's important to note, much of that share pressure is not a result of pricing or promotional activity, but rather new entrants into our elevated segments like Kettle potato chips or organic better-for-you tortilla chips.\nAlthough we continue to see investment in promotion going forward, we expect levels to remain competitive and disciplined. It's important to remember that although managing price gaps is important, growing our elevated snacks brands will be more influenced by the impact of our innovation and marketing efforts. Those plans are particularly robust for fiscal 2025, giving us even more confidence.\nOn Slide 16, I'd like to quickly provide some additional color on the bridge between the in-market 1% decline and our overall 3% decline in organic net sales. There were 2 key drivers. First, as we expected, there was approximately a 1% reduction driven by partner and contract brands, which I'll explain a bit more about in a moment. Second, we cycled about 1 point of favorable trade phasing in Q4 of fiscal '23 that created some additional pressure on pricing in the quarter. This is a onetime dynamic that we do not expect to repeat in fiscal 2025.\nLet me go a bit deeper now on the partner and contract brands headwind. As you will likely recall, we've discussed the role of these partner and contract brands in the past. Partner brands or brands Campbell does not own that we agree to sell through IDPs to improve the scale of their routes. Contract brands or products at Campbell manufacturers to support the scale of our manufacturing plants and are shipped to another company or customer. Although these businesses play an important role, on average, they have approximately 50% lower variable contribution margin than our power brands, and also, in many cases, support competitors' products. So as we grow our power brands and optimize our DSD and manufacturing network, our reliance on these businesses has gone down. Although there is a top line headwind in the near term, it is clearly the right strategic decision to focus more on our own brands and improve the mix of our business. We expect this trend to continue in fiscal '25. But as you can see, we've been working this number down and reduced it by more than half. We'll provide a bit more detail on our destination for these businesses during Investor Day.\nIn addition to the rightsizing of partner and contract brands and with a similar objective, we recently announced the sale of our Pop Secret business. Although a very strong brand in the microwave popcorn segment, we do not see the brand or the category as a core focus area for our snack business. While there will be a modest impact to net sales and EPS this year, we're confident that as we continue to refine our snacks portfolio, the continued focus will be a further enabler to faster and more profitable growth.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we did experience some competitive pressure on our power brands in Q4, resulting in dollar consumption that was flat compared to the prior year. On a 2-year basis, our power brands did grow 9.5%. Moreover, we continue to see meaningful progress in the quarter on key brands like Goldfish, which continued to drive in-market growth. We believe strongly in the accelerated growth of these brands within our snacks portfolio and are responding to the near-term pressure by delivering strong innovation, increasing our marketing efforts and investing in sustainable and disciplined levels as we continue to make strides towards our long-term goals for the category.\nAnother important focus area for fiscal '24 was delivering snacks margin improvement. And I'm pleased that despite the volatile environment, we were able to reach approximately 15% operating margin for the full year. This finish reflects 170 basis points of expansion over the last 2 years. We remain extremely confident in our savings and productivity road maps for snacks. But we'll always ensure that we're appropriately supporting our brands given our priority of growth. As you will hear from Carrie in a moment, we're being measured in our fiscal '25 guidance for snacks margin improvement until we fully cycle the consumer and category recoveries. To that end, although we do expect margin progress in fiscal '25 on snacks, we're targeting approximately 50 basis points of year-over-year improvement. Again, all savings initiatives remain on track, and this moderation from our originally planned 100 basis points increase simply reflects the acceleration of planned marketing investment into this year, reflecting the competitive environment and a near-term moderate margin headwind from the Pop Secret divestiture.\nWe remain confident in our stated longer-term goal of 17% margins for snacks, and we'll talk more about that path during Investor Day.\nIn summary, our fourth quarter performance was a solid close to fiscal '24, with steady progress across the business and against our strategic plan. We saw stabilizing trends in growth and volumes, compelling earnings with margin improvement and continued progress integrating Sovos Brands. I'd like to thank the entire Campbell's team for their hard work and commitment in finding ways to deliver in an ever-evolving consumer environment. I recognize that we're not fully through the consumer recovery yet, but I can clearly see the light at the end of the tunnel. This paired with the tremendous progress we've made in transforming Campbell's business is setting up what I believe will be a very exciting next chapter in our storied history.\nWe look forward to laying out that chapter at our upcoming Investor Day on September 10 in New York. With that, let me turn it over to Carrie.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter, including continued strong performance from the Sovos Brands acquisition. Fourth quarter reported net sales were up 11% driven by the contribution from Sovos. Organic net sales, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency decreased 1% compared to the prior year to $2 billion. Importantly, as Mark mentioned earlier, we continued to show sequential volume improvement moving into positive territory.\nSimilar to third quarter, both adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share increased double digits in Q4, with expansion in both adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBIT margin. Adjusted EBIT increased 36%, primarily due to higher adjusted gross profit from the contribution of Sovos and base business performance. Adjusted EPS increased 26% to $0.63, with the impact of the acquisition approximately neutral in the quarter, which, as Mark mentioned, continue to exceed our expectations.\nTurning to Slide 23, on a full year basis, net sales were up 3%, including 4.5 months of sales contribution from the Sovos acquisition. Organic net sales decreased 1% compared to the prior year with unfavorable volume and mix, partially offset by the benefit of net price realization. Our organic full year net sales result was in line with the low end of our guidance range, and we have now delivered 2 consecutive quarters of stable or growing year-over-year volume and mix.\nFull year adjusted EBIT increased 6%, driven by higher adjusted gross profit from the contribution of the acquisition and base business performance. Adjusted EBIT margin improved 50 basis points, driven primarily by an increase in adjusted gross margin. Full year adjusted EPS increased 3% to $3.08, with the impact of the acquisition approximately neutral during the fiscal year.\nMoving to Slide 24. Organic net sales declined slightly in the quarter as sequential improvement in volume and mix was more than offset by unfavorable net pricing. We did see volumes turn positive in the quarter within our Meals & Beverages division and neutral volumes in snacks, and both divisions saw volume improvement in the quarter compared to Q3. Looking ahead, we expect volume trends to continue to modestly improve as we move through fiscal '25.\nDuring the quarter, Sovos Brands added 12 percentage points to reported net sales growth, which exceeded our expectations.\nOn Slide 25, fourth quarter adjusted gross profit margin expanded 80 basis points to 31.4%, consistent with Q3 margins and in line with our expectations. Drivers of margin expansion included supply chain productivity, lower other supply chain cost and favorable mix. These contributors more than offset unfavorable net price realization, moderate cost inflation and the impact of the Sovos Brands acquisition, which has a lower margin profile than the base business.\nCore inflation in the quarter remained in the low single-digit range, consistent with rates we experienced throughout the year and much lower than the 12% we reported for full year fiscal '23. We anticipate core inflation to remain in the low single-digit range for fiscal '25, and we remain focused in areas of the portfolio where we still see higher year-over-year input costs, including olive oil, cocoa and packaging costs, and other areas of persistent inflation such as labor cost and warehousing costs.\nIn fiscal '24, we delivered $60 million of enterprise cost savings, reaching a cumulative $950 million of our $1 billion multiyear cost savings program. For the full year, our total productivity initiatives and cost savings programs more than offset the impact of inflation.\nTurning to Slide 26. Q4 other operating items included adjusted marketing and selling expenses, which decreased 4% to $187 million. The decrease was primarily driven by lower advertising and consumer expenses in the base business as we lapped significant spending in the prior year. Reductions in advertising and customer expenses on the base business were partially offset by the impact of the Sovos Brands acquisition.\nFourth quarter adjusted administrative expenses modestly increased 1% to $165 million. The added adjusted administrative costs from the acquisition were partially mitigated by lower incentive compensation costs and approximately $7 million in cost synergy realization in the quarter from our Sovos integration plan. This brings our total Sovos integration synergy capture to $10 million for fiscal '24.\nAs shown on Slide 27, fourth quarter adjusted EBIT increased 36% and adjusted EBIT margin increased 260 basis points to 14.3%. This was primarily due to higher adjusted gross profit from the contribution of the acquisition and base business performance. Lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses were offset by the modest increase in adjusted administrative and R&D costs and an increase in adjusted other expenses, which were driven by higher amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition and lower pension and postretirement benefit income.\nOn Slide 28, adjusted EPS increased double digits to $0.63, primarily reflecting higher adjusted EBIT, partially offset by higher net interest expense related to higher levels of debt to fund the acquisition. As we mentioned earlier, the acquisition was approximately neutral to adjusted EPS in Q4 and to the full year.\nIn Meals & Beverages, fourth quarter net sales increased 28%, driven by the contribution of the Sovos Brands acquisition. Pro forma Q4 net sales growth for the division, as if we had owned Sovos Brands for all of Q4 fiscal '23, would have been approximately 4%, driven by the respective pro forma Q4 growth of Sovos of 14%. Organic net sales increased 1%, driven by gains in U.S. soup, foodservice and prego pasta sauces, partially offset by declines in beverages. It was great to see year-over-year volume trends turn positive in the quarter for Meals & Beverages, with favorable volume and mix of 2%, partially offset by lower net price realization of 1%.\nIn U.S. soup, net sales increased 2%, primarily due to an increase in broth, partially offset by decreases in ready-to-serve and condensed soups. Additionally, fourth quarter operating earnings increased 60%, primarily driven by the contribution of the Sovos Brands acquisition and higher gross profit in the base business. We were pleased with the Q4 Meals & Beverages operating margin of 17.6%, which improved 350 basis points as compared to the prior year, more than absorbing the impact of the recent acquisition, which, as I mentioned earlier, has a lower margin profile than the base business.\nFor the full year, Meals & Beverages operating margins improved 30 basis points to 18.5%.\nFourth quarter organic net sales in snacks decreased 3%. Volume and mix trends sequentially improved to flat in the quarter, with roughly 1% growth in power brands and 1% reduction in partner brands. In addition, we saw slightly more than a 2% unfavorable net price realization, of which approximately half was a planned increase in net pricing investment and the balance reflecting the lapping of favorable trade phasing in Q4 of fiscal '23.\nFourth quarter operating margin for snacks increased 50 basis points to 14.5%, and full year margin improved 40 basis points to end the year at 14.8%, generally aligned with our goal of reaching approximately 15% margins for the year as we navigated the ongoing consumer recovery. We remain on track with our network and route-to-market initiatives as part of our margin road map. Though as we think about fiscal '25, we will be a bit more conservative with a margin expectation modestly above 15% as volume trends continue to normalize and we absorb the near-term impact of the Pop Secret divestiture. This will give us some flexibility to remain competitive while supporting our brands and innovation launches this coming year, while staying focused on our long-term margin goal of 17%.\nTurning to Slide 31, we generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal year '24. This result represented a 4% increase compared to the prior year despite incurring onetime cash costs associated with the acquisition.\nFiscal '24 capital expenditures were $517 million as we continue to prioritize key growth and capability-building investments, including capital requirements related to Sovos Brands. We also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders with $445 million of dividends paid and $67 million in anti-dilutive share repurchases during the fiscal year.\nOur net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage at the end of the fourth quarter was 3.7x as expected. We remain committed to investment-grade ratings and our goal to return to our 3x net leverage target by the end of year 3 post close.\nAt the end of Q4, we had approximately $108 million in cash and cash equivalents, and ample liquidity under our revolving credit facility.\nTurning to Slide 32. Our full year fiscal '25 guidance reflects a balance between sequential progress, while also reflecting a reasonable range as we continue to navigate the ongoing consumer recovery. As a reminder, we completed the sale of our Pop Secret business earlier this week. The divestiture is estimated to reduce net sales by approximately 1 percentage point and have a $0.04 earnings per share dilutive impact in fiscal '25, which is reflected in our full year guidance.\nFiscal '25 comprises 53 weeks, 1 additional week compared to fiscal '24. The benefit of the 53rd week is included in our fiscal '25 guidance, and it is estimated to be worth approximately 2 points of net sales and adjusted EBIT growth and approximately $0.06 of adjusted EPS. Full year reported net sales are expected to increase approximately 9% to 11%, which reflects a full 12 months of net sales contribution from Sovos Brands and the loss of 11 months of net sales from the divestiture of Pop Secret. As a reminder, Sovos moves into our organic growth calculation starting March 12, 2025. We expect Sovos Brands fiscal '25 pro forma net sales growth as if we had owned Sovos for all of fiscal '24 to be in the high single-digit range, following a year of double-digit growth. Rao's will lap its more significant distribution gains beginning in January. Moving forward, we still expect long-term Sovos Brands net sales growth to be in the mid-single-digit range.\nFull year organic net sales growth is expected in a range of approximately flat to up 2%, reflecting the variability in the pace of consumer recovery. Our organic net sales growth expectations reflect modest positive volume and mix for the year. In terms of phasing, we expect Q1 organic net sales growth to be relatively flat, a modest improvement from Q4. And for the balance of the year, we expect sequential improvement in the consumer environment. Importantly, for the second half, although we expect healthier category trends, we will be cycling the broth net sales benefit in fiscal '24 that was a result of private label supply constraints.\nWe expect adjusted EBIT growth of 9% to 11%, including the operating income contribution of Sovos Brands and the impact of the divestiture of Pop Secret. As a reminder, the adjusted EBIT contribution of Sovos in our guidance includes stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, whereas, historically, when Sovos was a stand-alone company, these costs were not included in their adjusted results.\nFiscal '25 transaction-related depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be approximately $18 million, in line with our original expectations. We expect full year core inflation in the low single-digit range, consistent with fiscal '24. We also expect productivity improvements of approximately 3% and enterprise cost savings of approximately $70 million, inclusive of $10 million in cost synergies related to the integration of Sovos. Of the $70 million, roughly 1/3 will benefit gross profit and 2/3 to be realized in the marketing, selling and general and administrative expense categories.\nAdditionally, in line with our continued commitment to brand investments, we expect adjusted marketing and selling expense as a percent of net sales to return to our targeted range of 9% to 10%. For Q1, we expect an increase in marketing and selling spend as compared to Q1 fiscal '24, with the addition of Sovos Brands expenses as well as other targeted brand investments in the base business.\nTotal company adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be similar to fiscal '24, with a modest improvement in adjusted gross margin, offset with the impact of the acquisition as it moves into our base for a full 12 months as well as the normalization of incentive compensation and higher levels of marketing and selling costs for the base business. As mentioned earlier, Snacks operating margin is expected to be modestly above fiscal '24. Meals & Beverages operating margin is expected to be modestly lower, reflecting the mix impact of Sovos, partially offset by a modest margin improvement in the base business.\nAdjusted earnings per share is expected to increase 1% to 4% and be in a range of $3.12 to $3.22, including the $0.04 impact of the divestiture of Pop Secret. We expect Sovos to be approximately neutral to adjusted EPS in fiscal '25.\nTo provide a bit more clarity about the phasing of the year, in Q1, we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the mid- to high $0.80 range, reflecting modest dilution impacts from the Sovos acquisition and Pop Secret divestiture as well as brand investments within our targeted 9% to 10% range.\nFull year adjusted net interest expense is expected to be between $350 million and $355 million. Net interest expense is higher than fiscal '24, reflecting a full year of incremental debt related to the acquisition and higher expected interest expense associated with the refinancing of our March 2025 bond maturities, with expected debt issuance timing driven by market conditions.\nAs I wrap up guidance, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 5% of net sales. Our priorities for fiscal 2025 include key networking optimization initiatives across both divisions, capital related to the integration of Sovos, including IT investments, and completing our growth capacity investments in our Snacks division for Goldfish and Kettle brand chips. We see great opportunity to reinvest into the business in support of growth and improve profitability. This remains very much aligned with our long-term algorithm and capital allocation priorities that we'll talk more about at our upcoming Investor Day.\nTo wrap up, we were pleased with our fourth quarter results, delivering double-digit growth in both adjusted EBIT and EPS and margin expansion. As we head into fiscal '25, we remain encouraged by the continued expectation for improving volume trends in the business and sustaining the momentum following our first full quarter with Sovos Brands in our results. With that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Third Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell. Joining me today are Mark Clouse, Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\nBecause we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation. Slide 4 outlines today's agenda. Mark will provide insight into our third quarter performance as well as our in-market performance by division. Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and outline our guidance for the full fiscal year 2024, which we updated this morning.\nAs a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands on March 12. And as such, third quarter and third quarter year-to-date financial results include a partial quarter of contribution of Sovos Brands.\nAnd with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. As we announced today, we had a solid third quarter with sequential volume improvement, stable organic net sales, double-digit year-over-year adjusted EBIT and EPS growth while expanding margins.\nThe integration of the Sovos Brands is off to a fantastic start, and has already added significant incremental growth to our company in the third quarter. We feel great about the confirmation of our diligence during the acquisition process and are excited about Sovos' long runway for growth. We are also excited to be working with the many talented Sovos Brands team members who have joined Campbell's.\nWe saw stabilizing in-market performance on our base meals and beverage business, but faced some moderate category pressure in the Snacks business. However, we've seen improvement in the latest weeks and remain very confident and the continued consumer demand for snacking and the strength of our portfolio of advantaged brands. Additionally, we are pleased with our continued Snacks operating margin progress. We are updating our fiscal '24 outlook to reflect the addition of Sovos Brands and the ongoing pace of the consumer recovery. Carrie will provide further details on this guidance a bit later.\nTurning to Slide 7. Organic net sales in the third quarter were comparable to the prior year period. As we expected, volume improved compared to the second quarter. Both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS increased by double digits with the recent acquisition having no material impact to adjusted EPS. In-market consumption was down 2%, but up 6% versus 2 years ago, as we continue to normalize pricing and volumes. The 2 points of difference in organic net sales versus consumption was primarily driven by strength in unmeasured channels as foodservice in Canada both had strong quarters.\nIt is exciting to see the positive impact on the business from adding Sovos Brands. In Q3, on a pro forma basis, we see a 200 basis point improvement in top line and volume and mix growth. Looking at the now combined Campbell's, we would rank among the fastest volume-driven growth companies in the food sector over recent periods. As integration progresses, we expect to realize further top line and bottom line benefits. I look forward to providing more details at our Investor Day in September about how this acquisition when paired with the rest of our iconic portfolio will fuel the next chapter of long-term growth for the company.\nOn Slide 9, I want to go into more detail about the current consumer environment. Unquestionably, as prices have begun to moderate, consumers are starting to recover. This is substantiated by the first improvements in consumer confidence in a long time. In addition, we are seeing significant growth in the percentage of the top 50 edible categories that are maintaining or increasing household penetration compared to the same period last year. Most importantly, we are seeing food volumes stabilize as pricing normalizes. Yet it is fair to say that the pace of this recovery has varied depending on the specific category and the consumers' income level. For example, our Snacks business, which has been the most resilient to date, is now facing some short-term pressure, especially among lower and middle-income consumers. We are seeing some modest improvement in the snacking segment in the most recent weeks with the expectation of more of a full recovery in the first half of fiscal 2025. Overall, we're staying focused on what we can control with an emphasis on execution, innovation and strong collaboration with our retail partners to remain relevant and win by meeting them both on quality and value. Growing and improving share trends, along with stabilizing volumes are clearly a positive indication, and we expect that to continue going forward.\nMoving to our Meals & Beverages division on Slide 10. We achieved comparable organic net sales in the quarter. More importantly, we delivered volume improvement from the second quarter as planned. Organic net sales outpaced consumption, reflecting the strength in unmeasured channels. As mentioned earlier, this was primarily in foodservice in Canada.\nAs we look at meals and beverages on a pro forma combined basis with the addition of Sovos Brands, Meals & Beverages net sales grew 5%. Similarly, combined dollar consumption grew 3% for the quarter. This supports the ongoing transformation of our Meals & Beverages business and demonstrates the ability for this key business to be a positive driver of Campbell's growth going forward.\nNow let me briefly cover our soup portfolio on Slide 11. We had an improvement in share on soup during the quarter, fueled by improving trends across most key segments. In particular, as consumers continue to focus on stretchable meals, the cooking side of the portfolio benefited in the quarter with notable dollar share gains in condensed cooking and broth. It's important to note that the industry has been experiencing some supply issues more broadly on broth. Given the strength of our supply chain, we've been able to step-up production to help meet that need, which has accelerated growth in this normally stable category. Although we expect industry capacity to return over time, it's adding significant new households for Swanson that we see as a positive indicator for the future. And our ready-to-serve business, although more pressured as a segment, we now have Rao's ready-to-serve soup business under our umbrella, which had strong dollar share gains in the quarter.\nSlide 12 illustrates that we have now surpassed one of our main strategic plan goals, which was to build a $1 billion sauce business. With the addition of the ultra distinctive Rao's Italian sauce, Campbell's has strengthened its leading share position in the total Italian sauce category in terms of both dollars and units, gaining 3.1 points of unit share and 3.1 points of dollar share in the third quarter. Even more encouraging is the household penetration momentum we are seeing for Prego and Rao's with both increasing compared to the prior year.\nOn Slide 13, we updated the slide we presented in August when we announced the Sovos transaction. As we had suggested at the time, there were many factors that support the potential for additional growth on Rao's. I'm happy to say, almost a year later, we have seen the validation of those assumptions as we continue to progress toward our next $1 billion brand. I'm excited that Rao's is exceeding our expectations regarding household penetration, and that we're seeing faster growth among younger consumers. The path ahead will continue to be fueled by household penetration gains and strengthening distribution and assortment. With innovation in adjacent categories as additional growth drivers, the future is bright.\nMoving to frozen on Slide 14. Although not a particularly big bet in our growth model, it was encouraging to see the progress in the quarter. Our total frozen meal business maintained positive momentum with strong velocity increases as the team has optimized assortments and distribution and with the continued strong performance from our expanding frozen pizza portfolio, we continue to see strong potential in this business. Overall, we continue to be encouraged by the success of Rao's disciplined and thoughtful brand extensions, and we'll provide a comprehensive update on our plans going forward during our upcoming Investor Day.\nI'll wrap up my remarks on the Meals & Beverages division by discussing noosa on Slide 15. And the noosa business has been one of the more positive surprises in the Sovos Brands acquisition. It is an excellent product and brand that continues to perform very well. In fact, in the quarter, the new noosa spoonable business returned to dollar growth driven by the success of its 8-ounce yogurt. Additionally, the 8-ounce yogurt has now experienced 14 quarters of consecutive dollar consumption growth. Even though we have decided to explore strategic alternatives for the business, as yogurt is not a strategic category for Campbell's, the business has truly exceeded our expectations. I am grateful to the noosa team for their tremendous focus and commitment. It is a well-run business with a dedicated team and great tasting unique products.\nTurning to our Snacks business on Slide 16. Organic net sales declined by 1%, slightly better than dollar consumption. On a 2-year compounded annual growth rate basis, organic net sales increased 6%, matching dollar consumption growth for the quarter. Our power brands increased net sales by 2%, following a 16% increase in the prior year, showing the continued resilience of brands like Goldfish in late July, which increased net sales by 5% and 26%, respectively. On a 2-year compounded annual growth rate basis, our Power Brands grew net sales and dollar consumption by 9%. Now that our power brands represent 2/3 of our Snacks business, this is a great foundation for sustained growth going forward. The strength of the power brands in the quarter was tempered by declines in lower-margin partner brands, contract manufacturing and fresh bakery. We look forward to our Investor Day where we can provide both a clear growth acceleration path for power brands and a clear path to further optimize the remaining parts of our current Snacks portfolio.\nOn Slide 17, I want to provide some context on the slower trends in the snacking categories seen over these past couple of quarters and add some proof points as to why we remain very bullish on the snacking occasion. First, over the past 3 years, Snacks categories have been the most resilient across food, essentially reflecting very little, if any, price elasticity. Recently, we have experienced some slowdown as low and middle income consumers have sustained economic pressure for so long, it's finally impacting Snacks. However, even with this category moderation, we're still averaging 8% consumption growth over the last 3 years, which is well above total food and historical snack growth averages. Second, the slowdown so far has been more modest compared to other edible categories, which is consistent with historical performance and learnings that Snacks meet a variety of consumer needs, including emotional support during difficult times, making it more resilient than many other categories. Finally, we're already seeing improvement as we enter the important summer holiday windows, where snacks are the star of the show for backyard barbecues and entertainment. So although I anticipate some continued pressure in the short term, we expect Snacks will recover over the next couple of quarters and are confident in our overall expectation for outsized growth in snacking over the longer term. In fact, a couple of standouts in the third quarter were Late July and Pepperidge Farm cookies, fueled by innovation and great marketing. We spiced up our Late July portfolio with the addition of Scotch & Sauce and Hawaii and Habanero just in time for the summer snacking season. Late July net sales in the quarter increased 26% compared to prior year as the brand displays remarkable momentum supported by our great new product development, brand investment and execution.\nOn the sweeter side, we continue to drive strong levels of velocity in cookies with new innovations in our Pepperidge Farm Milano cookie portfolio, such as the launch of our London Fog limited time offering. Most importantly, our Pepperidge Farm cookies portfolio continues to grow buyers across all generations, a positive proof point that as consumers are more selective on how they spend their snacking dollars our elevated brands are well positioned to win.\nSlide 19 illustrates the continued margin progress in our Snacks business. On a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis year-to-date, Snacks organic net sales grew 7%, and operating earnings increased 14%. This growth came with approximately 190 basis points of margin expansion. Key drivers of this margin expansion are initiatives to optimize our network, better execution in our manufacturing facilities and disciplined spending. We expect to reach our 15% operating margin goal for the full year and are on track to reach our longer-term target of 17%.\nBefore I wrap up, I wanted to address the recent announcement about further optimization of our supply chain. We are making significant investments to continue the transformation of our manufacturing and distribution network to maintain our competitive advantage, while also selectively rationalizing less efficient or redundant areas to lower cost. We are investing approximately $230 million through fiscal 2026 in various facilities to modernize our supply chain, including added capacity and capabilities. These projects will create approximately 210 new roles, especially with new aseptic technology opportunities in Maxton, North Carolina. This is in addition to the previously announced $160 million investment in our Richmond, Utah site to expand Goldfish capacity. We are also closing our Tolleson plant as we shift soup and broth production to more advantaged sites while also simplifying our Jeffersonville, Indiana plant to focus on Late July tortilla chip production and move potato chip production to more scaled locations. The impact of these changes will be the reduction of 415 roles and be executed over the next 2 years.\nWe continue to evaluate additional optimization opportunities across the network to build our supply chain of the future. At our upcoming Investor Day, we plan to provide full program details and savings to lay out the next source of fuel for growth and earnings.\nIn summary, the third quarter was a solid quarter where we advanced in every aspect of the business. We saw stabilizing trends on growth and volumes, compelling earnings with margin improvement and a great start to the integration of Sovos Brands. As we continue to control the controllables in a dynamic environment, I remain confident in our outlook and continue to see this moment as a tremendous time for the company to begin its next chapter of sustained growth. I'm looking forward to laying out that path fully for you at our upcoming Investor Day in September in New York City.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Carrie.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by sharing some highlights from our third quarter. We had a lot of positives, including the better-than-expected contribution of the Sovos Brands business to our performance. Reported net sales were up 6%, driven by the partial quarter of sales contribution from Sovos Brands. Organic net sales, excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency were comparable to the prior year and continued to show sequential volume improvement. On a 2-year compounded annual growth rate basis, organic net sales grew 2%. Both adjusted EBIT and adjusted earnings per share increased double digits in the quarter with expansion in both adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBIT margin. Adjusted EBIT increased 13%, primarily driven by the contribution of Sovos Brands as well as higher adjusted earnings in the base business. Adjusted EPS increased 10% to $0.75 and with the impact of the acquisition approximately neutral in the quarter, exceeding our initial expectations.\nSlide 24 shows that organic net sales were stable, with nominal impacts from net price realization and volume and mix. We experienced sequential improvement in the third quarter and expect these volume trends to modestly improve in Q4. And during the quarter, Sovos Brands added 7 percentage points to reported net sales growth, which exceeded our expectations.\nOn Slide 25, third quarter adjusted gross profit margin expanded 30 basis points compared to the prior year to 31 The drivers of margin expansion included supply chain productivity, cost savings initiatives and favorable volume and mix. These contributors more than offset cost inflation and other supply chain costs, and the impact of the Sovos acquisition, which has a lower margin profile than the base business. Core inflation in the quarter remained in the low single-digit range, consistent with rates we experienced in the first half and much lower than the 8% reported in the prior year. We anticipate core inflation to remain in this range for the balance of fiscal '24, and we will stay focused in areas of our portfolio with increased input costs such as tomatoes, olive oil, cocoa and other areas of persistent inflation such as labor cost and warehousing costs. Through the end of the third quarter, we achieved $940 million of our $1 billion multiyear cost savings program. Similar to Q3, we expect our productivity initiatives and cost savings programs to offset the impact of inflation in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 26. Other operating items include adjusted marketing and selling expenses, which increased 2% to $198 million. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the recent acquisition, partially offset by lower costs in the base business, including lower advertising and consumer promotion expense, lower incentive compensation expense and lower selling expense. Adjusted administrative expenses increased $2 million or 1% to $156 million due primarily to the addition of the recent acquisition. Adjusted administrative expenses benefited from approximately $3 million in cost synergy realization from our acquisition integration plan that I will touch on a bit more when covering our next slide.\nAs shown on Slide 27, third quarter adjusted EBIT increased 13% and adjusted EBIT margin increased 90 basis points primarily due to higher adjusted gross profit from the contribution of the acquisition and the base business. This was partially offset by higher adjusted expenses, including marketing and selling, administrative, research and development and other expenses, primarily due to the addition of Sovos Brands expense in these P&L categories. As mentioned earlier, these higher adjusted admin expenses were partially offset by approximately $3 million in cost synergies related to our Sovos Brands integration plan. We expect to realize a total of $50 million in annualized cost synergies by the end of the second year post close, of which about 2/3 are expected in the administrative expense area and the balance in cost of products sold. As Mark indicated, we are pleased with the pace of the integration and look forward to sharing more about the next phase of our cost savings initiatives at our Investor Day in mid-September, which will encompass Sovos synergy savings as well as incremental supply chain network savings.\nOn Slide 28, adjusted EPS increased double digit to $0.75, primarily reflecting higher adjusted EBIT and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, partially offset by higher adjusted net interest expense related to higher levels of debt to fund the acquisition. As we mentioned earlier, the acquisition was approximately neutral to adjusted EPS.\nIn Meals and Beverages, third quarter reported net sales increased 15% due to the partial quarter contribution of the Sovos Brands acquisition. Pro forma third quarter net sales growth for the division as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal '23, was approximately 5%, driven by the respective pro forma Q3 growth of Sovos Brands of approximately 27%. This Q3 pro forma Sovos growth benefited from the timing of Rao's sauce inventory builds and a shift in the timing of our promotion in nonmeasured channels.\nOrganic net sales for Meals & Beverages, excluding the acquisition, were flat with the favorable impact of volume and mix offset by net price realization. In the quarter, gains in our foodservice business were offset by lower sales in U.S. retail, where we saw declines in beverages, Campbell's pasta and Swanson canned poultry, partially offset by gains in Prego pasta sauce and U.S. soup. In U.S. soup, sales increased 2%, an encouraging indicator in the business and supportive of the expected sequential improvement in the second half of fiscal '24. A 2% sales increase was primarily due to an increase in broth sales, partially offset by lower sales of ready-to-serve and condensed soups. In addition, we were pleased with the third quarter Meals & Beverages operating margin of 18%, which improved 160 basis points year-over-year, more than absorbing the impact of the recent acquisition, which, as I mentioned earlier, has a lower margin profile than the base business.\nThird quarter organic net sales in Snacks were slightly lower by 1%, but we were encouraged by the continued sequential improvement of the year-over-year volume trends from the second quarter. The lower sales were primarily driven by declines in third-party partner brands, contract manufacturing and bakery, partially offset by a 2% increase in our Snacks power brands. On a 2-year compounded annual basis, Snacks organic net sales and power brands net sales increased 6% and 9%, respectively. Net price realization was neutral in the quarter. Third quarter operating margin for Snacks was 15.2%. This was a lower margin compared to last year but came in as expected due to lapping a tougher comparison with last year's Q3 margin benefiting from the combination of pricing waves and the timing of fiscal '23 marketing and selling expenses. Year-to-date margins of 14.9% have improved 40 basis points from the prior year and are approaching our 15% goal for the full year fiscal 2024. We intend to share more details related to our longer-term road map for a snacks margin of 17% during our Investor Day.\nTurning to Slide 31. We continue to generate strong cash flow from operations of nearly $900 million through the end of the third quarter. This result was slightly lower than prior year, primarily due to costs related to the acquisition. Year-to-date capital expenditures were $376 million, up from $257 million in the prior year as we continue to prioritize key growth and capability-building investments. We also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders with $334 million of dividends paid and $46 million in anti-dilutive share repurchases year-to-date. With the closing of the Sovos Brands acquisition in the quarter, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage at the end of the third quarter was 3.9x as expected. We remain committed to investment-grade ratings and our goal to return to our 3x net leverage target by the end of year 3 post close. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $107 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.85 billion available under our revolving credit facility, which we renewed this quarter. We are updating our fiscal 2024 full year guidance to reflect the expected performance of the base business and the impact of the recent acquisition. Full year reported net sales are expected to increase approximately 3% to 4%, driven by the partial year of net sales contribution of Sovos Brands. Full year organic net sales growth is currently pacing to the midpoint of our updated range of approximately flat to down 1%, reflecting the current pace of consumer recovery. At the midpoint, this represents about 0.5 point lower than what we indicated on our second quarter earnings call when we said we expected organic net sales to be at the low end of flat to 2%.\nAs Mark mentioned, and like other companies in the food industry, we continue to be impacted by a dynamic macroeconomic environment and observing a discerning consumer that is particularly impacted at lower income levels. At the midpoint of our updated net sales guidance, implied fourth quarter organic net sales growth is expected to moderately increase sequentially from Q3 and and we expect a low teens pro forma net sales contribution from Sovos Brands in Q4, reflecting the timing shifts from Q3 that I mentioned earlier. We feel really good about the performance of Sovos Brands, specifically Rao's with sales growing faster than our expectations at the time of the deal announcement, thus enabling us to benefit from a higher level of adjusted EBIT contribution since closing. Moving forward, we still expect long-term Sovos Brands net sales growth to be in the mid-single-digit range. We'll provide more specifics on near-term fiscal '25 expectations on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nFull year adjusted EBIT growth for the combined business is expected to be approximately 6.5% to 7%, reflecting the partial year contribution of the acquisition, inclusive of integration savings and base business performance, including lower adjusted marketing and selling expenses and favorable net price realization, productivity and cost savings more than offsetting inflation and other supply chain costs. This outlook implies fourth quarter double-digit adjusted EBIT growth driven by the contribution of the acquisition and the performance in the base business, including improving adjusted gross margin as well as lapping a 23% increase in A&C in the prior year.\nAs a reminder, the adjusted EBIT contribution of Sovos in our results include stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense, whereas historically when Sovos was a stand-alone company, these costs were not included in their adjusted results. Annual transaction-related depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million, in line with our original expectations. Full year adjusted EPS for the combined business is expected to be up approximately 2% to 3% in a range of $3.07 to $3.10. This includes expected dilution from the Sovos acquisition between $0.01 to $0.02 per share for fiscal '24. This full year outlook also implies double-digit growth in Q4 adjusted EPS, driven by expected higher adjusted EBIT partially offset by higher net interest expense related to the acquisition.\nAnd then a few other guidance items that I'll update. Full year cost savings towards our $1 billion enterprise-wide program are expected to be in the range of $55 million to $60 million. Full year adjusted net interest expense is now expected to be approximately $245 million versus our prior forecast of $185 million to $190 million, reflecting incremental interest expense associated with the new acquisition-related debt. And full year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million as we continue to invest in our business for the long run. All other underlying guidance assumptions remain unchanged.\nTo wrap up, we were pleased with our third quarter results, delivering double-digit growth in both adjusted EBIT and EPS and margin expansion as well as better-than-expected acquisition performance. As we head into Q4, we remain encouraged by the continued expectation for improving volume trends in the business, another quarter of double-digit adjusted EBIT and earnings per share growth and building on the great start to the integration of the Sovos Brands business.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell. Joining me today are Mark Clouse, Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer. Today's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location, followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation.\nSlide 4 outlines today's agenda. Mark will provide insights into our second quarter performance as well as in-market performance by division. Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and outline our guidance for the full fiscal year 2024, which we reaffirmed this morning. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. As you saw in our press release this morning, we once again delivered on our commitments, with sequential improvement in volume trends and year-over-year operating margin expansion in both divisions.\nWhile it is true that category trends have slowed over the last year, I'm encouraged by a variety of stabilizing consumer indicators like consumer sentiment, household penetration and average categories purchased. However, we are also continuing to see economic pressure impacting select categories and certain consumer demographics. While we expect these trends to improve over time, we're certainly not there yet. In the meantime, I continue to be very happy with our team's ability to control the controllables, including managing our supply chain and in-market execution.\nLooking ahead, we are affirming our full year outlook as we anticipate continued sequential improvement in top line, earnings and margin progress while sustaining our best-in-class navigation of this volatile environment. Carrie will elaborate on that a bit later.\nWith that strong foundation in place on the base business, we are eagerly anticipating the closing of the Sovos Brands acquisition in the coming week, adding the best volume-driven growth story in food to our portfolio.\nAt an upcoming Investor Day in late June, we look forward to sharing the vision for Campbell's next chapter, driven by what will be one of the most focused and advantaged portfolios in the industry.\nTurning to Slide 7. As expected, organic net sales in the second quarter decreased 1% to $2.5 billion, in line with consumption, with many of our brands exceeding their respective category growth rates and growing share. On a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis, [indiscernible] grew 6%, adjusted EBIT increased 1% and adjusted EPS was comparable to the prior year, following double-digit increases in both key measures a year ago.\nOn Slide 8, we've highlighted the success of both businesses during the holiday season, including in strategic categories, such as condensed cooking in our Meals & Beverages division and cookies in our Snacks division. Our holiday focus brands delivered a 4% increase in total volume compared to the prior year, driven by our strong brand support programs, terrific in-store execution and robust consumer demand.\nSpecifically, we had healthy volume and dollar share gains across key seasonal categories such as condensed cooking soup, broth, Pepperidge Farm cookies and Pepperidge Farm stuffing. During the quarter, condensed cooking holiday volume share reached a 5-year high, with volume share gains in each of the 9 weeks during the holiday period.\nIn addition, we saw momentum in our Snacks portfolio with brands like Lance, Snack Factory and Late July, all reaching 5-year highs in volume share. Importantly, we delivered these results while addressing an important question about our ability to achieve this, while also balancing profitability. I believe we demonstrated this, evidenced by the operating margin expansion in both divisions.\nTurning to Slide 9. I wanted to take a moment to discuss the top line expectations for the second half of the fiscal year, as this is both an important driver and a somewhat difficult area to forecast. As we have consistently shared since providing initial guidance, our net sales expectations reflect a range of time lines for the category stabilization and consumer recovery.\nOur results through Q2 have been aligned with our outlook. As we look at far easier comparisons ahead, we remain confident in modest sequential improvement throughout the remainder of fiscal 2024. More specifically, we expect flat to low single-digit organic net sales growth in Q3, with continued sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.\nAlthough this trajectory suggests the lower end of our net sales guidance range, we have half the year remaining at a variety of compelling drivers to help accelerate the recovery. With our supply chain in full force, effective marketing and accelerating innovation and strong but disciplined promotional activity, we look forward to monitoring the pace of consumer recovery closely, with in-market results serving as a clear indicator of that progress.\nTurning to our Meals & Beverages business, we experienced a low single-digit organic net sales decline in the second quarter which, as expected, tracked closely to consumption. On a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis, top line grew 4%, while consumption grew 2%. For the balance of the year, we remain confident in the growth and margin trajectory of this business, as consumers continue to seek out our brands for value and quality in a dynamic environment and year ago comparisons moderate significantly.\nTurning to Slide 11. Consumers continue to prioritize value as shown by their preference for home cooked meals, purchasing food that helped them prepare stretchable meals and smaller and less frequent shopping trips. Our soup portfolio is especially well suited to meet these needs.\nOur condensed cooking portfolio saw both dollar and volume share increase in the quarter, marking the sixth consecutive quarter we've held or grew both metrics. We also saw similar strength in our broth portfolio, with Swanson Broth and Stock growing above the category rate and dollar consumption up 13%. In addition, while growing consumption, this portion of our portfolio also had dollar and volume share gains in the quarter.\nWhile the eating soup landscape remains more challenging, we did see sequential improvement in the second quarter, as it relates to dollar share on Chunky and our condensed eating portfolio. The longer-term outlook for ready-to-serve soup remains quite strong, supported by a combination of continued Chunky innovation and marketing, expansion of the successful launch of Pacific ready-to-eat soup. And we're also excited about the impact of including the strength of the super premium Rao's soup line, adding approximately a full point of share growth to the portfolio.\nOn Slide 12, let's look more broadly at what the potential next chapter of this great division could be, as we prepare to welcome the talented Sovos team to Campbell's. As we announced last month, both companies have certified substantial compliance with the Federal Trade Commission's second request, and we're excited to be one step closer to completing the acquisition.\nJust last week, with our fourth quarter and full year fiscal '23 earnings results, Sovos announced that they had surpassed $1 billion in annual net sales, a 16% increase versus prior year, led by Rao's, which continues to showcase its premium brand equity with consumers, with dollar consumption up nearly 32% in Pasta sauce and 53% in the combined frozen meals and pizza segment, jarred soup and dry pasta categories.\nWhen paired with our Meals and Beverages iconic category-leading brands and our distinctive fast-growing Pacific Foods brand, the Sovos Brands portfolio will strengthen the division for years to come. In fact, although not an apples-to-apples comparison, if we were to simply overlay Sovos results in the last quarter with our Meals and Beverage results, we would have gained approximately 4 points of organic top line growth. Imagine for a moment now, the value of combining this with our differentiated snacks portfolio, and you can appreciate our confidence in the strength of this portfolio headed into the future.\nSo now let's turn to our differentiated snacks business on Slide 13. We delivered a second quarter organic net sales increase of 1%, 1 point ahead of consumption in measured channels.\nOur Power Brands net sales grew 4%, following a 20% increase in the prior year for 12% growth on a 2-year compound annual rate basis. We were pleased with the net sales performance on brands such as Goldfish, Lance, Kettle Brand and Cape Cod, adding to the remarkable track record of our Power Brands portfolio, even as consumers continue to navigate a tough economic environment.\nDuring the quarter, we experienced anticipated pockets of pressure in some of our lower-margin businesses, specifically Partner Brands and fresh bakery. We continue to balance short-term competitiveness and sustainable margins, while taking steps to optimize this portfolio for the future. Partner Brands were a 1 point growth headwind to the portfolio. Although we expect this to continue going forward, it further strengthens the focus of our portfolio on our Advantage power brands.\nOn the next slide, we highlight the sustained resilience of our power brands. As dollar consumption has grown 24% versus 2 years ago, we're encouraged by the continued appetite for our core portfolio, which now represents 2/3 of total snacks net sales. More importantly, we see continued progress on dollar share, as power brands have held or gained share for 7 straight quarters.\nTurning to Slide 15. I want to highlight our Goldfish business, which has now held or grown dollar share for 6 consecutive quarters. Our exciting innovations, proven limited time-only strategy and strong marketing execution have fueled continued momentum for our portfolio. And our latest innovation, Goldfish Crisps, are off to an amazing start.\nLaunched in January, we realized strong velocities greater than other recent category launches and it has exceeded our initial expectations, as we begin to move Goldfish into adjacent occasions. The news on Goldfish gets even more exciting. Goldfish has now officially crossed $1 billion in net sales, making it the second billion dollar brand in our portfolio, alongside Campbell's iconic red and white soup.\nOur strategy over the past few years and our continued innovation momentum has propelled Goldfish to its next phase of growth. We remain excited about this brand's momentum and see an incredible road for growth ahead, as we strive to make Goldfish a North American mega brand.\nOn Slide 17, I am also excited to share the continued progress we've made on our Snacks margin road map. On a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis, we grew organic net sales by 8% and operating earnings by 15%, with approximately 200 basis points of margin expansion. We've made great progress this year and remain on track to finish fiscal '24 at an operating margin of approximately 15%. And as we continue to solidify our margin road map, we are confident in our ability to add about 100 basis points per year for the next couple of years, thus reaching our target of 17% operating margin for the division by the end of fiscal '26.\nEven more exciting is the fact that as we further refine our route to market and direct store delivery or DSD model, we are identifying even more potential efficiencies and savings, to fund further investment in the brands or to further expand operating margins beyond 17% in the future.\nTurning to our DSD transformation initiative on Slide 18, I wanted to provide an update on our route strategy, which adds another important element for our plans to create essentially, a single snacks network. As we discussed during our first quarter earnings call, we're already executing the integration of our warehouse and depot network, as well as upgrading technology across our network and the independent distributor network, with the goal of improving efficiency and effectiveness. This leaves independent distributor DSD routes as our next optimization area.\nToday, the majority of our routes are already operating efficiently, where the scale of the business supports separate routes for Pepperidge Farm snacks and Snyder's-Lance. We expect no change in these routes. However, for some of our routes, we do not have enough scale to help maximize the economics or efficiency of these routes if they remain separated.\nTo solve this, we've been testing the combination of the entire snacks portfolio on one truck. In these limited underscaled markets, we purchased certain Pepperidge Farm snacks and Snyder's-Lance routes, combine them and sell the combined routes back to independent distributors. We're seeing that beyond the efficiency of this, independent distributors have an opportunity to provide better execution and improved service for our customers.\nWhen we pair this improved route with our already existing plans to combine the warehouse system into a single location, the net impact should create better scale and help unlock growth for our business, while also having to benefit both the area independent distributors and our customers with more compelling economics.\nIt's still early days, but the results we have seen thus far, give us confidence to expand our pilots and execute a pay-as-you-go model in creating these combo routes. We expect to convert about 1/5 of the snacks routes nationwide into combo routes over a multiyear road map. This plan will not require significant upfront financial outlay. And as I mentioned earlier, we plan to manage it as a pay-as-you-go model.\nLet me share a little more detail behind this strategy. First, these routes will vary in location, including urban, rural and suburban areas. Second, there are no plans to combine the Pepperidge Farm bakery routes, as the focus is on gaining scale and capturing growth across our snacks portfolio. Third, in markets where we've executed this strategy, the time between purchase and resale has been swift. And finally, given the financial attractiveness of these routes, we're seeing a meaningful increase in multi-route ownership by experienced independent distributors that are existing snacks and bakery IDPs.\nSo wrapping up, the second quarter was another solid and consistent quarter, while keeping us on track for the year. Looking ahead, there is so much to be excited about as we continue the transformation of Campbell's. And again, we look forward to providing these details this summer in a full Investor Day.\nNext up, Carrie will take you through the second quarter and the second half outlook in a bit more detail.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing an overview of our second quarter results, with a top line that came in as expected, operating margin expansion in both the Meals and Beverages and Snacks divisions and adjusted EPS ahead of our expectations.\nSecond quarter organic net sales decreased 1%, lapping a 13% increase in the prior year, for a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of 6%. Adjusted EBIT increased 1% to $364 million, reflecting higher adjusted gross profit, partially offset by higher adjusted expenses, including other expenses, R&D expenses and administrative expenses. Adjusted EPS of $0.80 in the quarter was in line with prior year and lapped double-digit growth last year.\nSlide 22 provides the drivers of our second quarter net sales performance. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of the [ Emerald ] nut business, organic net sales were lower by 1%. During the quarter, we generated 1 percentage point of growth from net price realization, offset by volume and mix, which was unfavorable by 2 percentage points, in line with the sequential improvement from Q1 that we expected.\nAs shown on Slide 23, second quarter adjusted gross profit margin was 31.4%. We were pleased with the 70 basis point margin expansion, which was driven by supply chain productivity improvements, net price realization, cost savings initiatives and the favorable impact of volume and mix, which more than offset cost inflation and other supply chain costs.\nCore inflation in Q2 was low single digits, consistent with Q1, and significantly lower than the 14% in the prior year, driven by attenuation in inputs such as flour and oil. We continue to expect core inflation to stay within this low single-digit range for the remainder of fiscal '24, down from the double-digit range last year.\nNet pricing averaged 1% for the quarter, reflecting the remaining contribution from our Wave 4 pricing, our smallest and most focused pricing round. As a reminder, our Wave 4 pricing is now fully lapped. During the second half of the fiscal year, we do not expect net pricing to be a material driver of net sales growth, reflecting our continued balance and disciplined promotional activity.\nWe continue to deploy a range of other levers to mitigate remaining inflation, including supply chain productivity improvements and broader margin-enhancing initiatives. We expect these other levers to contribute to margin performance in the second half of the year, as inflation remains moderate and volume trends continue to sequentially improve.\nThrough the first half, we have achieved $915 million of total savings under our multiyear cost savings program, inclusive of Snyder-Lance synergies. We remain on track to deliver savings of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.\nMoving on to other operating items. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses were comparable to the prior year. Marketing and selling also remained approximately 9% of net sales, consistent with our targeted level. Adjusted administrative expenses increased by $2 million, primarily due to higher general and administrative costs and inflation, mostly offset by the benefits of cost savings initiatives.\nAs shown on Slide 25, adjusted EBIT for the second quarter increased 1%, primarily due to higher adjusted gross profit, partially offset by higher adjusted expenses, including other expenses, R&D expenses and administrative expenses. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 14.8% in the quarter, primarily driven by a higher adjusted gross profit margin.\nTurning to Slide 26. Adjusted EPS of $0.80 was comparable to the prior year, and was driven by a slight increase in adjusted EBIT and the benefit of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding, partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate.\nTurning to Meals & Beverages. Second quarter organic net sales decreased 2%, driven by unfavorable volume and mix. Lapping an 11% increase in organic net sales in the prior year quarter, Meals & Beverages organic net sales grew 4% on a 2-year compounded annual growth rate.\nDuring the quarter, modest declines in U.S. retail were partially offset by increases in Canada and Foodservice. Sales of U.S. Soup decreased 3%, following a 7% increase in the prior year, primarily due to lower sales of ready-to-serve and condensed soups, partially offset by an increase in broth.\nWe were encouraged by the sequential volume improvement trends we achieved in the quarter, with Meals & Beverages volume only down 2% year-over-year compared to a 6% decline in Q1. On a first half basis, organic net sales decreased 3%, lapping a 13% increase in the prior year.\nWe were also pleased with the progress we've made on Meals & Beverages operating margins. While segment operating earnings in the quarter for Meals & Beverages were down just slightly, operating margin increased 20 basis points to 17.9%. This was better than expected, and we anticipate continued sequential improvement into the second half. Meals & Beverages operating margin for the first half was 19.2%.\nIn Snacks, second quarter organic net sales increased 1%. On a 2-year compounded annual basis, organic net sales increased 8%. For Q2, the increase reflects a net price realization of 3%, partially offset by unfavorable volume and mix of 2%.\nSimilar to the comments I made when discussing Meals & Beverages results, we were also pleased with the sequential improvement in volume trends in our Snacks business, with Snacks volumes only down 2% year-over-year in the second quarter compared to a 4% decline in the first quarter.\nSales of our 8 power brands increased 4% in Q2, with volumes relatively flat. And for the first half, organic net sales increased 1%, lapping a 15% increase in the prior year.\nWe delivered solid operating earnings and margin performance in Snacks, with a 7% increase in segment operating earnings and a 110 basis point improvement in operating margins in the quarter. The higher operating earnings were driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by planned higher marketing and selling expenses.\nGross profit margin increased due to the impact of net price realization, supply chain productivity improvements, the benefit from cost savings initiatives and favorable volume and mix more than offsetting higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs.\nSnacks operating margin reached 15% in Q2, and for the first half, operating margin was 14.7%. As a reminder, the Snacks margin in the third quarter of fiscal '23 was 16%, up 330 basis points. This was driven by the benefit of last year's wave 4 pricing, net of inflation and the timing of marketing spend.\nSo although we do expect negative pressure on Q3 margins, given the lap from the prior year comp, we remain on track to approximately 15% margin for the year. As Mark mentioned earlier, we further expect Snacks margins to increase approximately 100 basis points per year over the next 2 years, reaching our stated goal of 17% by the end of fiscal '26.\nI'll now turn to cash flow on Slide 29. We generated $684 million in operating cash flow in the first half and deployed that cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities to maximize long-term shareholder value.\nYear-to-date capital expenditures were $263 million, $108 million higher than in the prior year, reflecting our commitment to invest for growth, particularly in capacity for our Snacks division, as well as investments to drive productivity and enhance business capabilities.\nWe also continued our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, with $224 million of dividends paid and $29 million of anti-dilutive share repurchases in the first half.\nOur balance sheet continues to be stable, with net debt of $4.4 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.6x.\nAt the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $169 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.85 billion available under our revolving credit facility.\nAll in, with the $2 billion delayed single draw term loan credit agreement, we are well positioned to close the pending Sovos Brands acquisition.\nAs you'll see on Slide 30, given the consistent and improving performance in Q2, we are reaffirming our full year guidance provided on August 31.\nIn the second half of fiscal '24, we continue to expect earnings growth and margin progress, particularly in Q4, benefiting from improving volume and mix trends, moderate inflation levels and the flow-through of ongoing productivity improvements, as well as second half marketing and selling expenses at our stated targets which will provide some year-over-year margin benefit in the second half.\nTo provide a bit more clarity about the phasing of the second half, in Q3, we would expect adjusted EPS to be in the lower $0.70 range. As Mark mentioned earlier, top line guidance reflects a range of outcomes based on the speed of in-market category stabilization. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in year-over-year sales, with first half volumes coming in largely as anticipated, and we remain highly confident in the continued stabilization and ultimately returning to growth in the second half.\nWe are currently pacing to the lower end of the net sales guidance range for the full year. However, we still have half of the year remaining, with excellent plans and innovation to help accelerate the rate of sequential improvement moving forward. We will continue to invest in our brands with marketing and selling expenses as a percent of net sales expected at the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% range.\nFrom a phasing perspective, we expect to spend more in the third quarter relative to the fourth quarter. All other guidance assumptions remain unchanged. Additionally, the pending acquisition of Sovos brands is currently expected to close the week of March 11, 2024, and is not included in our current fiscal '24 outlook. After the transaction closes, we expect to update guidance for the combined business during our third quarter call.\nTo wrap up, our second quarter tracked closely to our expectations, driven largely by the actions we undertook to position our business for second half momentum. We are confident in our plans for the rest of the fiscal year, and our team remains focused on executing our strategy.\nWithin both segments of our business, we expect to deliver margin momentum in the second half, paired with improvements in the trajectory of volume and mix. In addition, we are excited to be one step closer to completing the Sovos Brands acquisition and look forward to welcoming their team to Campbell's.\nWith that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell.\nJoining me today are Mark Clouse, Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer. Today's remarks have been pre-recorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of our presentation.\nSlide 4 outlines today's agenda. Mark will provide insights into our first quarter performance as well as in-market performance by division. Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and outline our guidance for the full fiscal year 2024, which we reaffirmed this morning.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. From Campbell's management team, we hope you enjoyed a happy Thanksgiving with family, friends and of course, some green bean casserole and Pepperidge Farm stuffing.\nAs you saw in our press release this morning, we reported first quarter results with top line coming in consistent with our expectations. And adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS coming in slightly ahead as we lapped one of our strongest quarters with 15% growth across all 3 key metrics in the prior year. I am pleased with these results as we continue to negate [indiscernible] evolving and challenging consumer environment. We also made material progress advancing the key initiatives of our focused strategic plan and continue to build confidence in the next stage of Campbell's growth. I am encouraged by the consistency of our outstanding execution, including strong sustained performance across our supply chain, numerous successful innovations and marketing programs and more recently, improving share trends. We achieved all this while maintaining our margin and earnings expectations.\nGoing forward, we anticipate these areas of focus to fuel sequential improvement over the course of the year generating momentum in terms of revenue, volumes, market share and profit margins, particularly as we head into the second half of fiscal '24. As a result, we remain confident and are affirming our full year guidance. We believe this building momentum, paired with the pending acquisition of Sovos Brands, will set the stage for accelerated growth and solidify Campbell's position as one of the most dependable names in food.\nTurning to Slide 7. As expected, organic net sales decreased by 1% to $2.5 billion, following a 15% increase in the prior year resulting in growth of approximately 7% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS declined 9% and 11%, respectively, following a 15% increase in both key measures the prior year. Our dollar consumption was down 2% but grew 8% versus 2 years ago.\nIn line with expectations we communicated during our fourth quarter earnings call, the consumer landscape remains challenging. However, we have many opportunities within our portfolio to meet the shifting macro consumer trends and have optimized our strategies and plans concentrating on 3 key areas. First, we're dedicated to ensuring the affordability of our products and maintaining competitive price gaps within our margin goals. This is particularly important, especially as consumers seek to maximize the value of their spending, stretching their budgets to cover the cost of family meals every day and during the important holiday season.\nSecond, we are committed to sustaining our marketing and innovation plans. This is critical not only to reinforce the value and differentiation of our products but also to continue to build the long-term equity of our brands on which we've made significant progress in recent years.\nFinally, our approach to spending remains disciplined and balanced focused on high ROI and impactful programs. We are driving productivity and making appropriate trade-offs to fuel this investment while we protect our margin and earnings objectives where support has been added, we believe it's both sustainable and profitable.\nWe intend to maintain this focused approach throughout fiscal '24, and we are confident that we will build momentum as the year progresses and continue to deliver our financial commitments. We remain confident in this forecasted improvement in trends throughout the year for a number of reasons. It's important to recall that our growth rates in the first half of fiscal '23 averaged in the mid-teens and subsequently tapered down to mid-single-digit growth in the second half. This approximate 10-point decline in part reflected a slowing in incremental pricing. These more modest comparables post Q2 support our expectations for improving top line and volumes.\nIn addition, we have a robust pipeline of innovation and marketing programs informed by the current consumer trends to also fuel the improving outlook. So although the consumer landscape remains dynamic, we are well positioned for improvement and we'll continue to plan contingencies and remain nimble as we navigate the balance of the year.\nTurning to our Meals & Beverages division. As planned, we experienced a low to mid-single-digit decline in top line and consumption in the first quarter. On a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis, organic net sales were up 6%, and dollar consumption was up 1%. The difference in net sales and consumption growth rates reflect the strength in our food service business and unmeasured channels as well as a year ago supply and inventory recovery. Within these results, we find many reasons to remain confident in the trajectory of the business as consumers depend more and more on affordable stretchable meal solutions, which is at the core of our Meals & Beverages division.\nTurning to our Soup portfolio on Slide 11. As anticipated, throughout the summer, we experienced decreases in dollar consumption overall. However, within these results, there are pockets of strength. For example, as consumers sought to stretch their food budget, they turn to the strong value and convenience of the cooking portions of our portfolio. In fact, in our condensed cooking portfolio, we gained dollar share for the fifth consecutive quarter, increasing 1.5 share points in the quarter. Even among younger households, we continue to see long-term potential as household penetration of total condensed cooking soups gained 0.4 points versus the prior year.\nIn our broth business, we continue to drive relevance among consumers in this dynamic environment as total broth was up 4% behind the strength of our Pacific broth portfolio, which saw dollar consumption grow 16% well above the category rate.\nThe ready-to-serve and condensed eating businesses experienced more pressure in the quarter as a result of more consumers shifting to more stretchable meals versus single-serve options.\nTurning to Page 12. As we have begun ramping up planned support in anticipation of the important holiday season, trends have been improving, especially as it relates to share. In fact, over the latest 4 weeks, including Thanksgiving, we've seen improvement in all segments driving overall dollar and unit share gains including a 0.2 improvement in dollar share as well as a 0.9 improvement in unit share for our very important total [indiscernible] business. Importantly, we are doing this with modest incremental investment as we are seeing more retailers actively returning to Campbell's brands from private label a year ago. This is providing an outsized benefit while we continue to balance the critical interplay between growing share, volumes and margins in line with our [ expectations ]. Although the category remains somewhat under pressure on dollars, it's very encouraging to see improvement in both share and units as we head deeper into our key season.\nTurning to our Snacks business. We delivered first quarter organic net sales growth of 1%, consistent with the increase in [indiscernible] consumption. Our Power Brands grew net sales by a solid 5% following a 21% increase in the prior year for a 13% growth on a 2-year compound annual rate basis. Even with some emerging broader category pressure due to the consumer dynamics that we discussed earlier, our 8 power brands have showed a remarkable resilience with brands like Goldfish and Lance posting net sales growth of 5% and 15%, respectively. The [indiscernible] Power brands was tempered in the quarter, by lower-margin partner brands and fresh bakery as those businesses are somewhat more vulnerable to private label and consumer trade down.\nOn the following slide, we highlighted the continued strength of each of our power brands. Dollar consumption grew 3% versus the prior year and 19% versus 2 years ago, while 5 of 8 power brands held or gained share in the quarter. Our 8 power brands, which now represent approximately 2/3 of the Vision net sales remain a powerful and consistent growth engine even in the current consumer environment.\nTurning to Slide 15. A prime example of our Snacks power brand growth engine is Goldfish. For the fifth consecutive time, Goldfish has been named team's most preferred snack brand according to Piper Sandler's taking stock with teens, most recently in the fall 2023 survey. This recognition is the result of the remarkable work of our cross-functional teams and expanding the brand to a broader audience and adding manufacturing capacity to meet the incredible demand for this product. We continue to see share strength in the overall portfolio as Goldfish marked its fifth consecutive quarter of holding or gaining their share.\nOne of the keys to our Goldfish success has been a steady drumbeat of innovation. On this front, we're excited to bring to consumers our latest limited time offer for the holiday season. Goldfish [indiscernible]Maple syrup flavored grahams in partnership with Warner Bros. Discovery, celebrating the 20th anniversary of its iconic movie Elf. Is there anything better than Maple syrup Goldfish to spread holiday cheer and it's perfect for stocking stuffers or snacking all season long.\nAnd there's even more exciting innovation in Goldfish in store this year. Adding to the incredible success of innovations like Goldfish Mega Bites and our run of limited time offers, we are reinventing the category again in a way only Goldfish can with the introduction of Goldfish Crisps. Crisps, for the way that Goldfish does chips, the best of Goldfish with the best of chips combined into an irresistible light Aerie crispy fish-shaped baked snack. Launching in 3 craveable flavors, Goldfish Crisp will be available at retailers nationwide in January.\nOn Slide 17, I want to highlight the margin momentum that the Snacks division has demonstrated. On a 2-year compound annual growth rate basis, we grew Snacks organic net sales by 8% and operating earnings by 12% with approximately 130 basis points of margin expansion. Consistent with our long-term margin road map of achieving 17%, we remain confident in fiscal '24 expectations to finish above 15%. And now we're adding even more fuel to our Snacks growth and margin journey with our DSD transformation initiative. This includes 3 key elements you see on Slide 18, 2 of which were already progressing.\nFirst, creating one snacking DSD logistics and warehouse network. This multiyear program will streamline our logistics and warehouse network, eliminate redundancy, simplify our network and improve our technology and capabilities within our warehouses and depots. Second, modernizing and harmonizing tools and technology used by our critical independent distribution partners. This will enable new capabilities and help enhance effectiveness and focus. In addition, this also allowed better retailer linkage and alignment to orders while improving in-store insights. And third, we'll focus on DSD routes. The good news is the vast majority of geographies already have scaled routes and in combination with the upgrades from the first 2 elements of our DSD transformation. These will be fully optimized going forward. To help improve geographies where routes are not operating at full scale, we're piloting a variety of potential solutions with encouraging early results. I'll share more about this third and very important element in our Q2 earnings call.\nWe're excited to have made so much progress in such a unique and critical part of our business. And in the end, this will result in a strong and differentiated DSD platform to fuel both the growth and margins of the Snacks business.\nBefore I conclude, let me provide a brief update on the status of our pending acquisition of Sovos Brands. As we announced in October, we received a second request for information from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the agency's review of Campbell's proposed acquisition. We are working hard to complete those requests and are advancing our integration planning. I continue to be impressed with the strong results the Sovos team is delivering and could not be more excited about completing the acquisition and fueling our next chapter of growth. We expect to complete the deal in the next calendar year, and we'll continue to engage with the FTC on their review with the objective of closing the transaction in mid-2024.\nIn closing, the first quarter unfolded much as we anticipated, continuing our consistent track record of meeting our commitments.\nLooking ahead, I am confident and optimistic about the balance of the year. We will remain vigilant and agile to meet the evolving demands of consumers while continuing to progress our strategic plans.\nWith that, I'd like to wish all of you and my colleagues across the company a happy holiday season and thank the entire team at Campbell's for their ongoing incredible and impactful work.\nAnd now I'll pass it to Carrie.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter results.\nAs Mark indicated, our top line finished as we anticipated and adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS came in slightly better primarily due to the timing of adjusted marketing, selling and administrative expenses. Our organic net sales decline of 1% reflects mid-single-digit expected volume declines, a lower contribution from pricing and disciplined levels of promotion activity. Lapping a 15% increase in organic net sales in the prior year, organic net sales grew approximately 7% on a 2-year compounded annual growth rate.\nAdjusted EBIT decreased 9% to $407 million, reflecting lower adjusted gross profit, a commitment to continued marketing and selling investments and lower benefits from pension and postretirement income, partially offset by lower adjusted administrative expenses. Adjusted EPS decreased 11% to $0.91, driven primarily by lower adjusted EBIT and slightly higher interest expense partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nSlide 22 summarizes the drivers of our first quarter net sales performance. Excluding the impact of the Emerald nut business divestiture, organic net sales declined 1%. We generated 3 percentage points of growth from net price realization and volume and mix declined 5 percentage points, in line with expectations.\nAs shown on Slide 23, our first quarter adjusted gross profit margin of 32.1% decreased a modest 10 basis points with the year-over-year change in margin driven primarily by unfavorable volume and mix. As shown on the bridge, the combination of net price realization, productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives offset higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs.\nTurning to Slide 24. We continue to successfully mitigate inflationary headwinds with core inflation moderating to 2% in the first quarter driven by attenuation in key inputs such as flower and oil. We expect core inflation to stay within this low single-digit range for the full year, down from the 12% we saw in fiscal '23. Net pricing averaged 3% for the quarter, reflecting the contribution from our Wave 4 pricing, our smallest and most focused pricing round. As a reminder, our Wave 4 pricing will be fully lapped at the end of Q2 fiscal '24.\nIn addition to pricing, we continue to deploy a range of other levers to mitigate inflation including supply chain productivity improvements and broader margin-enhancing initiatives, including a focus on discretionary spending across the organization. These other levers will start to have a greater contribution to margin performance as inflation continues to moderate and volume normalizes especially moving into the second half of the fiscal year.\nWe are pleased with the progress we have made on our cost savings initiatives. Through the first quarter, we have achieved $895 million of [ tubings ] under our multi-[indiscernible] program, inclusive of Snyder-Lance synergies. We remain on track to deliver savings of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.\nMoving on to other operating items. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 9%, driven by higher selling expenses, higher advertising and consumer promotion expense or AMC, will increase 6% compared to the prior year and higher other marketing expenses. On both a reported and adjusted basis, marketing and selling expenses represented approximately 9% of net sales for the quarter. Adjusted administrative expenses decreased by $5 million due to lower general administrative costs partially offset by inflation. We saw some timing favorability in adjusted marketing, selling and other administrative expenses in the quarter, but expect this to be rephased into Q2 to keep the first half in line with expectations.\nAs shown on Slide 26, adjusted EBIT for the first quarter decreased 9%, primarily due to lower adjusted gross profit, higher adjusted marketing and selling expenses and lower benefits from pension and postretirement income, partially offset by lower adjusted administrative expenses. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased to 16.2% in the quarter primarily driven by higher adjusted marketing and selling expenses and changes in pension and postretirement benefit income.\nTurning to Slide 27. Adjusted EPS of $0.91 was down 11% or $0.11 per share compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by the decrease in adjusted EBIT and slightly higher interest expense partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Changes in pension and post retirement benefit income drove an approximate $0.01 impact to adjusted EPS in the quarter.\nTurning to the segments. In Meals & Beverage, first quarter organic net sales decreased 3%, driven by an approximate 6% volume and mix decline partially offset by 2% net price realization. Lapping a 15% increase in organic net sales in the prior year, Meals & Beverage organic net sales grew approximately 6% on a 2-year compound annual growth rate. During the quarter, declines in U.S. retail products were partially offset by an increase in food service.\nSales of U.S. Soup decreased 5%, following an 11% increase in the prior year, primarily due to declines in condensed and ready-to-serve soups, partially offset by an increase in broth.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter for Meals & Beverages decreased 13% to $287 million, largely due to lower gross profit. As [indiscernible] first quarter operating margin declined 230 basis points to 20.4%, driven by the lower gross profit margin, which was largely driven by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, as well as the unfavorable volume and mix between retail and food service, partially offset by supply chain productivity improvements and net price realization.\nIn Snacks, first quarter organic net sales increased 1% and on a 2-year compound annual basis increased 8%. The organic net sales increase reflects net price realization of 5% and unfavorable volume and mix of 4%. Sales of our 8 power brands increased 5% in the quarter.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 5% to $161 million primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to the impact of net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements more than offsetting higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs. Overall, within our Snacks division, first quarter operating margins increased year-over-year by 80 basis points to 14.5%.\nI'll now turn to cash flow on Slide 30. We generated $174 million in operating cash flow in the first quarter and deployed that cash consistent with our capital allocation priorities to maximize long-term shareholder value. We see some great opportunities to reinvest back into the business to drive incremental growth, productivity and enhanced business capabilities. And as such, we stepped up our capital spend in fiscal '23, and this will now continue into fiscal '24 after a few years of lower spend levels through 2022.\nIn Q1, capital expenditures were [indiscernible] million, [ $66 million ] higher than in the prior year, reflecting our commitment to invest for growth, particularly in capacity for our Snacks division. We also continued our commitment to return cash to our shareholders with $114 million events paid and $28 million of anti-dilutive [indiscernible] purchases in the quarter. Our balance sheet continues to be in a strong position with net debt of $4.6 billion and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.8x below our target of 3x. At the end of the first quarter, the company had approximately $91 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.85 billion available under its revolving credit facility.\nIn addition, on October 10, we entered into a $2 billion delayed single draw term loan credit agreement. The proceeds of the loan under this credit agreement can only be used in connection with the acquisition of Sovos Brands. This $2 billion credit facility, along with our current revolving credit facility will provide ample liquidity and flexibility as we plan for the pending Sovos Brands acquisition.\nAs you'll see on Slide 31, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2024 guidance provided on August 31. Organic net sales outlook for the full year remains in an expected range of 0% to 2% and reflects volume declines in the first half of fiscal 2024, with positive volume trends in the second half. Specifically for Q2, we expect net sales to again follow in market trends with likely modest sequential volume improvement from Q1. However, we still expect volume and mix to be negative compared to the prior year. Additionally, our net sales performance will reflect lower contribution from pricing as we move through the year and continue our disciplined levels of promotion.\nOur full year guidance range for net sales is largely reflective of what we see as the potential variability in the speed of volume recovery for the balance of the year.\nFull year adjusted EPS guidance remains in the range of $3.09 to $3.15 with an expectation of modest earnings growth and margin progress in fiscal 2024 weighted to the second half, benefiting from a moderating inflationary environment and ongoing productivity improvement benefits. As I mentioned earlier, the expense timing favorability we saw in our Q1 results will be rephased into Q2.\nAs a reminder, the sale of our Emerald nuts business, which we divested in May of fiscal '23, is estimated to reduce net sales by approximately 0.5% and have a $0.01 per share dilutive impact in fiscal '24.\nAdditionally, the acquisition of Sovos Brands is expected to close in calendar year '24 and therefore, is not included in our current fiscal '24 outlook. We will continue to commit to investing in our brands, marketing and selling expense as a percent of net sales expected at the low end of the targeted 9% to 10% range, with second quarter having higher sequential spend than Q1.\nWe are increasing our capital expenditure guidance to approximately 5% of net sales as we make additional investments in the business and strategically increase capacity to fuel organic growth. With the timing shift of the Sovos Brands transaction, we're accelerating certain key growth and infrastructure products from fiscal '25 into fiscal '24, all other guidance assumptions remain unchanged.\nTurning to Slide 32. We thought it would be helpful to provide some additional insight behind the adjusted gross margin and adjusted EBIT drivers we expect to come to fruition in the second half of fiscal '24. As shown on the slide and referenced in our guidance, our core inflation outlook for fiscal '24 is materially improved from the low double-digit levels we averaged in the prior year. With cost inflation expected to remain in the low single-digit range for the balance of the year, we expect to see a greater net contribution from productivity and cost savings to our bottom line. Other factors that we expect will contribute to improving margin trends in the second half will be more favorable mix as volumes stabilize, especially on profitable businesses like Soup, normalizing year-over-year changes in marketing and selling costs as well as lower [ tension ] and post-retirement income headwinds.\nIn closing, first quarter results were largely as expected, and our fundamentals are strong as we head into this important winter season. Our Snacks business continues to progress its margin journey while we continue to invest in the equity of our brands. Our Meals & Beverages business continues to attract consumers seeking stretchable meals, which is especially important for winning the holiday season given the current consumer environment. With a clearly defined strategy in a best-in-class supply chain, Campbell is well positioned to deliver the rest of its fiscal year.\nFrom the management team at Campbell's, we want to thank all of our teams for their hard work and wish everyone a wonderful holiday season.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to the operator for Q&A.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell. Joining me today are Mark Clouse, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. For us to give as many participants as possible the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to 2 questions. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations.

Carrie will then discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the full fiscal year 2024.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Speaking on behalf of Campbell's management, I would like to extend our recognition of the dedication and hard work demonstrated by our teams throughout this year.\nWe delivered the fourth quarter consistent with our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered strong growth across all 3 key financial metrics, coming in well ahead of our initial expectations and advancing many of our strategic initiatives. Collectively, we continue to solidify the foundation that has delivered consistent and dependable results over the past several years.\nFurthermore, our progress has set the stage for increased momentum in fiscal 2024 that we believe will result in broad-based growth and deliver compelling shareholder value creation. Let me begin with the highlights of the fourth quarter.\nAs expected, we delivered 5% organic net sales growth, led by inflation-driven net price realization and solid in-market performance enabled by an advantaged supply chain and effective marketing and selling investments. Fourth quarter consumption increased 3% versus the prior year and 25% versus 4 years ago. As expected, we did experience declines in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS in the quarter given our planned brand investments and the pension headwind, which we pointed out on prior earnings calls.\nFor the full year, we delivered double-digit organic net sales growth of 10% and strong adjusted EBIT growth of 5%. Adjusted EPS of $3, representing 5% growth versus prior year, was at the top end of our guidance range. As a reminder, the pension headwind was approximately $0.11 to adjusted EPS and 4 points of growth for the year. Consumption for the full year increased 8% versus the prior year and reflected share growth across many brands. These strong results reflect the ongoing effective execution of our focused strategy along with the sustained consumer demand for our brands. We have strategically balanced the interplay between pricing and promotional frequency while enhancing the tremendous equity and differentiation of our brands.\nWe also continued to invest in expanding capacity for the future and enhance our capabilities in supply chain, marketing, sales and innovation. Looking ahead to fiscal 2024, we're excited about the next stage of Campbell's growth. The snacks business will continue to deliver on the value proposition of the Snyder's-Lance acquisition with top line and margin building momentum.\nOur Meals & Beverage business will be further strengthened and diversified with the planned strategic acquisition of Sovos Brands, which will extend our portfolio into the ultra distinctive sauces segment and provides significant growth opportunities. This combination will make Campbell as one of the most dependable growth-oriented names in food. Carrie will provide full fiscal 2024 guidance later in the call.\nBefore I review the division results, I'd like to provide some perspective on the current consumer landscape. We've spent a great deal of time analyzing the drivers and importantly, the potential implications going forward. We see 3 factors currently putting some transitory pressure on category in market results. These are primarily impacting our Meals & Beverage businesses and all influenced Q4 to some extent.\nThe first area is the residual effects of COVID surges from the summer of fiscal 2022. These surges notably benefited categories like soup in the prior year, particularly during the summer, a period which historically has lower sales. We expect this effect to continue into Q1 and greatly diminish as we approach the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\nDirectionally, the impact of this factor contributed about 50% of the decline in soup in the fourth quarter. This dynamic likely helped mitigate price-driven elasticities in Q4 fiscal of 2022.\nThe next factor is lapping of double-digit pricing actions from 1 year ago. This was a dynamic we expected and one that likely will continue to be a headwind throughout fiscal 2024, but sequentially lessening in the second half of the year. We do also expect sequential volume improvement to mitigate this pricing headwind as we move into Q2 in the second half.\nThe third factor and likely contributing to the limited volume recovery to date is the consumer behavior in response to ongoing economic uncertainty and prolonged inflation. First, consumers began prioritizing categories based on more immediate needs and value leading to fewer categories in the shopper basket. This pattern of behavior resulted in a real focus on seasonal priorities and has obviously created a headwind on categories like soup in the summer. We expect our categories like soup, which is a top 10 category in the fall and winter, to increase in priority, and we're already seeing some early signs of improvement.\nThe second behavior is a growing shift to more value-driven stretchable meals, which has had a mixed effect on our business. It has undoubtedly been a positive driver on categories like pasta sauce and condensed cooking soups, as well as broth, while also adding pressure on categories like ready-to-eat soup. We expect this behavior to subside as inflation continues to moderate.\nThe positive news as it pertains to our Snacks division is that our brands consistently maintain a strong presence in consumers' top categories throughout all seasons of the year. Moreover, our snack power brands have displayed remarkable resilience as consumers, even while prioritizing value, continue to sustain their purchases across our differentiated portfolio.\nBroadly speaking, we see these dynamics as transitional in nature. While we do anticipate the persistence of these dynamics in the near term, we're confident in the equity and the value of our brands within this environment. In fiscal 2024, we'll maintain our support of our brands and remain vigilant on value to ensure we remain competitive, but do not see this as a catalyst for dramatic shifts in promotional or margin dilutive actions to chase volume or share.\nTurning to our division results. Our Meals & Beverages portfolio remains well positioned as consumers employ multiple strategies to stretch their food dollars. In the fourth quarter, we delivered organic net sales growth of 1%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is the lightest in terms of seasonality for this business, and we're also wrapping strong performance of 7% organic net sales growth in the prior year, primarily driven by inflation-driven pricing and some of the COVID surges I mentioned earlier.\nWhile end market consumption was down in the fourth quarter by 4%, we saw strong performance by Prego, up 5%; and Pace, up 7%; and pacific, up 11%. Compared to pre-COVID levels, dollar consumption for the division was up 17% overall.\nDiving more specifically into our Meals & Beverages portfolio, I wanted to highlight the progress we've made within several areas of our soup business. This year, we've refined our soup portfolio to establish distinct areas for growth and identified areas where scale and optimization will be more of the focus. The great news is our growth focus segments represent over 2/3 of our U.S. soup business and has consistently delivered strong growth and share results even where private label is present.\nBrands like our condensed icons, our condensed cooking soups, Chunky, Homestyle and Pacific soup are compelling areas of consumer relevance even among younger households and continue to demonstrate long-term growth potential. They are also brands where our marketing and innovation efforts have been very effective.\nIn the quarter, our shares in this portion of the business were essentially flat. And versus 4 years ago, we've gained 1.2 share points with consumption up 27%. We're confident in the trajectory of this business and are committed to continuing to fuel these segments going forward.\nThe optimized portion of our soup portfolio, which represents less than 1/3 of our U.S. soup business, has experienced recent share softness and thus remains an area of opportunity for us. These are areas where the segments are a bit more commoditized or value sensitive, like broth. So they have tended to be where private label or lower cost options have sourced some share. The team remains vigilant in this segment of the portfolio, continuing to ensure we remain competitive without undermining any long-term profitability.\nInterestingly, this portion of the business represents only 14% of Meals & Beverages and is approximately 7% of Campbell's total net sales and will become even smaller after the pending acquisition of the Sovos Brands business.\nTurning to Snacks on Slide 10. We finished the year strong with fourth quarter organic net sales up 9%, driven by our 8 power brands. We maintained strong in-market momentum, growing consumption by 8% and 31% compared to 4 years ago, also driven by the strength of our power brands, which delivered double-digit dollar consumption for the fifth consecutive quarter.\nOverall, fiscal 2023 was another fantastic year for Snacks. With net sales growing at 13% and operating earnings growth at 24%, these results provide compelling proof that our strategic focus on highly differentiated and relevant brands is working and can lead to sustainable profitable growth.\nThe next slide highlights the impressive performance and continued growth of our power brands, which grew consumption 10% versus the prior year. On a 4-year basis, consumption was up 39%, with all 8 brands growing double digits in the quarter while holding volume share. This illustrates the strength of our core portfolio and reflects the continuation of heightened consumer demand for snacking.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our Snacks business has delivered tremendous growth over the past 2 years. The business has grown net sales at a 7% CAGR with operating earnings growth at a 12% CAGR over a 2-year period. In the last fiscal year, we drove a step change in operating margin, growing from 13.1% in fiscal 2022 to 14.4% in fiscal 2023. This is consistent with our snacks margin road map and gives us increased confidence that we'll continue to deliver on our long-term goals and show steady improvement in fiscal 2024, where we expect to be north of 15%.\nI'm excited and very optimistic as we enter the new year with proven strategies and strong fundamentals and advantaged strong supply chain and arguably one of the most focused portfolio stories in the industry. Within Snacks, we continue to expect accelerated growth and to build on the margin trajectory from this year. And in Meals & Beverages, we expect to continue to strengthen the business with sequential and steady improvement throughout the year. This story will only be made stronger following the completion of the Sovos Brands acquisition, adding the most compelling growth story in food to the Campbell's portfolio. It's an exciting combination.\nWe understand and have planned for some short-term broad-based category dynamics in the early part of the year, especially in Q1. However, we have strong plans in place and are well positioned to gain momentum and deliver another strong year, adding further evidence of the transformation of the Campbell's business. With that, I'll pass it to Carrie, who will review our fourth quarter and full year results and present our fiscal 2024 outlook.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our fourth quarter results, which came in largely as expected with a mid-single-digit organic net sales increase and an adjusted EBIT performance that reflected planned fourth quarter investments in sales and marketing, especially in our Snacks business and continued headwinds related to a nonoperating item.\nFourth quarter organic net sales increased 5% to nearly $2.1 billion, reflecting inflation-driven net price realization, partially offset by some unfavorable volume and mix. Adjusted EBIT of $242 million was a 10% decrease to prior year as higher adjusted gross profit was offset by planned investments in marketing and selling and higher adjusted other expenses related to lower pension and postretirement benefit income.\nAdjusted EPS decreased 11% to $0.50 driven primarily by lower adjusted EBIT. The impact of lower pension and postretirement benefit income reduced adjusted EBIT margin by 40 basis points and adjusted EPS by $0.02 in the quarter. We are pleased with our overall performance for the full year. Our fiscal year net sales results exceeded our initial guidance expectations provided a year ago, finishing the year with organic net sales growth of 10%, driven by higher net price realization.\nAdjusted EBIT grew 5% and adjusted earnings per share finished at $3, also up 5% and ahead of the top end of our initial expectation range despite a $0.02 greater adjusted EPS impact than originally planned from pension and post retirement income. Overall, for the year, this nonoperating item reduced full year adjusted EBIT by $44 million and adjusted EPS by $0.11.\nSlide 17 summarizes the drivers of our fourth quarter net sales growth. Excluding the impact of the sale of the Emerald nuts business, organic net sales grew 5% in the quarter. We generated 10 percentage points of growth from inflation-driven net price realization. Volume and mix declined 5 percentage points across both divisions.\nOur fourth quarter adjusted gross profit margin of 30.6% was generally in line with Q3 with the year-over-year change in margin driven primarily by unfavorable volume and mix. As shown in the bridge, net price realization and productivity improvements more than offset cost inflation and other supply chain costs.\nMoving to Slide 19. Our teams continue to successfully mitigate inflationary headwinds that averaged 12% for the year. We saw steady moderation as we move through the quarters with Q4 core inflation finishing at 6% compared to a high of 18% in Q1. Fourth quarter's rate reflected improved trends in oils and flour as well as improvement in logistics and transportation.\nNet pricing averaged 13% for the full year reflecting contributions from 3 waves of pricing aimed at offsetting double-digit inflation. We ended the year with a fourth quarter net pricing contribution of 10%, still benefiting from the impact of pricing waves 3 and 4 with price wave 3 fully wrapped as of July.\nIn addition to pricing, we continue to deploy a range of other levers to mitigate inflation including supply chain productivity improvements and broader margin-enhancing initiatives, including a focus on discretionary spending across the organization. We are pleased with the progress we have made on our cost savings initiatives.\nThrough the fourth quarter, we have achieved $890 million of total savings under our multiyear cost savings program, inclusive of Snyder's-Lance synergies. We remain on track to deliver savings of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.\nMoving on to other operating items. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased 9%, driven by higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, or A&C, which increased 23% compared to the prior year, and higher selling expenses, partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nThe increase in A&C this quarter was primarily driven by the planned increases in our Snacks division. Overall, our adjusted marketing and selling expenses represented approximately 9% of net sales for the quarter and the full fiscal year. And adjusted administrative expenses increased by $11 million or 7% to $164 million due to higher general administrative costs and inflation, partially offset by increased benefits from cost-saving initiatives.\nAs shown on Slide 21, adjusted EBIT for the fourth quarter decreased 10%, primarily due to higher adjusted marketing and selling expenses, higher adjusted administrative expenses and higher adjusted other expenses related to lower pension and postretirement benefit income this year, partially offset by higher adjusted gross profit.\nLower pension and postretirement benefit income this year drove an approximate $7 million impact to adjusted EBIT. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased to 11.7% in the quarter, primarily driven by a lower adjusted gross profit margin, higher adjusted marketing and selling expenses and the impact of lower pension and postretirement benefit income.\nTurning to Slide 22. Adjusted EPS of $0.50 was down 11% or $0.06 per share compared to the prior year. This was primarily driven by the decrease in adjusted EBIT and slightly higher interest expense, partially offset by a lower adjusted effective tax rate and a reduction in the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nTurning to the segments in Meals & Beverage. Fourth quarter organic net sales increased 1%, reflecting net price realization, partially offset by unfavorable volume and mix. Sales increases in foodservice and Prego pasta sauces were partially offset by declines in beverages, U.S. soup and Canada. Sales of U.S. Soup decreased 2%, primarily due to declines in ready-to-serve soups, partially offset by strong increases in broth and modest increases in condensed.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter for Meals & Beverages decreased 18% to $132 million, primarily due to lower gross profit. Fourth quarter operating margin declined to 14.1% driven by lower gross profit margin, which was largely due to higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, as well as unfavorable mix between retail and foodservice, partially offset by net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements.\nFor the fiscal year, segment operating margin declined to 18.2% compared to 19% in the comparable year ago period. In Snacks, fourth quarter organic net sales increased 9%, driven by sales of Power Brands, which were up 13%, and reflected net price realization, partially offset by modest unfavorable volume and mix.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 12% to $158 million, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses as well as higher administrative expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to the impact of net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, more than offsetting higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs and unfavorable volume and mix.\nOverall, within our Snacks division, fourth quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 60 basis points to 14%. For the fiscal year, we were pleased with our margin progress posting a 130 basis point improvement to 14.4% compared to 13.1% in the prior year.\nI'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal 2023 cash flow from operations was $1.14 billion compared to $1.18 billion in the prior year, primarily due to changes in working capital partially offset by higher cash earnings. In line with our commitment to return value to shareholders, we have returned nearly $590 million through dividends and share repurchases through this fiscal year.\nCash outflows from investing activities reflected capital expenditures of $370 million, $128 million higher than in the prior year as we invested in key growth areas, particularly in our Snacks division. Our year-to-date cash outflows from financing activities were $723 million, including $447 million of dividends paid and $142 million of share repurchases.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had approximately $301 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program and approximately $104 million remaining under our $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program.\nOur balance sheet ended the fiscal year in a strong position with net debt of $4.5 billion and with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 2.6x, well below our targeted 3x range. This puts us in great shape as we plan for the pending Sovos Brands acquisition. As of year-end, the company had approximately $189 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $1.85 billion available under its revolving credit facility, providing a significant excess liquidity and flexibility.\nTurning to Slide 26, let me walk you through our full year fiscal '24 guidance. As a reminder, the sale of our Emerald nuts business, which we divested in May of fiscal 2023, is estimated to reduce net sales by approximately 0.5 percentage point and have a $0.01 per share dilutive impact in fiscal 2024.\nAdditionally, the acquisition of Sovos Brands is expected to close by the end of December 2023, and therefore, is not yet included in our current fiscal 2024 outlook. For revenue, we expect reported net sales growth to be in a range of down 0.5% to plus 1.5% and organic net sales growth of flat to 2% for the year.\nOur expectations reflect improving volume trends throughout the year with an expected lower contribution from pricing and disciplined levels of promotional activity. In terms of phasing, we do expect volume declines to continue in the first half of fiscal 2024 with sequential improvement leading to positive trends in the second half. This dynamic will be most pronounced in Q1, where we would expect top line to be very much in line with consumption.\nFor earnings, we expect adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth of 3% to 5% with an adjusted EPS range of $3.09 to $3.15. We also see the opportunity for modest margin progress. Having exited Q4 with core inflation of 6%, we expect sequential quarterly improvement throughout fiscal 2024 and expect full year core inflation in the low single-digit range. We also expect productivity improvements of approximately 3% and cost savings of approximately $35 million to $40 million towards our $1 billion savings program.\nAs a result of improved second half volume trends and these cost dynamics, earnings growth and margin expansion are expected to be second half weighted. Additionally, in line with our continued commitment to brand investments, we expect marketing and selling expense as a percent of net sales to be at the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% range with a step-up in marketing and selling spend in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nDivision operating margins are expected to improve overall for fiscal 2024 with Snacks operating margins expected to be above 15% and modest operating margin expansion in Meals & Beverage expected in the second half of the fiscal year. Our full year adjusted EBIT and EPS guidance also comprehends an estimated pension headwind of approximately $13 million to adjusted EBIT or $0.03 per share. This is significantly lower than the impact we saw in fiscal 2023 and represents approximately 1% of both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth compared to the 3% to 4% impact we saw in the prior year. This headwind will be most pronounced in the first quarter.\nOther key assumptions underlying our guidance included an expected net interest expense of approximately $185 million to $190 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%. As we think about the phasing for the year, we expect the first quarter adjusted earnings growth rate to be the lowest of the year due to the concentration of higher inflation, increased marketing and selling expenses, the highest quarter impact from lower pension income and some costs related to a nonmaterial cyber incident.\nAs you know, we don't provide quarterly guidance. Given the unique dynamics in Q1, however, we expect first quarter adjusted EPS likely in the upper $0.80 range with momentum building as the year progresses. As I wrap up guidance, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 4.7% of net sales.\nOur priorities for fiscal 2024 include select capacity expansion projects, including the recently announced Goldfish investment, our headquarter consolidation and other programs to support our Snacks margin improvement plan as well as important IT and productivity investments. We see great opportunity to reinvest back into the business in support of growth and improve profitability. This is fueling the modest step-up in investment compared to the last couple of years and remains very much aligned with our long-term algorithm and capital allocation priorities.\nWe are also committed to maintaining a competitive dividend and a strong balance sheet. In closing, we are confident that the relevance of our brands, our strength and capabilities in marketing, innovation and supply chain execution provide a solid setup for accelerated growth in the second half of the year and into fiscal 2025.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks, and I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.",

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief Investor Relations Officer\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell. And joining me today are Mark Clouse, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded and reflect an effort to better accommodate more time for Q&A. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. For us to give as many participants as possible the opportunity to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to 2 questions. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location, followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.\nBecause we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of this presentation. On Slide 4, you'll see today's agenda. Mark will share his overall thoughts on our third quarter performance as well as in-market performance by division. Carrie will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and review our guidance for the full year fiscal 2023.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Campbell Soup Co.\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. As you read in our press release this morning, we delivered our third quarter very much in line with our expectations with strong mid-single-digit net sales growth, led by favorable net price realization, partially mitigated by the comparison to year ago retailer inventory rebuild.\nWe also experienced planned low single-digit declines in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS year-over-year, primarily due to higher nonoperating items. Overall, it was another quarter of consistent strong results, fueled by in-market performance, best-in-class service levels driven by our sustained supply chain recovery and favorable inflation-driven net price realization. All of these have and continue to be key areas of focus for our company.\nOur performance was led by another tremendous quarter in Snacks, where we continue to build broad-based momentum on both growth and share and made a meaningful step change on margins. In Meals & Beverages, our brands continue to benefit from the strong value and convenience they provide consumers. We did experience some expected volume mix pressure as we cycled prior year retailer inventory rebuild.\nIt's worth noting that we are fully back to pre-COVID service levels in the mid- to high 90s, which is currently best in class as we continue to turn our supply chain operations into a competitive advantage.\nIn addition, we don't expect further significant inventory-driven volatility as retailers have returned to targeted inventory levels, taking advantage of these improvements in our service levels.\nAs we look to close out another strong fiscal year, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal '23 financial guidance ranges for net sales and adjusted EBIT, and we are currently tracking to the upper end of our adjusted EPS outlook range. Our guidance appropriately considers the current environment, prior year comparisons, normalized investment levels and absorbs the divestiture of the Emerald nuts business, which was announced on May 30. Now I'll turn to a quick discussion of our divisional results, starting with Meals & Beverages.\nOrganic net sales decreased 1%, while in-market dollar consumption grew 2% with the variance primarily driven by the cycling of significant retailer inventory rebuild in Q3 fiscal 2022, which was more pronounced in the Meals & Beverages division.\nOur supply chain recovery has been best-in-class and our top-tier execution led to significantly improved customer service levels, up approximately 25 points in the third quarter versus prior year, enabling retailers to return to pre-pandemic inventory levels. Volume in the quarter was impacted by the same inventory dynamic as well as below historical norm price elasticities and some increased competitive activity as other supply also improved.\nOnce we cycle the tough prior year comparisons, we expect volume trends to improve sequentially. We have made considerable progress in creating sustainable momentum and relevance across the Meals & Beverages business over the last several years and remain confident in the continued growth potential of our iconic brands.\nTurning to our soup portfolio on Slide 8. Dollar consumption was essentially flat versus prior year, reflecting inflation-driven pricing mitigated by below historical normal elasticities and some increasing share pressure. As competitors improve supply, we are seeing some increased promotional activity.\nOn a net sales basis, soup was down 11%, primarily reflecting the disproportionate impact of cycling the inventory recovery from a year ago, which accounts for the majority of this decline. Strategically, we continue to believe strongly in our ability to grow the soup business and are pleased with the progress we've made in leading the renewed relevance of the category over the last 4 years.\nFor example, the improved relevance of condensed soup, especially cooking, where we have supported the growth of in-home meals. Importantly, this has attracted new younger consumers to Campbell's.\nIn addition to cooking, our condensed eating icons, including chicken noodle and tomato, are also up significantly from pre-COVID levels, providing a strong foundation for our business. However, some flankers like healthy requests in our kids flavors, which have been key drivers of recent share softness, remain an area of opportunity.\nNext is the complete restage and growth of Chunky soup. This brand has been fundamentally transformed from a product purchase primarily on deep discount promotion to a great everyday value with a compelling position that focuses on protein and quick in-home lunches. This positioning has been particularly relevant with younger consumers, especially given the current economic climate and in contrast to higher-priced frozen food or away-from-home options.\nThe impressive 4-year growth in dollar consumption, up 31% and share up 2 points has been fueled by great marketing, effective inflation-driven pricing and innovation like our spicy line. We did experience a step-up in some competitive pressure in Q3, but we're already seeing the return to share growth, up 1 point in the latest 4 weeks.\nFinally, the performance of Pacific as a growth engine. This organic premium line has proven to be a fantastic acquisition, driving incremental consumers to our portfolio. Its results over the last 4 years have been impressive, up 56% in dollar consumption and 0.9 share points. With offerings across broth and ready-to-serve soup, Pacific gives us a high-growth premium platform to keep expanding the category and our soup business.\nThese 3 areas of strength, paired with a robust pipeline for the future, solidifies our confidence that soup will be a steady contributor as we cycle through some of the tough comparisons and return to a level playing field.\nTurning to Slide 9. Our Snacks business delivered its third consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales growth, continuing the strong momentum of this business. Our 12% net sales growth was fueled by our 8 power brands, reflecting the benefit of net pricing and below historical normal elasticities, which resulted in a slight decline in volume and mix.\nIn-market dollar consumption in our total snacks business grew 15% over the prior year and 32% compared to 4 years ago, also driven by our power brands. Although not as significant as in Meals & Beverages, we were also lapping some of the inventory recovery from a year ago.\nIn fact, with our significant supply chain recovery, our customer service levels are now averaging 95%. Drilling into our power brands on Slide 10, dollar consumption increased 18% with strong dollar and volume share growth, which was driven by impactful marketing and a steady drumbeat of innovation.\nOn a 4-year basis, dollar consumption was up 40% with all 8 brands growing double digits in the quarter. For 6 of our 8 power brands, our dollar consumption growth is outpacing their respective categories, highlighting the outsized consumer demand for our unique and differentiated snacks portfolio that spans both cookie cracker and salty categories. With increased service levels, contributions from new product and packaging innovations and planned investments, the share trajectory of our power brands shows a significant improvement over the prior year, systematically rising for each of the last 4 consecutive quarters.\nOur marketing efforts also continue to win as we focus on engaging consumers where and when we can have the greatest impact. Goldfish, which is on pace to approach $1 billion brand, is a great example being named Teen's most preferred snack brand for the fourth time in a row according to Piper Sandler's Spring 2023, taking stock with Teen survey.\nBuilding on the success of our Goldfish innovation model, with LTOs such as Frank's RedHot and Old Bay Goldfish, we are now driving increased innovation on other brands in our snacking portfolio, such as the Kettle brand. Our new Kettle cook and air finished potato chips have performed extremely well in market. We've also released 2 LTOs with strong results, taking a page out of the successful Goldfish playbook.\nWe're adding innovation on brands like Late July that has also fully recovered now on supply. As we continue to build momentum across the portfolio, we'll step up investment behind this innovation and brand building, which will continue in the fourth quarter.\nOur snacks business has grown steadily these past 2 years, and we're now starting to see progress on our profit and margin road map. Over the same period, we have seen operating earnings growth averaged 13%. And even with the strength of our top line, we've also seen margins expand.\nIn fact, Q3 year-to-date, we are up 130 basis points versus 2 years ago and pacing to an absolute operating margin for the year of over 14%. We remain confident that we'll continue to show steady improvement in fiscal 2024 and while also remaining on track for our longer-term snacks operating margin goal.\nIn summary, although Q3 was a tougher comparison to cycle from a year ago, our results were in line with our expectations. We remain right on track for the full year. And more importantly, we're showing fantastic progress in many critical strategic areas such as momentum in every facet of our snacks business, including margins, strong sustained execution across our supply chain and momentum and continued relevance of our Meals and Beverages business.\nOverall, we continue to be pleased with the consistency and performance of the business leading to another strong year for Campbell. With that, I'll turn it over to Carrie.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our third quarter results, which came in as expected, reflecting the benefit of prior waves of pricing and ongoing supply chain momentum as well as the in-market environment and retailer inventory dynamics, which Mark discussed earlier.\nThird quarter organic net sales increased 5% versus prior year, reflecting favorable inflation driven net price realization, partially offset by volume and mix declines. Adjusted EBIT decreased 2%, primarily driven by higher adjusted other expenses related to lower pension and postretirement benefit income this year. Higher adjusted gross profit more than offset higher adjusted administrative expenses and higher marketing and selling expenses.\nAdjusted EBIT margin declined by 110 basis points versus prior year to 14%. Adjusted EPS decreased 3% to $0.68, driven by lower adjusted EBIT and a higher adjusted effective tax rate. The impact of lower pension and postretirement benefit income reduced adjusted EBIT margin by 50 basis points and EPS by $0.03 in the quarter.\nTurning to a year-to-date view, top line and adjusted EPS were both up double digits compared to the period last year, and adjusted EBIT was up 9%. The impact of lower pension and postretirement benefit income reduced year-to-date adjusted EBIT by $37 million and adjusted EPS by $0.09.\nOf note, our Q3 year-to-date adjusted EBIT margin was relatively stable at 15.4% when compared to 15.6% for the 9-month period last year. As reflected on Slide 17, third quarter dollar consumption growth in measured channels of 8% outpaced net sales growth of 5%, driven largely by the expected lapping of retailer inventory rebuild in the prior year period when our service levels were recovering. This was partially offset by net sales growth in nonmeasured channels, which we estimate contributed approximately 2 percentage points in the bridge between dollar consumption growth and organic net sales growth in this quarter.\nSlide 18 summarizes the drivers of our net sales growth of 5% in the third quarter. We generated 12 percentage points of growth from inflation-driven net price realization. Volume and mix declined 7 percentage points, reflecting both the cycling of retailer inventory rebuild in Q3 of fiscal '22 as well as lower volume consumption due to higher elasticities. Excluding the impact of the cycling of retailer inventory, the underlying volume and mix decline was approximately mid-single digits, consistent with the implied run rate we expect for the balance of fiscal '23.\nWe expect volume trends to improve into fiscal '24 as we fully cycle pricing. Price elasticities remain below historical levels, illustrating the continued underlying strength of our brands. Our third quarter adjusted gross profit margin was generally as expected, declining 60 basis points to 30.9% this year from 31.5% last year, driven primarily by unfavorable volume and mix.\nAs shown on the bridge, favorable net price realization and productivity improvements more than offset cost inflation and other supply chain costs. Within other supply chain costs, we are lapping a onetime insurance benefit of 50 basis points in Q3 fiscal '22 related to a temporary disruption in our Meals & Beverages supply chain operations caused by Texas storm in 2021.\nThe next page highlights the steps we have taken to mitigate core inflation, which was approximately 8% on a rate basis in the third quarter compared to 15% in the third quarter of fiscal '22. Our actions include targeted pricing and trade optimization. For the third quarter, net pricing was 12% and reflected the impact of pricing waves 3 and 4. As a reminder, wave 3 pricing went into effect at the start of July of 2022 and wave 4 pricing, which was more selective compared to other rounds, was in place at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal '23.\nWe continue to deploy a range of other levers to mitigate inflation, including supply chain productivity improvements and broader margin-enhancing initiatives, including a focus on discretionary spending across the organization.\nIn terms of commodity exposure, all of our raw materials are essentially covered for the balance of the fiscal year and we continue to closely monitor the overall commodity markets.\nMoving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses increased $6 million or 3% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. This increase was driven by higher selling expenses, partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nOverall, our marketing and selling expenses represented approximately 9% of net sales for the quarter, and we continue to expect marketing and selling expenses to be at the low end of our targeted range of 9% to 10% of net sales for the full fiscal year.\nWithin marketing and selling, advertising and consumer promotion, or A&C, was down 2% versus prior year, driven by a mix of investments to focus on prioritizing value-driven programs to match the current consumer landscape. Adjusted administrative expenses increased by $8 million or 5% to $154 million due to higher general administrative cost and inflation, higher incentive compensation and higher benefit-related costs, partially offset by lower expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims.\nAs a percentage of net sales, adjusted administrative expenses were 6.9% in line with prior year. As shown on Slide 22, adjusted EBIT decreased 2%, more than explained by the $12 million increase in adjusted other expenses related to lower pension and postretirement benefit income this year. Higher adjusted gross profit more than offset the combination of higher adjusted administrative expenses and higher marketing and selling expenses.\nOverall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased 110 basis points to 14% in the quarter, primarily driven by a lower adjusted gross profit margin and the expected 50 basis point impact of lower pension and postretirement benefit income year-over-year.\nThe impact of higher marketing and selling expenses and higher adjusted administrative and R&D expenses was fairly neutral on margin in the quarter as net sales growth was higher than expense growth.\nTurning to Slide 23. Adjusted EPS of $0.68 was down 3% or $0.02 per share compared to the prior year. This was driven by the lower pension and postretirement benefit income we just discussed, which was a $0.03 impact to adjusted EPS, along with a slightly higher adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter.\nTurning to the segments. In Meals & Beverages, third quarter reported net sales decreased 2%. Organic net sales decreased 1%, primarily due to inventory in elasticity-driven volume and mix declines partially offset by gains in foodservice and net price realization. Third quarter operating earnings for Meals & Beverages decreased 17% due to lower gross profit, with nearly 30% of the decline due to lapping the insurance settlement in the prior year.\nThird quarter operating margin in the segment decreased to 16.4%, driven by lower gross profit margin, which was due in part to an unfavorable mix shift between foodservice and retail and the 100 basis point impact of lapping the insurance settlement. Favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements largely offset cost inflation and other supply chain costs.\nOn a third quarter year-to-date basis, segment operating margin stayed relatively stable at 19.2% compared to 19.4% in the comparable year ago period. For Snacks, third quarter net sales, both reported and organic, increased 12%, driven by sales of Power Brands, which were up 16%, and reflected favorable net price realization, which was partially offset by modest declines in volume and mix. This is the third consecutive quarter of double-digit net sales growth for our snacks business.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 41%, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by slightly higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements more than offsetting cost inflation and other supply chain costs.\nOverall, within our Snacks division, third quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 330 basis points to 16%. On a third quarter year-to-date basis, operating margin increased 150 basis points to 14.5% versus 13% in the comparable year ago period.\nThis year-to-date margin is more indicative of the Snack margin we expect for the full year as we continue to invest in the momentum of the business. I'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity.\nOur cash generation remains strong with cash flow from operations of $918 million through the end of the third quarter. In line with our commitment to return value to shareholders, year-to-date, we have returned over $475 million through dividends and share repurchases. Cash flow from operations was lower than the prior year, primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher cash earnings.\nOur year-to-date cash outflows from investing activities were reflective of capital expenditures of $257 million, up from $179 million in the previous year. Our year-to-date cash outflows from financing activities were $535 million, including $336 million of dividends paid and $141 million of share repurchases.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had approximately $301 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program and approximately $104 million remaining under our $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $223 million.\nTurning to Slide 27. We are reaffirming our net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS outlook provided on our second quarter earnings call. Given our year-to-date performance, we are tracking to the upper end of our full year fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS guidance. And given the momentum of our core brands, we anticipate that the recent divestiture of the Emerald nuts business, which closed on May 30, will not have a material impact on our fiscal year adjusted 2023 results.\nAnd accordingly, our full year guidance is inclusive of the lost sales and profits of that business for the remaining 2 months of the fiscal year. Our reaffirmed adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS guidance reflects planned fourth quarter investments in sales and marketing, especially in our Snacks business as we drive continued momentum and value for consumers into these important summer months.\nAdditionally, we are now expecting full year capital expenditures of $360 million for fiscal '23, up from our previous guidance of $325 million as we look to accelerate key manufacturing capacity investments in our Snacks business. Our full year guidance for all other items remain unchanged, including the full year pretax pension and post-retirement benefit income, which is expected to be lower by approximately $45 million or $0.12 per share compared to the prior year. This represents approximately 3.5% of adjusted EBIT growth and approximately 4% of adjusted EPS growth.\nTo wrap up our third quarter tracked to our expectations driven by strong price realization and operational execution, including in our supply chain. While we did see volume and mix decline in the quarter, it was largely a function of year-over-year comparisons, which masked base volume trends. We are meeting consumer needs for value, quality and convenience while managing private label and competitive activity, particularly in our Meals & Beverage business, while our Snacks business continues to demonstrate accelerated growth and steady year-to-date margin progression.\nOur capital allocation priorities are well defined and consistent, and we look forward to deploying our strong cash flow against the highest ROI opportunities. And with that, let me turn the call over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief IR Officer, Campbell Soup Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I am Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell Soup Company. Joining me today are Mark Clouse, President and Chief Executive Officer; Carrie Anderson, Chief Financial Officer; and Mick Beekhuizen, President, Meals and Beverages.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of this presentation.\nOn Slide 4, you'll see today's agenda. Mark will share his overall thoughts on our second quarter performance as well as in-market performance by division. Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail, and Carrie will then review our guidance for the full year fiscal '23.\nAnd with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call.\nAs you read in our press release this morning, the momentum of our business continued as we delivered another strong quarter with double-digit growth across all key metrics: Net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS compared to the prior year. These results continue to reflect the strength of our strategic actions over the last few years and consistent top-tier execution despite significant market volatility. We have grown our portfolio of highly relevant iconic brands in key categories with a strengthened supply chain, elevated marketing and investment, new capabilities and impactful innovation. We've delivered broad-based market share gains and positioned our business for sustained future growth.\nWe have also successfully navigated the dynamic economic environment using a variety of levers to mitigate inflation, including targeted pricing, cost savings initiatives and productivity improvements, and we've managed well below historical levels of elasticity as volume/mix declines remain modest. This challenging but critical algorithm of balancing growth, share, margins and volume has been a key focus of ours over the last several quarters, and the second quarter is another key proof point of our continued successful execution of this plan.\nOur strong business fundamentals, together with the strength of the first half performance and the continued health of our brands, give us the confidence to raise our net sales guidance as well as raise the midpoint of the adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS guidance we previously communicated for the 2023 fiscal year. This reflects continued momentum on top line with greater confidence in our profit and earnings despite some additional pressure from lower pension income.\nNow let's cover some specifics from Q2. Organic net sales increased 13%, supported by favorable inflation-driven net price realization and strong consumer demand for our brands. Total company dollar consumption grew 10% in the quarter versus the prior year and 20% versus 3 years ago. As we expected, the gap between net sales and consumption was driven primarily by continued recovery in our foodservice business, albeit at a lower rate than in Q1.\nOverall, we held dollar share versus the prior year and continued to make significant progress, particularly in the Snacks business as we are successfully reinvesting in our brands and continuing to strengthen our supply chain. This performance in Snacks marks a significant step in our journey as we continue to emerge as a truly differentiated and best-in-class Snacks portfolio.\nIn Q2, we had the strongest share growth in both cookie, cracker and salty snacks among all major branded players, even more impressive as we are among the very few who compete in both of these critical categories. Although benefiting from pricing, we also drove favorable volume mix. One additional important note is the Snacks margin also improved, while increasing investment by 19% on marketing and selling.\nTurning to profit for the company. Adjusted EBIT increased 14%, driven primarily by top line growth and modest gross profit expansion, despite increased marketing and selling expenses versus prior year. Our teams continue to successfully navigate the inflationary environment, leveraging a number of different tools beyond pricing, such as driving operational efficiencies and productivity improvements. We're confident that over time, we have compelling initiatives and road maps to drive margins and deliver our longer-term goals. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.80, up 16%, reflecting strong EBIT flow-through.\nWe did experience some limited pockets of volume declines in the quarter, specifically in our Meals & Beverages division and particularly in the last 4 weeks of the second quarter. These year-over-year declines were primarily due to lapping last year's significant Omicron surge and favorable year-ago winter storm impacts rather than increasing elasticities due to pricing. In fact, overall elasticities remain as we expected and are favorable to historical norms.\nHowever, as we said several quarters ago, we do not expect all brands and categories to react exactly the same. Therefore, we remain highly vigilant of price gaps on key brands and are closely monitoring elasticities. In places where we are experiencing higher impacts from competition or slower category trends, like condensed soup or broth, we're taking appropriate and pragmatic actions to continue to remain competitive and drive sustained profitable growth.\nTurning to our divisional results. Our Meals & Beverages portfolio remains well positioned in growing categories and consumers continue to seek out our brands, as they look for ways to stretch their food budgets and turn to value-driven meals that taste great and are easy to prepare. Organic net sales increased 11%, driven by favorable net price realization, partially offset by modest unfavorable volume and mix. In-market dollar consumption in our Meals & Beverages business grew 6% over the prior year and 17% compared to 3 years ago, reflecting the continued health of our portfolio.\nOur U.S. soup business, which represents more than half of the wet soup category, grew dollar consumption by 4% in the second quarter despite increasing promotional pressure from private label. Our dollar share did decline by 0.6 points versus prior year as the category overall grew by 6%. We continue to feel great about the long-term health of the category and our ability to drive sustainable growth and share over time. In fact, we continue to grow share in key strategic areas of the portfolio in this quarter.\nCondensed icons, for example, tomato, chicken noodle, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken, grew dollar share by 1 point versus prior year, driven by multipacks, which are resonating with consumers as they seek value. Also, condensed cooking SKUs overall are growing share as the cooking behavior and great recipe marketing is driving increased relevance as consumers feel continued pressure economically.\nA couple of great examples of this is our jacked-up mac and cheese recipe that features our cheddar cheese condensed cooking soup and our easy one-pan beef roast with vegetables recipe, which features our French onion soup, both of which cost under $4 a serving. Chunky also continued to perform well, with share gains of 0.2 points. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter that Chunky has grown dollar share and has held or grown volume share. This success has been further fueled by the expansion of our new spicy innovation platform.\nSpicy Chunky Chicken Noodle continues to perform very well, and now we have three additional spicy SKUs on the Chunky roster, all of which are resonating exceptionally well with consumers. We also built significant buzz this winter with a limited time offering of Chunky Ghost Pepper, which we'll be returning nationwide for soup season this coming fall.\nPacific Foods also had a very strong quarter, gaining share and momentum, particularly with millennials. Pacific is extremely well positioned across a variety of categories as a premium organic and healthy brand with offerings in broth, ready-to-serve soups and beverages. In the quarter, consumption was up 17%, and the brand held or grew share in its segments for a total share gain of 0.3 points. In the quarter, Pacific was the fastest-growing branded wet soup product on a dollar basis in all of the measured channels in IRI. And in soup, Pacific continues to hold the #1 share position in the organic category.\nWe are never satisfied with any share loss on the business, but the share pressure we have experienced within condensed soup and broth are both consistent with expectations and concentrated more in the tail of the condensed business versus on our strategic core. The team continues to remain very vigilant, and we continue to ensure we remain competitive without undermining long-term profitability. The great news is we continue to see strength in the category. And in the longer run, given our decisive leadership position, it bodes well for the future.\nIn Italian sauces, dollar consumption grew 8%, while share declined slightly by 0.8 points. The Italian sauce category remains very relevant and continues to benefit from consumers seeking value and meals that the entire family loves and can easily be prepared at home. In Alfredo, we gained dollar share of 0.3 points versus prior year as service and availability improved. And finally, we saw the greatest incrementality in the last 5 years from our latest Prego innovation, which included spicy marinara, creamy tomato basal and other elevated flavor varieties.\nIn Mexican sauces, Pace performed well with dollar consumption up 12% in the quarter and share gains of 0.3 points, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of share growth. Volume share rose for the fourth consecutive quarter, up 0.4 points, enabled by service improvements of 20 points versus prior year. Pace held or grew share across all segments of its portfolio, and we're excited about our innovation launches with this brand, particularly our Pace ghost pepper habanero as we take advantage of the continued strength of Mexican meals prepared at home.\nTurning to Snacks. The division had another excellent quarter as we continue to win versus the competition, supported by substantial brand building and recovery across our supply chain. Our strong top line growth of 15% was driven by favorable net price realization, volume gains and continued growth of our power brands. In-market dollar consumption grew 20% in aggregate on all 8 power brands, and 7 of 8 of those brands grew dollar share. All brands grew across dollars, volume and units, showing the power of our portfolio and the relevance of the consumer snacking behavior even in this current economic environment.\nOur Snacks brands also had a very strong holiday season. Pepperidge Farm cookies gained 0.7 points of dollar share, driven by merchandising support, new packaging designs, limited time offers and the return of our Fancy Santa Milano marketing activation. Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps gained 4.1 points of dollar share, driven by the strength of the bites innovation and our seasonal sweet and salty drizzlers. Our Snacks division is demonstrating outstanding momentum, with the last 2 quarters growing double digits. Campbell Snacks has also significantly stepped up share growth among branded players in the cookie, cracker and salty snack categories.\nAs you can see on Slide 14, we are #1 in both the cookie, cracker and salty snack categories in terms of share growth in the second quarter. This continues to highlight how unique our snack brands are and why we see such a bright future for this portfolio. One of those brands, Goldfish, which is climbing to our goal of $1 billion in annual sales, continues to be the star of the Snacks business. As one of the company's primary growth engines, the brand continues to perform extremely well with 21% consumption growth and share gains of 0.7 points. This was the second consecutive quarter of Goldfish being the largest driver of growth for the entire cracker category.\nAnd our strategy to expand our consumer target has been even more successful than expected with growth versus prior year in both buy rates and repeat rates among households without children about equal to households with children. We continued our track record of having top-performing new items in each of the last 6 quarters, where Goldfish has had limited time-only launches. The Goldfish LTO strategy that we put in place is working with consumers twice as likely to purchase LTOs alongside other Goldfish items.\nWe're also driving strong momentum on innovation for our snack brands. We recently announced the new Kettle Brand air fried potato chips. We're the first company to commercialize air frying as a manufacturing technique in snacking, enabling us to be first to market with an air-fried chip. We've developed a patent-pending technology to kettle cook and air finish potato chips to deliver a light and crispy texture with 30% less fat than the original version. Initial customer and consumer reaction has been extremely positive.\nOverall, I'm pleased with our performance this quarter. With focused execution, strong end market results and strengthened supply chain capabilities, we are well positioned for continued growth, even in a dynamic consumer and economic environment of today. As we go forward and begin to cycle some of these unprecedented periods we've experienced, I've never been more confident in the strength and relevance of our brands, our ability to deliver best-in-class execution and the path for sustained, compelling and differentiated value creation.\nBefore we review the financial results in more detail, I want to quickly comment on the announcement we made in January to consolidate our offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Norwalk, Connecticut into our Camden headquarters. Closing these offices, although not an easy decision, is the right thing to do for our business and culture. Unifying the company in one headquarters will drive cost savings, while increasing our connectivity, collaboration and career opportunities for our people leading to even stronger performance.\nThe cost savings will be reinvested in the business and are included in our plan to increase margins in the Snacks division. I'm pleased to share that the Snacks leadership team has committed to relocate to Camden. We hope that all our colleagues in Norwalk and Charlotte will join us in Camden, but we recognize that some will not.\nFinally, before turning it over to Mick, who will review our second quarter results in more detail, I want to introduce Carrie Anderson, our new Chief Financial Officer, who joins us on the call today and will review our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year.\nCarrie is a seasoned leader with a strong background in complex business models across a wide range of industries. She is experienced in multi-division operating models and has extensive experience in manufacturing and supply chain-driven industries, which are all very relevant to this role. I'm confident Carrie will be a fantastic partner and will build upon the momentum we've established, while continuing to drive our finance team to best-in-class capabilities and performance. She's definitely hit the ground running.\nI also want to thank Mick for his partnership and his role as CFO. Under his leadership, we've made significant progress in increasing the capabilities of the finance team and improving the company's financial performance. As the President of our Meals & Beverages division, Mick brings his strategic, financial and high commercial acumen to the role. I'm confident he'll continue to advance our growth agenda.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Mick.\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nExecutive VP & President of Meals and Beverages, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our strong second quarter fiscal '23 results, reflecting double-digit growth versus prior year across all three key metrics: Net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. These results were consistent with our expectations and reflect inflation-driven pricing and supply chain productivity improvements to offset inflation pressures and increased marketing investments to support our brands.\nSecond quarter organic net sales increased 13%. Top line growth this quarter was lifted by favorable net price realization, partially offset by a slight volume and mix headwind. Price elasticities remain well below historical levels, illustrating the underlying strength of our brands. Second quarter net sales outpaced 10% dollar consumption growth in measured channels, due in large part to the continued recovery of our foodservice business.\nOur ability to mitigate continued cost inflation through a combination of levers led to a slight increase of our adjusted gross profit margin. Simultaneously, we increased support of our brands. And despite higher adjusted other expenses as a percentage of net sales versus prior year, adjusted EBIT margin increased by 20 basis points to 14.6%. On a dollar basis, adjusted EBIT increased 14% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS increased by $0.11 or 16% versus prior year quarter.\nOur cash generation remains strong, with cash flow from operations of $732 million through the first half. In line with our commitment to return value to shareholders, year-to-date, we have -- over $290 million. Organic net sales increased 13%, driven by 14 points of favorable inflation-driven net price realization. This was partially offset by a 2-point volume and mix headwind, which reflects increased elasticities, though they remain well below historical levels.\nTurning to Slide 21. Our second quarter adjusted gross profit margin increased 30 basis points from 30.4% last year to 30.7% this year. Favorable net price realization drove 1,020 basis point benefit due to the impact of our pricing actions, which only partially offset the impact of inflation and other supply chain costs in the quarter. Inflation and higher other supply chain costs had a negative impact of 1,140 basis points with much of the impact driven by continued cost inflation. That said, our supply chain productivity program drove a 280 basis point benefit to our adjusted gross profit margin, partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds. Unfavorable volume mix had a negative impact of 130 basis points in the current quarter.\nThe next page highlights the various initiatives we have deployed to mitigate core inflation, which on a rate basis, was approximately 14% in the second quarter versus 9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our actions include targeted pricing and trade optimization. For the second quarter, net pricing was 14% and reflected the impact of waves 2 and 3 pricing. As we move into the second half, only waves 3 and 4 will benefit our year-over-year comparisons, with wave 4 having a lesser impact than wave 2. Wave 4 pricing, which relative to prior rounds was much more selective in nature, has been fully implemented and was in place at the beginning of the third quarter.\nIn addition, we continue to deploy a range of other levers, including supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives as well as a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization. For the second half of the fiscal year, we have the vast majority of our raw materials covered and continue to closely monitor the overall commodity markets.\nMoving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses increased $20 million or 10% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. This increase was largely driven by higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, or A&C, which increased by 17% versus the moderated levels in the prior year, and higher selling expenses, partially offset by increased benefits from cost-saving initiatives. Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented approximately 8.7% of net sales.\nAdjusted administrative expenses increased by $13 million or 9% to $157 million due to higher general administrative costs and inflation, higher benefit-related costs and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by lower expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted administrative expenses were 6.3%, a 20 basis point decrease compared to last year.\nOn Slide 24, we are providing an adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. Adjusted EBIT increased 14% in the quarter, primarily driven by the $92 million improvement in adjusted gross profit. Despite marketing and selling expenses increasing $20 million versus the prior year, it was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales versus the prior year, and therefore had positive impact to our adjusted EBIT margin of 20 basis points.\nSimilarly, adjusted administrative and R&D expenses were $178 million, an increase of 8% over prior year and contributed 30 basis points to our adjusted EBIT margin. Adjusted other expenses of $6 million compared to adjusted other income of $9 million in the prior year had a negative adjusted EBIT margin impact of 60 basis points. This $15 million headwind is largely due to a reduction in pension and postretirement benefit income compared to prior year. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin increased 20 basis points to 14.6% in the quarter.\nThe following chart breaks down our 16% increase in adjusted EPS growth between operating performance and below-the-line items. An $0.11 positive impact from higher adjusted EBIT was only slightly offset by a $0.01 impact of a higher adjusted effective tax rate as our net interest expense was relatively flat year-over-year. All in, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was 16% or $0.11 per share higher than prior year.\nTurning to the segments. In Meals & Beverages, we delivered another strong quarter with reported net sales growth of 10%. Organic net sales increased 11% versus the prior year, primarily due to increase in U.S. retail products, including U.S. soup, Prego pasta sauces and Pace Mexican sauces as well as gains in foodservice. Favorable net price realization was partially offset by modest volume and mix declines. Sales of U.S. soup increased 7%, primarily due to sales increases in ready-to-serve soups and condensed soups.\nWithin our Meals & Beverages division, second quarter operating earnings increased 17%, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased slightly due to the impact of favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, partially offset by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs and unfavorable volume and mix. Overall, our second quarter operating margin in our Meals & Beverages division increased by 100 basis points year-over-year to 17.7%.\nWithin Snacks, net sales, both reported and organic, increased 15%, driven by sales of power brands, which were up 20% and reflected favorable net price realization and volume increases, lapping significant supply constraints in the prior year. Segment sales growth was driven by increases in cookies and crackers, primarily Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies, and in salty snacks, primarily Snyder's of Hanover pretzels, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and Kettle Brand potato chips.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 24%, primarily due to higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Gross profit margin increased due to favorable net price realization and supply chain productivity improvements, partially offset higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs. Overall, within our Snacks division, second quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 90 basis points to 13.9%.\nI'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal '23 cash flow from operations decreased from $766 million in the prior year to $732 million, primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher cash earnings. Our year-to-date cash outflows from investing activities were reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $155 million, which was an increase from $129 million in the previous year. We continue to forecast full year capital expenditures of $325 million for fiscal '23.\nOur year-to-date cash outflows from financing activities were $525 million, including $226 million of dividends paid and $66 million of share repurchases. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $375 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program and approximately $106 million remaining under our $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $158 million.\nAs we close out my last quarter as CFO, I would like to thank everyone for the support throughout my tenure as CFO at Campbell. I look forward to working closely with Carrie in my new role.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Carrie to talk through our updated full year guidance.\n\nCarrie L. Anderson\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation\n\nThank you, Mick, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be a part of the Campbell's team, and I look forward to contributing to our future success. As Mick mentioned, I will review our fiscal '23 outlook.\nTurning to Slide 30. We have updated our guidance, reflecting our confidence in our full year plan. Net sales growth for fiscal '23 is now expected to be in a range of plus 8.5% to plus 10%, up from our prior guidance of 7% to 9%. We have also raised the midpoint of our adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. We now expect adjusted EBIT growth of plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% and adjusted EPS growth of plus 3.5% to plus 5% compared to the prior year, resulting in fiscal '23 adjusted EPS of $2.95 to $3.\nOur higher expectation for revenue reflects the strength of our brands with price elasticities remaining favorable to historical norms as well as stronger supply chain execution and sustained marketing investment to fuel demand and support innovation. As we think about the second half, our plans contemplate several evolving drivers from the first half. Specifically, we will begin to lap our most significant year-ago pricing. We have been successful in executing our wave 4 pricing, but the net of this will result in lower overall growth rates than the first half.\nAs it relates to profit and EPS, our revised guidance remains consistent with our prior plans. We will continue to navigate expected inflation with pricing, albeit lower incremental pricing levels in the second half as compared to the first half and with continued productivity. We will also continue to invest in our business to drive demand and profitably defend share.\nAdditionally, in the second half, we'll see a headwind from lower pension income. Fiscal '23 pension income is now expected to be lower by approximately $45 million or $0.12 per share compared to the prior year. This represents a headwind of approximately 3.5% to adjusted EBIT growth and approximately 4% to adjusted EPS growth for the full year, or an increase of 50 basis points or $10 million from previous estimates as a result of interim remeasurements. However, given the strength of our top line and the greater visibility and year-ago cost, we are confident in raising the midpoint of our adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS guidance ranges.\nAs we covered earlier, some of our inflation-driven pricing actions in the second half of fiscal '22 will now lap in the second half of fiscal '23. With inflation still expected in the low teens for the full year, we are driving other margin-enhancing initiatives in addition to price. We've already delivered $870 million of our multiyear cost savings program and remain on track to achieve $1 million by the end of fiscal 2025. For fiscal '23, the total benefits of our cost savings initiatives and productivity improvements remain unchanged, with a slight update to the split of the two programs as you'll see on the slide.\nAs we look to the second half of the fiscal year, with our brand momentum, strength in supply and continued competition, we will continue to invest in our brands, such that for the full year we expect marketing and selling expenses to be near the low end of our targeted 9% to 10% of net sales.\nTo summarize, we feel good about the momentum we've created thus far as well as our plans for the second half of the year, which translates into another raise in guidance for the full year.\nAll in, our second quarter was aligned with our expectations. And for the full year, we remain confident in our strategy, our compelling portfolio of leading brands, our strength in supply chain capabilities and our team's focused execution.\nI'd like to close by thanking our teams for a warm welcome. I'm excited to be part of Campbell's continued progress towards unlocking its full growth potential.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. You may begin your conference.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief IR Officer, Campbell Soup Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell Soup Company. I am joined today by Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mick Beekhuizen, Campbell's Chief Financial Officer and President of Meals & Beverages.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude our prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section of our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location, followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of this presentation.\nOn Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. Mark will share his perspective on our first quarter results as well as in-market performance by division. Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and then review our guidance for the full year fiscal 2023.\nAnd with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2023 conference call. I hope you had a happy Thanksgiving and filled up on Green Bean casserole, Pepperidge Farm stuffing, and plenty of our delicious snacks and cookies.\nAs you read in our press release this morning, our fiscal year is off to a fast start. Our strong year-over-year performance across all 3 key [metrics] reflects the continued strength of our portfolio, and our successful efforts to substantially mitigate significant inflation through a combination of pricing and productivity improvements. I am also encouraged that we delivered those results while increasing investments in our brands and ensuring we remain a good value to consumers in this difficult economic time.\nWe also made significant progress on market share versus the fourth quarter, growing or holding share in most of our categories year-over-year. We are very pleased that the combination of stronger supply, accelerating innovation and appropriate investment is translating into strong profitable share growth as we had planned. Overall, Campbell's portfolio continues to demonstrate compelling consumer relevance and is well positioned for the current economic environment.\nWe recognize it's still early in our fiscal year, and the environment does remain challenging. But given the strength of the first quarter performance, the health of our brands and our consistent execution, we've increased our guidance to reflect our current outlook. Mick will provide more details on the drivers shortly. But this quarter's results and the full year outlook demonstrate the significant progress we've made across our brands, supply chain, culture and capabilities. Although there remains more to do on the business as we continue unlocking our full growth potential, this quarter's results represent a positive milestone in our journey.\nOrganic net sales increased 15% to $2.6 billion due to both inflation-driven pricing and strong consumer demand. While we did see some volume declines, it was partially mitigated by expected retail inventory recovery and a strong rebound in unmeasured channels, especially food service. Dollar consumption was up 10% in the quarter versus the prior year and 21% versus 3 years ago. As expected, we shipped ahead of consumption in the quarter as our supply chain execution and service levels continue to improve and retailers rebuild inventory levels. The improved supply also allowed us to significantly increase our marketing investment in both divisions as planned.\nTurning to adjusted EBIT. Higher adjusted gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses and higher adjusted other expenses, resulted in a 15% increase in adjusted EBIT. The team has done an excellent job navigating inflation, leveraging a good balance of different tools. I also can see that our agility has improved in reacting to the volatile environment. As an example, we recently announced a very targeted Wave 4 pricing action on products where our input costs have gone up further.\nAdjusted earnings per share were $1.02, also up 15%, as the flow-through of adjusted EBIT and lower weighted average diluted shares were partially offset by higher adjusted taxes. I'm thrilled with our progress on dollar share. We grew our held share in most categories year-over-year and also grew share versus the prior quarter. In fact, 10 out of 15 of our key brands grew share in the quarter, some of which responded faster and more significantly than expected as inventory and support were added.\nEven in categories where we experienced modest share declines, such as soup and pretzels, our share performance improved sequentially as planned. There is no question that the focus of our portfolio from a category and geographic perspective is a distinct advantage right now and is enabling us to effectively deploy investment and drive consistently strong execution.\nLet's look at our divisions. Starting with Meals & Beverages, which delivered a strong first quarter, with reported and organic net sales growth of 15%. In-market performance continues to show the underlying health of our portfolio with dollar consumption growing 8% over the prior year and up 17% versus 3 years ago. The recovery in our supply chain resulted in materially improved service levels, up over 18 points versus the prior year, enabling retailers to replenish inventory in the quarter and be well positioned on supply heading into the critical holiday season. We also saw a marked recovery in our foodservice business as supply has also improved in this important channel.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our strong dollar consumption growth was across most of our Meals & Beverages portfolio as we are well positioned within growing categories. The growth of our brands in key segments, namely ready-to-serve or RTS soups, Italian sauces, Mexican sauces and select segments in our condensed soup well outpaced the growth of their respective categories.\nTurning to Slide 11. Our consumer insights show that consumers continue to cut back on out-of-home eating and are migrating from more expensive grocery categories as they seek ways to ease the impact of inflation. Consumers are making changes to stretch their budget and following several years of becoming more confident and comfortable with cooking, they continue to turn to our categories and importantly, our brands as evidenced by the continued growth of our Meals & Beverages business.\nWith consumers preparing about 80% of meals from home, our brands are well positioned for sustained growth, delivering consumers the quality, value and convenience they seek for simple at-home meals and quick-scratch cooking. For example, our spaghetti carbonara recipe is a top performer year-over-year as it easily and economically feeds a family for about $1.53 a serving.\nTurning to Slide 12. U.S. soup net sales grew 11% over the prior year, with gains in ready-to-serve, condensed and broth. We continue to see a favorable net pricing benefit with dollar consumption up 5%, partially offset by pricing-related volume declines. Elasticities remain below historical levels. And while our total dollar share of U.S. soup declined, it was by less than 1 point. We had positive dollar share growth in the quarter in key strategic segments, partially offset by competitive share losses to private label in total condensed and broth as expected. We continue to focus on price gaps and are adding equity support with meaningful innovation to maintain the strength of the category and our brands over the long run.\nChunky continued its positive momentum with dollar share up 1.6 points in the quarter coming from strong base velocities as we further recovered on shelf and 13% dollar consumption growth versus the prior year. This was the fifth consecutive quarter Chunky held or gained volume share, reflecting the powerful combination of a strong base business, highly relevant innovation and increased investment in compelling advertising. Versus 3 years ago, Chunky grew dollar consumption by 26%. Our chunky digital and social activations are seeing notable year-over-year increases in engagement and our Lunchtime is Your Halftime campaign is resonating, particularly with younger consumers as we expand our reach through our NFL partnership and gaming via EA Madden.\nClosing out the slide, Pacific has returned to growth as a result of restored supply and innovation, with dollar consumption of Pacific RTS soup up 21% versus prior year and share grew by 0.4 points in the quarter. Pacific's growth is outpacing organic subsegments in the quarter, and the launch of RTS cans is the leading contributor to the growth with millennial buyers up 16% versus prior year.\nTurning to the next slide and our progress on building a $1 billion sauce business, Prego continues to solidify our position as the branded dollar share leader in the Italian sauce category. Growth in the quarter was driven by both pricing and higher volume, reflecting improved service versus a year ago. The brand had strong in-market dollar consumption of plus 21% and share growth of 1.1 points versus prior year. Pace also performed well, with dollar share gains of 0.4 points, marking the third consecutive quarter of dollar share growth and increased dollar consumption of 16%.\nTurning to Snacks. We had an impressive quarter as our brands rapidly responded to the recovery of supply and increased investment with accelerated top line growth and share improvement. The strong 15% top line growth, which was fueled by our power brands, reflected pricing actions offset by slight pricing-related volume declines. Sales growth exceeded dollar consumption of 13% versus prior year due to the replenishment of retailer inventory, which have been depleted in the prior year due to supply challenges.\nAs you'll see on the next slide, in-market dollar consumption in our power brands was up 15%, with 6 of 8 brands growing double digits. On a 3-year basis, dollar consumption was up 28%, with all 8 power brands growing double digits and 4 of our 5 salty power brands growing over 30%. This also supports the historical learning that consumer snacking behavior is very resilient and relevant in tough economic environments. Overall, 6 of our 8 power brands grew dollar share in the first quarter, including Cape Cod, Snack Factory and Lance, each of which grew share by over 1 point.\nAs we have recovered from significant supply constraints that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we began to see sequential dollar share improvement quarter-to-quarter. Specifically, over the last 4 quarters, Goldfish gained 0.6 points, Snyder's of Hanover gained 3.5 points, Lance is up 4.8 points, and Pepperidge Farm cookies were up 0.4 points.\nOur snack brands are also highly differentiated against competition with positive velocity trends. In fact, on Slide 16, you'll see that our brands are growing faster than their respective categories. And 5 out of 7 power brand categories, including crackers, Kettle chips, deli snacks, organic tortilla chips and sandwich crackers.\nConsumers continue to show their love for Goldfish and respond to the steps we've taken to broaden the appeal of this iconic brand. This is a remarkable growth story for one of our most important brands. We continue to deliver against our strategy to expand our consumer base with robust and relevant innovation and effective marketing that engages the entire family, not just younger kids.\nIn fact, for the third time in a row, Goldfish crackers were teens most preferred snack brand according to Piper Sandler's Fall 2022, Taking Stock With Teens survey. Our Goldfish Dunkin' Pumpkin Spice crackers were the top turning new cracker item and leading pumpkin spice stacking item during the quarter. We've continued this momentum with a new partnership with Disney Marvel and our limited-edition Black Panther: Wakanda Forever Goldfish, which hit the store shelves last month. And keep an eye out for the limited return of Goldfish Frank's RedHot Crackers in the coming months.\nWe also continued to win in salty snacks, with dollar consumption and dollar share gains in Kettle Chips, Cape Cod, Snack Factory and Late July. Our Snack Factory pretzel crisp and Snyder's of Hanover will have new holiday activations inspiring new occasions and elevating every holiday snack trade.\nAnd finally, I want to highlight Pepperidge Farm cookies. The holidays are their Super Bowl and with supply back, we're able to return to full speed through the holidays. We've introduced new packaging designs across the portfolio from Milano to Chessman and brought back holiday favorites, like Linzer cookies. We also have new limited-edition Milano Hazelnut Hot Cocoa, and with the return of the Milano Fancy Santa activation, we hope to do our share in making the holidays a little more special.\nIn closing, I'm really pleased with our strong year-over-year performance and the fast start to the year. This is perhaps one of the most complete quarters we've delivered. We continue to build momentum and confidence with a powerful portfolio of brands in both divisions and the continued strength of our supply chain execution. We're recovering on share and driving growth in key categories. And with our portfolio focus, we are well positioned for the current consumer and economic environment.\nOur innovation is resonating with consumers, driving more engagement, especially among younger households and there's more to come. It's important to remember that there's still much to do on our business, and the environment does remain challenging. But being able to face those challenges off a stronger and more stable foundation is very encouraging and bodes well for the future.\nBefore turning it over to Mick, I wanted to comment on our recent management changes. As we announced in November, Mick has been appointed President, Meals & Beverages; and Chris Foley is now President of Snacks. Mick will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer until a successor to this role is in place. The search is going very well, and I look forward to updating you in the future.\nBoth Mick and Chris have played a significant role in Campbell's transformation over the last several years by enhancing our culture and improving our business performance. I'm confident that they are the right leaders to continue to build our momentum and unlock our full growth potential.\nIn closing, I'd like to thank all of the Campbell's team for their hard work and wish all of them and you happy holidays.\nWith that, over to Mick.\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nExecutive VP , CFO & President of Meals & Beverages, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased by the strong results we delivered in the first quarter with 15% growth across all 3 key metrics: net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS. Top line growth was due to inflation-driven pricing, sustained brand health and improved supply chain execution, partially offset by modest volume declines.\nFirst quarter net sales growth of 15% outpaced consumption growth due in part to retailer inventory rebuild as well as the strong recovery in our foodservice business. Strong sales growth, a relatively flat gross profit margin as cost inflation and unfavorable volume and mix were mostly mitigated by pricing and productivity improvements, combined with continued support of our brands and expected lower pension income resulted in a 15% increase in adjusted EBIT.\nOn a margin basis, adjusted EBIT was comparable to the prior year at 17.4%. Adjusted EPS increased 15% to $1.02 per share, driven primarily by the increase in adjusted EBIT, partially offset by a higher adjusted effective tax rate. Our cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $227 million, which allowed us to continue to invest in the business, while we returned over $150 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nWith Q1 results ahead of expectations and our strong confidence in the health and momentum of our brands and improved supply chain, we feel it's appropriate to raise our guidance.\nThat said, let's first discuss our first quarter results versus prior year in more detail. Net sales in the quarter, both reported and organic, increased 15%, driven by 16 points of inflation-driven pricing. This was partially offset by a 1 point volume and mix headwind. Promotional spending in the quarter was down 1% in Meals & Beverages and up 1% in Snacks and thus, overall comparable to the prior year. As an aside, going forward, we will combine the impact of promotional spending with the impact of pricing in our quarterly earnings materials.\nTurning to Slide 22. Our first quarter adjusted gross profit margin decreased 30 basis points from 32.5% to 32.2%. Inflation and higher other supply chain costs had a negative impact of 1,260 basis points, with the majority of the impact driven by continued cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 18%, which were slightly higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal '22.\nAdditionally, unfavorable volume and mix had a negative impact of 150 basis points in the quarter. These factors were mostly mitigated by a higher net realized price, which drove an 1,140 basis point improvement, reflecting the impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions. In addition, our ongoing supply chain productivity and cost savings programs contributed 240 basis points to the adjusted gross profit margin.\nIn the first quarter, we continued our efforts to mitigate inflation highlighted on the next page. Through a combination of targeted price increases and trade optimization as well as supply chain productivity improvements, cost savings initiatives and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization.\nAs discussed during our previous earnings call, we expect cost inflation to continue throughout fiscal 2023. To mitigate the expected inflation, we are currently implementing selective additional pricing in both divisions, which should become effective in the second half of our fiscal year. We continue to focus on all other areas of inflation mitigation, while we diligently protect the important value proposition for consumers.\nMoving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses increased 18% or $31 million and represented approximately 7.8% of net sales versus 7.6% in the prior year. The primary drivers of higher marketing and selling expenses were higher advertising and consumer promotion expense, or A&C, which increased by 31% versus the moderated levels in the prior year and higher selling expenses, partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nAdministrative expenses on an adjusted basis increased 1% to $155 million due to higher general administrative costs and inflation, partially offset by lower expenses related to the settlement of certain legal claims. As a percentage of net sales, adjusted administrative expenses were 6%, a 90 basis point decrease compared to last year.\nOn Slide 25, we are providing an adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT increased 15% in the quarter, primarily due to a 14% or $102 million improvement in adjusted gross profit. While the increase in adjusted gross profit benefited adjusted EBIT, it was lower as a percentage of net sales, resulting in a 30 basis point decrease of our adjusted gross profit margin and a corresponding decrease of our adjusted EBIT margin.\nMarketing and selling expenses increased $31 million versus the prior year and had a negative impact on our adjusted EBIT margin of 20 basis points. Adjusted administrative and R&D expenses were $176 million, a 1% increase over prior year. This increase resulted in a 100 basis point contribution to the adjusted EBIT margin as these expenses were lower as a percentage of net sales versus prior year.\nAdjusted other expenses of $3 million compared to adjusted other income of $7 million in the prior year had a negative adjusted EBIT margin impact of 40 basis points. This headwind is largely due to a reduction in pension and postretirement benefit income compared to prior year. Our adjusted EBIT margin was in line with prior year at 17.4%.\nThe following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS growth between operating performance and below the line items. Higher adjusted EBIT impact of $0.16 was partially offset by a $0.04 headwind of higher adjusted taxes. Earnings per share also benefited from a reduction of the weighted average diluted shares outstanding. All in, adjusted EPS increased year-over-year by 15% to $1.02.\nTurning to Slide 27. Our Meals & Beverages division delivered a strong quarter with both reported and organic net sales increasing 15% versus prior year primarily due to increases in U.S. retail products, including soup and Prego pasta sauces as well as gains in our foodservice business. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances and lower levels of promotional spending were partially offset by volume declines. Sales of U.S. soup increased 11% due to sales increases in ready-to-serve soups, condensed soups and broth.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 18%. The increase was primarily driven by higher gross profit, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Overall, within our Meals & Beverages division, first quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 60 basis points to 22.7%.\nOn Slide 28, reported and organic net sales in our Snacks division increased 15%, driven by sales of Power Brands, which were up 21%. Sales growth was driven by increases in cookies and crackers, primarily Goldfish crackers and in salty snacks, primarily in Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and both Kettle brand and Cape Cod potato chips. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were partially offset by volume declines and increased promotional spending relative to moderated levels in the prior year quarter.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 20%, primarily due to higher gross profit and lower administrative expenses, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses. Overall, within our Snacks division, first quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 50 basis points to 13.7%.\nI'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal 2023 cash flow from operations decreased 21% year-over-year to $227 million, primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher cash earnings. Cash outflows from investing activities were reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $77 million, which was an increase from $69 million in the previous year. Cash outflows from financing activities were $127 million, including $115 million of dividends paid and $41 million of share repurchases. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $375 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program and approximately $131 million remaining on our $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $130 million.\nBefore I turn to guidance, I wanted to touch on a few additional items. First, at the end of September, S&P Global upgraded our credit rating to BBB with a stable outlook. Secondly, on November 15, we raised a delayed draw term loan totaling up to $500 million. We plan to use the proceeds of the loan to refinance our existing $566 million notes, maturing in March 2023. And lastly, on November 21, we entered into a 12-year renewable power purchase agreement with Enel North America to support our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Improving the sustainability of the agriculture and food value chain is important to Campbell, and this agreement is a substantial step forward in meeting our science-based emissions reduction target.\nWith that, let's turn to Slide 30. As previously mentioned, we are raising our financial guidance for the year given the strength of our first quarter performance, the health of our brands and our consistent execution. For the full year, we now expect net sales, both organic and reported, to be plus 7% to plus 9%, adjusted EBIT of plus 2.5% to plus 6.5% and adjusted EPS of plus 2% to plus 5% versus the fiscal 2022 results, resulting in fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS of $2.90 to $3.\nLastly, as we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, our guidance reflects an approximate 3% headwind to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS from lower pension and post retirement income. All in, we're off to a great start to fiscal 2023 and are confident in our strategy and execution. As Mark mentioned, while we expect the environment to remain dynamic, our brand momentum remains strong as both supply and investment returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nI'd like to close by thanking all our teams for their commitment and wishing everyone a wonderful holiday season. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. You may begin.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief IR Officer, Campbell Soup Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I am Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer at Campbell Soup Company. I am joined today by Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mick Beekhuizen, Campbell's Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude our prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session.

Clouse\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.\nOn behalf of Campbell's leadership, I want to begin by thanking the teams for all their hard work this year. By maintaining focus on the factors we can control, we delivered solid fourth quarter and full year results while advancing our strategic plan to deliver sustainable profitable growth. The teams executed with excellence across the company. We improved supply chain performance and implemented effective revenue management to counter inflation, all while demand for our portfolio of brands remained elevated. Importantly, we did what we said we were going to do. We delivered on the high end of our original full year fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS guidance. We accomplished this despite the volatile environment we're in. And with the momentum we built throughout the year, we're confident in our ability to continue to deliver in fiscal 2023.\nLet me start with the fourth quarter. We delivered strong growth across all 3 key metrics, net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, driven by continued improvement in our supply chain execution, sustained consumer demand and our successful efforts to mitigate inflation. Organic net sales increased 6% versus the prior year due to net price realization, continued elevated consumer demand and significantly improved supply. Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS both returned to growth due to successful inflation mitigation and cost management.\nFor the full year, organic net sales grew 2% and we delivered adjusted EPS of $2.85. As expected, adjusted EBIT decreased due to challenging inflationary pressures and our commitment to protect critical brand investments.\nOur financial results reflect the strong end market performance of our brands. Fourth quarter consumption was up 8% versus the prior year and up 21% compared to 3 years ago. For the full year, consumption was up 4% versus the prior year and up 14% versus 3 years ago. The sustained strength of our portfolio continues to signal great growth potential for the future.\nOn Slide 8, I'd like to talk about a few of the reasons why Campbell is well positioned for the consumer and economic environment as we head into fiscal 2023.\nFirst, our brands are in categories that excel during challenging economic times. Consumers tend to seek out the better value our meals and beverages portfolio delivers, while the resiliency of snacking has been consistent in prior economic downturns. Also, we're not solely dependent on pricing to manage inflation. We've already delivered $850 million of multiyear cost savings, and we're tracking to $1 billion by fiscal 2025.\nOur supply chain transformation continues as well as we address both short-term and longer-term challenges and are performing substantially better than even earlier in the year. In fact, service levels in the fourth quarter improved by approximately 15 points compared to the first half of fiscal 2022.\nWe've delivered strong innovation, with a focus on relevant, differentiated and value-driven platforms. We saw a 2% contribution from innovation in fiscal 2022 and have our most robust pipeline yet for fiscal 2023. For our U.S. soup business, innovation contributed 3% of net sales in fiscal 2022, demonstrating the opportunity for innovation in this strengthening category.\nLet me now turn to another strong proof point of our progress, which are the share results for our brands as we emerge from the last 3 years of the pandemic influence. We are pleased with the fact that share for most of our key brands across our portfolio continue to remain at or above fiscal 2019 levels. While as we expected in the fourth quarter, we have experienced some select share pressure, this sustained share growth versus pre-pandemic levels is a positive sign that we're emerging with a stronger portfolio of brands as we head into 2023.\nTurning to our Meals & Beverage division on Slide 10. I continue to be pleased by the performance of our brands. Organic net sales in the division increased 7% versus the prior year, with growth coming across all major meal segments. Consumption grew 8% over the prior year and 22% compared to 3 years ago, reflecting the underlying health of our portfolio and the strengthening position we've built with new consumers through the pandemic, especially with new millennial consumers.\nTurning to Slide 11. As expected, during tougher economic times, shelf-stable simple meals grew an importance, evidenced by the growth of volume share of total food. The strong value and convenience of categories like pasta sauce and ready-to-serve soup, have driven the segment's outperformance versus both refrigerated and frozen simple meals. This consumer behavior, importantly, among younger households, gives us confidence in the continued relevance of our categories heading into fiscal 2023.\nThroughout the thoughtful planning and execution of pricing actions in fiscal 2022, we anticipated and appropriately plan for the share pressure we are experiencing from private label, particularly in parts of the portfolio like condensed soup and broth. What is important to remember is the context of the strength of our share positions. Although never happy with share loss in a category where we have a significant share leadership position, the strength of the category translates to compelling growth on a very important part of our portfolio. Further, we've been very focused on which consumers are trading down within soup. And they tend to be our baby boomer consumers, who historically are a bit more sensitive to price gaps and also very likely to trade back over time. The good news is most of our new millennial consumers in soup have been highly brand loyal.\nTurning to Slide 13. We also are encouraged by our performance on select brands within our soup category that we see as the most imperative to defend our share. Our condensed icons continued to perform well this quarter, with share up 4.1 points and consumption up 29.6% versus the prior year. On a 3-year basis, our condensed icons are up nearly 6 points in dollar share, while also growing units approximately 9%, reflecting our focus on ensuring we are winning on the most strategic parts of our condensed portfolio.\nIn the ready-to-serve business, Chunky continues to be a star, with dollar share up 1.3 points and consumption up 20.3% versus the prior year. Compared to 3 years ago, Chunky gained over 2 points of dollar share, increased units nearly 27%, and we've added over 1 million new buyers into the brand. We are revitalizing the Chunky brand for new generations of consumers, leveraging our 25th season as an NFL sponsor and broadening our relationship with gaming icon, EA Madden, featuring the Campbell's Chunky Stadium.\nInnovation will also continue to help fuel our Win in Soup strategy in fiscal 2023. As consumers trade into shelf-stable meals, like ready-to-serve soup, we're bringing new relevant innovation, targeting better-for-you and flavor profiles that will add variety as frequency in these categories go up. Building off of the success of our Creamy Pacific Food soups, we're adding to our portfolio of organic ready-to-serve soups and plant-based chilis, which launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We're also expanding our new Chunky spicy lineup following the insight that nearly 2/3 of consumers agree that savory foods taste better with spice. Finally, we are providing a full restage of packaging and graphics to continue to fuel the relaunch of our, Well Yes! better-for-you soup line.\nBroth is a category where, as expected, private label pressure has been greater. As a result, we continue to further differentiate our Swanson brand. In fiscal 2023, we will be modernizing our packaging and improving our ingredients to drive the taste superiority, quality and value of our Swanson brand. We will also be launching Swanson Quick Cups, which is a convenient 1-cup serving a broth, which fits the majority of broth recipe usage occasions. This smaller size offering delivers convenience for smaller households and further delivers value by reducing waste. Through improved quality and a robust lineup of offerings for our consumers, our focus will be on winning this holiday season.\nTurning to sauces. We continue to make progress against our goal of building a $1 billion sauces business. With quick scratch cooking increasing in relevance as consumers continue to eat more at home to save money, we are well positioned to capture market share and growth. In fact, our Prego brand remained the #1 share leader in the Italian category for the 39th consecutive month and delivered consumption growth of 12.4% compared to the prior year. In addition, repeat rates were up 4 points in the quarter compared to 3 years ago. We are also building on this success by expanding Prego's lineup as consumers are seeking new elevated flavors and ways to enhance their meals as they cook more at home.\nPrego's new varieties offer bold and vibrant ingredients to meet the growing need to bring more choices to the in-home Italian sauce experience. Pace continued to build momentum in the fourth quarter as we recovered from material shortages that pressured supply earlier in the year, leading directly to share gains in the category. Compared to the prior year quarter, Pace gained 0.4 points of dollar share and grew consumption 14.5%, while repeat rates increased 5.9 points versus 3 years ago. Turning to Slide 17. As I mentioned earlier, convenience and value are key drivers, especially when paired with the continued strength of quick scratch cooking. In support of these key consumer dynamics, we're fueling that behavior through innovation, with the launch of Campbell's Flavor Up concentrated sauces and with the relaunch of Campbell's cooking sauces. Both will expand options and flexibility for dinner variety, especially as consumers look to find ways to incorporate more interesting flavors at home.\nFor example, with Campbell's Flavor Up, cooks can control flavor and portions. Plus, given its concentrated form, a home cook can flavor 15 meals in every $5 package, making it an excellent value that helps stretch consumers' grocery dollars. We will launch this through focused retailer partnerships to methodically build momentum as we create this new exciting way to cook. We are pleased with our results and our innovation. And we remain poised to deliver our goals of achieving $1 billion sauce portfolio.\nTurning to our Snacks division on Slide 18. The division also had a strong quarter, with organic net sales up 6% over the prior year quarter, driven by our power brands. End market performance was strong, growing consumption 8% versus prior year and 20% compared to 3 years ago, fueled also by the performance of our power brands. We have also now successfully delivered our value capture from the integration. And although we recognize that margins do reflect some of the short-term pressure from inflation and COVID-19, we remain very confident in our plans for further margin expansion in the future.\nPerhaps even more encouraging is the continued strength of our growing, highly relevant and unique portfolio of power brands. Taking a closer look at these brands, end market consumption grew 11% versus the prior year. And on a 3-year basis, consumption grew 26%, with double-digit growth across all our power brands versus 3 years ago. With respect to share, our power brands held dollar share in the quarter versus the prior year, with share gains on Kettle Brand, Cape Cod, Snack Factory Pretzel Crisps and Pepperidge Farm cookies.\nOn Slide 20, as we indicated last quarter, our improvement in supply chain execution would enable us to invest in our brands through promotional activity in the fourth quarter. We were encouraged to see that our increased support helped drive positive results. We also are continuing to watch unit share very closely on snacking as we know share of stomach in these categories are very important and provide insight into longer-term growth potential. The great news is we saw unit share improvement across all our power brands in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.\nA particularly competitive segment is Total Salty Snacks, where we were the only major player who grew unit share in the fourth quarter as we've worked hard to keep price and promotion balanced as supply recovered. Gold Fish continues to deliver exceptional results also, driven by relevant innovation and award-winning marketing. We continue to shake things up with our limited time-only strategy. Building on successful collaborations and flavors with Frank's RedHot and Jalapeño Popper as well as with bold and suite partnerships with Old Bay and our recently announced Goldfish Dunkin' Pumpkin Spice Grahams. Since their launch, Frank's RedHot and Jalapeño Popper Goldfish have driven incremental sales of 60% for the Goldfish brand. These 2 innovations along with old Bay Seasoned Goldfish were ranked #1 in velocity for the cracker category innovations during the launch.\nWe're engaging consumers in a unique way, coupling our ability to create delicious flavor-driven snacks with strong partnerships and world-class marketing. This is expanding our consumer reach and usage. The latest accolade is that Goldfish was named one of America's hottest brands of 2022 by Ad Age.\nSo in closing, Campbell enters fiscal year 2023 and with strength in fundamentals, a powerful brand portfolio in advantaged categories and the proven track record of navigating the continued volatile environment. We remain focused on what we can control, and most importantly, continue to deliver our commitments.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results and present more details on the fiscal 2023 outlook we provided in our press release this morning.\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.\nWe are pleased by the strong results we delivered in the fourth quarter in a challenging operating environment. As Mark said earlier, we are proud to have delivered strong full year results, with adjusted EPS at the high end of our original fiscal 2022 guidance range. This is a testament to the progress our team has made throughout the year in areas such as our supply chain, allowing us to support continued elevated demand levels. Additionally, we have made significant progress regarding inflation mitigation via effective revenue management, continued productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives.\nOur cash generation during fiscal 2022 remains strong as well, with cash flow from operations of $1.2 billion, a 14% increase over prior year. Of which, we returned over $600 million in fiscal 2022 to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the end of my remarks, I'll review our fiscal 2023 guidance. But now let's first discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.\nTurning to Slide 25. For the fourth quarter, organic net sales increased 6% as our inflation-driven pricing actions continued to gain traction. Fourth quarter consumption was slightly ahead of our organic net sales performance, driven in part by year-over-year net sales declines in our non-measured channels and due to shipment timing following our July pricing. We now expect inventory replenishment to extend more into Q1.\nAdjusted EBIT increased 5% compared to the prior year to $269 million, primarily due to higher adjusted gross margin, partially offset by higher adjusted administrative expenses and lower adjusted other income. Our adjusted EBIT margin decreased 20 basis points to 13.5% compared to 13.7% in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 8% to $0.56 per share, driven primarily by the increase in adjusted EBIT and lower net interest expense. For the full year, organic net sales increased 2% and adjusted EBIT decreased 4% compared to the prior year, resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin decrease of 90 basis points to 15.1%. Our fiscal 2022 adjusted EPS was $2.85 per share compared to $2.86 per share in the prior year.\nOn the next slide, I will break down our net sales performance for the fourth quarter. Net sales in the quarter, both reported and organic, increased 6%, driven by 14 points of inflation-driven pricing. This was partially offset by a 4 point volume and mix headwind and 3 points of increased promotional spending in the quarter, primarily within Snacks.\nTurning to Slide 27. Our fourth quarter adjusted gross margin percentage increased 40 basis points from 30.9% to 31.3%. Net price realization drove an 840 basis point improvement, reflecting the impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions, net of increased promotional spending in the quarter. In addition, our ongoing supply chain productivity program and our cost savings initiatives contributed 150 basis points and 30 basis points to the adjusted gross margin percentage, respectively.\nInflation and other factors had a negative impact of 810 basis points, with the majority of the impact driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 15%, which was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. Lastly, unfavorable volume and mix had a negative impact of 170 basis points in the quarter. In the fourth quarter, we continued our efforts to mitigate inflation, highlighted on the next page, through a combination of targeted price increases and trade optimization, as well as productivity improvements, primarily in our supply chain, cost-saving initiatives and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization.\nMoving on to other operating items. Adjusted marketing and selling expenses increased $4 million or 2% and represented approximately 9% of net sales as planned or a 30 basis point decrease compared to last year. The increase in the quarter was driven by higher selling expenses, which were partially offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense or A&C. A&C declined by 3% in the quarter, driven by reductions in our V8 beverage business, where investments were moderated to reflect material availability constraints, offsetting increases in snacks, primarily on Goldfish.\nAdjusted administrative expenses increased $14 million or 10% to $153 million. The increase in adjusted administrative expenses was driven by higher incentive compensation costs, higher benefit-related costs and inflation. As a percentage of fourth quarter net sales, adjusted administrative expenses were 7.7%, a 30 basis point increase compared to last year.\nOn Slide 30, we are providing an adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT increased 5% in the quarter, primarily due to an 8% or $44 million improvement in adjusted gross margin, as volume declines were more than offset by the net rate improvement, resulting in a 40 basis point adjusted EBIT margin contribution. In addition, higher adjusted administrative and R&D expenses of $14 million and lower adjusted other income of $13 million had a negative adjusted EBIT margin impact of 30 basis points and 60 basis points, respectively. Despite adjusted marketing and selling expenses increasing $4 million versus the prior year, they were lower as a percentage of net sales, and therefore, had a positive impact on our adjusted EBIT margin of 30 basis points. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by 20 basis points to 13.5%.\nThe following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS growth between operating performance and below the line items. A $0.03 impact of higher adjusted EBIT was further benefited by a $0.01 favorable impact from lower net interest expense. This resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.56, which was up $0.04 per share or 8% compared to the prior year.\nTurning to Slide 32. Our Meals & Beverages division had a strong quarter, with organic net sales increasing 7% versus prior year, driven by increases in U.S. soup and gains in foodservice and Prego pasta sauces. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were partially offset by volume declines and increased promotional spending. Sales of U.S. soup increased 6% due to gains in ready-to-serve soups and condensed soups, partially offset by declines in broth.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 18%. The increase was primarily due to a higher gross margin and lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by higher administrative expenses. Gross margin percentage improved, reflecting the mitigation of ongoing inflation with pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvements. Lower volume and unfavorable mix as well as higher level of promotional spending pressured gross margin percentage. Overall, within our Meals & Beverages division, the fourth quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 160 basis points to 17.2%.\nOn Slide 33, organic net sales in our Snacks division increased 6%, driven by sales of our power brands, which were up 9%. Snacks sales increased due to gains in salty snacks, primarily Kettle brand, and Cape Cod potato chips, as well as in cookies and crackers, primarily Goldfish crackers. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were partially offset by increased promotional spending and volume declines.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter increased 3%, primarily due to higher gross margin, partially offset by higher marketing and selling expenses and higher administrative expenses. Gross margin percentage was relatively flat, reflecting the mitigation of ongoing inflation with pricing actions, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by higher levels of promotional spending, lower volume and unfavorable mix. Overall, the fourth quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 40 basis points to 13.4%.\nI'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal 2022 cash flow from operations increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Cash outflows from investing activities were reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $242 million, which was down from $275 million in the previous year. Cash outflows from financing activities were $910 million. The majority of which, or $618 million, represented the return of capital to our shareholders, including $451 million of dividends paid and $167 million of share repurchases. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had approximately $375 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program and approximately $172 million under our $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $109 million.\nTurning to Slide 35. As covered in our press release, we are providing financial guidance for the full year fiscal 2023. While we expect the current macro challenges to continue, our portfolio of brands is well positioned to meet consumer demand. Our previous pricing actions are now fully in place, with expected price elasticities in fiscal 2023 to be slightly above fiscal 2022 levels. We expect positive top line growth for the year in both divisions, partly driven by an increase in our brand investments, supported by an improved supply chain. Our productivity improvements of approximately 3% and cost savings of approximately $60 million in fiscal 2023 will continue to play an important role in mitigating inflation, which is expected to be in the low teens range for the year.\nOther assumptions incorporated in our full year guidance includes interest expense of approximately $190 million and an adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 24%. We expect pension income to decline year-over-year by approximately $35 million, representing a headwind of approximately 3% to adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS growth in fiscal 2023. All in, we expect net sales, both organic and reported, to be plus 4% to plus 6%, adjusted EBIT of plus 1% to plus 5% and adjusted EPS of flat to plus 4% versus the fiscal 2022 results. We plan to invest in the business, with capital expenditures targeted at approximately $325 million for the year. Although the midpoint of our guidance reflects modest growth in adjusted EPS, it's important to highlight that without this headwind from pension income, we expect a significant step-up in growth across all key metrics while still accelerating investments to continue to unlock our full potential. This significant step-up in growth is more indicative of the progress of the business.\nOverall, we had a strong finish to the year. And we are truly grateful for the continued dedication and commitment by our teams. And with that, let me turn it over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of today's earnings call.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rebecca Gardy, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nSenior VP & Chief IR Officer, Campbell Soup Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. I am Rebecca Gardy, Head of Investor Relations at Campbell Soup Company. And joining me today are Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mick Beekhuizen, Campbell's Chief Financial Officer.\nToday's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude our prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements.\nBecause we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of this presentation.\nOn Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. Mark will share his perspective on our third quarter performance as well as in-market performance by division. Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and then review our guidance for the full year fiscal 2022. And with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call for fiscal 2022. As you read in our press release, we reported strong year-over-year performance. While expected, the performance represents a positive proof point for our continued successful execution in what remains a highly dynamic environment. Over the last several years, we've been navigating substantial headwinds, including the ongoing impact of COVID-19, labor and supply pressures, significant transformation and a rising level of inflation. The team has done a great job of controlling the controllables. We have improved our execution and strengthened our supply chain by increasing labor and capabilities while working with our retail partners to deploy inflation-driven pricing effectively and thoughtfully.\nOur results this quarter reflect this work. We delivered accelerated growth in sales driven by continued consumer demand for our brands and significantly improve supply. The underlying health of our portfolio remains strong, though, we did experience some expected share pressure due to select remaining supply constraints and private label improvement in certain categories.\nAlso returning to growth were adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS, reflecting our successful efforts to mitigate inflation and recover on labor and supply. Although we expect the environment to remain challenging, we are confident that we are on a considerably stronger foundation and in a much better position to navigate the volatile macro environment moving forward.\nOur year-to-date performance and improved execution have led us to raise our previously communicated net sales guidance for the year. We are maintaining our adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal 2022 to reflect the ongoing inflation pressure.\nNow let's cover some specifics from Q3. Organic net sales were up 9%, primarily driven by the impact of our second wave of inflation-driven pricing, which is now reflected on shelf across both divisions. Our service levels also continued to recover, supported by improved labor hiring and retention, which enabled us to meet this demand, recover distribution and enable retailers to begin to rebuild product inventories.\nVolume declined in the quarter, driven by select labor and materials constraints and some price elasticities, albeit much lower than historical levels. We anticipate and have plans for similar volume trends going forward, where demand and inventory replenishment is mitigated by some ongoing materials availability and price elasticity. We are remaining vigilant on elasticities with a variety of contingency plans in place if they begin to accelerate.\nTurning to profit. Net price realization and our strength in supply chain execution offset the impact of accelerating inflation and lower volume, resulting in a 23% increase in adjusted EBIT and a 37% increase in adjusted EPS in the quarter.\nWhile our adjusted EBIT margin was up 190 basis points versus the prior year, I want to remind you of our challenging margin performance in the prior year quarter. I would characterize the improvement as more of a stabilization than a full recovery as the combination of our pricing actions, productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives began to catch up with the current inflation in ingredients, packaging, freight and labor. We expect continued inflation pressure going forward and have already announced a third wave of select pricing to take effect as we transition into fiscal 2023.\nNow turning to in-market performance for the quarter. We saw increased consumption across both businesses. In-market performance remained positive, up 4% versus the prior year. Net sales were 5 points ahead of consumption in the quarter, reflecting the retail inventory rebuild previously noted. On a 3-year basis, consumption grew 14%.\nTurning to Slide 8. Building on our in-market performance briefly discussed on the previous slide, we are very excited about the continued consumption and share growth of our key brands. In fact, all our key brands have grown consumption considerably over the last 3 years, with many of our most important brands at or above pre-pandemic share levels.\nThat said, we experienced some short-term market share pressure on certain brands as we expected. These share losses tend to line up very closely with where our distribution levels were down. Evidence that supply was one of the key drivers of this pressure. As we continue to recover distribution and are fully supporting our portfolio, we expect to see ongoing share recovery. We are already seeing this recovery in snacks in the most recent period.\nIn the quarter, we also experienced some continued share pressure from private label following their distribution recovery and the market's higher overall prices, causing some trading down.\nTurning to Meals & Beverages. I continue to be pleased by the underlying health of demand for our portfolio. Organic net sales in the division increased 9% versus prior year. Consumption grew 4% over prior year, including brands in 4 of our 5 core categories. We feel great about the progress we've made, especially when you compare this business to where we were 3 years ago prior to the pandemic, with consumption growth of 14% over that period and share gains in many of our categories.\nLet's turn to the next slide where I want to spend a moment framing how the Meals & Beverage portfolio is poised to win in the current dynamic environment of accelerating inflation and some recent trading down consumer behaviors. In times of rising inflation, out-of-home meals are the #1 occasion people cut back on. Grocery store occasions are the #1 go-to occasion when consumers feel pressure. Despite recent average prices on shelf increasing in our key categories of soup and Italian sauce in the low to mid-double digits, volumes are still elevated versus the prior year, indicating that both the soup and Italian sauce categories are staying in consumers' baskets as prices are rising. In fact, even in categories where we may be experiencing some share pressure from private label, it is consistently where consumers tend to be trading down into our categories, driving overall accelerated growth.\nAs an example, in condensed soup where private label share has expanded, the category and Campbell's are growing significantly at 9% and 6%, respectively, versus the prior year. To keep fueling this growth, we are also continuing to shift our marketing message towards more value.\nTurning to our soup portfolio on Slide 11. In-market soup consumption continued to grow, increasing 5% versus prior year and 14% compared to 3 years ago. In the quarter, we continued to see strong share performance on key brands. But as expected, we did see pockets of share pressure, in particular, on condensed soup and Swanson, where inflation and slower private label pricing put some pressure on share. However, we remain very confident in our overall competitive position.\nOne proof point is we are growing shares in key strategic areas like our condensed icons: chicken noodle, tomato, cream of chicken and cream of mushroom, the largest SKUs in the condensed business. In addition, overall share in condensed is up nearly 2 points versus 3 years ago prior to COVID-19, even with the most recent recovery of private label.\nFinally, on condensed, we are thrilled that we are retaining the younger millennials that we have added in the last 3 years. The share losses tend to be more concentrated in the baby boomer cohort who are a bit more price-sensitive. As a result, we are very pleased to see our new consumers remain committed to our brand and our household retention remains high.\nOn our ready-to-serve, or RTS, business, share was down in the quarter due to the prioritization of core brands, Chunky and Well Yes! In fact, Chunky's strong performance resulted in 14% dollar consumption growth and nearly 2 points of share growth versus prior year.\nIn the third quarter, Prego consumption increased 7% versus the prior year. Versus 3 years ago, consumption is up 25% and repeat rate up nearly 5 points. Prego also continued to maintain its share leadership in the Italian sauce category.\nFor Pace, a significant recovery in service during the quarter drove share growth of 0.2 points and household penetration of plus 0.5 points and added 800,000 new households in the quarter, driven primarily by millennials versus the prior year. Versus 3 years ago, we grew consumption 14%. And we're pleased with our strong progress to date and remain confident in our ability to achieve our goals of building a $1 billion sauce business.\nAs we outlined in our Investor Day in December, driving the core is critical to achieving our goals, as is meaningful innovation and smart M&A. On Slide 13, we're excited to share a glimpse into our Meals & Beverages innovation plans for fiscal 2023.\nInnovation on our business is critical. And now with supply improving, we can focus on rolling out a robust pipeline of new products. Starting with a new innovative approach to home quick scratch meals, we'll be launching our Campbell's [flavor up!] line. This brings a versatile concentrated flavor sauce that will enable a variety of recipes, and the consumer can control flavor intensity and portions, a quick meal for one or a convenient family dinner.\nPrego will also be expanding its lineup in fiscal 2023 as consumers continue to eat more at home to save money and seek value in the current inflationary environment. Younger consumers especially are seeking new specialty flavors and ways to enhance their at-home meals. Prego's new items will offer bold flavors to meet the growing need to bring greater variety to the in-home Italian sauce experience.\nChunky Spicy, which is adding to the strong results of this important brand, will also be expanding their lineup in fiscal 2023. In fact, Chunky Spicy Chicken Noodle, launched earlier this year, is already rapidly approaching the first quartile of all ready-to-serve soup with strong trial and repeat. We are also launching an Old Bay seasoned variety of clam chowder in conjunction with the limited edition launch of Old Bay Seasoned Goldfish.\nFinally, we're also excited about Pacific ready-to-serve soups and chilis, which we'll be launching in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We continue to drive innovation in this business and expect these new products to be a significant growth driver next fiscal year, solidifying our leadership in organic soup. The combination of our Chunky, Well Yes! and now organic Pacific ready-to-serve soup will create a formidable portfolio and a full range of choices for all consumer cohorts and price points.\nTurning to our Snacks division on Slide 14. We delivered organic net sales growth of 8% versus prior year. We also experienced strong in-market performance of 4% over the prior year quarter and 14% on a 3-year basis. This acceleration in growth reflects the continued underlying strength of our brands, especially our power brands, and significant improvement in our supply chain and service levels. Our Snacks power brands continue to fuel performance with in-market consumption growth of 6% versus the prior year and 19% compared to 3 years ago, reflecting our efforts to prioritize power brands. We feel good that 6 of 8 of our power brands grew consumption year-over-year, with the exceptions being Late July and Pepperidge Farm cookies, both of which were negatively impacted by our remaining supply challenges.\nWith respect to share, we experienced some expected pressure on our power brands as supply and promotional recovery took time through the quarter. Great examples of brands where supply is in place and were supporting the business fully, include both Kettle Brand and Cape Cod potato chips, with share gains of 1.5 points and 0.2 points, respectively. Additionally, we have seen very little elasticity or trade down due to price sensitivity so far. This is true more broadly across all of salty snacks. In fact, private label and value brands lost share in the snacks category in the quarter.\nAnother standout has been our largest Snacks brand, Goldfish, which has grown from a favorite kids food to a top choice of their teen siblings and their parents. In the quarter, Goldfish consumption was up 8% and up 18% on a 3-year basis.\nOn Slide 16, I'll highlight a few of the recent Goldfish new product successes. Family Size and Mega Bites are the #1 and #2 fastest turning cracker innovation in calendar year 2022, fueling a buy rate increase of 11.4% year-over-year for this iconic brand. Family Size is overdelivering across all metrics, with strong velocity, distribution and trial. Goldfish Mega Bites continues to outpace our target and overdeliver on our expectations, driven by strong velocity, trial and repeat rates. Our strategy to broaden our consumer base is working, as evidenced by more than half of buyers being households without children and Mega Bites performing well with older consumers.\nAdditionally, we're building upon the successful limited time-only strategy that brought Frank's RedHot and Jalapeño Popper Goldfish to consumers. We recently launched our Old Bay Seasoned Goldfish. We quickly created a buzz among a passionate consumer base, logging more than 1 billion impressions in 48 hours. The product sold out within 9 hours on Shop McCormick, with velocities very strong across all retail outlets.\nTo conclude, while we feel very good about the progress we've made, the operating environment remains challenging, and we expect ongoing margin pressure from inflation. However, we're in a better position to navigate it and now very much on our front foot.\nGoing forward in Q4, you should expect to see us: one, continue to work hard to use all our tools to combat inflation and manage margin pressure; two, leverage improving supply and execution to further recover distribution and inventory levels; three, return promotional and marketing investment to strengthen competitiveness and combat private label trade down; and finally, four, work to create a compelling fiscal 2023 plan that balances the many nearing challenges while maintaining the momentum and progress on our long-term strategic plans. Although this environment may be different than our original expectations, we are pleased with the continued progress on the business and remain very confident in our ability to achieve our long-term objectives.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Mick to discuss our results in more detail.\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone.\nWe delivered solid growth in the third quarter across net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS amidst meaningful macro headwinds. As Mark reviewed, the sustained consumer demand for our portfolio of brands, improved supply chain execution combined with inflation-driven pricing and limited elasticities resulted in strong top line growth. Our productivity improvements and the benefit of continued cost savings initiatives helped mitigate a continued inflationary environment driving growth in both adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS in the quarter. Q3 adjusted gross margin performance represents the gradual recovery of the year-to-date impact of significant inflation and select supply chain constraints. Also recall that we are lapping a favorable prior year comparison.\nOur cash generation remains strong with cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion through the first 9 months. Additionally, in line with our commitment to deliver value to shareholders, we have returned over $450 million year-to-date to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As I will review in more detail in a moment, we are raising net sales guidance based on our performance year-to-date as well as our expectations for continued strong consumer demand for our brands, limited price elasticities, continued supply recovery and improved service levels. Given the persistent inflationary environment, we are reaffirming our full year guidance on adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS.\nTurning to the next slide. Organic net sales increased 9% in the quarter as consumer demand was strong and we experienced limited price elasticities. Third quarter organic net sales performance outpaced consumption in measured channels by 5 points, primarily driven by retailer inventory rebuild. Adjusted EBIT increased 23% compared to prior year quarter due to improved adjusted gross margin performance and lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by sales volume declines and lower adjusted other income. Adjusted EBIT margin increased by 190 basis points to 15.1% compared to 13.2% in the prior year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations increased 37% to $0.70 per share, driven primarily by the increase in adjusted EBIT, lower adjusted net interest expense and the benefit of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Year-to-date, organic net sales increased 1% and adjusted EBIT decreased 7% compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased by 110 basis points to 15.6% compared to 16.7% in the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS decreased 2% versus the prior year.\nOn the next slide, I'll break down our net sales performance for the third quarter. inflation-driven pricing more than offset the impact of volume declines in the quarter as we experienced lower than historical price elasticities. Organic net sales increased 9% during the quarter, driven by 11 points of favorable pricing, reflecting inflation-driven price increases. This was partially offset by a 3-point volume/mix headwind, reflecting select supply constraints as well as price elasticities, partially offset by retailer inventory rebuild. The impact of the sale Plum subtracted one point in the quarter. All in, our reported net sales increased 7% over the prior year.\nTurning to the next slide. Our third quarter adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points to 31.5% from 30.6% last year. In addition to lapping a sizable decline in the prior year, this margin expansion represents a gradual recovery of the significant year-to-date impact of increased cost inflation and other macro issues, such as labor and materials availability. Net price realization drove an 800 basis points improvement due to the impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions, which only partially offset the inflationary headwinds experienced in the quarter. Our ongoing supply chain productivity program and our cost savings program contributed 110 basis points and 20 basis points to adjusted gross margin, respectively.\nInflation/other had a negative impact of 790 basis points, with the majority of the impact driven by cost inflation as overall input prices on a rate basis increased by approximately 15%. Along with other industry participants, we experienced the impact of significantly increasing cost inflation and other macro issues, such as labor and materials availability. Other supply chain costs had a favorable impact as we lapped higher other supply chain-related costs in the prior year third quarter, including those related to last year's Texas storm, which caused a temporary disruption to the Meals & Beverage division supply chain operations. In addition, we received a onetime benefit in the current year for insurance claims related to the Texas storm. The benefits of these items improved our adjusted Q3 gross margin year-over-year by approximately 100 basis points. Lastly, volume/mix had a negative 50 basis point impact on gross margin, largely due to reduced operating leverage.\nThe previously described initiatives to mitigate inflation, highlighted on the next page, includes price increases and trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization. We remain focused on the inflation mitigation as we expect core inflation for the year to be low double-digits, with a more pronounced impact in the second half of fiscal 2022. Our wave 2 pricing was fully reflected throughout the third quarter. And as Mark noted in his opening remarks, we have already announced a third wave of select pricing to help mitigate the continued increase in inflation as we head into fiscal 2023.\nMoving on to other operating items. Marketing and selling expenses decreased $14 million or 7% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Advertising and consumer promotion expense, or A&C, declined by 16% in the quarter as investments were moderated, due in part to the pacing of supply recovery and some ongoing materials availability issues. Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented approximately 9% as a percent of net sales, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted administrative expenses increased $4 million or 3% to $146 million. As a percentage of third quarter net sales, adjusted administrative expenses were 6.9%, a 30 basis point decrease compared to last year.\nOn the next slide, we are providing an adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT increased 23% in the quarter, primarily due to a 90 basis point or $87 million improvement in adjusted gross margin. Lower marketing and selling expenses contributed $40 million or 140 basis points to our adjusted EBIT margin. The continued headwind of sales volume declines, primarily from the impact of select supply constraints as well as price elasticities, partially offset by retailer inventory rebuild, negatively impacted EBIT by $24 million. Lower adjusted other income had a negative impact of $13 million or 70 basis points. Despite adjusted administrative and R&D expenses increasing $4 million versus the prior year, it was lower as a percentage of net sales versus the prior year, and therefore had a positive impact to our adjusted EBIT margin of 40 basis points. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin increased year-over-year by 190 basis points to 15.1%.\nThe following chart breaks down our adjusted EPS change between our operating performance and below the line items. A $0.15 impact of higher adjusted EBIT was further benefited by a $0.02 favorable impact from lower adjusted net interest expense, a $0.01 impact of lower adjusted taxes and a $0.01 impact from the benefit of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding. This resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.70, which was up $0.19 per share or 37% compared to prior year.\nTurning to the segments. In Meals & Beverages, organic net sales, which exclude the impact from the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business, increased 9%, driven by increases in U.S. soup, foodservice and Prego pasta sauces, partially offset by declines in Canada. Inflation-driven pricing and sales allowances were partially offset by increased promotional spending. Volume decreased, primarily due to supply constraints, driven by labor and materials availability, and price elasticities, partially offset by retailer inventory rebuild.\nSales of U.S. soup increased 15% due to increases in both condensed and ready-to-serve soups, while broth was comparable to the prior year. Segment operating earnings in the quarter increased 18%. The increase was primarily driven by improved gross margin performance and relatively stable marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by sales volume declines. Gross margin performance reflected ongoing cost inflation, which was offset by pricing actions, lower other supply chain costs and supply chain productivity improvements. The lower other supply chain costs were positively impacted by the previously mentioned Texas storm impact. Unfavorable volume/mix also pressured gross margins, largely due to reduced operating leverage as well as higher levels of promotional spending. These results also reflect lower base operating earnings in the prior year third quarter. Overall, within our Meals & Beverages division, the third quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 200 basis points to 19.5%.\nWithin Snacks, organic net sales increased 8% while sales of our power brands were up 13%. Snack sales increased due to increases in salty snacks, primarily Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and Kettle Brand potato chips as well as cookies and crackers, primarily Goldfish crackers. Overall, inflation-driven pricing, sales allowances and lower promotional spending were partially offset by volume declines. Despite some inventory rebuild, volume declined in the quarter, driven by supply constraints based on materials availability and price elasticities. Segment operating earnings in the quarter increased 25%, primarily driven by improved gross margin performance and lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by higher administrative expenses.\nGross margin performance improved as higher inflation and increased other supply chain costs were more than offset by pricing, supply chain productivity improvements, execution improvements and cost savings initiatives. These results also reflect lower base operating earnings in the prior year quarter. Overall, within our Snacks division, the third quarter operating margin increased year-over-year by 160 basis points to 12.7%.\nI'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Year-to-date fiscal 2022 cash flow from operations increased from $881 million in the prior year to $1.1 billion, primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Our year-to-date cash outflows for investing activities were reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $179 million, which was down from $190 million in the previous year. Our year-to-date cash outflows from financing activities were $805 million. The majority of which, or $456 million, represented the return of capital to our shareholders, including $340 million of dividends paid and $116 million of share repurchases.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $425 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program and approximately $173 million under our $250 million anti-diluted share repurchase program. In the quarter, we settled the redemption of all $450 million of our senior notes due to mature in August 2022 with a combination of cash and short-term debt. We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $196 million.\nTurning to the next slide. We are raising our full year fiscal 2022 net sales guidance to reflect year-to-date performance, expectations of continued strong demand for our portfolio of brands and limited price elasticities amidst a heightened inflationary environment as well as continued supply recovery and improved service levels. Although our third quarter adjusted EBIT margins improved relative to the prior year, we expect core inflation to exceed prior estimates for the balance of the year. We expect margin pressure for the full fiscal year despite ongoing mitigating actions, such as net price realization, productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives. Accordingly, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS performance are expected to be consistent with the guidance provided on March 9, 2022.\nFor the full year, we expect organic net sales to be plus 1% to plus 2%. This is a change from minus 1% to plus 1% reported on March 9, 2022. We continue to expect adjusted EBIT of minus 4.5% to minus 1.5% and adjusted EPS of minus 4% to flat versus the adjusted fiscal 2021 results. The sale of Plum is estimated to have a negative impact of 1 percentage point on fiscal 2022 net sales.\nIn closing, while the macro environment remains challenging and increased inflation is certain, we are confident in our outlook for the balance of the year, given the continued demand for our trusted brands and the focused execution of our teams. We are pleased with our third quarter financial results and overall business performance. And we continue to look forward to closing out the year on a strong foundation.\nWe will now turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Thank you.",

My name is April, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Campbell Soup Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. With that, I would like to hand the conference over to your host, Ms. Rebecca Gardy. Ms. Gardy, you may begin your conference.\n\nRebecca Gardy\n\nVP of IR, Campbell Soup Company\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Campbell's second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings conference call. I am Rebecca Gardy, Head of Investor Relations at Campbell Soup Company. Joining me today are Mark Clouse, Campbell's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mick Beekhuizen, Campbell's Chief Financial Officer. Today's remarks have been prerecorded. Once we conclude the prepared remarks, we will transition to a live webcast Q&A session. The slide deck and today's earnings press release have been posted to the Investor Relations section on our website, campbellsoupcompany.com. Following the conclusion of the Q&A session, a replay of the webcast will be available at the same location followed by a transcript of the call within 24 hours.\nOn our call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to Slide 3 of our presentation or our SEC filings for a list of factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. Because we use non-GAAP measures, we have provided a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the appendix of this presentation.\nOn Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. Mark will share his overall thoughts on our second quarter performance, as well as in-market performance by division; Mick will discuss the financial results of the quarter in more detail and then review our guidance for the full year fiscal 2022.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Rebecca. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2022. Before I turn to the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to thank all our teams, especially our frontline colleagues for navigating the impact on our operations during another difficult period of the pandemic. We are now at the 2-year mark of working within this challenging COVID-19 environment, and I'm very proud of their perseverance, continued performance and dedication.\nI also want to take a moment to express our concern for the people of Ukraine. Our sympathies and support go out to them during this crisis.\nAs we outlined during the Q1 earnings call and as you saw in our press release, Q2 was challenging as we expected, including industry-wide constraints on labor and materials availability made even tougher by the winter Omicron surge, as well as ongoing commodity and logistics inflation. However, more recently, labor and service levels are improving as COVID cases decline, and we see greater impact from our aggressive hiring and training. Since October, our full-time filled headcount increased by 10 points, and we now see absenteeism and vacancy rates trending back to normal levels. This is translating to more production and the beginning of a return to normal distribution and inventory levels. We do continue to expect inflation to remain persistent, especially as it relates to logistics. And although we have no direct exposure to Ukraine and Russia, we are monitoring any broader economic impact from the current crisis, especially on commodities.\nAs we look forward, and including the balance of these factors, combined with the greater impact from pricing actions, easing prior year comparisons and continued strong demand across our portfolio, we remain confident in reiterating our previously communicated full year fiscal 2022 guidance. We look forward to returning the business to growth while building momentum in the back half and exiting the year a more capable and stronger business.\nNow let's cover some specifics from Q2. Organic net sales were down 2%, primarily driven by industry-wide labor and supply challenges more than offsetting the favorable impact of net pricing in the quarter. On a 2-year basis, organic net sales remained elevated, growing 3%. End-market performance remained positive, up 1% and this was 3 points ahead of net sales in the quarter, reflecting a lag in inventory replenishment and lower distribution levels due to previously mentioned supply constraints. The end-market demand was balanced across both divisions. On a 2-year basis, consumption grew 9%. And importantly, our brands in 12 of our 13 core categories continued to grow in market consumption.\nDespite this growth, as expected, we experienced short-term market pressure on certain brands. These share losses tend to line up very closely with where our distribution levels are down. Supporting supply is the key driver of this pressure. As we recover distribution and can fully support our portfolio, we expect to return to share recovery as we move through the second half of the fiscal year.\nTurning to profit, lower volume and accelerating inflation weighed on margins and earnings, resulting in a 17% decline in adjusted EBIT and a 16% decline in adjusted EPS in the quarter, both very much in line with our expectations.\nTurning to our Meals & Beverages division, I continue to be pleased by the underlying health and strength of demand for our portfolio. Consumption grew 1% over prior year and was up 11% versus 2 years ago despite our supply challenges. Organic net sales decreased 2% versus prior year, lapping 5% growth in the prior year.\nTurning to Soup on Slide 9, the next chapter of our Win in Soup strategy continues to deliver growth. End-market soup consumption continued to be ahead of the elevated levels in the prior year, increasing 3% versus prior year and 10% compared to 2 years ago. In the quarter, we continued to see strong share performance on key brands, but as expected, we did see pockets of share declines. In particular, on Condensed Soup, we continue to remain very confident in our overall competitive position. However, we experienced some share pressure as private label lapped an extended period of supply constraints.\nAs you see on Slide 10, we had continued success with younger buyers. We performed very well and brought in additional millennial and Gen Z buyers to both our condensed eating and cooking varieties in the second quarter. On total U.S. Soup, household penetration in the quarter was up versus both the prior year and 2 years ago. And importantly, we continue to see more consumers participating in the soup category and purchasing our soup brands compared to prepandemic levels.\nWhile dollars spent per buyer increased due to our pricing actions, volume per buyer remained relatively stable to prepandemic levels despite specific supply constraints in the quarter. For the important holiday period, our soup and broth posted its second largest holiday in the last 5 years, only down compared to last year as consumers return to fewer, larger gatherings during this holiday season.\nIn ready-to-serve, Chunky had a very strong quarter, increasing consumption 9% on top of the 13% growth in the prior year quarter leading to an astounding 25% consumption growth and over 2 points of share growth on a 2-year basis. As we shared at Investor Day, lunch is a key occasion for this brand, and people are now eating even more low-prep lunches compared to prior year. Our focus on the lunch occasion highlighted through a successful advertising campaign, Lunch Time Is Your Halftime with Super Bowl winning coach from the Ram Shanay, is driving a positive sales lift, including among younger households. Also, our latest innovation, Chunky Spicy, which we are expanding, is adding to the strong results of this important brand. In fact, Chunky Spicy Chicken Noodle launched earlier this year is already in the second quartile of all ready-to-serve items with strong trial and repeat.\nTurning to Swanson Broth & Stock. The continued supply recovery led to a fourth consecutive quarter of share growth up 1.2 points in the quarter, a clear win during the important holiday season and a good example of where supply recovery directly translated to share recovery.\nOn sauces, Prego continues to be the #1 share leader. However, some supply challenges on our Prego Alfredo sauce put pressure on share. We expect a steady recovery of supply beginning in the fourth quarter. Pace share continues to improve, while V8 beverage experienced some share loss in the quarter due to high single-digit declines in total points of distribution, or TDPs, compared to prior year driven by material shortages, especially aluminum cans.\nTurning to our Snacks division on Slide 12. Organic net sales were down 3% versus prior year, but compared to 2 years ago, grew 3%. On snacks, we expected a significant impact from supply constraints we experienced. Despite these constraints, end market consumption grew 1% over the prior year quarter and 8% on a 2-year basis, reflecting the underlying strength of our brands, especially our power brands. In fact, our Snacks power brands continue to fuel performance with end-market consumption growth of 3% versus the prior year and 9% compared to 2 years ago, reflecting our efforts to prioritize power brands and to remain competitive.\nWe are encouraged to see repeat rates ahead of prior year on 7 of 8 power brands and ahead on a 2-year basis on all power brands. Particular standouts were our Kettle brand potato chips and Cape Cod potato chips, where we have successfully added capacity. Each had a strong quarter with consumption growth of 26% and 20% compared to 2 years ago, and share growth of almost 2 share points combined.\nTurning to Goldfish, also an area of significant capacity expansion and supply recovery, we performed well in the quarter, holding share in a competitive marketplace and growing consumption by 9%. As we outlined at Investor Day, we recently launched our Goldfish Mega Bites, a bigger, bolder, cheesier Goldfish cracker, and our Family Size Goldfish aimed at meeting key consumer trends. Both are off to strong starts. We are executing our plan to elevate innovation based on consumer insights, resulting in bigger, more impactful ideas.\nSince the launch in January, Mega Bites achieved the fastest distribution growth in recent history of Goldfish innovation launches. Early consumer repeat rates are promising as consumers who purchased once are already coming back to buy again. We launched in January with a highly impactful PR and social campaign. And within its first week alone, Mega Bites achieved over 1 billion earned media impressions. The full activation will run through the summer, and I have to say it feels good to return to what we do best, building our brands. This is an important proof point as we pivot from supply recovery to now running the business in what we believe will be more predictable conditions as we come through the rest of the fiscal year and into fiscal 2023.\nLastly on Goldfish, continuing our successful limited time offer strategy, we're excited about the launch of the limited edition Star Wars The Mandalorian Cheddar Crackers. We have another limited time offer Goldfish release planned for the early summer, including another surprising one-of-a-kind flavor collaboration.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, we expected short-term share headwinds due to supply constraints on certain snack brands, specifically, in Late July snacks, Snyder's of Hanover pretzels and Lance sandwich crackers. Similar to supply pressures on meals and beverages, share pressure aligned with lower TDPs in the quarter compared to prior year. We have taken actions to improve overall performance, including core SKU prioritization efforts to increase production while reducing complexity, as well as prioritizing plant labor recruiting, training and retention. We feel confident these share headwinds are temporary as we've already seen strong improvement in our labor and production levels. As a result, we will return to our planned levels of investment through the back half of the fiscal year and expect to be fully back on track for what our snack brands do best, growing consumption and share.\nTo conclude, we expected Q2 to be tough as we navigated challenges and lapped strong performance from a year ago, and it was. We also expect stronger year-over-year performance in the second half of the fiscal year as we lap easier prior year comparables. In addition, we are in an improving position to meet our share as our staffing levels and vacancy rates are improving, with nearly 3,500 new hires in the last 7 months. Also in the second half, through the combination of our most recent pricing actions, our continued supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives, we will be better positioned to help offset ongoing inflationary pressure. We will remain nimble and use our full range of tools to offset additional inflation as needed, including potential further pricing actions where appropriate. Accordingly, we expect meaningful improvement and recovery in margins, profit and EPS in the balance of the year. And we remain confident in our plans and full year outlook.\nBefore I turn it over to Mick, I'd like to share a change to my leadership team. First, I'd like to take a moment to thank Bob Furbee, our Executive Vice President, Global Supply Chain Officer, who will be retiring after nearly 40 years with Campbell. Bob has had a remarkable career at Campbell and has been a key part of our transformation. We are deeply grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in his retirement. As we announced in January, our incoming Executive Vice President, Chief Supply Chain Officer, Dan Poland, is working to drive operational excellence across our network. He brings extensive experience at all levels of the CPG supply chain, and has a track record of building high-performing teams, delivering exceptional product quality and driving execution which will be invaluable as we continue to deliver growth while also navigating.\nI'll turn it over to Mick.\n\nMick J. Beekhuizen\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter fiscal 2022 results are generally consistent with our expectations despite industry-wide inflation and supply constraints. As you heard Mark describe earlier, strong demand for our portfolio of brands continued in the second quarter. However, higher-than-expected supply chain volatility resulted in lower service levels. Additionally, as expected, accelerating core inflation in the quarter pressured margins. We continue to feel good about our initiatives to mitigate inflation, which include price increases, trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives. Our cash generation remains strong, with cash flow from operations of $766 million through the first half. Additionally, in line with our commitment to return value to shareholders, year-to-date, we have returned nearly $300 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.\nOur first half performance and improving second half actions and continued strong consumer demand despite a tight but improving labor market, give us confidence in reaffirming our full year guidance. Organic net sales declined 2% in the quarter, lapping 5% growth in the prior year. The year-over-year volume decline due to industry-wide labor and supply challenges, more than offset the favorable impact of net pricing in the quarter. Consumer demand remained strong, with second quarter dollar consumption in measured channels, 3 points above our total organic net sales performance. Relative to the second quarter of 2020, organic net sales grew 3%.\nAdjusted EBIT decreased 17% compared to the prior year quarter and was 12% lower on a 2-year basis, due to significant levels of inflation on ingredients and packaging but our Wave 2 pricing will not be fully reflected until the third quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin declined by 2% compared to 16.8% in the prior year.\nAdjusted EPS from continuing expense or 16% and was 4% lower on a 2-year basis to $0.69 per share. Sales declined 3% lapping (inaudible) period, resulting in 4% growth on a 2-year basis. Adjusted EBIT decreased 16% compared to prior year and was down 6% on a 2-year basis, given significant inflation. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS decreased 13%, with (inaudible) averaging.\nOn the next slide, I'll break down our net sales performance for the second quarter. As I mentioned, the industry-wide labor and supply challenges held back our ability to meet the continued strong demand. Organic net sales decreased 2% during the quarter, driven by an 8-point volume and mix headwind, which reflects the supply constraints, Favorable price and sales allowances drew spending in the quarter drove a 1 point gain. The impact of the sale of (inaudible) subtracted 1 point. All-in, our reported net sales declined 3% from the prior year.\nTurning to Slide 22. Our second quarter adjusted gross margin decreased by 340 basis points from 33.8% last year to 30.4% this year. Volume/mix had a negative impact of approximately 170 basis points. Net price realization drove a 480 basis point improvement due to the benefits of our pricing actions, as well as lower promotional spending due to supply constraints.\nInflation and other factors had a negative impact of 820 bps, with nearly 3/4 of the decline driven by core inflation as overall input costs on a rate basis increased by approximately 9%. Along with other industry participants, we experienced significant inflation across all input cost categories, including ingredients (inaudible). The remaining decline was driven by increases in other operational costs due in part to supply chain disruptions. That said, our ongoing supply chain productivity program contributed 140 basis points to gross margin, partially offsetting these inflationary headwinds. Our cost savings program, which is in incremental to our ongoing supply chain productivity program, added 30 basis points to our gross margin. The previously described initiatives to mitigate inflation, highlighted on the next page, include price increases and trade optimization, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives and a continued focus on discretionary spending across the organization. We remain focused on inflation mitigation as we now expect core inflation for the year to be low double digit, up from previously expected high single digits with a more pronounced impact in the second half of fiscal 2022. Wave 2 pricing was effective at the end of the second quarter and will be fully reflected in the third quarter. And although for the second half of the fiscal year, we have a large proportion of our raw materials covered from a pricing perspective. As Mark previously mentioned, we continue to closely monitor any economic impact from the current crisis in Ukraine.\nMoving to the next slide, we have continued to successfully deliver against our multiyear enterprise cost savings initiative year-over-year savings, bringing program-to-date savings to $835 million, and we remain on track to deliver total savings of $1 billion by the end of fiscal 2025, as we shared during our Investor Day.\nMoving on to other operating items, marketing and selling expenses decreased $35 million or 15% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. This decrease although A&C declined 27% as investment was moderated to reflect supply pressure, we expect it to normalize as supply strengthened throughout the year. Overall, our marketing and selling expenses represented 8.9% of net sales during the quarter, a 130 basis point decrease compared to last year.\nAdjusted administrative expenses decreased $8 million or 5% due to benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower benefits-related costs. Adjusted administrative expenses represented 6.5% of net sales during the quarter, a 20 basis point decrease compared to last year.\nOn Slide 26, we are providing a total company adjusted EBIT bridge to summarize the key drivers of performance this quarter. As previously mentioned, adjusted EBIT declined 17%, as the sales volume declined and the 340 basis point adjusted gross margin contraction resulted in a $70 million and $29 million EBIT headwind, respectively. Partially offsetting this was lower marketing and selling expenses, contributing 130 basis points to our adjusted EBIT margin. Lower adjusted administrative and higher R&D expenses had a neutral impact, and lower adjusted other income had a 30 basis point negative impact. Overall, our adjusted EBIT margin decreased year-over-year by 240 basis points to 14.4%.\nOperating performance and below the line items, a $0.16 impact of lower adjusted EBIT was partially offset by a $0.02 favorable impact from lower interest expense, a $0.01 impact of lower adjusted taxes and a $0.01 impact from the benefit of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding. This resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.69, which was down $0.13 per share or 16% compared to the prior year.\nTurning to the segments, in Meals & Beverages, organic net sales, which exclude the impact from the sale of the Plum baby food and snacks business declined 2%, driven by declines in U.S. Retail, including U.S. Soup and Campbell's Pasta, as well as in Canada, partially offset by gains in foodservice. Volume declined due to supply constraints driven by labor and materials availability. Price and sales allowances were favorable in the quarter, partially offset by increased promotional spending relative to moderated levels in the prior year quarter.\nSales of U.S. Soup decreased 1%, cycling a 10% increase in the prior year quarter due to declines in Condensed Soup, partially offset by gains in ready-to-serve soups and broth. Segment operating earnings in the quarter decreased 19%. The decrease was primarily due to sales volume declines and lower gross margin performance, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Gross margin performance was impacted by higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, unfavorable volume/mix, which was largely due to reduced operating leverage as well as higher levels of promotional spending, partially offset by the benefits of pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvement. Overall, within our Meals & Beverages division, the second quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 320 basis points to 16.7%.\nWithin Snacks, organic net sales decreased 3% while sales of Power Brands were up 1%. Segment sales decreased due to declines in noncore businesses and in certain salty snacks, primarily Late July snacks, partially offset by gains in Goldfish crackers. Overall, favorable price and sales allowances and lower promotional spending were more than offset by volume declines, driven by significant supply constraints due to labor.\nSegment operating earnings in the quarter decreased 14% driven by sales volume declines and increased administrative expenses, partially offset by lower marketing and selling expenses. Increased pricing and lower promotional activity, combined with the results of our productivity and cost savings initiatives largely offset core inflation, higher other supply chain costs and unfavorable volume/mix, which was largely due to reduced operating leverage. Overall, within our Snacks division, second quarter operating margin decreased year-over-year by 160 basis points to 13%.\nI'll now turn to our cash flow and liquidity. Fiscal 2022 cash flow from operations increased from $611 million in the prior year to $766 million, primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by lower cash earnings. Our year-to-date cash outflows for investing activities were reflective of the cash outlay for capital expenditures of $129 million, which was comparable to prior year. Given the challenging operating environment, we are now forecasting full year capital expenditures of approximately $275 million for fiscal 2022.\nOur year-to-date cash outflows for financing activities were $352 million, the vast majority of which are $293 million represented the return of capital to our shareholders, including $228 million of dividends and $65 million of share repurchases. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $475 million remaining under the current $500 million strategic share repurchase program. We also have a $250 million anti-dilutive share repurchase program, of which approximately $174 million was remaining. We ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $357 million.\nTurning to Slide 31, we continue to expect full year fiscal 2022 net sales, adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS performance to be consistent with the guidance we provided during our first quarter earnings call. Our full year guidance reflects expected continued strong demand for the balance of the year with steady supply recovery and improved service levels, particularly in the fourth quarter as labor recovers. We have seen consistent improvements in labor attraction and retention driven through the recent recruiting actions and wage increases. However, core inflation is now expected to be low double digits for the full year. Wave 2 pricing will be fully reflected in the third quarter, and we expect to continue managing inflationary headwinds through pricing, supply chain productivity improvements and cost savings initiatives. We expect these actions and improved labor outlook and easier prior year comparisons to result in margin progress and earnings recovery in the second half.\nFor the full year, we expect organic net sales to be minus 1% to plus 1%, adjusted EBIT of minus 4.5% to minus 1.5%, and adjusted EPS of minus 4% to flat versus the adjusted fiscal 2021 results. The sale of Plum is estimated to have an impact of 1 percentage point on fiscal 2022 net sales. This implies for the second half net sales growth of low to mid-single digits and double-digit growth in adjusted EBIT and adjusted EPS.\nOverall, our first half was generally aligned with our expectations, thanks to all the hard work by our teams. I'm truly grateful for their continued dedication and commitment. I will now turn it back to Mark for closing comments. Thank you.\n\nMark A. Clouse\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Campbell Soup Company\n\nThanks, Mick. To conclude, although we fully recognize the volatile nature of the environment we remain in, we continue to deploy more of our time and resources to future plans, growth and supporting the full potential of our business. As we outlined at our recent Investor Day, we believe we have an advantaged portfolio and position going forward, and we are excited that in the second half of this fiscal year will begin to transition from defense to offense after this unprecedented period. And I could not be more confident in our team, brands and Campbell's value creation potential.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Thank you.",

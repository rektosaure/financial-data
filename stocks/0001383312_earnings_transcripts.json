Please note this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's First Fiscal First Quarter 2026 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Ashwin Ghei.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation. Let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. I'm pleased to be here to discuss our strong first quarter results. With a positive economic backdrop, equity markets remain strong and the fixed income market is steady. Capital markets are healthy and our financial services clients are benefiting. And last, we're operating against a pro-innovation regulatory backdrop. As a result, it should come as no surprise that Broadridge is off to a very good start to fiscal year 2026. We delivered strong first quarter results, and we're raising our recurring revenue outlook to the higher end of our 5% to 7% growth range. Our pipeline is growing as our clients look at how they can accelerate change across their businesses. And we're also investing in new governance solutions in expanding our tokenization capabilities and in making value-added acquisitions. With that backdrop, let's dig into the results, starting with the headlines.\nFirst, Broadridge delivered strong first quarter results, including 8% recurring revenue growth constant currency and 51% growth in adjusted EPS. Second, we continue to execute on our strategy to democratize and digitize investing, simplify and innovate trading and modernize wealth management. That execution is driving our results in the form of strong growth, continued product innovation and a growing pipeline. Third, we are using our investment-grade balance sheet and strong free cash flow to strengthen our business. Over the past year, we made a handful of small acquisitions to strengthen our ICS business. And of course, last year, we acquired SIS to accelerate our platform rollout in Canada. And in the last 2 quarters, we repurchased $250 million of our shares. Finally, we expect to deliver strong fiscal year 2026 results. With our positive start to the year, we now expect to be at the higher end of our 5% to 7% recurring revenue range, and we're reaffirming our guidance for 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth and $290 million to $330 million of closed sales. That outlook also keeps us on track to deliver again on our top and bottom line 3-year growth objectives. Let's move to the drivers of our strong start on Slide 4. I'll start with our governance business, where we continue to drive democratization and digitization and to deliver innovation. Governance revenues rose 5%, driven by revenue from sales and continued healthy position growth. Investor participation trends remain healthy across both equities and funds. At 2%, fund position growth was impacted by the timing and mix of communications in the quarter. Looking through that noise, we continue to see fund positions growing in the mid-single digits, consistent with fiscal '25. Total equity position growth was 12%, driven by continued growth in [indiscernible] accounts.\nFor the first half of the year, we expect mid-teens position growth overall with high single-digit growth in revenue equity positions. Five years ago, we began to talk about direct indexing, and we're now seeing it is driving growth in managed account positions. Today, we're beginning to see interest in tokenized equities which could create future sources of demand for new U.S. equity positions.\nOur speed of adoption is uncertain, the SEC has been clear that tokenized securities are still securities. That means they will need to incorporate all the complex features of corporate governance and corporate actions that regular equities [indiscernible], and Broadridge is committed to making all that work.\nWe will be there with disclosure and governance solutions for tokenized equities to ensure that there are no roadblocks to [indiscernible] adoption. It's too early to say how popular tokenized equities will become [indiscernible] and decking, we see them as another leg of democratization that will continue to drive physician growth over time. Beyond position growth, we're also benefiting from a quiet a significant shift in how asset managers and public companies are approaching shareholder engagement and proxy voting.\nLast quarter, we talked about how the growth of Patos investing is forcing the largest asset managers to rethink how they grow. With a growing number of funds, nearly 400 at the end of fiscal '25, representing nearly $2 trillion in assets using Broadridge's voting choice solution to enable their shareholders to engage by expressing their voting preferences. Now we're working with large asset and wealth managers to create an objective, a different approach to voting.\nTo be clear, we're a technology company, not a proxy adviser. Our solution which will be live with a select group of clients disproxy season, will meet an important market need by enabling clients to define and implement independent policies to complement ISS and Glass Lewis. In addition, we're also working with public companies to better engage retail shareholders by increasing the convenience of voting. This past quarter, we launched a pipe program with ExxonMobil to enable retail shareholders to provide standing voting instructions for annual meetings. Shareholders who opt in will continue to receive all the materials they do today and they can change their vote at any time.\nThis approach makes it more convenient to both and has the potential to increase retail voting. It's a new and exciting front in shareholder engagement, and we're seeing significant interest from other public companies. Taken together, these innovations across passive funds active institutional funds and public companies are enabling a quiet revolution in shareholder engagement by leveraging Broadridge's technology to give Main Street investors a greater voice in the companies they own. That's great for our markets. We also completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions in the first quarter to strengthen our governance business. Signal is focused on digital client communications.\nIt yields our customer communications business, a foothold in Europe and strengthens our global relationships with key financial services firms. I join as a retirement plan technology provider that will strengthen our Workplace and Retirement Solutions business. Both are great examples of how small strategic M&A can accelerate our product development. and deepen our product set. Let's turn next to capital markets, where we are simplifying and innovating trading. Capital Markets revenues grew 6%, driven by a combination of new sales and higher trading volumes with a boost for tokenization, which I'll comment in a moment. The growth in new sales is being driven by a balanced mix across both front and back office solutions.\nIn the front office, We're seeing strong demand for our connectivity solutions. And in the back office, we're seeing increased demand for solutions that help our clients simplify their global trading operations. We're also engaging clients in some of the market structure changes coming in calendar '26, namely the move to 225 trading of equities in the second half of '26 and to centralized clearing for treasuries at the end of '26.\nThe good news is that the move to 235 trading will be seamless for Bad bridge clients, highlighting the benefit of a mutualized platform. As we move toward treasury clearing, that is accelerating demand for our DLR distributed ledger repo solution. In September, we processed over $300 billion in tokenized equity -- tokenized trades per day, up from $100 million per day 6 months ago. And we're clearly the leading at-scale platform. Next, regarding to real-time repo, which will make repos a trading and financing instrument and further sale volumes. While we started with repo, the platform is fully multi-asset and we'll be going to other asset classes over the next 12 months. We'll also be incorporating stable coin as the cash rails for real-time transactions.\nMore broadly, we see tokenization as a make a trend over the next 10 years. It's ideal for less liquid, [indiscernible] asset classes, and there could be real benefits in other areas of income, collateral, private credit and alternative assets. One of the avenues for tokenizes activity to grow is on the Canton network, a public permission digital asset network designed specifically for financial services. As a result of our investment in digital asset holdings, and our work on DLR. We have been a super validator on the Canton network since beginning of fiscal '25 for which we have earned Canton coins.\nIn Q1, we recorded $4 million in recurring revenue from our super validated role. In addition, the coin holdings we earned previously have also gained materially in value, as Asma will share in a moment. We see the potential for the Canton network to serve as the operating system for tokenized institutional markets, including DLR. To support this vision, an investor group led by DRW announced yesterday the formation of a Canton focused digital asset treasury or DAT, which intends to invest in Canton client and create applications for the network. We are contributing a portion of our [indiscernible] client Holdings to take an 8% pro forma stake in that DAT, which will trade on the NASDAQ. This transaction is just 1 more indicator of the potential for our DLR and broader tokenization capability to create value as tokenized activity grows.\nMoving to wealth, where we're modernizing Wealth and Investment Management. Revenues grew 22% in the quarter, paced by solid organic growth and the acquisition of SIS. Fiscal '25 was a strong sales year for our wealth business with 3 significant platform sales. So I'm pleased to note that we're making good progress in onboarding these new clients and are on track to begin recognizing revenue at the end of fiscal 2016.\nNovember 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of the SIS acquisition, and I'm pleased with how it's driving value for our business and our clients. Over the past year, we've extended our relationship with key Canadian clients, and we're making strong progress in integrating SIS onto our wealth platform. More broadly, we continue to see a strong pipeline across our wealth business. And finally, close sales. After a strong finish to the fiscal '25 year in June, we closed $33 million in Q1 sales. More importantly, our pipeline continues to strengthen, and we are on track to deliver on our full year guidance of $290 million to $330 million.\nAll this means that Broadridge is better positioned than ever. Tokenization is just one of the many innovations we are driving that are transforming our industry. and setting the stage for long-term growth. Let me close with final thoughts. First, Broadridge delivered strong first quarter results. Second, our first quarter performance is Broadridge on track to deliver another strong year, including recurring revenue at the higher end of our 5% to 7% range and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth.\nWe're also deploying capital to drive value. Third, our results are being driven by the execution of our long-term growth strategy. We're driving to democratization and digitization of governance by delivering new voting solutions that put Main Street investors front and center. We're simplifying and innovating in capital markets across both the front and back office, and we're modernizing wealth management by delivering platform capabilities for clients in both the U.S. and Canada.\nFourth, we're positioned to benefit from the growth of digital assets and the trend towards tokenization A combination of a pro-innovation regulatory backdrop and accelerating technology change is putting digital assets and tokenization front and center as a new mega trend in financial services that creates significant opportunity for Broadridge.\nAcross our businesses, Broadridge is well positioned. Tokenization is the next wave of democratization to drive equity position growth, and our early start makes us the leader in supporting the technology behind tokenized assets trading. And finally, Broadridge is well positioned to deliver on its 3-year financial objectives and beyond. This will be the fifth consecutive 3-year period in which we've met our goals and the opportunity going forward is even larger.\nBefore I turn it over to Ashima, I want to thank our associates around the world. Their focus on serving clients and driving change is how we add value to our clients and our industry every day. and is making a real difference in the financial lives of millions. Amisha?\n\nAshima Ghei\n\nInterim Chief Finance Officer\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning. It's great to be here today to share our Q1 results. Before I begin my review, I want to make 5 key callouts. First, Broadridge is off to a strong start to fiscal '26 with strong recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth. Second, event-driven revenue. We reported $114 million of event-driven revenues in Q1, well above the long-term average, driven in part by a proxy election at a major mutual fund complex.\nThird, we are deploying capital to drive shareholder returns. During the first quarter, we completed 2 tuck-in M&A deals for a total of $56 million and repurchased $150 million of our shares. Fourth, we continue to expect to deliver strong fiscal 2016 results. We are now raising our recurring revenue growth outlook to the prior end of our 5% to 7% guidance range.\nWe are also reaffirming our guidance for 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth and close sales of $290 million to $330 million. And one final call out. digital asset revenues and mark-to-market gains. As Tim referenced, Broadridge recognized $4 million of digital asset revenues related to our work as a super validator on the Canton network. While we have been earning coins for the service over the last year, they had de minimis value. Now as these points have increased in value, they are not only contributing to revenue, their value is also being recognized on our balance sheet.\nAs a result, we recorded a $46 million unrealized gain on the value of the 1.7 billion coins we held at the end of the quarter. That gain was excluded from our calculation of adjusted EPS. With that, let's go to the numbers on Slide 6. I Recurring revenues grew 8% on a constant currency basis, including 5% organic growth. Adjusted operating income margin expanded by 280 basis points to 15.8%. Adjusted EPS grew 51% to $1.51, driven by strong event revenue and closed sales were $33 million.\nLet's move to Slide 7 to discuss our segment recurring revenue, starting with our ICS or governance segment. ICS recurring revenues rose 5% to $518 million. including a 1 point benefit from acquisitions and a 1 point headwind from lower interest rates.\nAs a reminder, the earnings impact of lower interest rates is functionally hedged by lower interest expense on available rate debt. Regulatory revenues rose 4% in Q1, driven by 7% growth in equity revenue positions and 2% growth in fund positions. Regulatory revenues were partially impacted by a shift in fund communications from September to October, which lowered Q1 regulatory growth by 2 points. Data Driven Fund Solutions revenue grew 2% as a 3-point headwind from lower interest rates partially offset strong growth in our Retirement and Worklist Solutions revenue. We also completed the acquisition of [indiscernible] joint in mid-September, which had only a modest impact on growth in the quarter. We expect to see data-driven fund revenue growth accelerate in the second half of the year. Issuer revenues grew 6%, driven by strong growth in both our Disclosure Solutions and our shareholder engagement solutions. Customer Communications revenues grew 8% and driven by organic growth in digital and print revenues and the addition of signal.\nFor the year, we expect ICS recurring revenue at the high end of our 5% to 7% total recurring revenue guidance, including a modest benefit from the [ I ] Joint and Signal acquisitions and the continued drag from lower interest rates. Turning to GTO. Revenues grew 12% in Q1, including 6% organic. Capital markets revenues grew 6% and driven by the growth in our global post rate solutions, which benefited from high trading volumes and by the recognition of digital asset revenues, which together more than offset a point of losses related to the business exit that we discussed last quarter.\nDigital asset revenues contributed $4 million or 1 point to the growth of our capital markets business in the first quarter. With the recent increases in coin value, we expect these digital asset revenues to contribute approximately 1 point to capital markets growth in fiscal '26. Taken together with our growing revenues from distributed ledger repo platform, it's exciting to see our tokenization efforts starting to drive a small but real revenue contribution to our Capital Markets business. Wealth and Investment Management revenues grew 22%, driven by 5% organic growth and the impact of the SIS acquisition.\nAs a reminder, we closed the FIS deal on November 1, 24, and that revenue will be reported as organic for the last 2 months of our second quarter and in the second half of the year. For the year, we continue to expect GTO recurring revenue growth within our 5% to 7% guidance range with higher growth in wealth. Now let's move to Slide 8 to review our key volume indicators. We continue to see healthy growth in investor participation across both equities and funds. Equity position growth was 12%, including 7% growth in revenue positions.\nLooking ahead, our testing showed mid-teens total position growth in Q2. Full year testing is showing low double-digit growth. which would imply revenue position growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. Q1 fund position growth of 2% was impacted by the timing of fund communications in the quarter. Our testing continues to indicate mid-single-digit position growth for both the first half and the full year. In GTO, trade volumes rose 17% for the quarter. driven by double-digit growth in both equity and fixed income volumes. I'll wrap up my discussion of recurring revenue growth on Slide 9.\nIn Q1, recurring revenue growth constant currency was 8%, primarily driven by 5 points of organic growth. Revenue from closed sales remains the biggest driver of our organic growth at 5 points as we onboarded revenues from our $430 million fiscal '25 year-end backlog. Our retention rate was 98% for the quarter. Internal growth contributed 2 points, primarily driven by higher trade volumes and digital asset revenues. Acquisitions, primarily FIS contribute 3 points to growth.\nAnd finally, changes in FX contributed 1 point. Let's close our discussion of revenues on Slide 10. Total revenue increased 12% to $1.6 billion, driven by 5 points of growth from recurring revenue. Higher event-driven revenue drove 4 points of growth. Q1 2016 revenues of $114 million were our second highest quarter ever. The biggest driver of event-driven revenue in the quarter was board elections at a major mutual fund complex.\nThis fund company had its last proxy event in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In the 7 years since that event, the number of positions grew approximately 30%. We highlighting the long-term growth drivers propelling event-driven revenues. Looking ahead, we expect event-driven revenues to return to historic average levels. of $50 million to $60 million per quarter for the balance of fiscal '26. Low to no margin distribution revenues grew 8%, primarily driven by higher postage rates, and contributed 3 points to total revenue growth. Turning now to margins on Slide 11. Adjusted operating income margin was 15.8%.\nAnd an increase of 280 basis points from Q1 '25. This growth was driven by higher event-driven revenue and operating leverage from our scale business. partially offset by our ongoing reinvestments. The net impact of lower interest rates and higher distribution revenues reduced AOI margins by 30 basis points. Let's move on to earnings on Slide 12. Q1 adjusted EPS grew 51% to $1.51, driven by higher event-driven revenue.\nInterest expense was $24 million in the quarter, a decrease of $8 million from Q1 '25 driven by a combination of lower balances and lower rates. As I noted in my call out, Broadridge recorded a $46 million unrealized gain driven by the increase in the value of our digital asset holdings in the quarter. that noncash gain was reported in other nonoperating income and was excluded from our calculation of adjusted EPS, given the volatile nature of digital asset values, we expect to continue to record gains and losses as we mark these digital assets to market every quarter. Let's turn to sales now on Slide 13.\nBroadridge reported closed sales of $33 million, driven by sales of our governance solutions. Looking ahead, our pipeline remains strong, and we are reaffirming our guidance for full year closed sales of $290 million to $330 million. Turning to our cash flows on Slide 14. Broadridge generated free cash flow of $13 million in the first quarter.\nOur strong cash performance was driven by higher earnings and working capital management, and we remain on track to deliver free cash flow conversion of over 100% in fiscal '26. Turning next to capital allocation on Slide 15. We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. In Q1, we invested $30 million in capital spending and software spend with an additional $7 million to onboard clients onto our solutions.\nWe deployed $56 million during the quarter on 2 tuck-in acquisitions to strengthen our governance franchise. In addition, we continue to expect our previously announced acquisition of [ Akalin ] to close at calendar year-end, pending approval by German regulatory authorities. During the quarter, we also repurchased $150 million in Broadridge shares and returned an additional $103 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend. And yesterday, we entered into an agreement to use approximately $340 million of our Canton Coin Holdings as part of a pipe offering in [ PARIMmUNE ] incorporated, a NASDAQ-listed company with the ticker THAR that intends to execute a digital asset treasury strategy for Canton coins. When the deal closes later this week, we anticipate holding warrants for 8% of the publicly traded vehicle.\nLet's start to wrap by reviewing our fiscal 2016 guidance on Slide 16. As I said in my call outs, Broadridge is on track to deliver strong fiscal 2016 results. Given our strong start to the year and the incremental revenue from our Signal and I join acquisitions, we now expect fiscal 2016 recurring revenue growth, constant currency, to be at the higher end of our 5% to 7% guidance.\nWe continue to expect adjusted operating income margin of between 20% to 21%, adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12% and $290 million to $330 million in closed sales. Additionally, I will highlight that we are expecting a more normalized level of event-driven revenue in the second quarter of 26% compared to last year's record $125 million.\nAs a result, we expect 2Q adjusted EPS to be approximately 13% to 15% of our full year outlook. I'll wrap by summarizing my key points. Broadridge is off to a strong start to the year, and the combination of strong performance and recent acquisitions has us incrementally more confident in growth in recurring revenues. We are deploying capital to boost growth and shareholder returns. And last, we remain very much on track to deliver another strong year of recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth in fiscal '26 and deliver again on our top and bottom line 3-year objectives.\nWith that, let's move to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Chuck. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. .\nJoining me on the call this morning are Timothy Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Ashima Ghei.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey.\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. Before I begin my review of our strong results and outlook, I want to share some thoughts on the macro environment. After volatile April, market conditions normalized in May and June. And we saw the beginnings of a bounce back in capital markets activity including new IPOs, M&A, and continued confidence from main suite investors. This positive environment contributed to a strong close to our sales for the year and gives us incremental confidence in our outlook for fiscal '26.\nWith that, let me turn to our results and our outlook going forward. I'll start with the headlines. First, Broadridge delivered another strong year in fiscal '25. Recurring revenue rose 7% in constant currency and adjusted EPS grew 11%, both right in line with our long-term objectives. Second, we're executing on our growth strategy. We're driving the democularization and digitization of governance simplifying and innovating capital markets and modernizing wealth management. Third, and as a result, we are positioned to deliver another year of strong financial performance in fiscal '26 including 5% to 7% recurring revenue growth, 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth and closed sales of $290 million to $330 million. Those results keep us on track to deliver again on the 3-year top and bottom line objectives we shared at our last Investor Day.\nAnd finally, worth translating the execution and financial performance into shareholder value. Last night, our Board approved an 11% increase in our dividend to $3.90 per share. We have now raised our dividend every year since becoming a public company, that's 19 years now with double-digit increases in 13 of the past 14 years.\nLet's move to Slide 4 to start a review of those results. In governance, we're driving the democratization and digitization of investing. Governance recurring revenues rose 6% to $2.7 billion in fiscal '25 driven by strong growth in investor positions. The long-term trend of the democratization of investing, enabling more investors to participate in capital markets or giving them access to a widening array of financial products remains a driving force. The number of equity shareholder positions rose 16% in fiscal '25 with revenue positions growing 12%. Managed accounts were a key driver of this growth and self-directed position growth was also healthy as investors took advantage of market volatility to increase their participation.\nMutual fund and ETF position growth was also strong, growing 7% driven by demand for passive funds. Growth was driven by demand for both equity and fixed income funds or the number of money market fund positions, which have surged in recent years, declined slightly. Driving the digitization of these communications has long been a focus for us. Digitization rates in fiscal '25 for equity proxy communications rose above 90%. And and they were more than 77% for funds. Those rates have increased by more than 25 points over the last decade, translating into hundreds of millions in annual savings from public companies and funds.\nBeyond position growth, Broadridge is making it easier than ever for investors to have a voice in the governance of the companies they own through funds. Nearly 400 funds managing a total of $1.8 trillion now offer a Broadridge voting Trice solution to their shareholders. That's up from 100 funds at the end of fiscal '24 and only 8 funds 2 years ago.\nLooking ahead, we'll be making it even easier for fund investors to opt in by integrating our voting choice options with standard annual and semiannual reports. We're also working with funds in Europe to lower their registration, distribution and disclosure expenses. The acquisition of Acklen, which we announced last month will further accelerate these efforts. Acklen will deepen our roles in intermediary between distributors and funds and enhance the quality and scope of our fund data. And data quality is a key reason our AI-enabled global demand model is gaining traction in the marketplace and becoming an industry standard for helping fund companies predict future demand.\nFinally, our Print and Digital strategy is driving digitization and customer communications with the third consecutive year of double-digit growth in digital revenue. We've rolled out our Wealth and Focused solution to more than 6 million wealth management accounts, only adding 1 million more in coming quarters.\nNow let's move to our capital markets franchise on Slide 5. We continue to make strong progress against our goal of simplifying and innovating across the trade life cycle. Capital Markets fiscal '25 revenues grew 6% to $1.1 billion, driven by a combination of new sales and higher trade volumes. We are seeing strong demand for our trade processing solutions, driven by our clients' need for scalability and global interoperability. We notched several notable back office wins during the year including a sale to a leading Japanese bank, a longtime U.S. client. The bank is now turning to Broadridge to help modernize and upgrade its operations across other markets.\nIn the front office, our NYFIX trade routing solution is seamlessly delivering multi-asset class connectivity to almost 2,000 buy and sell-side clients around the world and powering tens of millions of trades every day. And our order management solution is helping our clients automate complex high- and low-touch trading processes for a growing number of clients. We're also driving innovation in capital markets, Our OpsGPT solution, which marries AgenticAI with our expertise and operations is drawing strong interest from clients looking to optimize their back-office processes in a world of faster settlement and extended trading hours.\nTokenization is clearly a hot topic in markets today. There's real momentum around speeding settlement times and reducing liquidity requirements across multiple asset classes by tokenizing securities and other assets. That's driving strong demand for our distributed ledger repo solution, which is the largest platform for tokenized assets in the world. Daily average trading volumes rose above $200 billion in June, up from $100 million just a few months ago and nearly 5x the size of any other platform. It's a great example of how Broadridge can bring to bear deep domain knowledge and modern technology to drive innovation at scale for our clients.\nLet's turn now to Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 6. Our Wealth and Investment Management franchise had a strong fiscal '25. Recurring revenues rose 12%, driven by the acquisition of SIS. Excluding the impact of the eTrade deconversion, organic growth was 5%. Importantly, our Wealth platform continues to gain momentum in the market. After closing a sale with a leading U.S. wealth manager to modernize the set of in-house solutions in the third quarter we closed another significant U.S. sale in the fourth quarter, this time displacing a long-time competitor.\nIn Canada, the acquisition of SIS strengthened our relationship with key clients and allowed us to accelerate our efforts to bring new capabilities to market. Those efforts were rewarded in the fourth quarter as we closed our first Canadian wealth platform sale with a leading Canadian wealth manager who will use our adviser Workspace solution to modernize and enhance key elements of their front office. We're also seeing strong demand Sentry, our market-leading private credit solution, including a sale to one of the leading alternative managers in the fourth quarter. Sentry sales rose 8% in fiscal '25. And with more asset managers seeking to expand their private credit offerings, we have a strong sales pipeline going into '26.\nOur execution across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management is driving our sales. As I noted earlier, overall client sentiment improved during the quarter, paving a way for us to deliver strong closed sales at the higher end of our revised guidance. I'm especially pleased to see growing sales from our new products. We're benefiting from our efforts to increase investor engagement with new voting choice solutions for funds, our investment in digital omnichannel solutions and our AI-enabled data solutions. And we're seeing growing sales of our wealth platform, distributed ledger repo network and our global post-trade solutions.\nLooking ahead, we have a robust pipeline, which positions us to deliver another strong sales year in fiscal '26, strong for our innovative solutions makes it clear that our clients increasingly see Broadridge as a trusted and transformative partner.\nBefore I close my review, I want to provide a brief update on the regulatory environment. Going into the fall, we see new momentum on digital assets, shareholder engagement, private assets and the digitization of communications. The good news is that we are well positioned to help drive many of these changes, which we see as opportunities for Broadridge. With the recent stablecoin legislation and other changes, it's clear bipartisan support to make it easier for more Americans to invest in digital assets. We see this as a natural extension of the democratization of investing with implications for disclosure, wealth management and capital markets. With [indiscernible], we've already introduced an innovative disclosure solution for digital assets, and we're actively talking to clients about how we can help them grow their digital asset offerings. Second area is shareholder engagement. Both the SEC and Congress are focused on ensuring that institutional investors vote in the interest of the shareholders and that should drive continued growth of our Voting Choice solution for funds. We're also seeing opportunities to help funds and asset owners develop and execute their own custom voting policies using a data-driven approach.\nThird, we are working with our clients and industry partners to accelerate the digitization of financial communications. We're proud of the work we've already done in driving nearly 90% digitization rate for regulatory communications. Now we see an opportunity to further increase digitization by making digital the default for most financial communications. This will take some time but we see it as an opportunity to create next-generation digital experiences that save the industry money, enable more effective disclosure and increase investor engagement.\nFinally, another area we're seeing change is private assets. While growth of private assets has been a strong trend for some time, it is increasing movement to open these products to a broader set of investors and to retirement accounts. This will drive growth in our Sentry private credit platform and longer term could have implications for disclosure. So there's a lot going on, it's exciting. And keep in mind that most of the changes I just described will take time, perhaps years for some. But we are confident that as they do take shape, our scale, domain expertise and commitment to innovation will enable Broadridge to implement change faster and at a lower cost for our clients.\nI'll close my remarks with some summary thoughts on Slide 7. First, Broadridge is executing on our strategy with 7% recurring revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth of 11% in fiscal '25. We are democratizing and digitizing governance by driving shareholder engagement with our digital solutions and by making it easier than ever for investors to participate in the governance of companies they own directly or indirectly. We're accelerating and innovating trading by reducing the cost and complexity of capital markets worldwide and by helping clients take advantage of tokenized trading. And we're modernizing wealth management, one client at a time and on their own terms in both the U.S. and Canada.\nSecond, we're continuing to transform Broadridge. We're leveraging the investments we made in our wealth platform to become a platform company. We're extending a common application layer to more products adding open API architecture to more solutions and adding more applications onto a common BRX data layer. These changes will allow us to scale faster, deliver more value to clients more rapidly and unlock additional value through data and AI.\nThird, and as a result, we're delivering steady and consistent growth. We expect another strong year in fiscal '26 with 5% to 7% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. That outlook has Broadridge delivered positions to deliver -- excuse me -- to deliver on the 3-year top and bottom line financial objectives we shared with you at our last Investor Day.\nFourth, we're using your capital efficiently and effectively with 100% plus free cash flow conversion, ROIC in the mid- to high teens, attractive tuck-in acquisitions and an 11% dividend increase. And finally, Broadridge remains positioned for long-term growth. Potential regulatory changes are only adding to the long-term trends driving our growth, including the democratization of investing the acceleration of trading, the modernization of wealth management, data and AI and regulatory change. Our position is our clients' trusted and transformative partner positions us well to help them adapt to change with modern technology and innovative new products that will help drive their growth. I've never been more optimistic about the opportunities in front of our company and about how well we are positioned to help our clients in this evolving environment.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ashima, I want to thank our 15,000 associates around the world. Their work and commitment to serving our clients is driving our transformation of our company and our industry. Ashima?\n\nAshima Ghei\n\nInterim Chief Finance Officer\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning. It's great to be here today to share our strong fiscal '25 results and our fiscal '26 guidance. Before I begin my review, I wanted to make 5 key callouts. First, the fourth quarter, Broadridge closed the year with a strong quarter including 6% organic recurring revenue growth and $114 million in closed sales. Second, event-driven revenue. Event-driven revenues was $79 million in the fourth quarter, ending a record $319 million year on a strong note, and contributing to our 11% adjusted EPS growth.\nLooking ahead, we expect that event-driven revenues will decline in fiscal '26 but will remain above the historical average. Third, free cash flow. Broadridge generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '25, equal to 104% of our adjusted net income. As a result, we enter fiscal '26 in a strong position to make internal investments, fund a strong dividend, pursue strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders. Fourth, backlog. Thanks to a strong finish on sales, our recurring revenue backlog stands at $430 million. At 10% of recurring revenue, it gives us great visibility into the biggest driver of our growth in fiscal '26 and '27, which leads me to my fifth and last call out. Our guidance calls for another strong year in fiscal '26 and keeps us on track to deliver on our 3-year top and bottom line growth objectives.\nWith that, let's go to the numbers on Slide 8. Fiscal '25 recurring revenues grew 7% on a constant currency basis including organic growth of 5.5%. Adjusted operating income margin expanded by 50 basis points to 20.5%. Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $8.55, and close sales were $288 million. For the fourth quarter, recurring revenue constant currency grew 7% to $1.4 billion. including 6% organic growth. Adjusted EPS rose 1% as we increased our growth investments. And we delivered $114 million in sales.\nLet's move to Slide 9 to discuss our segment recurring revenue. ICS recurring revenues rose 5% to $959 million in the fourth quarter, led by strong growth in regulatory revenues. For the full year, ICS recurring revenues rose 6%. Regulatory revenues rose 8% in Q4 and 7% for the full year, driven largely by strong position growth across both equities and funds. Equity revenue position growth, which excludes small or fractional positions for which we do not bill issuers, was 14% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Fund position growth was 7%. The impact of higher position growth was partially offset by slower growth in other regulatory communications and international revenues.\nData-driven Fund Solutions revenues were flat in Q4 and rose 5% for the full year. During the quarter, strong growth in our data and analytics revenues were offset by a modest decline in our Retirement and Workplace Solutions, which was impacted by lower float income. For the full year, we saw strong growth in our Data and Analytics Solutions and Retirement and Workplace Solutions. Issuer revenue grew 3% in the quarter and 5% for the full year, driven by balanced growth across our shareholder engagement and disclosure Solutions, partially offset by lower float income. Customer communications revenues rose 3% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year as we continue to execute our print to digital strategy.\nStrong growth in our digital solutions including the third consecutive year of double-digit growth was offset by lower growth in print revenues. Looking ahead to fiscal '26, we expect another year of steady and consistent growth in the ICS business, in line with our overall recurring revenue guidance and led by continued strong growth in regulatory revenues.\nTurning to GTO on Slide 10. GTO revenues grew 12% in Q4 and full year revenues rose 8% to $1.8 billion. Capital markets revenues grew 4% for the quarter, driven by new sales and growth in trade volumes, partially offset by losses related to an exit of a business. Full year revenues rose 6% driven by growth across both our front office BTCS and back-office post-trade solutions.\nWealth and Investment Management revenues grew 26% in the fourth quarter, driven by 11% organic growth and the impact of the SIS acquisition. Organic growth benefited from the timing of license revenues which contributed 5 points of growth. Full year Wealth and Investment Management revenues rose 12% driven by the acquisition of SIS. Adjusting for the impact of the E*TRADE deconversion, full year organic growth of 1% would have been 5%.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '26, we expect GTO to grow within our 5% to 7% historical range with higher growth in Wealth Management and lower growth in Capital Markets. Now let's move to Slide 11 to review our key volume indicators. Broadridge continues to benefit from strong growth in investor participation across both equities and funds. Fourth quarter equity position growth was 18%, including 14% growth in revenue-generating positions. Fund position growth was 7%. For the full year, the combination of 12% equity revenue position growth and 7% mutual fund and ETF growth was at the high end of the long-term trend of mid- to high single-digit blended average position growth.\nLooking ahead to the first half of fiscal '26, our position testing is showing low double-digit equity position growth, which we expect will translate into high single-digit revenue position growth. We expect fund position growth to remain in the mid-single digits. In GTO, trade volumes rose 14% for the quarter as we saw double-digit growth in both equity and fixed income trade volumes. For the year, trade volumes were up 13%.\nI'll wrap up my discussion of recurring revenue growth on Slide 12. For the quarter, recurring revenue growth constant currency was 7%, primarily driven by 6 points of organic growth. Revenue from closed sales remain the biggest driver of our organic growth at 5 points as we onboarded revenues from our fiscal '24 year-end backlog. Our retention rate was 98% for the quarter. Our 97% full year retention rate included a 1 point impact from the E*TRADE deconversion. Internal growth contributed 2 points, primarily driven by position growth and higher trade volumes. Acquisitions, primarily SIS contributed 2 points to growth. Finally, changes in FX reduced reported growth by 10 basis points.\nLet's close our discussion of revenues on Slide 13. I Total revenue in Q4 increased 6% to $2.1 billion, driven by 5 points of growth from recurring revenue. Event-driven revenue of $79 million benefited from higher levels of mutual fund proxy activity and contributed less than 1 point to growth. Low to no margin distribution revenues grew 4%. And contributing 1 point to total revenue growth.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 14. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income margin was 27%, a decline of 180 basis points from fourth quarter '24 as operating leverage from our scale business was offset by the timing of growth investments. On a full year basis, adjusted operating income margin was 20.5%, up 50 basis points. As the combination of strong recurring revenue, record event revenue and strong operating leverage enabled Broadridge to increase investments in key growth initiatives while offsetting the impact of the E*TRADE deconversion. The impact of float and distribution revenues was a 10 basis point headwind to our fiscal '25 AOI margin.\nLet's move on to sales. Broadridge reported fully closed sales of $288 million. Backing out the benefit of sales of our tailored shareholder report regulatory solution, close sales were essentially flat year-over-year. Turning to our cash flows on Slide 16, Broadridge generated free cash flow of $1.1 billion in fiscal '25, up 12% from fiscal '24 driven largely by higher earnings. Free cash flow conversion was 104%.\nTurning next to capital allocation on Slide 17. We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. In fiscal '24, we deployed $115 million in capital spending and software with an additional $12 million to onboard clients onto our platforms. We returned $402 million to shareholders through our dividend. After internal investment and dividends, targeted M&A is a core part of our capital strategy. We deployed $193 million to strengthen our wealth franchise in Canada with the acquisition of SIS and made 2 other small tuck-in acquisitions in our ICS business. More recently, in July, we announced the acquisition of Akalin, which will extend the suite of services we offer to our fund clients in Europe. This approximately $70 million acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal year '26. We also returned $100 million to shareholders through a fourth quarter buyback and repaid $104 million of our debt.\nAt June 30, our leverage ratio was 2x, below our target of 2.5x, giving us ample capacity to pursue additional strategic M&A and/or repurchase shares. Last night, our Board approved an 11% increase in our annual dividend to $3.90 per share. This marks the 13th double-digit increase in the last 14 years, which underscores our sustained earnings growth over the period. Our capital-light model and our long-term commitment to a strong and growing dividend as a component of balanced capital allocation.\nI will close my prepared remarks this morning on Slide 18 with some detail on our guidance. As we enter fiscal '26, we expect another year of strong recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth, accompanied by underlying margin expansion and higher sales. Let me walk through each of these points, starting first with revenue. We expect recurring revenue growth constant currency of 5% to 7% with balanced growth across both ICS and GTO. We expect organic growth to be driven by new sales as we onboard our $430 million backlog and the acquisition of SIS adding approximately 60 basis points to growth. The acquisition of Akalin is not expected to have a significant impact on our fiscal '26 recurring revenue growth.\nAfter setting a record in fiscal '25, we anticipate a lower but still healthy year for event-driven revenues. We anticipate event-driven revenues will be at the high end of their historical $230 million to $280 million range, driven by a first quarter proxy campaign at a major mutual fund complex. Distribution revenues are forecast to grow at mid-single-digit range, powered in part by higher postage rates. We expect these low to no margin revenues to have a dilutive impact to our reported margins.\nNow let's move to margin. We expect adjusted operating income margin will be 20% to 21%, approximately flat to fiscal '25. The combination of operating leverage and disciplined expense management should enable us to fund ongoing investments and deliver over 50 basis points of core margin expansion excluding the impact of float and distribution income. Third, EPS. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12%, embedded in this outlook is an expected tax rate of 22%. Additionally, for the first quarter of fiscal '26, we expect our adjusted EPS to account for 12% to 15% of our full year earnings roughly in line with our historical average. Finally, we expect closed sales of $290 million to $330 million.\nSo let's wrap up with a quick summary of the key takeaways from our strong fiscal '25 results. First, Broadridge delivered another year of strong and sustainable recurring revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. Second, our guidance for fiscal '26 calls for another strong year and keeps us on track to deliver on our 3-year top and bottom line objectives. Third and last, our strong free cash flow has the company well positioned to make internal investments, fund another double-digit dividend increase, pursue strategic and value-enhancing M&A and repurchase shares. Net-net, Broadridge is entering fiscal '26 well positioned to continue to deliver strong and sustainable growth.\nWith that, let's move to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Third Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. The earnings release and the slides that accompanied this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Ashima Ghei.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and the presentation.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results, and we are on track to deliver a strong fiscal 2025. To understand our confidence in the year, let me start with some observations on the current market. Clearly, there has been significant uncertainty and market volatility over the past several weeks. As a SaaS technology provider with primarily U.S. exposure, the direct impact on Broadridge has been modest to date. Market trading volumes have been unusually high. Given our strong scalability, our technology has performed well, and higher volumes have been a modest near-term positive.\nLike us, our financial services clients are also benefiting from high trading volumes and are performing well. More broadly, this period of volatility highlights the strength and stability of our business. With 94% recurring fee revenues, 98% revenue retention rate and a $450 million revenue backlog, we have strong visibility into our growth over the next 12 to 18 months, which in turn enables us to continue to invest in the solutions that will propel our future.\nWhile this period of uncertainty does have the potential to influence the timing of new investments by our clients. The breadth of our solutions means that we can help clients both reduce cost and drive innovation, which means we can help them in any economic scenario. At the same time, the long-term trends that are shaping financial services, including the democlarization of investing, acceleration of trading, digitization of communications and regulatory change are not slowing down.\nWe're seeing those trends play out directly in our results, as I'll touch on in a moment. And Broadridge is one of the only players that has both the deep expertise and proven ability to drive the innovation at scale that's necessary to help our clients adapt to these trends. So while markets are likely to remain volatile and the economic outlook murky over the next few months, I'm confident that Broadridge is well positioned to deliver strong fiscal year 2025 results, and we remain on track to hair 3-year objectives and we are positioned to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.\nSo with those thoughts, let's get to the headlines on Slide 3. First, Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results, including 8% recurring revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. Second, these strong results in the phase of growing market uncertainty highlight both the resilience of our business and the continued execution of our growth strategy to digitize and democratize investing, innovate and simplify trading and modernize wealth management. Third, Broadridge remains on track to deliver another year of steady and consistent top and bottom line growth. We are reaffirming our guidance for 6% to 8% recurring revenue growth constant currency and expect to deliver adjusted EPS growth in the middle of our 8% to 12% growth guidance with strong free cash flow.\nFinally, our outlook for fiscal '25 keeps us on track to achieve the 3-year growth objectives we laid out at our December 2023 Investor Day. Our results demonstrate the power of our strategy and our proven ability to execute.\nSo let's turn to Slide 4 to look at the key drivers of that execution, starting with our governance business. Governance recurring revenues rose 6%, driven by new sales and continued growth in investor participation. Equity position growth strengthened to 15% in the quarter, the highest quarterly growth rate since the end of fiscal '22. Equity position growth began to pick up in October and continued to strengthen though the third quarter even as markets began to soften in February.\nThe acceleration in position growth was driven by managed accounts. While self-directed account growth remained stable in the mid-single digits. An important trend I want to call out is the growth of smaller positions, likely driven by direct indexing. We've talked about this for a while, but we are now really seeing it begin to scale. That's exciting because one of the promises of democratization is it is opening the door for an increasing number of investors to take advantage of the sophisticated strategies available to institutional investors, like model-based investing and direct indexing.\nThis evolution is driving rapid growth in small account sizes. What's also is exciting is it highlights how innovation is working for public companies and funds. Fractional positions, which include managed accounts with less than 5 shares and fractional shares in self-directed accounts are free to public companies and funds, leveraging our technology to make democratization cost-effective for all stakeholders. These factional positions do not translate immediately into revenue for Broadridge. But the good news is that we can expect many of these accounts to go to larger position sizes over time, providing an additional foundation for Broadridge's long-term growth.\nMeanwhile, Fund position growth remained healthy at 6%, driven by continued demand for passive funds. Across our ICS business, new product innovation continues to be the biggest driver of growth. Demand for our digital solutions and our customer communications business remains very strong, and I was pleased to see another sale of our AI-enabled global demand data and analytics model to another large asset manager. It's the 13th win for that AI data product since it was launched last year, highlighting the unmatched quality and depth of our data.\nLet's turn next to capital markets, which reported 10% recurring revenue growth. In Capital Markets, we're simplifying trading across the front and back office. A key part of that value proposition is our ability to seamlessly scale our post-rate capabilities in periods of market stress. That was certainly the case in the week following April 2, when our settlements platforms processed record fixed income trades and double our typical volume and equities.\nOur ability to offer seamless scalability and global interoperability continues to drive demand for our global post-trade solutions. We closed 2 notable post trade sales in the third quarter, including 1 to a rapidly growing trading firm that builds on a long-term relationship that already includes both front and back office solutions in the U.S. and Europe.\nWe're also delivering innovation at scale in other asset classes. Our distributed ledger repo solution is now processing $100 billion in daily average trading volume as we onboard new clients. And in early April, we completed a successful integration with finality, a blockchain-based wholesale payments firm and the next step toward real-time settlement of intraday repo transactions.\nIn Wealth and Investment Management, revenues grew 13%, driven by the acquisition of SIS. The integration of SIS is well underway and we're making strides in integrating our Canadian wealth platforms with our newer wealth modules. In the U.S., we continue to make progress on the rollout of our next-generation wealth platform. We now have a total of 34 clients live on one or more platform components, and we continue to see strong sales momentum.\nDuring the quarter, we closed a major sale with a leading U.S. wealth manager to provide a suite of solutions linked by a common data layer, open APIs and a consistent user interface. The decision by this client to modernize key parts of this technology on the Broadridge platform is a great validation of our strategy to offer our clients transformation on your own terms.\nSpeaking of sales, we ended March with year-to-date closed sales of $174 million, including $71 million in Q3. Excluding sales of our tailored shareholder report solutions, Closed sales rose 9% for both the year-to-date period as well as the third quarter, tracking right in line with our full year guidance. As we enter our critical selling quarter in the fourth quarter, we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing significant interest in our digital solutions, capital markets platforms and wealth components.\nAt this point, the vast majority of our Q4 pipeline is in late-stage business or legal negotiations. At the same time, as I noted in my opening, there's now significant uncertainty about the health of the economy and the impact of tariffs. And we are seeing the closing process taking longer in Q4 than it did in Q3. Reflecting that elongation, we're taking a more cautious view of our fourth quarter sales and are updating our guidance for closed sales for fiscal '25 to $240 million to $300 million.\nGiven our backlog of previously closed business to onboard, we do not expect this to impact our FY '26 results. And as I've said in the past, whether something closes in June or August is really immaterial to our future growth. I'll close my remarks with a view summary comments on Slide 5.\nFirst, drivers executing on our growth strategy. We're driving the digitization and democratization of investing as we process double-digit growth in the number of shareholder positions. And our investments in digitization are helping to drive down the cost of serving these physicians and are driving strong demand for our digital solutions. We're simplifying and innovating and trading to seamlessly process trillions of dollars and trades per day, while the distributed ledger repo capabilities are making tokenization a reality in the repo market not tomorrow, but today.\nAnd our next-generation wealth platform is gaining momentum in the market in both the U.S. and Canada. Second, that execution is driving strong financial results, including 8% recurring revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter. More importantly, we are on track to deliver another year of steady and consistent recurring revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth with strong free cash flow in fiscal '25, even with the higher uncertainty. And that, in turn, keeps us on track to deliver our 3-year financial objectives for the fifth consecutive 3-year cycle.\nMore broadly, periods of uncertainty have historically strengthened Broadridge's position in the marketplace. Our recurring revenue business model helps insulate us from market swings and gives us the visibility to fund ongoing growth investments. Our broad product portfolio gives us the ability to help our clients drive productivity or growth depending on their requirements. And our capital-light model and investment-grade balance sheet gives us the capital flexibility to fund strategic M&A and return capital to shareholders.\nSo finally, as a result, Broadridge is well positioned for long-term growth. The long-term trends reshaping the financial services industry are increasing, not slowing down, which means our clients need a trusted and transformative partner like Broadridge to help them navigate those changes and grow their business. I'm confident that as time passes Broadridge will be stronger and better positioned than ever for long-term growth. Before I turn it over to Asha I want to thank the Broadridge team around the world. Their work, their focus on our clients is driving the growth of our company and the transformation of our industry. Thank you.\nAnd now I'll turn it over to Ashima. Ashima?\n\nAshima Ghei\n\nInterim Chief Finance Officer\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning. It's great to be here with you today. I'll start with the headline, which is that Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results, including 8% recurring revenue growth, constant currency and 9% adjusted EPS growth. And just as importantly, we remain on track to deliver another year of steady and consistent growth in fiscal '25. Before I dive into my discussion of those results and our guidance, I want to make 4 callouts.\nFirst is revenue. Our third quarter recurring revenue includes the impact of 2 headwinds. The first is FX. And the second is the movement of a meaningful wealth management license renewal into the fourth quarter. Taken together, these 2 items represented a 160 basis points headwind in to our reported third quarter recurring revenue growth.\nSecond, we continue to take a disciplined approach towards managing our expense base. During the quarter, we made the difficult decision to reduce our distribution footprint by closing a print operation in our customer communications business, resulting in a $5 million restructuring charge.\nMy third callout is that as of last week, we have records for over 90% of proxy positions for the full year, which, when combined with our recurring revenue backlog gives us a high degree of confidence in our full year recurring revenue and adjusted EPS guidance even in this uncertain environment. Finally, capital. We are on track to deliver on our free cash flow conversion target for the year, giving us significant flexibility to pursue our balanced capital allocation strategy.\nWith that, let's go into the numbers on Slide 6. In the quarter, recurring revenues grew 8% on a constant currency basis, driven by 6% organic growth and 2 points from our acquisition of SIS. Adjusted operating income grew 10%, driven by strong organic recurring revenue growth. AOI margins rose 100 basis points to 22.4% and adjusted EPS increased 9% to $2.44. Finally, we delivered close sales of $71 million. Year-to-date sales were 174 million.\nLet's move to Slide 7. Third quarter recurring revenue grew 8% to $1.2 billion, in line with our full year guidance for 6% to 8% growth. Our growth was primarily driven by new sales balance across ICS and GTO as well as internal growth from higher trade volumes and higher positions.\nLet's turn to Slide 8 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. ICS recurring revenues rose 6% to $740 million. Regulatory revenues grew 6%. 15% growth in equity positions was driven by a healthy 11% growth in equity revenue positions with the balance coming from the strong growth in smaller non-revenue positions that Tim highlighted. Fund position growth was 6%. Overall revenue growth from strong position growth was offset by mix, including slower growth in international.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect mid-teens equity position growth, including low double-digit equity revenue position as well as mid-single-digit fund position growth. Together, this should drive high single-digit regulatory revenue growth. Data-driven Fund Solutions revenue increased 8%, driven by double-digit growth in our data and insight products. Issuer revenue growth of 2% was driven by strength in our shareholder engagement solutions, partly offset by a modest decline in Disclosure Solutions revenues.\nCustomer Communications revenue growth was 5%, led by double-digit growth in digital revenue, as we continue to execute our print to digital strategy. Overall, we continue to expect full year ICS recurring revenue growth to be in line with our 6% to 8% recurring revenue growth guidance range for the full company.\nTurning to GTO. Revenue grew 11% to $464 million. Capital markets revenues grew 10%, driven by strong growth in both our global post rate capabilities, which benefited from higher trading volumes as well as our BTCS, front office solutions. Higher license revenue contributed 3 points to capital markets growth in the quarter. Wealth and Investment Management growth was 13%, driven by the acquisition of SIS which more than offset a 3% decline in organic revenue growth, driven by lower license revenues.\nLower license revenue included a 5-point headwind to wealth management organic growth from the license renewal shift from Q3 to Q4 that I highlighted in my opening remarks. In Q4, we expect strong wealth management growth, driven by high single-digit organic growth, including that timing benefit from license revenue and continued contribution from SIS. For the full year, we continue to expect overall GTO recurring revenue growth to be in line with the 6% to 8% recurring revenue guidance.\nNow let's move to Slide 9 to review our key volume indicators. Broadridge continues to benefit from strong growth in investor participation across both equities and funds. Third quarter equity position growth was 15%. For the full year, we now expect mid-teens equity position growth. We are now in the peak period for annual meetings. As of last week, have received record data for over 90% of proxies expected for this fiscal year. These records, combined with our testing give us a high degree of confidence in both our position growth and revenue outlook.\nFinally, based on recent trends, our forecast calls for low double-digit growth in equity revenue position. Mutual fund and ETF position growth was 6% in the third quarter. We expect a similar level of growth in the fourth quarter. In GTO, trade volumes rose 14% on a blended basis, led by double-digit growth in both equity and fixed income trade volumes. Strong trade volume growth continued into April, and we expect continued double-digit growth in the fourth quarter.\nI'll wrap up my discussion of recurring revenue growth on Slide 10. Revenue from closed sales remains the biggest driver of our recurring revenue growth at 5 points as we onboard revenues from our $450 million year-end backlog. That growth was partially offset by 2 points of losses, resulting in a revenue retention rate of 98%. Internal growth contributed 2 points, primarily driven by fund and equity position growth and higher trading volumes. As a result, organic revenue growth was 6%.\nAcquisitions contributed 2 points, primarily driven by the revenue from FIS. Finally, changes in FX reduced our reported recurring revenue growth by 90 basis points, driven by the decline in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar. The 90 basis points third quarter headwind from FX marks the largest quarterly impact since fiscal '23. Given the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we see a much more subdued FX impact going -- outlook going forward and a headwind of only 20 basis points for the full year versus our constant currency guidance.\nLet's close the discussion of revenues on Slide 11. Total revenue increased 5% to $1.8 billion, driven by 5 points of growth from recurring revenues. Event-driven revenues declined $14 million to $53 million as we lapped 2 notable proxy contests in Q4 of last year. We expect fourth quarter activity to be in line with our $55 million to $60 million historic quarterly average. Low to no margin distribution revenues grew 4%, contributing 1 point to total revenue growth. As the approximately $32 million impact of postage rate increases, more than offset lower mail volumes.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin was 22.4%, an increase of 100 basis points driven by the operating leverage from higher recurring revenue. This was impacted by a 10 basis point headwind from changes in float income and distribution revenues. During the quarter, we recognized $11 million of non-GAAP acquisition, integration and restructuring charges, $5 million of this was related to the closing of the print operation I noted earlier with most of the remaining related to the integration of our SIS acquisition.\nAs I noted in my opening remarks, we are committed to maintaining our expense discipline, while continuing to deliver strong returns to our shareholders and funding reinvestment in our business. That's enabled by the operating leverage in our scale business. which provides the flexibility to manage our expense base across market cycles. For the year, we remain on track to generate 50 basis points plus of underlying core margin expansion.\nLet's move on to sales. Closed sales were $71 million, $8 million lower than Q3 '24. Year-to-date sales are $174 million. compared to $185 million last year. Fiscal '24 closed sales benefited from strong sales of our tailored shareholder report solutions, which fund companies were required to implement last July. Excluding TSR sales, closed sales rose 9% for both the quarter and the year-to-date period.\nTurning to our cash flows. Q3 free cash flow was $337 million, an increase of $170 million from Q3 '24, driven by higher earnings and modestly lower capital investment. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $393 million, versus $259 million for the first 9 months of fiscal '24. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105% in fiscal '25.\nTurning next to capital allocation on Slide 15. Year-to-date, we have deployed $78 million in capital spending and software, and returned approximately $300 million to shareholders via our dividend. Platform investments were $9 million as we continue to work with clients to manage our onboarding spend. We've also deployed $193 million for targeted M&A investments, primarily to purchase SIS. As I noted earlier, our strong balance sheet and capital-light business model, give us significant flexibility to continue to fund growth investments, pursue value-accretive strategic M&A and repurchase shares.\nLet's conclude by reviewing our full year guidance on Page 16, followed by closing key messages. With 2 months left and high visibility into fiscal '25 position growth, we continue to expect recurring revenue growth constant currency of 6% to 8% for the full year, with only a modest headwind from changes in FX rates. We expect our recurring revenue growth to be balanced across both our ICS and GTO segments. We also continue to expect fiscal '25 AOI margin of approximately 20% and adjusted EPS growth in the middle of our 8% to 12% range.\nWe now expect closed sales of between $240 million to $300 million. And I will also note that we continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105% of adjusted earnings. To bring all of this together and highlight what it means for our financial objectives, I'll share some concluding thoughts.\nFirst, Broadridge reported strong third quarter results. Second, we remain very much on track to deliver strong fiscal year results, including 6% to 8% recurring revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth in the middle of our 8% to 12% guidance range. Third and probably most relevant for the environment that we are in, I want to emphasize the resilience of our business model. Broadridge has a long history of delivering consistent, sustainable recurring revenue growth. The combination of recurring revenue growth and the operating leverage in our scale business allows us to drive margin expansion and earnings growth while funding growth investments.\nWe've done this across multiple 3-year cycles, and we are on track to do it again. With that, let's take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our Chief Financial Officer, Ashima Ghei. Before I turn the call over to Tim, I do want to make a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K; two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. I'd like to start this morning by congratulating our new Chief Financial Officer. As you know, Ashima was named our permanent CFO last month after serving as our interim CFO since the summer. She's had a very positive impact since joining Broadridge 3 years ago and looking forward to partnering with our even more closely as we continue to grow and transform our company and our industry.\nBefore I go to my review of our results, I want to share some thoughts on the market backdrop. Financial markets remained strong even as we continue to see heightened global uncertainty. Our clients, especially in the United States, are benefiting from a combination of a healthy economy, strong markets, increased trading and growing optimism about a recovery in capital markets activity and M&A. That is driving an uptick in position growth and other activity is positive for Broadridge, keeping us on track to deliver another year of strong top and bottom line growth while funding important investments for the future.\nWith that, let's go to the headlines. First, Broadridge delivered strong second quarter results. Recurring revenues rose 9%, driven by organic growth of 7% and the impact of our SIS acquisition. And we set a new quarterly record for event-driven revenues. Adjusted EPS grew 70% to $1.56. Second, that growth is being driven by long-term trends and by the execution of our strategy as we continue to democratize and digitize investing, simplify and innovate capital markets and modernize wealth management.\nThird, we are now entering the seasonally more significant second half of our fiscal year, well positioned to deliver another strong set of full year results. And finally, our outlook for a strong fiscal '25 keeps us on pace to deliver on the 3-year financial objectives we laid out at our Investor Day in December of '23.\nIt was a strong quarter. So let's move to a review of what drove those results on Slide 4. I'll start with our governance business, where we're driving democratization and digitization by delivering innovation and by helping our clients adapt to change. ICS recurring revenues rose 9% in constant currency, driven by strong revenue from sales and continued growth in investor participation with strong growth across all our 4 product lines. Investor participation continues to be an important growth driver for our governance business. Equity position growth strengthened to 11% in the second quarter, the highest quarterly growth rate since the end of fiscal '22.\nEquity position growth, which had been trending around 7% since the summer, began to pick up in October, and we now expect low double-digit growth in the seasonally more meaningful second half of the year as Ashima will share in a few minutes. Managed accounts continue to be the biggest driver of equity position growth. Notably, physicians in self-directed accounts also grew in mid-single digits and acceleration from fiscal [ '23 ] -- '24, excuse me, when growth was essentially flat. That increased level of engagement from Main Street investors was a key driver of the acceleration in overall equity position growth. Fund position growth remained stable at 5% in the second quarter, driven by balanced growth across both fixed income and equity funds. While fund position growth has picked up from the 3% rate we saw in fiscal '24, it remains at the lower end of its historic mid- to -high single-digit range. Across our governance business, our revenue growth is grounded in our focus on delivering innovative solutions to our clients.\nTwo quarters in, our tailored shareholder reporting solution continues to perform very well. And as we prepare for the upcoming prostate season, more than 400 funds will be using our pass-through voting solutions to give their shareholders a greater voice on governance and other issues, up from 100 funds at the end of fiscal '24. We are adding new governance clients in Europe, and our data and analytics business is benefiting from strong demand for our AI-enabled global demand model. And customer communications, our wealth and focused solution is powering digital growth.\nBeyond our recurring revenues, we saw a new quarterly record for event-driven revenues, driven in significant part by our work facilitating board elections at a leading global mutual fund complex. Working closely with our fund client, we seamlessly process more than 100 million beneficial positions in over 400 funds held up more than 1,000 brokers. Thanks to the investments we have made, 90% of these communications were fully digital, which means that our efforts to enable digital alternatives save that fund complex and its shareholders, tens of millions of dollars in print and mail expenses.\nBoards of Directors elections like these highlight the critical role we play behind the scenes in ensuring that funds can communicate with their investors and get the approvals they need on key governance matters securely and on demand.\nLet's turn to capital markets, which reported 6% recurring revenue growth. In Capital Markets, we're simplifying and innovating trading across the front and back office. In the front office, we continue to roll out new solutions for speed trading and reduce the cost of trade execution with a new AI-enabled trading solution that uses real-time liquidity mapping to help our clients optimize trade execution for algorithmic trading strategies.\nWe also introduced new trading capabilities to simplify and improve trading for structured products. In the back office, our postpaid platforms continue to support strong trading volumes across both equity and fixed income markets. We also introduced new Gen AI enhancements, her operations GPT post-trade platform and with 3 new clients added in Q2. Our cutting-edge distributed ledger repo product is enabling a growing number of institutions to more easily adapt to the new treasury clearing requirements.\nIn Wealth and Investment Management, revenues grew 12%, largely driven by the acquisition of SIS. As we discussed last quarter, the SIS acquisition extends our Canadian wealth business by adding new clients and creating a greater opportunity for us to upsell our broader set of solutions. We saw an early indication of our strategy bearing fruit as a leading Canadian bank and current back-office client selected our adviser marketing solutions to address their goal of making it easier for investors to connect with their advisers. More broadly, our Broadridge wealth management platform continues to be recognized for its leading-edge capabilities, winning awards in the quarter from both Charters and the Everest Group. That recognition is helping to drive a record pipeline for our wealth business.\nSpeaking to pipeline, I'll turn to close sales. We ended December with year-to-date close sales of $103 million, essentially flat with fiscal '24. After a strong start to fiscal '25, our sales were modestly lower in the second quarter with a handful of large deals slipping into the third quarter. Some of those deals have already closed, and we expect to close the remainder over the coming weeks. Our pipeline remains healthy, and we are on track to achieve our outlook for closed sales of $290 million to $330 million for the full year.\nI'll close my remarks with a few summary comments on Slide 5. First, Broadridge delivered strong second quarter results. Second, those strong results are being driven by the execution of our long-term strategy. We're driving the [ mocetization ] of investing by helping tens of millions of mutual fund investors get the information they need to win in governance, while our investments in digitization and helping to drive down the cost of serving those investors. We're delivering innovation to our capital markets clients that will simplify their trading infrastructure and reduce trading costs. And we're extending our wealth business in Canada and the U.S. to bring increased innovation to the wealth market.\nThird, as a result, we are well positioned to achieve another year of strong recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth in fiscal '25. That outlook also keeps us on track to deliver again on our 3-year financial objectives while continuing to invest for the future. Finally, Broadridge is well positioned for long-term growth. in this era of technology transformation, the gap between digital leaders and laggards and financial services is set to grow even wider. Firms who have traded in their fragmented legacy systems in exchange for cohesive platform-based strategies will continue to set themselves apart. Our position at the center of financial services and our investments in our business have positioned Broadridge to be the trusted and transformative partner of choice for our clients as they make that transition. That is driving a strong pipeline that includes a significant number large opportunities across each of our businesses, and that's a great place to be.\nBefore I turn it over to Ashima, I want to thank my 15,000 fellow Broadridge associates around the world. Earlier this week, Broadridge was named as one of the world's most admired companies for the 11th year. It's a tremendous testament to the work and client focus of everyone here at Broadridge.\nAnd now turn it over to Ashima. Ashima?\n\nAshima Ghei\n\nInterim Chief Finance Officer\n\nThanks, Tim. Good morning. It's great to be here with you today. I'll begin my discussion this morning with 5 key callouts. First, Broadridge delivered strong second quarter results, including 9% recurring revenue growth, and 70% adjusted EPS. Second, our key revenue growth drivers remain strong. Revenue from sales continues to be the biggest driver of our growth as we tap into our $450 million year end backlog.\nIn addition, our equity position growth testing is now showing low double-digit growth, which supports our outlook for internal growth. Third, we reported record event-driven revenues modestly ahead of our expectations and surpassing our prior quarterly record from fiscal 2018. Fourth, our strong performance continues to support our ongoing growth investments in product innovation, AI and in our tech capabilities.\n[ Frist ] and last, we are on track to deliver strong fiscal '25 results, and we are reaffirming our guidance on all metrics. We also expect to generate free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105%, giving us ample cash flow to repurchase shares or pursue incremental M&A.\nWith that, let's go to the numbers on Slide 6. Recurring revenues rose 9% on a constant currency basis, driven by 7% organic growth and 2 points from our acquisition of FIS. Adjusted operating income increased 51% driven by strong organic recurring revenue growth and record event-driven revenues. AOI margins rose 420 basis points to 16.6% and adjusted EPS increased 70% to $1.56. As strong recurring revenue growth and higher event-driven revenues more than offset the impact of investments.\nFinally, we delivered close sales of $46 million, year-to-date sales were $103 million compared to $106 million last year. Let's move to Slide 7. Recurring revenue grew 9% to $980 million. Our growth was driven by a strong contribution from new sales, highlighting the importance of innovation. Internal growth from higher positions and increased trading volumes also contributed to recurring revenue growth.\nLet's turn to Slide 8 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. ICS recurring revenues rose 9% to $540 million. Regulatory revenues rose 8%, reflecting low double-digit equity position growth and mid-single-digit fund position growth. Data-driven Fund Solutions revenue increased 8%, driven by growth in our data and analytics products. M&A contributed 0.5 point to Fund Solutions growth. Issuer revenue grew 18%, led by growth in our Disclosure Solutions and a short-term bump in our transfer agency revenues.\nCustomer Communications revenue rose 10%, led by double-digit growth in digital revenues driven by new client onboarding and a higher mix of value-added print jobs. Looking ahead to the second half, we expect total ICS recurring revenue growth to be in line with our 6% to 8% full year recurring revenue growth outlook. By product, we expect high single-digit growth in regulatory revenue driven by equity and fund position growth and mid-single-digit growth across the balance of our ICS businesses, including customer communications.\nTurning to GTO. Revenues rose 8% to $440 million. Capital Markets revenue grew 6%, all organic, driven by the growth of our global post-trade capabilities, which benefited from higher fixed income and equity trading volumes as well as our BTCS front office solutions. Lower license revenues were a 3-point headwind to capital markets growth. Wealth and Investment Management revenues rose 12%, driven by a combination of 2% organic growth and the addition of 2 months of revenues from the SIS acquisition. Excluding the impact of e-trade deconversion, organic growth was 6%. As a reminder, this was the last quarter in which we have any drover impact from Etrade.\nLooking ahead, we expect GTO revenue growth to be in the low double digits for the second half of the year, driven by high teens growth in Wealth Management and mid- to high single-digit growth in capital markets. Now let's move to Slide 9 to review our key volume indicators. Broadridge continues to benefit from the secular growth in investor participation across both equities and funds. Equity position growth was 11%, driven by managed accounts and modestly ahead of our testing at the end of the first quarter.\nRelative to first quarter equity position growth of 3%, we benefited from both an improved mix of companies hosting Annual Meeting and from an overall uptick in position growth. Looking ahead to the more meaningful second half of the year, when we process more than 80% of equity proxy positions, our forward testing is now showing low double-digit growth. The outlook reflects the underlying growth we typically see throughout the year and the additional increase that began in October, as Tim noted. Mutual fund and ETF position growth was more muted at 5%, and our current testing is indicating continued mid-single-digit fund position growth. On the bottom of the slide, trade volumes rose 13% on a blended basis, led by strong growth in both fixed income and equity volume.\nI'll wrap up my discussion of recurring revenue growth on Slide 10. Revenue from closed sales remains the biggest driver of our recurring revenue growth at 7 points as we onboard revenues from our $450 million year-end backlog. That growth was partially offset by 3 points of losses, including the deconversion of ETRADE. Internal growth contributed 3 points, primarily driven by fund and equity position growth and higher trading volumes, which more than offset lower 33 regulatory fee revenue. As a result, organic revenue growth was 7%. Acquisitions contributed 2 points, primarily driven by 2 months of revenue from SIS which closed at the beginning of November.\nFinally, changes in FX had an immaterial impact on our growth in the second quarter. With the recent strengthening of the dollar, we now expect changes in FX to be a 50 basis points headwind to recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth for the balance of the fiscal year.\nLet's close our discussion of revenues on Slide 11. Total revenue increased 13% to $1.6 billion, driven by 6 points of growth from recurring revenue. Event-driven revenues rose $69 million to $125 million and contributed 5 points to total revenue growth. This was a quarterly record for event-driven revenues, surpassing the prior high of $97 million set in fiscal 2018. It's an important reminder that while event-driven revenues tend to be variable on a quarterly or annual basis. their long-term growth is tied to position growth, which has grown to mid- to high single-digit rates over time.\nLooking ahead, we expect event-driven revenues to be more in line with the $55 million to $60 million quarterly average over the balance of the year. I will remind you that last quarter, we benefited from the Disney proxy contest in the third quarter, which presents a headwind to growth in the third quarter this year. Low to no margin distribution revenues grew 7%, contributing 2 points to total revenue growth. Higher postage rates represented approximately 90% of the growth. We now expect distribution revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit range for fiscal '25, driven primarily by higher postage rates.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin was 16.6%, an increase of 420 basis points from Q2 '24 as our operating leverage from higher recurring and event-driven revenues more than offset the impact of ongoing ongoing growth reinvestment and higher distribution revenues. The net impact of changes in float income and distribution revenues had virtually no impact on AOI margins in the quarter. For the year, we remain on track to generate 50 basis points plus of underlying core margin expansion.\nLet's move on to sales. Closed sales were $46 million, $12 million lower than the Q2, '24 sales as higher sales of our GTO products were offset by lower governance sales. Year-to-date, sales are $103 million. Turning to our cash flows. I'll start with a reminder that Broadridge's cash flow generation is typically lower in the first half of the year and strengthens over the second half.\nQ2 '25 free cash flow was $214 million, an increase of $46 million from Q2 '24 driven by higher earnings. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $56 million versus $1 million for the first 6 months of fiscal '24. The first half change was driven by an increase in cash taxes and severance payments in the first quarter as well as changes in working capital, which benefited which offset the benefit of higher income. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 95% to 105% in fiscal '25.\nTurning next to capital allocation on Slide 15. Year-to-date, we have deployed $55 million in capital spending and software and returned just under $200 million to shareholders via our dividend. Platform investments, which in the past have represented a significant source of investment, absorbed only $4 million. In part because of our focus on getting clients to share most of the upfront cost of onboarding. We also invested $193 million in M&A, primarily the acquisition of SIS on November 1, USD 485 million.\nWe remain committed to balanced capital allocation as part of our long-term growth strategy. After taking into account our strong and growing dividend, Broadridge is well positioned to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases or fund additional tuck-in M&A.\nLet's conclude by reviewing our outlook for fiscal '25 on Page 16, followed by closing key messages. We are reaffirming our guidance on all key metrics, including 6% to 8% recurring revenue growth constant currency, 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth, and closed sales of $290 million to $330 million. With respect to the third quarter, a couple of modeling callouts, we expect Q3 EPS growth to be in the mid to high single-digit range. In addition, changes in license revenue will have an impact on the composition of GTO revenues, contributing to low double-digit growth in capital markets and low single-digit organic growth in Wealth Management.\nTurning now to my closing messages. Broadridge delivered strong Q2 financial results, including 9% recurring revenue growth. The demand and secular trends driving our growth remains strong. For the balance of the year, our testing is showing low double-digit equity position growth and mid-single-digit fund position growth. Third, the combination of higher equity position growth and strong second quarter event-driven revenues positions us to deliver on our full year guidance while funding our ongoing investments in new products and technology. Fourth and last, we are on track to deliver strong fiscal year '25 results and are reaffirming our guidance with strong cash flow that has Broadridge well positioned to repurchase shares or fund additional tuck-in M&A.\nWith that, let's take your questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Andrea, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our Interim Chief Financial Officer, Ashima Ghei. Before I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation. Let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. It's great to be here to discuss our strong fiscal '24 financial and operating results. I'm also pleased to be joined by interim CFO, Ashima Ghei. Ashima took over on July 1 from Edmond and we continue to wish good luck in his next endeavor. Importantly, I've had the opportunity to work closely with Ashima over the past 2.5 years as she played a leading goal in driving the strong results of our ICS. Previously, she was in American Express for 18 years, and she has brought a strong combination of deep insight and experience to her role as CFO of ICS here at Broadridge. Ashima, welcome.\n\nAshima Ghei\n\nInterim Chief Finance Officer\n\nThank you, Tim. Great to be here.\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nI'll start my review this morning with a quick comment on what we're seeing in the market. Over the past 6 months, the market has been stable to improving. Our clients have been moving proactively to digitize communications, simplify and modernize their technology infrastructure and enhance investor engagement. These trends play to Broadridge's strengths and they drove record closed sales for the quarter and for the year. This past week has seen much higher volatility with questions about the pace of rate easing and sustainability of growth. It's too early to know if this represents a market turn. But if it does, these kinds of environments are where Broadridge's resilient recurring revenue business model really stands out. I'm confident that Broadridge is going into fiscal '25, poised to deliver another year of sustainable growth, backed by a record backlog of sales already closed, a strong pipeline and resilient volume trends.\nWe're executing on our growth strategy and investing in our products and capabilities. So in any scenario, I feel very good about how we're positioned. With that as context, let's review our strong results and strategic progress. I'm happy to report that Broadridge is executing on our strategy to democratize and digitize governance to simplify and innovate in capital markets and to modernize wealth management. Our clients look to us as trusted and transformative partner to help them adapt to regulatory change, reduce cost and complexity and drive innovation. That trusted and transformative position, along with strong execution, is driving record closed sales. For the year, Broadridge reported 39% growth in closed sales to $342 million. That's both record sales and record sales growth. It's also enabling Broadridge to continue to deliver strong and sustainable growth. For the full year, adjusted EPS rose 10% and on 6% organic growth in recurring revenues.\nAs we've seen all year, that growth was accompanied by strong free cash flow conversion, ending the year at 12%. And Higher cash flow and our strong balance sheet enabled us to fund tuck-in M&A investments and repurchase $450 million in Broadridge shares. I'm also pleased to announce a 10% increase in our annual dividend to 12th double-digit increase in the last 13 years. Finally, the combination of strong execution and sales growth has broadly positioned to deliver another year of strong and sustainable growth in fiscal '25. Our guidance includes 5% to 7% organic recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth, with $290 million to $330 million of closed sales.\nNow let's dive into how we generated these strong results, starting on Slide 4 with our governance business. We continue to make strides in executing our strategy to drive the democratization and digitization of governments. For FY '24, our ICS business reported 5% recurring revenue growth, driven by data-driven Fund Solutions, issuer and digital communications. Part of driving democratization is enabling the continued growth in equity and fund investments by Main Street investors. Full year equity position growth was 6%, including 7% in the fourth quarter. in line with mid- to high single-digit trends for the past decade or more. That growth was driven by managed accounts, which continue to be a key area of focus for wealth advisers or self-directed position growth was flat. Mutual fund and ETF growth was 3% for the full year, driven by demand for passive funds. While growth picked up to 6% in the fourth quarter, Demand trends remain mixed. Money market fund positions, which account for less than 5% of the total, grew by 17% in the quarter, suggesting that many investments remained content to be in cash.\nRecall that investors tend to have only 1 money market fund versus multiple equity or bond funds. So growth in money markets tends to lower overall position growth. Beyond position growth, Broadridge is driving democratization by helping our fund clients implement voting choice to their shareholders. We are now enabling more than 100 separate funds to offer their investors a greater say in governance, up from only 8 a year ago. We're also seeing strong interest in Europe, where funds see voting choice as a competitive differentiator. Our virtual shareholder meeting capabilities are also making shareholder meetings more accessible. We recently hosted more than 6,500 investors and guests on our VSM platform for the meeting of a mega cap, mega tech company. And we're playing a role in enabling investors to weigh in on the governance as some of the largest and most widely held companies in our market, including Disney earlier this year and Tesla in the fourth quarter.\nI'm especially pleased with the success of our tailored shareholder report solution. As most of you know, beginning last month, tailored shareholder reports replaced the 100-plus page annual and semiannual reports that fund shareholders previously received with a condensed and more digestible 2- to 3-page report. While it's a big step forward in enabling funds to communicate more effectively with their shareholders, it doesn't come without added cost or complexity. Funds now need to manage a much greater number of individualized reports that first need to be digitally composed and then distributed to shareholders. To meet that demand, we created solutions to lower the print and distribution costs of these new communications and streamline the higher-value digital composition and digital tagging work. Our ability to deliver compelling solutions in the face of a looming regulatory deadline was critical for our clients. And the sales of our TSR solution contributed strongly to our overall sales growth this past year.\nIt's a great example of how Broadridge is bringing innovation and value-added services to do more for asset management clients. Finally, our print to digital strategy is driving digitization in our customer communications business. After crossing over the $100 million digital revenue threshold in fiscal '23, we delivered another year of double-digit growth in '24 driven by the continued onboarding of new clients to our wealth and focused digital solution. In the fourth quarter, we reached agreement with a major financial services firm to bring its digital communications infrastructure onto our platform. This was an existing Broadridge print client who sees Broadridge's digital capabilities as an opportunity to accelerate client engagement and drive additional savings. New sales like this give our BRCC business a clear runway for growth in '25.\nNow let's move to our capital markets franchise. We continue to make strong progress against our goal of simplifying and innovating across the trade life cycle. Capital Markets revenues crossed the $1 billion revenue milestone, rising 8% for the year, driven by strong growth in BTCS, and by the onboarding of new global post-trade clients. In the front office, our bank clients face the pressure to drive ever-increasing trade volumes at lower spreads from faster settlement across multiple asset classes and geography. We're meeting that need by delivering a state-of-the-art global SaaS platform that gives trading firms best-in-class order management, execution, scale and reliability. Now extending those capabilities to the derivatives market by developing new futures and options solutions. We also continue to help our clients reduce the cost and complexity of their back-office operations with our global post-trade capabilities. In fiscal '24, we brought a leading global bank, the international operations of a major European bank and the leading Nordic bank onto our global post-trade platform.\nBy combining multiple existing platforms and dozens of markets, Broadridge is enabling these clients to simplify their operations, reduce complexity and optimize capital. Only Broadridge can deliver that kind of global simplification at scale, and our success is driving a strong pipeline of additional post-rate engagements. Driving simplification also means helping our clients adapt to regulatory change and the transition to T+1 at the end of May was a notable example. The move to a shortened settlement cycle across North American equities and corporate and municipal bonds with the combination of initiative that began in 2020. The goal was to reduce systemic risk or lowering clearinghouse collateral requirements and enhancing operational efficiency. For Broadridge, it was another opportunity to showcase the benefits of neutralization. For more than a year, leading after the change, our team is focused on delivering rigorous testing, meticulous planning and robust client communication. A year ago, we set up a T+1 test environment that enabled clients to thoroughly test their own preparedness, and we led and participate in industry-wide initiatives along with the DTCC and CDS. The result has been a seamless transition for our clients, marked by significant improvement in industry trade date affirmation rates, a 30% reduction in certain collateral requirements and increased liquidity.\nFinally, we're driving innovation across trading through the adoption of AI and distributed ledger technology. We're seeing growing interest in our AI solutions, including our now patented BondGPT capability and our OpsGPT. Our distributed ledger repo platform is delivering reduced external transaction fees, lower sales and increased liquidity. We added 2 new clients onto our DLR platform in fiscal '24 increasing our monthly average trading volume to $1.5 trillion. Now let's turn to Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 6. In wealth, we are helping our clients modernize and transform on their own terms with our modular suite of capabilities. Wealth and Investment Management revenues rose 7% fiscal '24 driven in part by the go-live of our UBS contract at the beginning of the year. Partially offsetting this growth was the deconversion of Morgan Stanley E-Trade. After a 3-year journey, we helped Morgan Stanley complete the transition of the E-Trade platform last fall.\nMore broadly, the sales of our Wealth and Investment Management solutions rose more than 40% in fiscal '24 including a strong contribution from our wealth platform solutions. Our pipeline continues to grow, and we're seeing continuing demand for tools that help increase adviser effectiveness, enhance client engagement and drive operational efficiency. Last quarter, we announced the acquisition of Kyndryl's SIS business in Canada. The SIS platform provides front, middle and back-office technology for Canadian financial services firms. The addition of the SIS clients to our existing business in Canada will accelerate our ability to bring new capabilities, including our wealth solutions to the Canadian market. That deal is now moving through the Canadian regulatory review process, and we expect it to close in the first half of fiscal '25. I'll close my review of our fiscal '24 execution with close sales.\nBroadridge reported record closed sales of $342 million, including fourth quarter sales up more than 70% to $157 million. We benefited from strong demand for our tailored shareholder reports and digital capabilities in ICS and from strong growth in both capital markets and wealth in GTO. It's a direct reflection of the steps we've taken to help our clients adapt to change and grow their business. It's gratifying to see our investments translate into growth. Our strong sales performance is a clear sign that as clients begin to reinvest themselves. They see Broadridge as a trusted transformative partner to help them operate, innovate and grow. And with a strong pipeline going into next year, we expect another year of strong sales in fiscal '25.\nI'll wrap up my review with some closing callouts on Slide 7. First, Broadridge is executing on our growth strategy. We're driving democratization of investing by ensuring that a growing number of main suite investors get to critical information they need to understand their investments and make their voice heard. We're powering important appropriate elections and extending voting choice. As an upcoming change in regulatory fund reporting, we stepped up to develop innovative tailings shareholder report solutions. In digital, we started the journey years ago to combine world-class digital solutions with our low-cost print network. And in GTO, we have acquired, built and invested in our front and back-office solutions to help our clients trade faster, engage with their clients enhance adviser productivity and reduce operational complexity. We're delivering new capital markets capabilities and derivatives and extending our global reach. We enabled faster settlement times for dozens of clients and trillions of dollars of assets and are driving innovation with AI-enabled solutions and distributed ledger technology.\nWe're live with our wealth platform. We're driving the sales of our modular solutions, and we're leveraging the technology more broadly, including as the extend and grow business in Canada. Our execution on these strategies drove record closed sales, 6% recurring revenue growth and double-digit adjusted EPS growth in fiscal '24. Looking ahead, we expect another year of strong and sustainable growth in fiscal '25, and we're on track to deliver on our 3-year financial objectives. Most importantly, we continue to see a long runway for future growth. Technology trends are enabling more investors to participate in the market and giving them access to increasingly sophisticated investments. Digitalization is transforming the way businesses engage with their clients. Trading continues to accelerate, and banks look to reduce the cost complexity of their operations. Regulators around the world are constantly updating rules to modulate behavior and improve disclosure for all investors. And every one of those trends is shaped by the power of data and AI.\nWe've positioned Broadridge to help our clients meet the opportunities and challenges these trends create. We're executing on our growth strategy to do even more as we attack our $60 billion and growing vended market opportunity. The power of mutualizing change to increase speed and reduce cost is true in almost all economic environments, and our resilient business model is particularly strong in periods of higher volatility. We I've never been more optimistic about Broadridge's future. Before I hand over to Ashima, I want to thank our associates. As I've talked about today, Broadridge is executing on multiple fronts and none of that would be possible with the -- without the hard work and client focus of everyone at our company. So thank you for your work in serving our clients today and for helping to transform our industry for tomorrow. Ashima?\n\nAshima Ghei\n\nInterim Chief Finance Officer\n\nThank you, Tim. It's great to join all of you to discuss the strong results and to review our guidance for fiscal '25. Broadridge has a long track record of delivering strong and sustainable top and bottom line growth with strong shareholder returns, and this year was no different. Fiscal '21 recurring revenue grew 6% constant currency and adjusted EPS grew 10%. Before I go through the results, I want to call out the key items that gives me confidence that we are on track to deliver on our fiscal '25 guidance and our 3-year growth objectives. First, sales and backlog. Record closed sales of $342 million drove a 13% increase in revenue backlog, giving us strong visibility into our revenue growth in fiscal '25 and '26.\nSecond, position growth. Equity position growth was 6% in '24, and fund position growth was 3%. Our current testing shows a modest improvement in those trends with continued mid- to high single-digit growth in equities and mid-single-digit growth in funds. Third, expenses, investments and margins. We have a long history of driving operating leverage. This quarter, we completed a restructuring initiative that will position us to continue to fund long-term growth investments, grow core margin and deliver earnings growth. Fourth and last, capital allocation. In fiscal '24, we repurchased 2.3 million shares for $450 million and have recently announced 3 tuck-in M&A investments. That capital will contribute directly to our top and bottom line growth. These 4 areas position us well to deliver our 3-year financial objectives and our fiscal '25 guidance. which calls for 5% to 7% recurring revenue, constant currency growth, almost all organic and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth.\nWith that, let's go through the numbers on Slide 8. Fiscal '24 recurring revenues grew to $4.2 billion, up 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Adjusted operating income grew 9%. Adjusted EPS grew 10% to $7.73 and we reported record closed sales of $342 million, which drove our recurring revenue backlog to $450 million. Turning now to the fourth quarter headline numbers. Recurring revenue grew 5% and on a constant currency basis to $1.3 billion. Adjusted operating income grew 5% and AOI margin was 28.8%. Adjusted EPS rose 9% to $3.50, and closed sales rose 74% to a fourth quarter record $157 million.\nMoving to Slide 9. Fourth quarter recurring revenue rose 5% to $1.3 billion, driven by a combination of converting revenue from sales and mid-single-digit position growth. For the full year, recurring revenue growth was 6%, essentially all organic and in line with our 3-year organic growth objective of 5% to 8%. Let's turn to the next slides to review the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. In Q4, ICS recurring revenue grew 6% and powered by growth across all 4 product lines. We also saw the benefit of the timing delays we've called out in our Q3 results, which added 1 point to fourth quarter growth. For the full year, ICS recurring revenues were up 5% to $2.6 billion. Regulatory revenue grew 7% in Q4 and 5% for the full year, in line with position growth. Looking ahead, we expect continued mid-single-digit revenue growth in fiscal '25, in line with our position testing.\nData-driven Fund Solutions revenue increased by 7% in the fourth quarter and for the full year, driven by growth in retirement and workplace solutions and our data and analytics products. The acquisition of Advisor Target which closed on June 1, made a very modest contribution to growth. Issuer revenue grew 5% in Q4 and 7% for the full year. led by growth in our registered shareholder solutions and disclosure products. Customer Communications recurring revenue rose 3% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. as we continue to execute our print to digital strategy. Digital revenues grew double digits for both the quarter and the year. We expect customer communications growth to accelerate in fiscal '25 driven by a combination of digital growth and new client wins. Looking ahead to fiscal '25, we expect stronger ICS recurring revenue growth, driven by revenue from strong fiscal '24 sales, continued mid-single-digit position growth and strong growth in digital which will more than offset the loss of 33 revenues and lower float income.\nTurning to GTO on Slide 11. Q4 recurring revenue growth was 4%. For the full year, GTO revenues grew 8% to $1.6 billion, at the high end of our 3-year 5% to 8% organic growth objective driven by strong growth across both our capital markets and wealth businesses. Capital Markets revenue grew 6% in the fourth quarter, strong growth in revenue from sales and higher trading volumes more than offset lower license revenue. Full year revenues increased 8%, powered by strong growth in BTCS, and revenue from sales from new global post-trade clients. Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 7% for the full year. Fourth quarter growth was flat as revenue from new sales was offset by the E-Trade deconversion and lower license revenue. We expect the impact of E-TRADE will continue to weigh on the wealth and investment management growth through the first half of fiscal '25, especially in the first quarter.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '25, we expect GTO revenue growth to be at the low end of our 5% to 7% recurring revenue guidance range, with stronger growth in capital markets and lower growth in Wealth and Investment Management. Excluding the impact of E-Trade, wealth and investment management growth would be at the higher end of the 5% to 7% recurring revenue guidance. Now let's turn to Slide 12 to review volume trends. Position growth returned to mid- to high single digits for both equities and funds in the fourth quarter. Equity position growth rose to 7% in the fourth quarter, in line with our testing. Full year growth was 6%, driven almost entirely by double-digit growth in managed accounts. Our fiscal '25 first half testing continues to show healthy mid- to high single-digit growth. Fund position growth metric rebounded to 6% in the quarter. Full year fund position growth was 3%, driven by growth in passive funds and double-digit growth in money market funds. Fund flows have strengthened in recent months. and our current testing of underlying fund positions is indicating a modest pickup to between 4% to 5%.\nTurning to trade volumes. Trade volumes grew 15% on a blended basis in Q4, driven by both higher fixed income and equity volumes. For the full year, trading volumes were up 13%. Let's now move to Slide 13 for the drivers of recurring revenue growth. For the quarter, recurring revenue growth was 5%, virtually all organic and balanced between net new business and internal growth. Revenue from closed sales provided 5 points of growth. Our recurring revenue retention rate was 97% for the quarter and for the full year. Adjusting for the E-Trade deconversion, retention rates remained at 98%. And internal growth, primarily positions and trading volumes contributed 3 points. Lastly, we closed 2 small acquisitions in our ICS segment. Adviser target contributed less than 5 basis points to fourth quarter revenue growth and Comsat closed at the beginning of July. We expect these 2 acquisitions will contribute approximately 20 basis points to fiscal '25 recurring revenue growth.\nI'll finish the guidance on revenue on Slide 14. Total revenue grew 6% in Q4 to $1.9 billion, and recurring revenue was the largest contributor with 4 points of growth. Event-driven revenue was $76 million and contributed 1 point to Q4 growth. Event-driven revenue benefited from higher levels of mutual fund proxy and equity contest activity versus the fourth quarter of last year. Low to no margin distribution revenue increased 4% and contributed 1 point to total revenue growth. driven by higher postal rates. Remember, these have a dilutive impact on our adjusted operating income margin. So let's turn to margins on Slide 15. Adjusted operating income margin for Q4 was 28.8%, and the positive impact from operating leverage was offset by the timing of annual expenses. On a full year basis, adjusted operating income margin was 20%, up 20 basis points from fiscal '23. The combination of operating leverage and the benefits from our fiscal '23 restructuring enabled us to absorb the deconversion of E-Trade and higher amortization from our wealth platform while increasing our investments in long-term growth and meeting our earnings objectives.\nThe net impact of higher float revenue and distribution, which have little impact on earnings increased margins by 30 basis points. During the fourth quarter, we completed the restructuring program we began last year to realign some of our businesses and streamline our management structure. We incurred $56 million in fourth quarter charges, which were not included in our calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS. We estimate that these actions will generate over $100 million in annualized cost savings, which will position us to fund investments, further scale our business and deliver earnings growth. Rounding out the fourth quarter non-GAAP items. I would also note that we incurred $10 million in charges to settle various legal matters.\nLet's move ahead to close sales on Slide 16. Broadridge had a very strong sales year. Fiscal '24 sales rose 39% to a record $342 million. driven by a very strong fourth quarter where closed sales grew 74% to $157 million. As you heard from Tim, we benefited from strong sales of our tailored shareholder report solutions and digital as well as strong growth across both our capital markets and wealth and investment management solutions. These strong sales lifted our revenue backlog to $450 million, equal to 11% of our fiscal '24 recurring revenue. I'll now turn to cash flow on Slide 17. Broadridge generated free cash flow of $943 million in fiscal '24, up 26% from fiscal '23. Free cash flow conversion increased to 102% from 90% in fiscal '23 and 42% in '22. Returning to a more historic levels after a period of higher investment. We expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 95% to 105% in fiscal '25.\nLet's move next to capital allocation on Slide 18. We continue to take a balanced approach to capital allocation. In fiscal '24, we made platform investments of $41 million and deployed $113 million on capital expenditures and software spend. Fiscal '24 also marked a return to tuck-in M&A. In total, we enhanced our data and analytics solutions with the $35 million acquisition of Advisor Target and closed the smaller acquisition of CompSci on July 1. And to augment our issuer capabilities. In May, we announced the proposed acquisition of SIS from Kyndryl for approximately USD 200 million. SIS is a leading Canadian wealth and capital markets technology platform with annual revenues of USD 80 million to USD 85 million. The acquisition is expected to close during the first half of our fiscal year and will not have a significant impact on our margins or adjusted EPS during the first year of operation. Given the inherent timing uncertainty of regulatory review, we have not included it in our guidance.\nWe will add SIS to our fiscal '25 guidance after it closes. After internal and external investments, we return excess capital to shareholders. We returned $781 million to shareholders in fiscal '24 and through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 300 million of shares, bringing our total gross repurchases in fiscal '24 to 450 million. Finally, we repaid $60 million of debt, ending the year with a 2.2x leverage ratio below our long-term target of 2.5 million. Last night, our Board approved a 10% dividend increase to $3.52 per share. As Tim noted, this is our 12th double-digit increase in the last 13 years. which emphasizes both our sustained earnings growth and our long-term commitment to balance capital allocation. I'll close my prepared remarks this morning with some detail on our guidance on Slide 19. We expect another year of sustainable recurring revenue growth, core margin expansion, strong adjusted EPS growth and very healthy close sales in fiscal '25.\nLet me walk through each of those points, starting first with revenue. We expect recurring revenue growth constant currency of 5% to 7%, almost all organic, driven by new sales as we onboard our $450 million revenue backlog. We expect ICS recurring revenues to be at the higher end of that range with GTO lower. We expect event-driven revenues to be at the high end of our historic range. driven by a proxy campaign at a major mutual fund complex in our second quarter. Distribution revenues are forecast to grow at low double-digit rate powered by higher postage rates and stronger BRCC print volumes. We expect these low to no-margin revenues to have a dilutive impact on our reported margins. Second, let's move to margin. We expect adjusted operating income margin will be approximately 20%. We anticipate the combination of higher operating leverage and disciplined expense management. will enable us to deliver over 50 basis points of underlying core margin expansion, in line with our 3-year financial objectives. We expect this to be partially offset by the impact of higher distribution revenues and lower float income.\nThird, EPS. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12%. Embedded in this outlook is an expected tax rate of 21%. Fourth, we expect another year of strong closed sales, our guidance range of $290 million to $330 million reflects continued growth from our fiscal '24 results, excluding sales of tailored shareholder report solutions. And lastly, I will remind you that our guidance does not include the impact of SIS. Taken together, our fiscal '25 guidance highlights the strength of the Broadridge business model. Now before I conclude, let me offer some insight on our first quarter. We expect our first quarter earnings will account for 10% to 11% of our full year adjusted EPS at the low end of our historical range, driven in part by lower event-driven revenue versus Q1 of '24 and the E-Trade impact.\nSo let's wrap up with a quick summary of the key takeaways from our strong fiscal '24 results. First, Broadridge delivered another year of strong and sustainable recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth. Second, our record closed sales highlight the strong demand for our solutions and give us increased visibility into future growth. Third, we are putting our strong free cash flow to work for shareholders with another double-digit dividend increase, strategic and value-accretive acquisitions and share repurchases. Finally, Broadridge is poised to deliver another strong year in fiscal '25, keeping us well on track to achieve our 3-year growth objectives for the fourth consecutive cycle. With that, let's move to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the call over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Andrea. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our Chief Executive Officer; and our Chief Financial Officer, Edmund Reese.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard callouts. One, we'll be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K.\nTwo, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. It's great to be here to review our third quarter results and update you on our full year outlook.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the performance of our business in a complex environment. We see a market in which the underlying fundamentals are solid, where capital markets and retail investor activity are beginning to strengthen, and where our clients are highlighting the need for continued technology investment. While all that is going on, those same clients are being careful with their spending as they weigh the new higher-for-longer scenario as well as other tail risks.\nThese trends play to Broadridge's strength. Our testing is indicating that healthy markets are driving a pickup in investor participation and position growth, and we're delivering innovative solutions across governance, capital markets and wealth. Sales continue to be strong, highlighting our clients' willingness to move ahead with solutions that address revenue, cost or regulatory needs.\nMy conversations with clients make it clear that they see Broadridge as a partner in helping them grow their business and adapt to change. It's a strong position, and it will be further enhanced as we put our cash flow to work with a balance of capital returns and targeted M&A.\nSo let's dig into the quarter. First, Broadridge reported 4% recurring revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. Those results were modestly impacted by the timing of annual meetings, which pushed some governance revenues into the fourth quarter.\nSecond, we continue to execute against our strategy to drive the democratization and digitization of investing, simplify and innovate trading, and modernize wealth management. Our strategy is supported by long-term trends, including position growth, which we continue to see in the mid- to high single-digit range.\nThird, that execution is coming through in our closed sales, which rose 29% in the quarter and are now up 19% year-to-date. We expect that positive momentum to continue in the fourth quarter.\nFourth, we remain on track to achieve our objective for 100% free cash flow conversion for the full year. That positions us to use our capital to increase share repurchases and to fund strategic tuck-in M&A.\nFinally, as we move through our seasonally large fourth quarter, Broadridge is on track to deliver another year of steady and consistent growth, in line with our long-term financial objectives. We are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal '24, adjusted EPS at the middle of our 8% to 12% range, with recurring revenue growth at constant currency at the low end of our 6% to 9% range. With strong year-to-date sales, we also expect record closed sales of $280 million to $320 million.\nNow let's turn from the headlines to Slide 4 to review highlights of our execution, starting with our governance franchise. ICS recurring revenue rose 1% in the third quarter as the timing of regulatory communications impacted our quarterly growth. In regulatory communications, revenues were flat despite 5% equity position growth.\nAs many of you know, the peak period for proxy communications falls right at the end of March, so any shift in the annual meeting schedule can have an impact on quarterly revenues. This year, with Easter in the last week of March instead of April last year, we saw a substantial number of companies push back to date for their annual meeting. That change led to a shift of regulatory revenue from March to April, or from the third to fourth quarter. This timing shift will have no impact on our full year results. Outside of timing, position growth trends are mixed.\nAs I noted, equity position growth was 5%, in line with our testing, driven by double-digit growth in managed accounts. Fund and ETF record growth declined to negative 1% for the quarter. Quarterly fund position growth can vary more widely than the full year number because it is impacted by the timing and types of communications that are distributed during any particular quarter.\nMore broadly, the cumulative impact of lower fund flows and the shift to money market funds that began over a year ago has weighed on growth, especially for active funds. Year-to-date fund record growth was 2%. Looking ahead, fund flows are improving, and our testing indicates a modest pickup in the fourth quarter. As Edmund will outline, for the year, we expect stock record growth of 6% and fund record growth of 3%.\nDriving and enabling the democratization of investing is a key part of our long-term growth strategy. There's no better opportunity to demonstrate that -- what that means than in a large and very visible proxy fight. As part of the Disney contest, Broadridge processed and distributed multiple rounds of communications to millions of registered and beneficial shareholders holding almost 2 billion shares on behalf of hundreds of our broker-dealer clients.\nEach vote was subject to multiple reviews and a process verified by an independent accounting firm so that all sides could be highly confident in the accuracy of the Broadridge votes. Vote tallies were available daily to all participants. The process culminated with an annual meeting posted on Broadridge's Virtual Shareholder Meeting platform and the outcome was known immediately when the meeting closed.\nContests like Disney are a great showcase for issuers, investors, our broker-dealer clients and regulators of how Broadridge's significant investments in technology and digital communications, combined with our commitment to accuracy, enhance investor confidence in our markets.\nOutside of highly visible contests, we continue to enhance investor engagement by supporting the growth and voting choice across funds. In recent months, we've gone live with 5 of the largest asset managers across a mix of both retail and institutional focused funds and ETFs. This, in turn, is leading to strong interest to extend this service from more asset managers and for a wider set of fund categories.\nWe're also continuing the rollout of our tailored shareholder report solution as we help the funds industry navigate regulatory change. We're in production testing now, and we go fully live beginning in July.\nTurning to Capital Markets. Revenues rose 8% to $266 million, driven by strong growth in BTCS, which continues to deliver on the pillars of our original acquisition case. During the quarter, we signed a leading U.S. and global bank as the first client for Global Futures and Options SaaS platform. This new capability will build on our existing products and significantly expand our derivatives trading solutions. It also represents another step forward in our goal of expanding BTCS's capabilities across asset classes and to our U.S. client base, which was a key part of our long-term growth plan at the time of the acquisition.\nOn the post-trade side, we completed the implementation of our global post-trade platform for a leading Nordic bank. Our platform consolidates the bank's legacy in-house systems, streamlining its operations across 25 European markets and 10 custodians across both equities and fixed income. This particular bank was a long-term BTCS client. So it's also another example of leveraging our front-office relationship to extend our solutions across the trade life cycle. We also continue to see nice traction with our digital ledger repo and in AI with our BondGPT and OpsGPT solutions.\nTurning now to Wealth and Investment Management. Revenues rose 11% to $159 million as strong growth from UBS and the license revenue was partially offset by the E*TRADE transition. In the first full year since the rollout of our wealth platform, we are seeing significant interest in our broad suite of wealth capabilities, and that's driving strong sales momentum with year-to-date Wealth and Investment Management sales up 75%.\nI'm especially pleased to see strong interest in Canada for wealth component capabilities. Canada accounts for approximately 1/3 of our Wealth and Investment Management revenues, and we see a long-term opportunity to adapt our wealth tools for Canadian firms.\nMoving to sales. Closed sales rose 29% in the third quarter and are up 19% year-to-date. We benefited from strong sales of our digital and print solutions for the new tailored shareholder reports, and we continue to see significant print and digital opportunities in customer communications. Our pipeline remains at record levels as clients focus on solutions that drive revenue growth, like our front office trading tools, and meet their regulatory requirements like tailored shareholder reports. That combination of strong sales and a record pipeline is giving us increased confidence in our ability to achieve record closed sales in line of $280 million to $320 million full year guidance.\nLet's move to Slide 5 for some additional thoughts on our quarter and outlook. First, we are poised to deliver another year of mid-single-digit organic recurring revenue growth and double-digit earnings growth, right in line with the long-term growth goals we laid out at our Investor Day in December.\nIn a quarter impacted by the timing of annual meetings, we reported 9% adjusted EPS growth. Now 1 month into the fourth quarter, we have high visibility into our remaining volumes. For the full year, we're tracking to recurring revenue growth of 6%, adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10% and record closed sales.\nSecond, our growth continues to be driven by long-term trends, increasing investor engagement, the demand for digitization, accelerating trading, regulatory change, leveraging data and AI, and the need to modernize wealth management have all combined to drive strong sales over the first 3 quarters.\nAs a result, we're going into our largest sales quarter with a strong pipeline and increasing visibility. Position growth has moved from pandemic highs and overall trends remain in line with the mid- to high single-digit growth rate of the past decade.\nLooking beyond the fourth quarter, the outlook for financial services firms appears to be improving. Capital Markets activity is picking up and innovation is driving sales growth as our clients increase their level of investment. At the same time, strong equity markets are driving investor engagement and fund investors are beginning to rotate out of money market funds, both of which bode well for future position growth.\nThird, we're executing on our growth strategy. We are driving shareholder engagement and governance, enhancing our digital capabilities and customer communications, delivering innovative new capabilities in capital markets, and are expanding our ability to drive growth and wealth across North America. We're also investing to strengthen our product teams, sales capabilities and technology capabilities including of course AI.\nFourth, we're on track to achieve our 100% free cash flow conversion objective, and the combination of strong free cash flow and our investment-grade balance sheet positions us to return additional capital to shareholders. We're also seeing a growing number of attractive M&A opportunities to further complement our organic growth.\nFinally, Broadridge remains well-positioned to drive long-term growth. We remain on track to deliver on our 3-year growth objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth constant currency, 5% to 8% organic, and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth, with fiscal '24 right in line with those goals. And with continued execution supported by long-term demand trends, we are well-positioned to continue to grow beyond FY '26 as we attack our $60 billion and growing market opportunity.\nI want to close by thanking our associates around the world. The market for what we do continues to evolve and Broadridge will be evolving as well. We're seizing the opportunities in front of us, and your focus on serving our clients, as shown by our strong accomplishments this quarter and over a long period, continues to set us apart. Thank you.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Edmund.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that I'm pleased with the third quarter results relative to our full year guidance. While third quarter recurring revenue growth was impacted by the timing of annual meetings, we are entering the seasonally larger fourth quarter in a strong position.\nThrough 3 quarters, we reported 6% recurring revenue growth, 11% adjusted EPS growth, and have received 98% of proxy records through April. That gives us a high confidence interval in our ability to deliver 6% recurring revenue growth, approximately 20% adjusted operating income margin, and adjusted EPS growth of approximately 10%.\nOf equal importance is our cash flow performance for the year. We are on track for 100% free cash flow conversion, which will allow us to return a total of $700 to $800 million to shareholders through the dividend and with share repurchases of $350 million to $450 million. So with clarity on fiscal 2024, in my view, what matters most to achieving our 3-year financial objectives are the wins that we have at our back, which are driving positive momentum in the business.\nFirst, closed sales through the first 3 quarters are up 19% over last year. And our healthy pipeline reinforces our conviction that we will achieve 15% to 30% sales growth in our full year '24 guidance. Second, while our testing shows 6% equity and 3% fund and ETF position growth for full year '24, the early testing for Q1 '25 is consistent with more recent increased retail market activity and our long-term outlook of mid- to high single-digit growth.\nThird, we continue to focus on actively managing our expenses and finalizing our restructuring effort in the fourth quarter to create investment capacity for organic growth in fiscal '25 and '26, while delivering continued earnings growth. Finally, our free cash flow conversion is definitively back at historical levels, positioning us to supplement our organic growth with accretive tuck-in M&A or return capital to shareholders.\nAs a result, when I look ahead, I see strong momentum in the Broadridge business. Strong closed sales, driving 5 to 8 points of growth from new sales, position growth supporting 2 to 3 points from internal growth, M&A investment contributing additional growth, and active expense discipline that will enable Broadridge to continue to invest in organic growth and deliver continued earnings growth.\nWe continue to execute the Broadridge financial model, and that gives me confidence that we remain on track to deliver again on our 3-year financial objectives and on mid- to high teens ROIC.\nSo now turning to the financial summary on Slide 6. You see the performance for the third quarter. Recurring revenue rose to $1.1 billion, up 4% on a constant currency basis, all organic. Adjusted operating income increased 7%. And AOI margins of 21.4% expanded 40 basis points. And adjusted EPS rose 9% to $2.23. Finally, and as Tim noted, we delivered third quarter closed sales of $80 million, up 29% over Q3 '23.\nOn Slide 7, you see that recurring revenue grew 4% to $1.1 billion in Q3 '24. Recurring revenue growth driven by converting our backlog to revenue and growth in GTO was impacted by proxy communications that were delayed into our fiscal Q4.\nSo for more context on this point, March is typically a heavy month for proxy communications, accounting for almost 1/4 of our full year positions. As Tim mentioned, in 2024, we saw a modest delay in the timing of annual meetings, which pushed volumes from March into April. While that lowered our Q3 revenue, we have since processed virtually all of those delayed positions, and that will benefit regulatory revenue in the fourth quarter.\nOn Slide 8, we can see recurring revenue growth across our ICS and GTO segments. In Q3, ICS recurring revenue grew 1%, largely impacted by the quarterly noise that I just mentioned. Regulatory revenue was flat as mid-single-digit equity position growth in revenue from sales were partially offset by the timing of the annual meetings. As I explained earlier, while these timing variances have no real impact on full year revenues, they can result in quarters that vary from our reported position growth. We continue to expect full year regulatory revenues to be in line with mid-single-digit position growth.\nData-driven Fund Solutions revenue increased by 4% due to higher float revenue in our retirement and workplace products, as well as growth in our data and analytics products. Issuer revenue was up 3%, driven by strong sales of our disclosure solutions and higher float income in our registered shareholder solutions.\nOur Q3 registered shareholder solutions were also impacted by the timing of the annual meeting cycle. So I will note that the issuer business has grown 10% year-to-date and we still expect high single-digit full year revenue growth.\nCustomer communications revenue rose 1% as growth in higher-margin digital revenue was offset by the lower growth of lower margin print. We expect volumes to increase in the fourth quarter as we onboard new clients. For the full year, we expect low single-digit top line growth driven by double-digit growth of higher-margin digital revenue and low single-digit print growth. This is in line with our print-to-digital strategy, which should yield expanding margins and continued low double-digit earnings growth.\nLooking ahead to Q4, we expect ICS at the high end of our organic growth objectives, with recurring revenue growth of 7% to 9%, driven in part by the benefit of timing differences.\nTurning to GTO. Recurring revenue grew 9% to $425 million. Capital Markets revenue increased 8%, led by new sales and higher equity and fixed income trading volumes. I will also note that we continue to see strong performance in our front office BTCS solutions, which again had double-digit recurring revenue growth in the third quarter.\nWealth and Investment Management revenue grew 11%, powered by the UBS contract and higher license revenue, partially offset by the E*TRADE transition, which began late in the fiscal first quarter.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect Capital Markets growth in the fourth quarter to be impacted by growing over high Q4 '23 license revenue. And we will also have another full quarter impact from the E*TRADE transition in our wealth business. That said, GTO recurring revenue growth is 9% year-to-date, giving us high confidence that full year growth will be well within our 5% to 8% organic growth objectives for both businesses.\nTurning to Slide 9 for a discussion of volume trends. Equity position growth was 5% in the quarter, in line with our testing. Growth was driven by continued double-digit growth in managed accounts. We are now in the peak period for annual meetings and proxies. And through the end of April, we've received record data for 98% of proxies that are expected for the year. This data gives us high confidence in our outlook for position growth. For the full year, we expect equity position growth of approximately 6%.\nAnd while still early, our testing data is extending in the Q1 '25 and showing mid-single-digit growth, continuing to support our outlook for mid- to high single-digit equity position growth. We continue to be encouraged by expanding investor participation in financial markets serving as a long-term tailwind that drives growth in our business.\nFund and ETF positions declined by 1%. For the full year, we expect position growth of 3% with slower growth in passive funds and declines in active funds.\nTurning now to trade volumes on the bottom of the slide. Trade volumes grew 11% on a blended basis in Q3. Once again, we saw a difference in asset classes with increased volatility driving double-digit fixed income volume growth, now 11 consecutive quarters, and more modest equity volume growth.\nLet's now move to Slide 10 for the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenue grew 4% constant currency. Revenue from net new business contributed 3 points of growth. Internal growth, primarily trading volumes, expanding client relationships and float income, offset by the timing of proxy communications, contributed 1 point. Foreign exchange had a nonmaterial 20 basis point positive impact on recurring revenue growth. And based on current rates, we expect a similar benefit in full year recurring revenue growth relative to fiscal year '23.\nI'll wrap up the revenue discussion with a view of total revenue on Slide 11. Total revenue grew 5% in Q3 to $1.7 billion, with recurring revenue being the largest contributor, delivering 3 points of growth. Low to no margin distribution revenues contributed 1 point to total revenue growth.\nDistribution revenue grew 4% due to postal rate increases, which are a headwind to our adjusted operating income margin. We continue to expect distribution revenue to grow in the high single-digit range, driven by the continued impact of postal rate increases. Event-driven revenue was $67 million, up 29% over last year and adding 1 point to revenue growth. As anticipated, we saw more normalized levels of mutual fund proxy activity and elevated contest activity, including our work with Disney in Q3. With the combination of increased mutual fund proxy activity and higher contest activity, we now expect $260 million to $280 million in full year event-driven revenue.\nIn our Q2 call, we mentioned that we expected event-driven revenue to trend above our historical levels for the full year. We modestly increased growth investments in Q2 based on the above-trend event-driven revenue. We continue to make investments in Q3 as we are committed to investing in long-term growth while still delivering on our short-term fiscal '24 adjusted EPS guidance.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin was up 40 basis points from prior year to 21.4%. The net impact of higher distribution revenue and higher float income, which have an immaterial impact on earnings growth as I detailed at Investor Day, increased margins by 20 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted operating income margin continued to benefit from the operating leverage on our higher recurring and event revenue and the benefit from our restructuring initiative that we began in Q4 '23 to realign some of our businesses and streamline our management structure.\nAs part of the initiative, we exited a small noncore GTO business in Q3 '24. And we remain on track to complete the restructuring initiative and have the remaining restructuring charge by the end of the fiscal year. The restructuring charges are excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS.\nWe have a long track record of disciplined expense management. This discipline, along with the operating leverage inherent in our business model, allows us to invest in long-term growth investments and meet our earnings growth objectives. Looking ahead, we continue to expect adjusted operating income margin to increase year-over-year to approximately 20%.\nLet's move ahead to closed sales on Slide 13. Third quarter closed sales were $80 million, up 29% from $62 million in Q3 2023, and bringing our year-to-date total to $185 million, 19% above Q3 year-to-date '23. Our strong performance on closed sales has been in product areas where we've been investing and innovating, such as tailored shareholder reports, BTCS, and wealth. We continue to see clients willing to invest in areas that either drive revenue, lower cost or address regulatory requirements.\nWith the performance through 3 quarters and our 5-year history of closing on average 40% of full year sales in the fourth quarter, we continue to have high confidence in meeting our full year guidance of $280 million to $320 million, again, strengthening our revenue backlog and providing strong momentum entering fiscal year '25.\nI'll turn now to free cash flow on Slide 14. Q3 free cash flow was $167 million, $5 million better than last year. Q3 quarters free cash flow is a positive $259 million, relative to $47 million in the first 9 months of 2023. These results are being driven by our continued strong earnings growth and lower client platform spend.\nFree cash flow conversion was 108% in Q3 '24, up from 63% last year. This is consistent with our expectations and has us on track for free cash flow conversion of 100% for fiscal year '24.\nOn Slide 15, you can see that over the first 9 months of the year we invested $109 million on our technology platforms and converting clients to our platforms. Additionally, before option proceeds, we returned $424 million in capital to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchases year-to-date. And given our expectations for 100% free cash flow conversion, we are positioned to return additional capital to shareholders in fiscal year '24. We continue to estimate $350 million the $450 million in total share repurchases for the full year, which includes an additional $200 million to $300 million in the fourth quarter.\nAnd let me put this into context for you. While we are still early in this current fiscal '24 to fiscal '26 3-year cycle, our capital allocation is unfolding right in line with our expectations. As I said at Investor Day, we are in a strong capital position, on track to generate approximately $3 billion of free cash flow, with another $1 billion available at our 2.5x leverage objective.\nAfter the dividend, we are off to a strong start, balancing investment for growth with capital return to shareholders, which we expect to reach $700 million to $800 million this year. And we remain well-positioned to execute accretive tuck-in M&A. We expect that this balanced capital allocation will increase ROIC to mid- to high teens level over the next 3 years.\nTurning to guidance on Slide 16. We continue to execute the Broadridge financial model in fiscal '24. With 2 months left and high visibility in the fiscal '24 position growth, we expect recurring revenue growth constant currency to be approximately 6% for the full year, at the low end of our guidance range.\nWe continue to expect AOI margin expansion to approximately 20%, adjusted EPS growth at the middle of our 8% to 12% range, and closed sales of $280 million to $320 million. And I'll also note that we remain on track to [ drive ] 100% of free cash flow conversion and have capital return of $700 million to $800 million through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2024.\nTo bring all of this together and highlight what it means to our financial objectives, I will conclude by emphasizing what I said earlier. First, the results through the third quarter and the visibility into the fourth quarter, give us confidence in delivering a fiscal 2024 in line with our guidance, marking a strong start to the fiscal '24 to '26 3-year cycle.\nSecond, we have positive momentum in our business, including strong sales demand, growing investor participation, the actions we are taking to create investment capacity and sustain our steady and consistent growth. Additionally, we have the capital capacity for accretive tuck-in M&A to supplement our organic growth.\nFinally, those 2 items, fiscal year '24 performance and positive forward momentum, position us to deliver on our 3-year financial objective. And with that, let's take your questions. Andrea?"

[Operator Instructions] You also note today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Jamie, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our Chief Financial Officer, Edmund Reese. Before I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard call-outs.\nOne, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results.\nAn explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings. Good morning, and it was great reconnecting with so many of you at our Investor Day in December. As you heard, we are more optimistic than ever about the near- and long-term growth opportunity that lies ahead. You'll hear many of those same themes today as I discuss our positive second quarter results and fiscal year outlook.\nBefore I do, let me comment on the unique and complex moment in which we find ourselves. At [ Davos ] 2 weeks ago, it was energizing to talk with our senior clients about the opportunities and challenges they see ahead. A lot of the discussion was on the promise of AI and how we move our industry forward.\nBroadridge's recent amount of OpsGPT to leverage generative AI to transform Capital Markets operations was particularly timely. At the same time, the geopolitical challenges and uncertainties in the environment are clear which makes our highly recurring and resilient business model, all the more attractive. Against this backdrop, it was rewarding to hear our clients continues to think of Broadridge as an important partner for innovation and growth as well as for efficiency and resilience.\nAnd with that, let me turn to the quarter. First, Broadridge's second quarter results marked another step toward our growth plans for both fiscal '24 and the next 3 years with healthy organic growth across both segments that was in line with our long-term goals. Second, physician growth trends remained positive, with stronger fund position growth and mid-single-digit equity position growth.\nThird, we are executing against the growth plan we shared last month at our Investor Day by driving the democratization and digitization of investing, simplifying and innovating trading and modernizing wealth management. Fourth, we generated strong free cash flow in the quarter, keeping us on track to achieve our 100% FY '24 conversion objective and Edmund will discuss return more capital to shareholders.\nFinally, as we enter the seasonally larger second half of our fiscal year, we expect to deliver another strong set of results. We are reaffirming our guidance for 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth, 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth, and importantly, strong close sales.\nNow let's turn from the headlines to Slide 4 to review our results, starting with our governance franchise. ICS recurring revenue rose 6% in the second quarter. New sales were the biggest driver of growth, a direct result of our focus on delivering innovation across our governance business. We are seeing growth from adding new broker-dealer clients and from sales of our global insights data to asset managers. We're seeing continued momentum in our regulatory composition and disclosure business, and we're benefiting from a strong growth in our digital solutions and customer communications.\nIncreasing investor participation remains an important driver for our regulatory revenues, which rose 8% in the second quarter with mid-single-digit position growth across both equities and funds. In a seasonally small quarter, equity position growth was 6%. The biggest driver continues to be managed accounts, which represent just under 50% of physicians and which continues to grow at double digits compared to low single-digit growth for self-directed accounts.\nFund and ETF physician growth increased from last quarter to 5%, and the slowdown in the growth of passive funds was offset by a pickup in the number of active fund positions. Looking ahead, as Edmund will outline, we expect mid-single-digit physician growth in the second half in both equities and funds as investor participation remains healthy.\nIn December, you also heard us discuss the growth opportunities in our other ICS product lines. In Q2, we saw strong growth across issuer and data-driven fund solutions. In Customer Communications, strong growth in high-margin digital revenue offset lower print. I was particularly pleased with the continued digital transition as you all recall, is a key part of our strategy. In Q2, a significant proportion of this transition was driven by the successful onboarding of one of the largest U.S. wealth managers to our wealth and focused platform.\nThis is a platform we highlighted at our Investor Day, and it was great to see our printed digital strategy playing out. 4 months then, wealth and focus is delivering lower costs and increased investor engagement for our client with industry-leading open rates and click-throughs. Capital Markets revenues rose 10% to $262 million. Our focus on optimizing trading and connectivity in the front office continues to pay dividends in the form of strong growth in BTCS. On the post-trade side, we were helping to simplify our clients' back-office technology.\nI was pleased to see a new win at a regional bank who will be using multiple Broadridge products to drive their transition to self-clearing. We also continue to drive innovation in capital markets with distributed ledger and AI capabilities. Early this month, we launched our OpsGPT AI solution. OpsGPT uses generative AI to synthesize complex transactions, settlements and physicians data to enhance clients' sales resolution.\nAs clients focus on reducing the cost and complexity of their operations, especially in the accelerated world of T+1, they see Broadridge as a natural partner given our deep subject matter expertise and early investment to leverage AI. This progress in innovation, combined with strong BTCS sales in the front office and wins in the back office reinforces how we are successfully helping our clients simplify and innovate in trading.\nTurning now to Wealth and Investment Management. Revenues rose 4% to $143 million as strong growth from UBS was partially offset by the E-Trade transition. In early January, we onboarded the first client for alternatives workflow module. As you know, alternatives are one of the fastest-growing asset classes. Wealth managers are offering these products to a rapidly growing set of investors. But many of the back office processes remain antiquated.\nWe are seeing strong interest in alternatives workflow as wealth firms seek to address this growing opportunity and challenge. Moving to closed sales. Closed sales rose 12% for the first half. As you know, the second half of the year typically accounts for the bulk of our closed sales. And I'm pleased to note that our current pipeline sits at record levels. As important, we're starting to see more movement within the pipeline, increasing our confidence in the second half. While our clients remain cautious, we are seeing them invest in products that drive revenue, improve productivity and meet regulatory requirements, which plays to the strength of our solutions.\nIn governance, we have built a strong pipeline around our digital and print solutions for the new tailored shareholder reports. We're also experiencing increasing demand for our global insight data products from asset managers and we continue to see significant print and digital opportunities in customer communications. Capital Markets clients are beginning to look to a world beyond the implementation of T+1, which is driving growing interest in our poster capabilities.\nAnd in wealth, we saw significant sales in the first half as we begin to convert our strong pipeline. The net result is that we remain on track to deliver strong closed sales for the year, in line with our guidance of $280 million to $320 million. Let's move to Slide 5 for some final thoughts on our quarter and outlook. First, I'll reiterate that Broadridge delivered second quarter results that keep us on track for continued growth with more than 6% recurring revenue growth constant currency and strong free cash flow.\nSecond, those of you who attended our Investor Day last month, heard me talk about how we have made investments over the years to align our business with clear long-term growth trends, including the democratization of investing, the digitization of communications, the acceleration of trading, the growing importance of data in AI and an evolving regulatory environment. Being aligned with those drivers enables us to help our clients operate, innovate and grow. And in so doing, deliver steady and consistent growth for our investors.\nThis quarter again illustrated how we are executing against those priorities in governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. Among these drivers, AI, in particular, has the potential to drive step changes in client outcomes. We have committed to be a leader in AI within our space. In the not-distant future, AI will be incorporated into all products, and we are at work doing that across Broadridge. More fundamentally, companies with unique data will be in a differentiated position. And we believe that our position at the center of financial services gives us a unique opportunity to provide industry solutions that will make a difference.\nThat's a win-win formula for our clients and our shareholders. The products we've already introduced, including BondGPT, OpsGPT and distribution AI are a first step in that direction. Third, based on all that progress, we are reiterating our guidance for both recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth as well as our outlook for closed sales for the full fiscal year. Fourth, we remain on track to deliver free cash flow conversion of 100% this year, while funding the internal investment we need to continue to deliver innovation to our clients.\nThat's an approach that will enable us to retain our investment-grade rating, fund internal investment and deliver a strong and growing dividend, while we execute strategic tuck-in M&A and as Edmund will discuss return additional capital to shareholders. And that brings me to my last point, which is that Broadridge is well positioned to deliver on the 3-year financial objectives we laid out in December, including 79% recurring revenue growth, constant currency, 5% to 8% of which are organic, 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth as well as to continue to grow beyond FY '26 as we attack our $60 billion and growing market opportunity.\nBefore I close, I want to thank our 15,000 talented, knowledgeable and hard-working associates. Yesterday, Broadridge is recognized as one of Fortune's most admired companies. This is the tenth time we've been recognized and that's a direct result of our associates' commitment delivering great service, resiliency and innovation that makes our clients and our industry stronger, and that enables better financial lives for millions of investors every day. Thank you.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Edmund.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased to be here to discuss the results for the second quarter. But before moving into the detailed review, it's important to highlight with the first half signals for the seasonally larger second half and full year fiscal '24.\nFirst, we continue to execute the Broadridge financial model in the second quarter results have us right on track to deliver another strong year of recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth, right in line with our guidance. Second, strong free cash flow of positive $91 million through 2 quarters highlights the capital-light nature of our business and increases our confidence and our 100% free cash flow conversion objective in fiscal '24.\nThird, the combination of strong free cash flow and modest M&A in fiscal '24, means that we expect higher capital return to shareholders through increased share repurchases in the second half of fiscal '24. And finally, the demand for our products is strong. First half sales were up 12% over last year, and our pipeline and current client discussions reinforce our conviction that we will meet our full year objectives. Additionally, our equity position testing shows mid-single-digit growth for the full year.\nSo we continue to be encouraged by expanding investor participation in the financial markets, serving as a long-term tailwind for our business. These 4 items are the meaningful and significant signals from our results and the performance through the first half. So now turning to the financial summary on Slide 6, you see the performance for the second quarter. Recurring revenues rose to $899 million, up 6% on a constant currency basis, all organic. Adjusted operating income increased 1% as we modestly increased growth investments given above-trend event-driven revenue. AOI margin declined 100 basis points to 12.4%. Adjusted EPS was up 1% to $0.92.\nAnd finally, we delivered closed sales of $58 million in the quarter, bringing our first half total to $106 million up 12% over the first half of fiscal '23. Let's get into the details of these results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 7. Recurring revenue was within our full year guidance range and grew 6% to $899 million in Q2 '24. Our recurring revenue growth was driven by a combination of converting our backlog to revenue, fund position growth in ICS and double-digit trade volume growth in GTO. And on Slide 8, we can see recurring revenue growth across our ICS and GTO segments. ICS recurring revenue grew 6% to $493 million, driven by new sales position growth and float income.\nRegulatory revenue grew 8%, led by healthy fund and equity position growth and revenue from new sales. Data-driven Fund Solutions revenue increased by 9% due to higher float revenue in our retirement and workplace products as well as growth in our data and analytics products. Issuer revenue was up 15%, driven by higher float income in our registered shareholder solutions and revenue from strong sales of our disclosure solutions. Customer Communications revenue was flat, with strong growth in higher-margin digital business was offset by a decline in lower margin print revenues. We expect print volumes to increase in the second half of fiscal '24 as we onboard new clients.\nAnd I will again pause here to note that customer communications continues to execute on its print to digital strategy, replacing declining print volumes with higher-margin digital revenues. Over the long term, we expect the combination to result in low single-digit top line growth with expanding margins and continued low double-digit earnings growth. Turning to GTO. Recurring revenue grew 8% to $405 million. Capital Markets revenue increased 10%, led by new sales in equity and fixed income trading volume growth.\nI'll also note the continued strong performance in our front office BTCS solutions, which again had double-digit recurring revenue growth. Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 4% as revenue from the UBS contract was partially offset by the successful transition of E-Trade to the Morgan Stanley platform. which occurred late in the fiscal first quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to have high confidence in both businesses and full year GTO growth being in line with our 5% to 8% organic growth objective. With second half growth in both capital markets and wealth more weighted to the third quarter, driven by the timing of license revenues relative to last year.\nTurning to Slide 9 for a discussion of volume trends. Position growth for both equity and funds remained at healthy levels in the second quarter. The long-term trends that we highlighted at Investor Day, more investor participation in financial markets and more positions per investor underpin that growth. Equity position growth was 6%, driven primarily by double-digit managed account growth and more modest growth in self-directed accounts. As we approach the spring proxy season, which typically generates over 80% of our equity communications, our testing is now extending into the second half of the year, giving us insight on the full year relative to our mid- to high single-digit range.\nEquity position testing shows mid-single-digit growth for the second half of the year. As a result, we now expect mid-single-digit position growth for the full year of fiscal '24 keeping us on track to deliver our guidance of 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth. Mutual fund and ETF position growth improved from Q1 '23 to 5%, again driven by passive funds. We expect to see continued mid-single-digit growth for the second half of the year. And turning now to trade volumes on the bottom of the slide. Trade volumes rose 12% on a blended basis with strong growth in fixed income trading volumes, which benefited our capital markets revenue.\nAnd let's now move to Slide 10 for the recurring revenue growth drivers. Recurring revenue growth of 6% constant currency was all organic and in line with our 5% to 8% 3-year organic growth objective. As I mentioned during the Investor Day, we have a decade-long history of delivering 6 points or better of revenue from closed sales each year. In Q2 '24 had 8 points of contribution with 6 points in ICS and 10 points in GTO, including a boost from wealth management. With continued high retention from existing customers, revenue from net new business contributed to 4 points of growth. Internal growth contributed 2 points to recurring revenue growth, including 1 point from position growth.\nForeign exchange had a 0.5 point benefit from recurring revenue growth. So I'll wrap up the revenue discussion with a view of total revenue on Slide 11. Total revenues grew 9% in Q2 to $1.4 billion, with recurring revenue being the largest contributor powering 4 points of growth. Low to no margin distribution revenues contributed 3 points to total revenue growth. Distribution revenue grew 9%, primarily due to postal rate increases which are a headwind to our adjusted operating income margin. We continue to expect distribution revenue to grow in the high single to low double-digit range, driven by further postal rate increases.\nEvent-driven revenue was $55 million and added 1 point to growth. As anticipated, we saw more normalized levels of mutual fund proxy activity compared to lower levels in Q2 '23, driving a 47% increase in event-driven revenue over last year. I will also note that while contest activity is immaterial through the first half of the year, we expect the combination of increased mutual fund proxy activity and higher contest activity will now have us trending modestly above our historical $230 million to $250 million level for the full year.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have the flexibility to ramp up or ramp down investments based on performance, and we modestly increased growth investments in Q2 based on the above trend event-driven revenue. We are well positioned to stay committed to investing in long-term growth while still delivering our short-term fiscal '24 adjusted EPS guidance. Turning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin was down 100 basis points from prior year to 12.4%.\nAdjusted operating income margin continued to benefit from the operating leverage on our higher recurring in event revenue and the benefit from the Q4 '23 restructuring initiative to realign some of our businesses, and streamline our management structure. The net impact of higher distribution revenue and higher float income, which have an immaterial impact on earnings growth as I detailed at the Investor Day, contributed the positive impact of 45 basis points in the quarter. Those benefits were offset by the timing of other expense items and the impact of our growth investments as our outlook on the full year gave us the confidence to invest in product enhancements in our digital technology platforms.\nLooking ahead, we continue to expect adjusted operating income margin to increase year-over-year to approximately 20%. And I'll remind you that we remain focused on disciplined expense management and creating investment capacity. So we continue to expect to complete the restructuring initiative that began in Q4 '23 and have the remaining restructuring charge by the end of the fiscal year. This restructuring charge will be excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS.\nLet's move ahead to close sales on Slide 13. Closed sales were $58 million in the quarter, bringing the first half total to $106 million, up 12% from the first half of 2023. I was also pleased to see a strong start to the second half with continued sales growth in January. More importantly, the pipeline momentum that Tim mentioned gives us increased confidence in meeting our full year objective. And I'll turn now to free cash flow on Slide 14.\nQ2 '24 free cash flow was $168 million, $64 million better than last year. For the first half, free cash flow is a positive $91 million relative to the negative $115 million in the first half of 2023. These results are being driven by our continued strong earnings growth and lower client platform spend. Free cash flow conversion, calculated this trailing 12-month free cash flow over adjusted net earnings was 110% in Q2 '24 up from 51% last year. This is consistent with our expectations and has us on track for free cash flow conversion of 100% for fiscal year '24.\nOn Slide 15, you can see that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy. For the first half of the year, we invested $66 million on our technology platforms in converting clients to our platforms. Additionally, through the first 6 months, before option proceeds, we returned $330 million in capital to shareholders due to dividend and share repurchases. Given our expectations for 100% free cash flow conversion, we are positioned to return additional capital to shareholders. Based on our current outlook for limited M&A in fiscal 2024, we estimate $350 million to $450 million in total share repurchases, which includes an additional $200 million to $300 million in the second half.\nSo moving to guidance on Slide 16, along with some concluding thoughts. We are successfully executing the Broadridge financial model in fiscal '24 and therefore, reaffirming our full year guidance on all of our key financial metrics. We continue to expect 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth, constant currency, adjusted operating income margin of approximately 20%, adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12% and closed sales of between $280 million to $320 million. And I'll note that embedded in that full year guidance is high single-digit year-over-year adjusted EPS growth for both Q3 and Q4.\nIn addition to the guidance for fiscal '24, it's important that I highlight our high free cash flow business model. We are investing for the long term beyond 2024. And after 6 months in our fiscal year of strong free cash flow conversion, we are confident in our ability to consistently generate 100% free cash flow conversion. That free cash flow conversion, combined with our current outlook for limited M&A in the next 2 quarters, positions our capital return through dividends and share repurchases to reach a total of $700 million to $800 million in fiscal 2024.\nAnd finally, the drivers of growth, both strong demand and investor participation, combined with the investments that I mentioned earlier, give us confidence in meeting our 2024 to 2026 objectives in driving sustainable long-term growth. So with that, let's take your questions. Operator?"

Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Kate, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese. Before I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders.\nOne, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. I'm pleased to be here to discuss our strong start to fiscal '24. Clearly, the economy and our world remain in a volatile and difficult place. Despite the uncertain economic environment, our business continued to perform well in the first quarter, which speaks to the long-term trends and needs driving our growth as well as the strength of our business model and the execution of our team.\nI'll start with the headlines. First, Broadridge reported strong financial results. Recurring revenue grew 8%, all organic, with strong growth across governance, capital markets and wealth. Adjusted EPS rose 30% driven by strong recurring revenue growth, timing of event-driven fees and continued expense discipline. After a slower finish to last fiscal year, closed sales rose $19 million to a first quarter record of $48 million. Second, while markets have remained uneven. Continued growth in investor participation drove equity and fund physician growth of 8% and 3%, respectively.\nThird, we continue to execute our strategy to enable our clients to democratize investing, simplify and innovate trading and modernize wealth management. That execution is driving our results in the form of strong sales in our Government Solutions and strong performance of BTCS, and a growing pipeline in our Wealth Management business among many examples. Fourth, our commitment to balance capital allocation has always been a key part of our value creation strategy. In recent years, we've invested heavily to build out our wealth and capital markets platform capabilities. That investment is moderating.\nAnd in fiscal '23, we repaid a portion of the debt from our BTCS acquisition and ended the year at our target leverage. Now we're returning to our more historical mix of investment and capital allocation. Type-4 investments declined significantly from last year's level, and we repurchased $150 million of our shares in Q1, our first share repurchase since fiscal 2020.\nFinally, with a strong start to the year, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal '24 guidance. We expect recurring revenue growth of 6% to 9%, continued margin expansion, and another year of 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth and closed sales of $280 million to $320 million. Those are the headlines for the quarter.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 to review how we drove these strong results, starting with our governance franchise. Our ICS recurring revenue grew 6%, driven by a combination of revenue from sales increased investor participation and higher interest income. Looking across our product lines, solid growth in our regulatory solutions was complemented by strong results in data-driven fund and issuer solutions.\nIn Customer Communications, double-digit growth in our digital communications revenues more than offset a temporary slowing in print growth. The biggest driver of our growth remained revenue from new sales as we develop new solutions like our digital products and enhance our existing products. We're winning with both new clients and expanding our relationships with existing clients. Increasing investor participation also remains a positive driver for our regulatory business despite headwinds from a choppy market and rising interest rates. In what is the smallest quarter of the year, Equity record growth remained strong at 8%. Growth within managed accounts remained in the mid-teens, more than offsetting low single-digit growth in self-directed accounts.\nFund and ETF position growth was 3%, the underlying trends remain solid with double-digit growth in passive fund positions, offsetting weaker trends in actively managed vehicles. Our forward testing continues to indicate a mid- to high single-digit outlook for equity positions and mid-single-digit growth for fund positions. Equity driven activity also picked up in the quarter. event-driven activity also picked up in the quarter.\nI'm especially proud of the work done by our issuer business as part of the recent large cap spin-off. Not only did we seamlessly process critical communications for more than 5 million beneficial and employee shareholders. We also provided the digital composition and print work for the required filings. It's a great example how Broadridge can bring the full power of this network together to help public companies execute critical transactions.\nWe also appointed new leadership for our ICS business, elevating Doug DeSchutter and Mike A to the role of co-presidents, as part of a long-planned transition. Mike and Doug are proven leaders, and they bring a long track record of execution to their new roles. Our governance business is in strong hands.\nTurning to capital markets. Our sell-side clients are seeking to expand their agency and principal trading capabilities and they're turning to Broadridge for our help. Capital Markets revenues rose 9% to $249 million, driven by strong growth in BTCS, and higher trading volumes. We also help our clients simplify their back-office operations. And during the quarter, we completed the rollout of our global post-trade platform for a large global bank. Step by step, we've worked with that client over the past few years to transition away from 7 different disparate platforms covering 75 separate markets around the world, each of its own operational support and settlement structure, into a single unified Broadridge platform. This is a strong example of how we are helping our clients simplify their operations, reduce expenses and optimize capital utilization by modernizing their infrastructure.\nWealth Management revenues grew 14% to $154 million. As we highlighted on our last call, we began recognizing revenue from UBS at the beginning of the first quarter. For some time, we've been discussing our move to a component-based approach, which we are calling transformation on your terms. I'm pleased that we are seeing success with this approach.\nOur pipeline continues to grow, and we have now sold one or more components to 7 additional clients beyond UBS and RBC. These component sales give us confidence in our progress and the opportunity to expand these clients over time.\nFinally, we reported strong closed sales in the first quarter driven by a combination of underlying demand and sales that moved from fiscal '23. I was especially pleased to see sales growth across all of our franchise, including higher wealth sales and strong growth in BTCS. In an uncertain market, clients remain willing to invest in new capabilities, especially those that can deliver near-term benefits or to enhance the go-to-market strategies, including governance tools, enhance trading capabilities and adviser productivity tools. As a result, while time to close is sometimes longer, our conversations with clients remain strong, and our pipeline continues to grow.\nLet's move to Slide 5 for some closing thoughts on the quarter. First, Broadridge is off to a strong start to fiscal '24. We reported strong first quarter results, including 8% recurring revenue growth 30% adjusted EPS growth. We're executing against our strategy to enable the democratization of investing, simplify and innovate trading and modernize wealth management.\nSecond, our growth is being driven by long-term trends and strong execution, continue to benefit from increasing investor participation and clients investing in new regulatory solutions, faster and more efficient trading and the modernization of wealth management. We have invested to ensure that we can help our clients benefit from these trends. That combination of long-term drivers matched with a clear investment and growth strategy is driving real value for clients and strong results for our shareholders.\nThird, we remain committed to balanced capital allocation, with our core priorities of retaining our investment-grade credit rating, funding, internal investment, growing our dividend in line with earnings, completing tuck-in M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders. With our wealth platform investment now complete and target leverage achieved, we are confident that we will be able to return additional capital to shareholders going forward, and return to mid- to high teens ROIC. The $150 million share buyback we completed in the first quarter highlights that confidence.\nFourth and last, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24, and we remain well positioned for long-term growth. Our business has a long track record of delivering consistent top and bottom line growth and strong shareholder returns. Today, we are better positioned than ever to continue delivering even more value to our clients, and we're looking forward to sharing a newer set of 3-year objectives at our upcoming Investor Day this December, in New York.\nNormally, I close my remarks with a thank you to Broadridge associates around the world. It's an acknowledgment of their work and focus on driving positive client outcomes. But today, I first want to thank and remember one associate in particular. Bob Schifellite passed away in September after a brief illness, while in the process of a long-planned transition away from as well, as President of our ICS business. He joined our governance business almost 40 years ago, and he is a principal architect in building the strong governance franchise, we know today. He was a passionate advocate for our clients, a champion of our culture, and most of all, a good friend and mentor to me and so many others at Broadridge. So I want to thank and remember, Bob, for his work in building our company. And I want to thank all of our associates for the work they do every day to serve our clients drive the transformation of our industry and enable better financial lives for millions.\nEdmund over to you.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim. And thank you, in particular, for those comments on Bob. There is no doubt that he will be missed. Good morning, everyone. I'm really pleased to be here to discuss the results from another strong quarter and a strong start to fiscal 2024. Before reviewing this quarter's results, let me share a few key points.\nFirst, Broadridge delivered strong top line growth, led by strong recurring revenue, in line with our expectations and higher event-driven revenue. Second, and as a result, we expect to generate approximately 25% of adjusted EPS in the first half of fiscal '24. Third, we are reaffirming our fiscal '24 guidance. And finally, we resumed share repurchases in Q1 as we are confident in our ability to drive 100% free cash flow conversion and return more capital to shareholders.\nAs you can see from the financial summary on Slide 6, recurring revenues rose to $871 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis, all organic. Adjusted operating income increased 33% and AOI margin expanded 220 basis points to 13.9%. Adjusted EPS was up 30% to $1.09. And I'll remind you that while higher interest expense partially offsets operating income growth, the interest rate impact at the Broadridge level is fully offset by higher float income in our ICS segment.\nContinuing with the results, we delivered closed sales of $48 million, up $19 million over Q1 '23. And finally, I will note again that we repurchased $150 million of Broadridge shares as part of our balanced capital allocation model.\nLet's get into the details of these results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 7. We Current revenues grew 8% to $871 million in Q1 '24 and was at the higher end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 9%. And our recurring revenue growth was driven by a combination of converting our backlog to revenue and double-digit trade volume growth.\nLet's turn now to Slide 8 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. We continue to see growth in both ICS and GTO. ICS recurring revenue grew 6% to $469 million. Regulatory revenue grew 5% and was led by fund and equity position growth. More importantly, physician growth remains in line with our expectations as I'll detail in a moment. Data-driven Fund Solutions revenue increased by 9%, primarily due to higher float revenue in our mutual fund trade processing unit, which we have rebranded to be Broadridge Retirement and Workplace. Issuer revenue was up 19%, driven by growth in our registered shareholder solutions.\nAnd Customer Communications recurring revenue was up 2%, propelled by continued double-digit growth in our higher-margin digital business, which more than offset lower growth in our lower-margin print revenues. And while we do expect print volumes to pick up over the balance of fiscal '24, we continue to expect print revenues to decline over time and be replaced with higher-margin digital revenue. As a result, over the long term, we expect our customer communications business to have low single-digit top line growth with expanding margins and continued low double-digit earnings growth as it execute on its print to digital strategy.\nTurning to GTO. Recurring revenues grew 11% to $402 million. Capital markets revenue increased 9% and led by continued strong performance in BTCS, and elevated equity and fixed income trading volume growth. Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 14%, powered by the onset of revenue recognition related to the UBS contract, partially offset by the successful transition of E-Trade to the Morgan Stanley platform, which occurred at the beginning of September. Looking ahead, we continue to have high confidence in full year GTO growth being in line with our historical 5% to 7% growth objective.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 for a closer look at volume trends. As you can see by our results, investor participation in financial markets has continued to increase despite the market volatility. Equity position growth was 8%, driven by continued double-digit growth in managed accounts. Our testing of position growth continues to prove reliable as Q1 was in line with our expectations. We have now extended our testing into Q2 and Q3, and those results support our outlook for mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. Mutual fund position growth moderated from Q4 '23, but grew 3%, driven by strong growth in passive funds. Based on our testing, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year.\nTurning now to trade volumes on the bottom of the slide. Trade volumes rose 15% on a blended basis, led by double-digit volume growth in both equities and fixed income, which benefited our capital markets business.\nLet's now move to Slide 10 for the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenue growth of 8% was all organic and grew above our 5% to 7% growth objective for a sixth consecutive quarter. Revenue from net new business contributed 5 points of growth. Internal growth, primarily trading volumes, expanding client relationships and float income contributed 3 points. Foreign exchange had a nonmaterial teen-basis point positive impact on recurring revenue growth. And based on courage, we expect a similar benefit in full year recurring revenue growth relative to fiscal '23.\nI I'll finish the discussion on revenue on Slide 11. Total revenue grew 12% to $1.4 billion, of which recurring revenue, the largest contributor of 5 points of growth. Event-driven revenue was $87 million and added 2 points to growth. As expected, the bit driven revenue increased sequentially and was above a 7-year average. Event-driven activity in the quarter was particularly strong and benefited from the timing of mutual fund proxy activity and significant corporate actions. We continue to expect more normalized event-driven revenue for the remainder of the year and for the full year to be $230 million, $250 million, in line with recent years.\nLow to no margin distribution revenues contributed 5 points to the total revenue growth. Distribution revenue was elevated and reached 14% and with half of that growth coming from postal rate increases, which have a dilutive impact on our adjusted operating income margin. We continue to expect distribution revenue to grow in the high single to low double-digit range, driven by further postal rate increases.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin was 13.9%, a 220 basis point improvement over the prior year period, powered by a combination of operating leverage on our higher recurring and event-driven revenue, higher float income and continued disciplined expense management. Excluding the net impact of higher distribution revenue and higher float income, which was accretive to margins in Q1, we delivered over 100 basis points of margin expansion, after absorbing the amortization from our wealth platform. This performance gives us confidence in our ability to both fund long-term growth investments and still meet our earnings growth objectives.\nWe continue to expect adjusted operating income margin to increase year-over-year to approximately 20%, as we overcome the dilutive impact of higher distribution revenue.\nLet's move ahead to closed sales on Slide 13. Closed sales were $48 million, $19 million higher than Q1 '23. We were encouraged by our strong start to the year with higher sales across all 3 of our franchises. We saw strong BTCS sales in GTO and strong customer communications and regulatory sales in ICS. As Tim noted, our pipeline remains strong as we continue to see strong interest from clients in our technology solutions.\nI'll turn now to cash flow on Slide 14. I'll start with a reminder that Broadridge's cash flow generation is typically negative in the fiscal first quarter and strengthens throughout the year. Q1 '24 free cash flow was negative $76 million, $142 million better than last year, driven by a reduction in client platform spend, which I'll discuss in a moment. Free cash flow conversion calculated to this trailing 12-month free cash flow over adjusted net earnings was 103% in Q1 '24. This is consistent with our expectations of free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% for full year '24.\nOn Slide 15, you'll see that we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy that prioritizes our investment-grade credit rating, internal investment, a strong and growing dividend and strategic tuck-in M&A that meets our financial criteria, with excess capital being returned to shareholders through share repurchases. Our total capital investment for Q1 '24 was $34 million, including platform investment of $20 million, down significantly from the prior year's $163 million. We returned $86 million to shareholders through the dividend and with no M&A activity in the quarter, we returned an additional $150 million to shareholders through share repurchases, our first share repurchase activity since fiscal year '20.\nTurning to guidance on Page 16. As I said in the beginning of my remarks, the strong start to fiscal '24 gives us the confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance on all of our key financial metrics. We continue to expect 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth, constant currency, adjusted operating income margin of 20%, adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12% and closed sales of between $280 million to $320 million. Additionally, we expect approximately 75% of our earnings to be generated in the second half of the year with 25% in the first half, in line with our performance over the last 10 years.\nFinally, let me summarize my key messages. Broadridge delivered strong Q1 financial results. The demand and secular trends driving our growth remains strong, and our testing is showing continued equity and fund position growth into the second half of the fiscal year. We expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 100% in fiscal '24, allowing us to invest for growth and return capital to shareholders in line with our balanced capital allocation model. We are reaffirming our fiscal year '24 guidance, highlighting the strength of our business and financial model.\nAnd with that, let's take your questions. Operator, back to you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Jamie. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation. Let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Edings, and good morning. It's great to be here this morning to review our strong fiscal '23 results. I'm particularly proud of what Broadridge has been able to accomplish over the past year and where we stand now as we look forward. In fiscal '23, we finalized the rollout of our new wealth platform suite, completed the product integration of our front office trading capabilities and brought new innovation and digitization to our governance clients. At the same time, we delivered strong financial results and record free cash flow.\nWe met our leverage target, and we delivered at or above the high end of our 3-year financial objectives. The net result is that Broadridge is exiting 2023, poised to deliver another strong year in fiscal '24 and well positioned for continued long-term growth. I'm especially proud of our execution, given the uncertain market environment.\nOur financial services clients are dealing with fallout from the steepest rate increases in decades, a sharp slowdown in investment banking activity, fund outflows, banking crises and increased regulation. They are reducing head count and playing purchasing decisions. Those pressures have had an impact on our sales, as I'll touch on later in this call.\nOn the other hand, recent data points suggest an economy has proven to be more resilient than anticipated, contributing to the clear sets of urgency our clients feel around next-generation technology. They know they need to streamline their operations, increase their digital capabilities and drive innovation. They want partners who can help them accomplish these goals and they recognize that Broadridge is 1 of only a handful of scale technology players investing to deliver new solutions built on modern technology. That's great for our business, and is driving our record pipeline.\nSo it is an uneven environment. But for Broadridge, it's a market that further highlights the resiliency of our business and the value of our investments for the future. With that as background, let's look at the headlines for the quarter and the year.\nFirst, Broadridge delivered another strong quarter. Recurring revenue grew 8% with strong growth across both our segments. Earnings rose 21%, driven by the combination of strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Second, those results closed out a strong fiscal year. In 2023, recurring revenue and adjusted EPS both rose 9% and free cash flow conversion improved to 90%.\nImportantly, Broadridge met or exceeded our 3-year financial objectives. Third, our ability to deliver strong results despite an uneven market was driven by strong execution across governance, capital markets and wealth and by the long-term trends underpinning our growth. Fourth, we expect to deliver another strong year in fiscal '24. Our guidance calls for 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth, all organic and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. We also expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.\nFinally, I'm delighted to announce a 10% increase in our annual dividend. Dividends are an important part of our long-term capital allocation, and we're proud of our track record of increasing dividends every year since we became a public company in 2007, including double-digit increases in [indiscernible] of the past 12 years. As a result of our strong free cash flow, we expect to resume share repurchases in fiscal '24 and also have the flexibility to fund tuck-in M&A if the right opportunity arises.\nAs I noted earlier, 2023 was the final year of our latest set of 3-year objectives.\nSo let's turn to Slide 5 to highlight our performance against those goals. In fiscal '20, we reported recurring revenues of $2.9 billion and adjusted EPS of just over $5. Three years later, we've grown our recurring revenues nearly 40% to $4 billion and reported adjusted EPS just above $7. We met or exceeded the high end of our objectives for recurring revenue growth, adjusted operating income margin and adjusted EPS growth. Our ability to deliver on those goals becomes even more meaningful used in the context of a longer length. The fiscal '20 to '23 period marked the fourth consecutive 3-year cycle in which we have delivered against a similar set of objectives. That track record underscores the long-term trends driving demand for what we do.\nBroadridge is focused on driving profitable growth and the strength of our recurring revenue business model. Next, let's review our business performance, starting with our governance franchise on Slide 5. Our ICS business delivered another very strong year as recurring revenue growth of 9% was powered by a combination of revenue from new sales, increased investor participation and higher interest income. All 4 product lines reported strong growth. The biggest growth driver remained new sales. Our business benefited from new digital and print wins in our customer communications business and by increasing our relationships with fast-growing digital brokers.\nOur regulatory business also benefited from increased investor participation, which continue to grow at a healthy pace. We saw balanced position growth across both equities and funds despite the headwinds from an equity market that for much of the year was lower. After 2 very strong years, equity position growth of 9% returned to more normalized mid- to high single digits, driven by double-digit growth in managed accounts and single-digit growth in self-directed accounts.\nMutual fund and ETF position growth was also strong at 8%, with balanced mid-single-digit growth across both equity and fixed income funds. And while we saw growth of passive funds, demand for active funds also continue to be positive.\nOne reason clients are choosing to do more with Broadridge is our commitment to innovation, including our work on driving digitization and shareholder engagement. For example, we are driving the digitization of wealth management communications with our omnichannel wealth and focused product. Our ability to consolidate information simplifies the investor experience while lowering costs for our clients.\nThanks to our investments in digital. Broadridge has become the leading omnichannel communications hub. We are enabling a new frontier in investor engagement for funds with our work behind the scenes on voting choice. Over the course of 2023, we've rolled out pilot programs for 4 of the 5 largest ETF managers in the United States. We're enabling these fund managers to capture the voting preferences of millions of ETF shareholders, giving them an even stronger voice in the governance of the underlying companies they [indiscernible]. We're also helping funds adapt to the new tailored shareholder report regulations by applying our unique digital and in-line print capabilities to create a better investor experience at lower cost to fund companies. Those are just some of the examples of the innovative solutions that are differentiating Broadridge, driving high client retention and engagement and enabling strong revenue growth for our governance franchise.\nNow let's move to our capital markets franchise, where our BTCS business continues to drive growth. Capital Markets revenues rose 11% to $965 million, driven by strong growth in BTCS, and by the onboarding of new global post-trade clients. Our clients continue to look for ways to simplify their operating model. whether by bringing together disparate platforms at the front office, pursuing global multi-asset solutions in the back office or connecting front to back. We're meeting that demand with the standardized global multi-asset trading platform, componentized solutions to deliver a unified global book and the front-to-back integration that enables clients to improve controls and reduce cost and risk by implementing straight-through processing.\nWe're also delivering leading-edge solutions like distributed ledger repo. Earlier this [indiscernible], we saw our clients execute intraday repo transactions on our DLR network. These new capabilities mesh distributed ledger technology with existing market settlement infrastructure to give our clients added flexibility to manage liquidity. We're also developing new AI applications, including an AI-enabled interface for a bond trading platform, reducing the friction around pre-trade analysis by making it easier to identify bonds with similar characteristics.\nLet's turn to Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 7. Wealth and Investment Management revenues rose 4% to $560 million in fiscal '23. Our growth was paced by revenues from new sales driven by demand from modular solutions especially adviser tools like our digital marketing platform, which more than offset the impact of a significant license sale in the prior year. During the fourth quarter, we finalized our rollout plan with UBS, which enable us to begin to recognize revenue on July 1 as planned.\nWe have built a suite of solutions that can drive adviser productivity, enhance the client experience and reduce cost and risk by digitizing operations. It can help wealth firms better acquire, manage and grow client accounts. It's a fully modular suite of components, linked by common data layer and common APIs. With the new UBS contract in place, we are now focused on our goal of $20 million to $30 million of annualized wealth platform sales. Over the past few months, we developed a targeted marketing plan to expand our outreach efforts and build on early demand. We're seeing strong near-term demand for adviser Experience Suite, our corporate action platform and the alternative product.\nDeeper in the pipeline, we're seeing significant interest in other [indiscernible] solutions from wealth managers who want to enhance their client experience as well as those considering more fundamental changes in how they serve clients.\nI'll wrap up my business review with a discussion of closed sales, where we continue to feel the impact of market uncertainty and longer sales cycles. After 11 years of record sales, closed sales of $246 million were down 12% from fiscal '22. While U.S. sales were largely on track, we saw many delayed decisions in Europe. The good news is that we believe these are delays and that they will have little impact on our long-term growth trajectory. We have not seen projects drop or experienced competitive losses. As a result, our pipeline is at an all-time record and we expect strong sales growth in fiscal '24.\nLet's wrap up on Slide 8 with some closing callouts. First, Broadridge had another strong year in fiscal '23 financially and operationally. We delivered strong financial results, including record free cash flow and achieved critical growth and leverage milestones. We also finalized the delivery of our wealth platform and continue to enhance our governance and capital market solutions. Second, the same long-term trends that have propelled our growth show no signs of easing. Third, we expect to deliver another strong year in fiscal '24, with continued top and bottom line growth as well as record closed sales and higher free cash flow conversion. With a return to more balanced capital allocation in '24, we expect to make further progress in raising our ROIC to the mid- to high teens over the next 3 years.\nFinally, I've never been more confident in the outlook for our company. As I look across Broadridge, our governance business has a differentiated core offer and innovative new solutions like pass-through voting, digital communications and tailored shareholder reports. Our capital markets business is driving simplification and innovation in the front and back office. And our Wealth Business is now bringing the platform of tomorrow to clients today. We've never been better positioned for sustainable differentiation and innovation-driven growth. And with the end of our investment phase, return historic free cash flow conversion, balanced capital allocation and increasing ROIC to go with that growth, we are well positioned to drive strong returns for our shareholders.\nI'll wrap up on that note. But before I turn it over to Edmund, let me thank our almost 15,000 associates. To those listening on this call, thank you for your focus and our clients. Your work is helping us enable better financial lives per million. Edmund, over to you.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here to discuss the results from yet another strong quarter and the strong full year fiscal '23. Today, I'll also provide you with some additional color into our guidance for fiscal '24, which continues to be in line with our historical 3-year financial objectives. .\nBefore jumping into a review of our strong results and guidance, I want to emphasize some of the significance of some key milestones that we achieved in fiscal '23. First, we completed the investment in our wealth management platform, reduced our client platform spend and are now going live with our anchor client, recognizing revenue in July. Second, free cash flow conversion improved to 90%. Third, we paid down debt and reached our leverage objective in line with our commitment during the Itiviti acquisition. And fourth, we positioned ourselves to return more capital to shareholders via a higher dividend and the resumption of share repurchases in fiscal '24. And finally, as Tim noted, we capped our current 3-year cycle where we delivered at or above the high end of our 3-year objectives. Those milestones were a direct outcome of our strong fiscal '23 results.\nAnd as you can see from the financial summary on Slide 9, Broadridge's full year recurring revenue growth was at the higher end of our fiscal '23 guidance. And with operating leverage in our business and continued disciplined expense management, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth was right in line with our full year guidance despite the lower event-driven revenue.\nOn a full year basis, recurring revenue rose to approximately $4 billion, up 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis all organic. Adjusted operating income increased 12% and margin expanded 110 basis points to 19.8%, outpacing our annual margin expansion objective despite the drag from increased low to no margin distribution revenue. And I'll remind you that while higher interest rate expenses partially offset operating income growth, the interest rate impact at the Broadridge level is fully offset by higher float income in our ICS segment.\nAdjusted EPS rose 9% to $7.01. And finally, we delivered closed sales of $246 million. Turning to the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue grew 8% on a constant currency basis to $1.3 billion. Again, the growth was all organic. Adjusted operating income grew 22%, right in line with our expectations and AOI margins expanded 360 basis points. Adjusted EPS increased 21% to $3.21 and closed sales were 19% lower at $90 million.\nLet's get into the details of these results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 10. Recurring revenue grew 8% to $1.3 billion in Q4 '23. Our recurring revenue growth was all organic, driven by a combination of converting sales to revenue and mid-single-digit position in trade growth. For the full year, 9% recurring revenue growth was at the higher end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 9%. This 9% growth exceeds our 5% to 7% organic growth objective and marks 3 consecutive years of organic growth of at least 8%.\nIn addition to our strong organic growth, the acquisition of BTCS, contributed 2.6 points of growth to our fiscal year '20 to fiscal '23 recurring revenue CAGR, right in line with what we communicated at the time of acquisition. As a result, we also exceeded our total recurring revenue growth objective of 7% to 9%, with a 3-year constant currency CAGR of 11%.\nLet's turn now to Slide 11 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. We continued to see strong growth in both ICS and GTO. In Q4, ICS recurring revenue grew 7%, all organic to $858 million, with solid growth across all 4 product lines. Regulatory revenue grew 5% to $444 million on the back of continued growth in U.S. equity and fund positions, partially offset by lower growth in international proxy. Data-driven Fund Solutions revenue increased 12% to $113 million, primarily due to higher float revenue in our mutual fund trade processing unit. And Issuer revenue grew 7% to $134 million, led by growth in our registered shareholder and disclosure solutions.\nOur customer communications recurring revenue was up 7% to $166 million, led by new client wins, higher print volumes and very strong double-digit growth in our digital business. Our digital customer communications business has now surpassed $100 million in recurring revenue, which is a sign that our print, the higher-margin digital strategy is working. For the year, ICS grew recurring revenue at 9% with regulatory at 7% and double-digit growth across all other product lines.\nTurning to GTO on Slide 12. Q4 recurring revenue grew by 9% to $401 million. Capital Markets revenue grew 12% to $257 million propelled by higher license revenue in BTCS, continued fixed income trading volume growth and new sales growth. Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 4% to $143 million, driven by healthy growth from new sales, offset by lower trading volumes and the grow-over impact of higher license revenue in Q4 '22. For the year, GTO grew recurring revenue at 8%, ahead of our 5% to 7% growth objective, driven primarily by double-digit growth in our capital markets business.\nNow let's turn to Slide 13 for a closer look at the volume trends. We have healthy position growth for both equities and funds in the fourth quarter, consistent with our testing results. Equity position drove [indiscernible] high teen growth in Q4 '22 and was 6% in the quarter and 9% for the full year, with continued double-digit growth in managed accounts. Mutual fund position growth in the quarter ticked up to 8% and full year growth was also 8%, with continued strong flows in the money market funds. Looking ahead to the first half of fiscal '24, our current testing for equity positions is showing mid-single-digit growth, which supports our full year outlook of mid- to high single-digit growth.\nTurning now to trade volumes on the bottom of that slide. Trade volumes grew 3% on a blended basis in Q4, driven by another quarter of double-digit fixed income volume growth, which benefited our capital markets business and modest declines in equity volumes impacting our retail wealth business. For the full year, trading volume was up 4%.\nNow I move to Slide 14 for the drivers of recurring revenue growth. For the quarter, recurring revenue growth of 8% was all organic in balance between net new business and internal growth. Revenue from closed sales and our continued high retention from existing customers provided 4 points of growth. Our recurring revenue retention rate was 99% in the quarter and 98% for the full year. And internal growth, primarily higher positions, trading volumes and float income also contributed 4 points.\nForeign exchange impacted recurring revenue by 1 point, with most of that coming in our GTO business as you can see in the table on the bottom of the slide.\nI'll finish the discussion on revenue on Slide 15. Total revenue grew 7% in Q4 to $1.8 billion, and recurring revenue was the largest contributor with 5 points of growth. Event-driven revenue was $59 million and a 1 point headwind to Q4 growth. Event-driven revenue increased sequentially and was in line with our 7-year average as mutual fund proxy activity improved. While we're not forecasting any large fund proxy campaigns, we do expect some of the delayed mutual fund proxy activity in fiscal '23 to come through in fiscal '24 as event-driven revenue returns to more historical levels. Low than no margin distribution revenues contributed 3 points to total revenue growth, Distribution revenue increased 9% with postal rate increases contributing 8 points of that growth. Given that postal rate increases are passed through, elevated distribution revenue have a dilutive impact on our adjusted operating income margin.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 16. Adjusted operating income margin for Q4 was 28.9%, a 360 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by a combination of our operating leverage in our business, higher float income and continued disciplined expense management. On a full year basis, we delivered 110 basis points of margin expansion. The impact of interest income more than offset a 30 basis point headwind from the growth of low to no margin distribution revenue. Excluding both, margins expanded 60 basis points, which is above our 50 basis point long-term objective.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have a track record of disciplined expense management. This discipline, along with the operating leverage inherent in our business model allows us to invest in our long-term growth investments and meet our earnings objectives. As we exit fiscal '23, we are undergoing a modest restructuring that will realign some of our businesses, streamline our management structure and impact approximately 2% of our 14,700 associates. As a result, we incurred a $20 million restructuring charge in Q4 '23, and we anticipate that these actions will generate approximately $50 million in annualized savings. Again, allowing us to continue to fund growth investments and deliver earnings growth.\nLooking ahead, we expect another $15 million to $30 million charge in Q3 '24 as we complete this restructuring initiative and seek to create further room to invest. These restructuring charges are excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS.\nLet's move ahead to close sales on Slide 17. We ended our fiscal year closing $90 million in closed sales for the fourth quarter. For the full year, sales were down 12% off a record fiscal '22 to $246 million. Closed sales were below our full year guidance, driven by lower international sales. Strong U.S. sales were driven by customer communications, digital solutions and retirement solutions. Our pipeline entering fiscal '24 is at a record high, and the demand for our technology solutions remains strong. Importantly, the slowdown in sales we experienced in Q4 '23 is fully incorporated into our fiscal '24 guidance. Our $400 million backlog equal to 10% of our fiscal '23 recurring revenue provides strong visibility into the revenue conversion from closed sales that will drive fiscal '24 revenue growth.\nI'll now turn to cash flow on Slide 18. In fiscal year '23, we generated $748 million in free cash flow, doubling fiscal '22 levels. As a result, free cash flow conversion, calculated as free cash flow over adjusted net earnings improved to 90% in fiscal '23. This improvement was the product of reduced client platform spend and payments from UBS as we finalize the rollout and go-live plan, along with strong working capital management. Looking ahead to fiscal '24, we estimate free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%.\nLet me make a note here before we move on to capital allocation. With a new contract with UBS in place, we have now moved our focus to marketing and driving $20 million to $30 million in sales of the wealth management platform components. As a result, we have moved approximately $600 million of software investment from the deferred client conversion line to intangible assets. This is consistent with balance sheet classification of platform technology that will be marketed to multiple clients. We continue to expect to recognize $57 million of annualized amortization expense in fiscal '24, resulting from our wealth platform investment and this change will have no impact on the free cash flow or the income statement.\nLet's now discuss capital allocation on Slide 19. We spent $369 million on investments for growth, primarily our wealth platform and returned a net of $312 million to shareholders in fiscal '23. In addition, we repaid $385 million of debt. The combination of strong earnings growth and lower debt moves our leverage ratio at the end of fiscal '23 to 2.6x. This level is consistent with the leverage objective we set when we announced the Itiviti acquisition and is in line with our goal of maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As a result, we expect to return to more balanced capital allocation in fiscal '24. To that end, we are pleased that our Board has approved a 10% annual dividend increase to $3.20 per share in fiscal '24, in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 45% of adjusted earnings. We have capacity for modest strategic tuck-in M&A, and we are also in a position to resume share repurchases for the first time since fiscal '19.\nI'll close my prepared remarks this morning with some detail on our fiscal '24 guidance, which is on Slide 20. Our fiscal '24 guidance calls for mid- to high single-digit recurring revenue growth, margin expansion strong adjusted EPS growth and a recovery in closed sales.\nLet's break down the relevant components and drivers of each guidance point starting first with revenue. We expect fiscal '24 recurring revenue growth constant currency of 6% to 9%, all organic, driven by new sales as we work to onboard our $400 million backlog. For modeling purposes, we expect GTO growth to be in line with our historical 5% to 7% organic range. In our Wealth business, we anticipate that we will recognize approximately $75 million in incremental revenues from wealth platform clients. This growth will be significantly offset by the loss of revenue transitioning E-Trade to the Morgan Stanley platform. We are assuming flat trading volumes.\nWe expect event-driven revenue to return to more historical levels in the range of $230 million to $250 million. Distribution revenue is anticipated to grow in the high single to low double-digit range, driven by further increases in postal rates. This continued strong growth in low to no margin distribution revenue does create a margin headwind that I'll discuss in a moment. I'll also note that using the current forward curve for FX suggests a 0.5 point benefit in recurring revenue relative to fiscal '23.\nSecond, let's move on to margins. We expect our adjusted operating income margin will be up year-over-year to approximately 20%. We expect the net impact of higher distribution revenues and higher float income to be dilutive to our margins in fiscal '24. Excluding the headwind from distribution and float income, we expect that the operating leverage in our business and our disciplined expense management will allow us to absorb the amortization from our wealth platform and fund higher growth investments in our business while driving greater than 50 basis points of margin expansion, in line with our historical objectives.\nThird, EPS. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 12%. Embedded in this outlook is an expected tax rate of 23%, a slight uptick driven by the lower impact of discrete items on higher earnings and the geographic earnings mix.\nFinally, closed sales. We expect a strong year in sales with the fiscal '24 range of $280 million to $320 million based on our strong pipeline. We expect balanced sales between ICS and GTO, and I want to reiterate that the delays in the timing of our sales have only a very modest impact on our medium-term revenue outlook given our backlog. Taken together, our fiscal '24 guidance demonstrates the strength of our financial model. We continue to be focused on driving sustainable recurring revenue growth. Using the operating leverage in our business to create capacity for continued investment and continued margin expansion while also delivering steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth, all while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet and a balanced capital allocation policy.\nBefore I move on from guidance, we briefly discuss our Q1 and first half adjusted EPS outlook. Historically, Broadridge has generated a little less than 1/4 of our earnings in the first half, and we anticipate this year to be no different, with earnings slightly more weighted towards Q1 versus Q2, driven [indiscernible] by higher event-driven revenue in the first quarter. With that final note, let me wrap up with a quick summary of my key messages.\nBroadridge delivered strong Q4 financial results to close out a strong fiscal '23. We delivered at or above the high end of our 3-year financial objectives. And with our fiscal '24 guidance, we are positioned to deliver another strong set of financial results. Last, we expect to return to more balanced capital allocation in fiscal '24, including double-digit dividend growth, the resumption of stock repurchases and potential tuck-in M&A. And with that, let's take your questions. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nThank you, Kate. And good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese. Before I turn the call over to Tim, let me make a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks.\nA summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation. Let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThanks, Edings. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to be here to review our strong third quarter results. I'll start with a quick summary and key headlines followed by a review of our business. Then I'll close with some thoughts on why I think fiscal '23 has been such a strong year for Broadridge across key operating, strategic and financial milestones and why that positions us well for the future. Let's get started on Slide 3. First, Broadridge delivered another strong quarter. Recurring revenue rose 9% in constant currency, with double-digit growth in our governance business, and strong growth in GTO.\nDebt revenue growth helped drive 10% growth in adjusted operating income and 6% growth in adjusted EPS. Importantly, those earnings translated to Street's strong free cash flow, which nearly tripled year-over-year as we continue to step down our wealth platform investments. Second, investor participation remains strong. Q3 equity position growth was 10%, and fund position growth was 6%, with over 90% of equity record dates completed through last week, we continue to expect physician growth to be in the high single digits for fiscal '23, underlining the power of the trends driving that growth.\nThird, Broadridge continues to execute across governance, capital markets and wealth. The investments we have made to innovate in our governance business to put in place front-to-back capabilities in capital markets and to build a transformational wealth platform suite are resonating with clients. Fourth, as we move through our seasonally large fourth quarter, Broadridge is on track to deliver another year of steady top and bottom line growth. We expect to report recurring revenue growth at the higher end of our 6% to 9% guidance range. And we are reaffirming our outlook for continued margin expansion, and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth.\nFinally, our fiscal '23 outlook has us on track to deliver at or above the high end of our 3-year financial objectives 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. That would mark a fourth consecutive cycle in which we have delivered on our 3-year financial objectives. Now let's turn to Slide 4 for a review of our results, beginning with our governance or ICS business. Governance recurring revenues rose 11% constant currency driven by strong growth across all 4 product lines. Our regulatory business with its connections to broker dealers, funds, public companies and tens of millions of individual investors continues to benefit from strong investor participation.\nAs we move to the peak of proxy season, equity position growth, in particular, remains strong at 10%, led by low-teens growth in managed account positions, and solid 7% growth in self-directed positions. Broadridge is benefiting from broad-based growth across both mid- and large-cap equities and across sectors. And as Edmund will share, we see further growth ahead for the all-important fourth quarter. That growth, especially in the context of declining equity and fixed income markets over the past 15 months, really underscores the secular technology-driven trends driving increasing investor participation.\nOn the fund side, position growth also remained solid at 6%. We continue to see double-digit growth in passive fund positions, including ETFs and money markets with basically flat growth in active fund positions. For all the growth we've seen in passive funds over the past decade, passive positions still account for less than 40% of the total, giving us confidence this trend can continue to drive growth for a long time to come. Outside of the regulatory core, our governance business posted double-digit growth in recurring revenue.\nOur Customer Communications business is benefiting from strong growth in digital solutions. Our issuer business is benefiting from strong demand for our registered and disclosure solutions and higher interest rates are contributing to the growth of our data-driven funds business. Partially offsetting the strong recurring revenue growth is lower event-driven activity. The weakness we noted last quarter has continued and will likely extend into the fourth quarter as well.\nIn the past, we've seen these levels and activity extend anywhere from 2 to 4 quarters in periods of market weakness and uncertainty. As a reminder, most of this deferred activity involves elections for mutual fund boards of directors. As such, they need to happen eventually. And when they do, they grow with physicians. Turning now to GTO. Capital Markets revenues grew 5% to $246 million. The integration of BTCS, continues to deliver long-term benefits. During the quarter, we onboarded a leading global multi-asset class clearing firm providing them with ultra-low latency connections to 40 global member markets and displacing a major competitor.\nIn addition, one of our goals has been to develop a suite of applications that bring together our capabilities across the front and back office to simplify workflow across the trade life cycle. These efforts are now translating into multiple pipeline opportunities for bundled front-to-back sales. Outside of BTCS, our distributed ledger repo solution, while still small in revenue terms, continues to generate strong market interest. UBS recently executed the first real-time intraday DLT repo trade on our platform. This represents a major step forward in increasing settlement velocity and collateral mobility and therefore, reducing the amount of capital needed by clients to manage their intraday liquidity needs.\nIn wealth, revenue grew 10% to $143 million. I'm pleased to announce we have completed both the platform development and testing of our Broadridge wealth product suite. We've made significant progress towards finalizing a phased rollout approach with UBS that delivers solid economics to Broadridge while addressing T+1 and giving UBS the flexibility to deploy modules on its own timetable, as it continues its digital transformation. We remain confident that we are on track to recognize revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '24, and that we will see notably improved free cash flow conversion going forward.\nWe have invested significantly in the past 3 years to reach this point. Working closely with UBS, we've created a suite of modular solutions that enable our clients to drive adviser productivity, improve the investor experience and digitize front-to-back operations. This is a differentiated capability that others are talking about, but that only Broadridge can deliver now. Our componentized approach means that firms can step into this transformation based on their needs. These conversations are resonating, and our pipeline continues to grow, now up over 40% from the beginning of the year.\nAll in all, this is a proud moment for Broadridge. Finally, speaking of client conversations, closed sales rose 8% to $62 million in the third quarter. We are now entering our critical selling quarter with a record pipeline, and we are seeing significant interest in digital solutions, capital markets and wealth. At the same time, we're clearly in a highly uncertain economic environment. Like others, we're seeing longer sales cycles, especially in Europe. With some deals slipping into the summer, we now expect full year close sales to be near the low end of our $270 million to $310 million guidance.\nOur record pipeline gives us confidence the variation we are seeing is timing, and our strong backlog of solutions already sold and in the onboarding process means that we expect minimal impact on FY '24 revenue growth. I'll close my remarks on Slide 5. Broadridge is poised to deliver another strong year in fiscal '23 across key operating, strategic and financial metrics. First, on the operating side, position growth remains very healthy. After 2 years of strong markets and ultra-low rates, market dynamics have shifted significantly over the past 12 months.\nAnd yet our results year-to-date the activity we're seeing early in Q4 and our forward testing all give us a high degree of confidence that we'll end the year with physician growth in the high single digits for equities and mid-single digits for funds. These results, in turn, give us added conviction that the long-term trends driving increased investor participation remain very much intact, even in a choppy market and even after 2 above trend years. Beyond position growth, we've taken steps to strengthen our government business by implementing a voting choice for funds or pass-through voting, as we referred to it in the past and universal proxy all while developing a new offering for tailored shareholder reports.\nBetween the fundamental drivers and these enhancements, the regulatory business is the strongest it's ever been. Second, our investments in digital communications capabilities have begun to translate into significant momentum. Broadridge has become a leading omnichannel communication hub, giving our clients and enhanced digital experience while preserving best-in-class print. For many years, after we acquired DST's communications business at the beginning of fiscal '17. The combined business contributed double-digit earnings growth by delivering strong synergies and scale. More recently, we've seen these efficiencies help us drive new client wins.\nAnd now our digital capabilities are enabling Broadridge play a new and more central role in how our clients service and grow their business. This is the vision we laid out when we made the acquisition, and it's exciting to see it bear fruit. Third, our capital markets business have never been in a stronger position. Our ability to address the entire trade life cycle puts us in a unique position to help our clients simplify their complex operations. As we integrated [indiscernible] we have built the capabilities that will link our front and back-office solutions in the market receptivity has been strong.\nFourth, our Broadridge wealth platform will enable our clients to drive digital transformation on their terms through a wide set of modular solutions targeting adviser productivity, improved investor experience and digitized operations. We've now completed the elevated investment phase of our growth strategy, and we are well positioned to attack this growing market. Lastly, we're delivering another year of strong and consistent financial results. After a strong third quarter, our full year outlook calls for high single-digit recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth.\nThe successes we are discussing today require investments, significant investments in the case of BTCS and Wealth. Now we're exiting that investment phase. Which means that our free cash flow conversion is starting to return to historical levels, which we will expect -- which we expect will result in improving ROIC as well. In summary, Broadridge is delivering strong fiscal '23 year results across multiple fronts. Our key operating metrics continue to grow. We made important steps in strengthening key parts of our governance, capital markets and wealth franchises, and we are reaffirming our outlook for another year of consistent financial results backed by improving free cash flow.\nBroadridge is well positioned to drive long-term and sustainable growth. I want to conclude by thanking our associates, many of whom are listening to this call. Our commitment to client service consistently sets us apart with our clients. That is a big testament to the work of our highly engaged associates around the world. They continue to make a difference for our clients and for millions of investors every day. Thank you. And with that, let me turn things over to Edmund.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. Today, I am going to review our Q3 financial performance. I want to provide some additional insights on our rising free cash flow conversion. And I'll outline the drivers of our Q4 growth, which give us confidence in our recurring revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for fiscal '23. Starting with Q3, I am pleased to share the results from another strong quarter, where recurring revenue growth and continued disciplined expense management drove mid-single-digit adjusted EPS growth.\nDespite weaker event-driven revenue in the challenging macroeconomic environment. We continue to see robust organic recurring revenue growth from converting our sales backlog to revenue and healthy position growth. And as you can see from the financial summary on Slide 6, recurring revenue rose to over $1.1 billion, up 9% on a constant currency basis, all organic. Adjusted operating income increased 10% as we lapped elevated investments in fiscal '22 and realize the benefit from targeted cost actions that we initiated in Q4 '22. Both of which more than offset the impact of lower event-driven revenue.\nAOI margins of 21% expanded 60 basis points and adjusted EPS rose 6% to $2.05. And Finally, we delivered closed sales of $62 million, up 8% over Q3 '22. And I'll remind you that while higher interest expense partially offsets the operating income growth, the interest rate impact at the Broadridge level is fully offset by the higher float income in our ICS segment. On taxes, we continue to project an overall tax rate of approximately 21% for fiscal '23. And we'll get into the details of the Q3 results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 7. Recurring revenues grew 9% to $1.1 billion in Q3 '23.\nAnd was at the high end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 9%. Our recurring revenue growth was all organic, again, keeping us on track to exceed our 5% to 7% 3-year growth objective. Let's turn now to Slide 8 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. We continue to see strong growth in both of our segments. ICS recurring revenues grew 11%, all organic to $693 million, with regulatory at 8% and double-digit growth across all other product lines. Continued growth in equity and fund positions underpinned an 8% increase in regulatory revenues to $346 million.\nData-driven Fund Solution revenues increased by 14% to $102 million primarily due to the higher float revenue in our mutual fund trade processing unit. Our issuer revenues grew 25% to $58 million, led by growth in our registered and shareholder disclosure solutions. Finally, we continue to benefit from strong demand in our customer communications business, where recurring revenue rose 10% to $188 million, led by new client wins and higher volumes in print as well as double-digit growth in our higher-margin digital business. Turning to GTO. Recurring revenues grew to $388 million or 7% and driven by new sales revenue and wealth management and strength in our global post-trade products and capital markets.\nCapital markets revenue grew 5% to $246 million propelled by new sales growth and higher fixed income trading volumes, which offset the grow-over impact from higher license revenue in Q3 '22. Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased by 10% to $143 million, led by healthy growth from new sales and professional service fees. As a reminder, license revenues can impact quarterly revenue growth, and we expect a grow-over impact in Q4 for Wealth Management. Looking forward, I have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver GTO full year organic growth within our targeted 5% to 7% range, given our strong results over the past 9 months.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9 for a closer look at volume trends. We had healthy position growth for both equities and funds in the third quarter despite the market volatility. Equity position growth was 10% in the quarter, and growth was driven by continued double-digit growth in managed accounts and while more modest continued growth in self-directed accounts. We are now in the peak period for annual meetings and proxies. And through the end of April, we have received record data for 92% of the proxies that are expected for the year. Physician growth results have consistently been in line with our testing. So this data gives us high confidence in our Q4 estimate. For the full year, we expect equity position growth of approximately 8%. We continue to be encouraged by expanding investor participation in financial markets serving as a long-term tailwind that drives growth in our business.\nMutual fund position growth remained steady at 6% despite outflows from equity and fixed income funds to money market funds, and we anticipate growth in a similar range for Q4 and for the full year. Turning now to trade volumes on the bottom of the slide. Trade volumes grew 1% on the blended basis in Q3. And once again, we saw a difference in asset classes. With increased volatility driving double-digit fixed income volume growth now for 7 consecutive quarters and a modest decline in equity volume growth given the lower activity at our retail wealth management clients. We will be lapping a strong Q4 '22, but we expect full year trading volume growth to be better than our initial guidance and slightly up for the year.\nLet's now move to Slide 10, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenue growth of 9% was all organic and balanced between net new business and internal growth. Revenue from closed sales and our continued high retention from existing customers provided 4 points and internal growth primarily positions, trading volumes and float income contributed 5 points. Foreign exchange impacted recurring revenue by 1 point with the majority of that impact coming in our GTO business, as you can see, in the table on the bottom of the slide.\nI'll finish the discussion on revenue with a view of total revenue on Slide 11. Total revenue grew 7% in Q3 to $1.6 billion including 5 points of growth from recurring revenue. Event-driven revenue was down $7 million and was a modest headwind to growth as we saw continued lower mutual fund proxy activity. I will again highlight that lower mutual fund proxy activity is driven by the timing of fund and ETF board elections, which may be pushed back but are not an optional activity. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we expect activity to remain weaker in Q4 with full year revenue in the $210 million to $220 million range.\nBelow the $240 million to $260 million level that we've seen in recent years. Low the no margin distribution revenues increased by 8% and contributed 3 points to total revenue growth as the higher volumes in customer communications and the impact of postal rate increases more than offset the lower event-driven activity. We continue to expect double-digit distribution revenue growth for the full year and I'll again reiterate that the elevated distribution revenue from postal rate increases and higher customer communications volumes have a dilutive impact on our reported adjusted operating income margin.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin for Q3 was 21%, a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by a combination of operating leverage in our business, higher float income and continued disciplined expense management and the impact of targeted cost actions that we initiated at the end of Q4 '22. Our progress through 3 quarters gives us increased confidence that we will be able to offset inflation and FX impacts and deliver on our margin expansion objective of approximately 50 basis points for fiscal '23.\nLet's move ahead to close sales on Slide 13. Third quarter closed sales were $62 million, up from $57 million in Q3 '22 and bringing our year-to-date total to $156 million, $13 million below Q3 year-to-date $22 million. Over the last 5 years, we have closed on average 46% of our full year sales in the fourth quarter. So meeting our full year close sales objective continues to be heavily dependent on Q4 performance. I'll turn now to cash flow on Slide 14. Q3 '23 free cash flow strengthened to $162 million, up 189% from $56 million in the prior year period.\nFree cash flow conversion over the last 12 months calculated as free cash flow over adjusted net earnings improved 12 points sequentially to 63%, driven by operating cash flow improvement. And this improvement was the product of strong working capital management and most notably, a year-over-year decline in the level of client platform spend consistent with our expectations. Total client platform spend for Q3 '23 was $74 million, a reduction from last year's $114 million.\nThe wealth platform was the primary component of the investment in the quarter and the lower spend demonstrates our progress in completing the testing and development phase of that project. We are clearly managing the investment spend and we now expect to deliver fiscal year '23 free cash flow conversion that is significantly higher than fiscal '22 and we remain confident that we will continue to return to more historical levels of free cash flow conversion in fiscal year '24.\nAnd before moving on from our client platform spin, I'll add that consistent with our prior comments, we are on track to complete the spend on the wealth platform in Q4 '23 and recognized revenue during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. And as Tim said, we've made progress on finalizing a rollout approach that delivers solid economics to Broadridge, and we'll share more on the near-term economics when we finalize the plan with UBS. We continue to have confidence that the operating leverage and the ability to prioritize other investments inherent in our business model will allow us to mitigate the dilutive impact and continue to deliver on our earnings growth objectives.\nLet's now move to Slide 15 to discuss capital allocation. On Slide 15, you see that year-to-date, we've spent $315 million on investments for growth and returned $214 million to shareholders. Our capital allocation model balances investment for growth with capital return to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. And we feel very good that the combination of our earnings growth and free cash flow after lower client platform spend in fiscal year '23 and has us on track to pay down debt and continue to make progress towards the 2.5x leverage ratio objective that we communicated at the time of the Itiviti acquisition.\nNext, let's turn to our updated guidance on Slide 16 and some final thoughts on our fourth quarter. First, we expect to deliver recurring revenue growth at the higher end of our 6% to 9% guidance range. And as always, this guidance reflects a constant currency view. And it's important to note that year-to-date, there is a 1 point 8 point differential between the reported in the constant currency recurring revenue growth. Second, we are reaffirming our adjusted operating income margin expansion guidance of approximately 50 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 11%.\nFinally, on closed sales, we expect to be near the low end of $270 million to $310 million. And I want to reiterate that the delays in the timing of sales have only a very modest impact on our medium-term revenue outlook given our strong sales backlog. Embedded in this full year guidance is a strong Q4 '23, and there are 3 items worth highlighting as the primary drivers of growth in Q4. First, continued conversion of sales to revenue, and I'll emphasize the visibility that the revenue backlog provides. Second, proxy revenue from position growth and as I said earlier, we have strong visibility into this seasonally important quarter, having already received over 92% of record data.\nFinally, significant margin expansion as we grow over discrete growth investments in fiscal '22 and see the impact of targeted cost initiatives that we initiated at the end of Q4 '22. And before I close, I want to quickly address some questions that we've received over the last few weeks about our exposure to regional banks. First, our revenue exposure from the banks that have stopped operating is less than 20 basis points of our $3.7 billion of fiscal '22 recurring revenue.\nRegional banks more broadly make up less than 2% of our overall recurring revenues across the more than 900 client relationships. Finally, the overwhelming majority of our banking operations and deposits are with the systematically important banks is our internal policies prioritize safety of capital. So again, we have very small exposure to these institutions. With that final note, I will close by reiterating my key messages. Broadridge delivered strong Q3 financial results. We are positioned to deliver strong fourth quarter results and more importantly, another strong fiscal year.\nOur updated guidance calls for the higher end of 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth, constant currency, higher margins and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth. We have finalized the wealth platform development and testing or past our peak investment spend and once again, driving strong free cash flow. Allowing us to pay down debt and progress on our investment-grade 2.5 leverage ratio objective. The strength and resiliency of our business and financial model is visible in our performance and as Tim noted, we are poised to deliver against our 3-year growth objectives for the fourth consecutive time. And with that, let's take your questions. Back to you, operator."

(Operator Instructions) Please note the event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibo, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nHead of IR, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Allison and good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese. Before I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders.\nOne, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results.\nAn explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation. With that done, let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nCEO & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThanks, Edings. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to be here to review our strong second quarter performance. I'll start with a quick summary of our results and key headlines followed by a review of our business. I'll close with some thoughts on why my recent client meetings have given me even more confidence that Broadridge remains well positioned to grow even in an uncertain market.\nFirst, on Slide 3, Broader delivered another strong quarter. Recurring revenues rose 8% on a constant currency basis, with strong growth across both our segments. Adjusted EPS rose 11%, driven by the combination of strong growth and disciplined expense management. Second, this performance highlights the strength and resilience of our business. Clearly, the market backdrop remains uneven. Equity markets rose slightly in the quarter, capping off a year of strongly negative returns.\nRates continue to rise. Volatility remained high. Asset managers pulled back on discretionary expenditures and the dollar remained very strong. In the face of this uncertainty, Broadridge's resilient business model with 93% recurring fee revenues continued to perform. Moreover, our long-term business drivers remain healthy. We're benefiting from a strong sales backlog, robust investor participation and significant demand for our digital solutions, which, along with disciplined cost management, are enabling us to drive top and bottom line growth.\nThird, investor participation in particular, remains at very healthy levels. Broadridge benefited from mid- to high single-digit position growth across both funds and equities. And we expect to see further growth ahead in the second half. Fourth, we are executing on our long-term growth initiatives. We're innovating in governance, including pass-through voting, tailored shareholder reports and digital communications, and we continued our strong momentum in capital markets.\nFifth and finally, we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect to deliver 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth, constant currency, expanding margins and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 for review of our results, beginning with our governance or ICS business, which reported another strong quarter. The biggest driver of our 10% growth in ICS continues to be new sales in our Fund Solutions and Customer communications businesses.\nEquity position growth remained strong, driven by double-digit growth in managed accounts and mid-single-digit growth in non-managed accounts. Fund position growth while still healthy, slowed to 6% as investors rotated away from the traditional active strategies into ETFs impasses. Looking ahead to the seasonally larger second half of the year, we expect further growth across both equities and funds.\nDemand for our innovative solutions remains strong as evidenced by significant interest amongst our asset management clients to offer their investors both institutional and retail, choice on how their underlying shares are voted. Just yesterday, we launched a new pilot for individual investors with another leading passive asset manager. And we're in discussions with a number of other fund complexes.\nWe're also continuing to work with our fund clients to develop our future road map for tailored shareholder reports, which will fill a critical need for the industry. Beyond our regulatory products, we're seeing strong demand for digital communications with a second major client signing for our wealth and focused platform during the quarter. This omnichannel product suite offers enhanced investor engagement while delivering near-term cost savings through increased digitization of critical communications. That has proven to be a compelling combination for our customer communications clients.\nWe've been investing steadily in building these capabilities over the past few years, and I'm pleased to see that investment now turning into meaningful revenue with key clients. Turning to capital markets. Recurring revenues rose 12%, driven in part by the continued strong performance of Broadridge Trading and Connectivity Solutions, or BTCS, where our market share gains are driving growth. I was also pleased to see cross-selling start to contribute to new sales as well as we won a new client in the quarter that has long been targeted by BTCS, and that made the decision to switch now based on their trust in Broadridge.\nOur other capital markets products also performed well as our themes of simplifying globally, front to back and within the front office are resonating with clients. We also continue to see progress in digital ledger repo with a strong pipeline of discussions with new institutions. Wealth and Investment Management declined year-over-year as positive core growth was offset by lower license revenue.\nWe continue to hit key wealth management platform milestones. UBS advisers are transitioning under the latest generation of our workstation with continued very positive feedback. We've now completed development of all 29 platform areas and testing for 26 to 29. We are working closely with the new management at UBS as they refine their approach to rolling out the remainder of the platform and we continue to expect to begin to recognize revenue in mid-calendar '23.\nOur sales pipeline is strong. And as Edmund will discuss, our investment levels have decreased as we shift into this new phase. Moving to close sales. Year-to-date closed sales were $94 million. Client engagement around our next-generation technology remains high, and our pipeline entering calendar '23 is stronger than it ever has been. As a result, our sales expectations for fiscal '23 are unchanged. I'll close my remarks on Slide 5.\nOver the past several weeks, I have met with more than 30 CEO and C-suite clients in North America and Europe. The message from them is clear. They are continuing to push our next-generation technology. They are looking for long-term partners that invest in their business, and they like a componentized approach that creates value along the way. These critical needs are strongly aligned with our strategy and direction. And I'm confident that Broadridge is well positioned for growth in a market that remains uncertain.\nThat confidence starts with our strong market positions across all 3 of our franchises based on mission-critical infrastructure we provide that enables corporate governance and power trading and investing and is coupled with our strong track record of innovation and client service. We've invested to bring more value to clients and to meet their need for next-generation technology by building or acquiring critical solutions and adding talent and technology. These investments are playing a key role in driving the strong revenue growth we reported today, and we expect to see over the balance of the year.\nImportantly, we're innovating. As we talked about today, we're continuing to deliver new governance solutions. Our digital communications capabilities are gaining traction in the market. Our BTCS business is helping to drive the growth of our capital markets franchise, and we continue to progress wealth and investment management. By aligning with the long-term needs of our clients, we're attracting a $60 billion market opportunity, and we're scaling into a global fintech leader.\nIn an uncertain market, our resilient business model driven by recurring revenue, client focus and a long track record of disciplined expense management gives us the visibility and confidence to deliver for shareholders. As a result, we're reaffirming our full year guidance for 6% to 9% constant currency recurring revenue growth and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth. And in turn, we expect to deliver at or above the higher end of our 3-year objectives. When we do that, it will be the fourth consecutive 3-year period in which we've delivered on our objectives.\nFinally, we're past the peak investment period in our platform solutions. Positioning us to begin to return to a more historical strong free cash flow conversion and giving us additional flexibility to drive returns for our shareholders. In sum, Broadridge is delivering on the growth plan we shared at our last Investor Day. I want to close by thanking our associates. The work Broadridge does is important and makes a difference for millions of investors.\nNone of it will be possible without our associates' talent, knowledge and effort which enables us to deliver exceptional products and service at scale for our clients and for our clients' clients. So thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Edwin for a review of our financials.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim. And good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share the results from another strong quarter where recurring revenue growth and continued disciplined expense management drove double-digit adjusted EPS growth even in the challenging macroeconomic environment. We continue to see organic recurring revenue growth from converting our sales backlog to revenue and healthy position growth.\nThis performance in Q2 and the continued execution of our strategy gives us the confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance. As you can see from the financial summary on Slide 6, recurring revenues rose to $840 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis, all organic. Adjusted operating income increased 23% as we lapped elevated investment in fiscal '22 and realize the benefit from targeted cost actions that we initiated in Q4 '22, both of which more than offset the impact of the lower event-driven revenue.\nAOI margins of 13.4% expanded 220 basis points, and adjusted EPS rose 11% to $0.91. Finally, we delivered closed sales of $65 million. I'll note that the operating income growth is being offset by lower discrete tax items in Q2 '23 and interest rates. On taxes, we continue to project an overall tax rate of 21% for fiscal '23.\nAnd I'll remind you that while higher interest expense partially offsets operating income growth, the interest rate impact at the Broadridge level is fully offset by higher float income in our ICS segment. Let's give in the details of Q2 results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 7. Recurring revenue grew 8% to $840 million in Q2 '23, marking a second consecutive quarter near the higher end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 9%. Our recurring revenue growth was all organic, again, keeping us on track to exceed our 5% to 7% 3-year growth objective.\nLet's turn now to Slide 8 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. We continue to see growth in both of our segments. ICS recurring revenues grew 10%, all organic to $467 million, with regulatory at 9% and double-digit growth across all other product lines. The 9% increase to $181 million in regulatory revenue was driven by continued growth in equity and fund positions. Data-Driven Fund Solutions revenue grew 11% to $96 million, propelled by revenue from sales in our data and analytics products and higher float revenue in our mutual fund trade processing unit.\nOur Issuer business revenue increased 12% to $27 million, led by growth in our registered shareholder solutions. Finally, we continue to benefit from strong demand in our Customer Communications business where recurring revenues rose 11% to $163 million, driven by new client wins in print and growth in our higher-margin digital business.\nTurning to GTO. Recurring revenues grew to $373 million or 6%, driven by new sales and continued strength in our capital markets, including BTCS, Capital Markets revenues grew 12% to $235 million, again propelled by strong growth from BTCS, new sales and higher fixed income trading volumes.\nWealth and Investment Management revenues declined by 3% to $138 million. Growth from sales was offset by a decline in license revenue as we grew over a large client renewal from Q2 '22. As a reminder, license revenues can impact quarterly revenue growth, and we expect to grow over impact in Q3 for Capital Markets and in Q4 for Wealth Management. Looking forward, we expect GTO full year organic growth to be within our targeted 5% to 7% range.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 for a closer look at volume trends.\nWe had solid position growth for both equities and funds. As you can see by our results, investor participation in financial markets has remained steady despite market volatility. And we continue to be encouraged by this long-term tailwind. Equity position growth of 9% was driven by continued double-digit growth in managed accounts. Looking to the seasonally larger second half our testing continues to show mid-single-digit growth. And with those results, we continue to expect equity position growth in the mid- to high single-digit range for the full year.\nMutual fund position growth moderated from Q1 '23 levels, but still grew 6%, largely driven by the growth in passive funds. We expect to see continued mid-single-digit growth in the second half. Turning now to trade volumes on the bottom of the slide. Trade volumes grew 5% on a blended basis in Q2 driven by double-digit fixed income volume growth and modest equity volume growth as continued higher trading by institutional investors more than offset the lower activity at our retail wealth management clients. As we lap a strong Q4 '22, we continue to expect full year trading volume growth to be essentially flat for the year.\nLet's now move to Slide 10, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenue growth of 8% was all organic. And this organic growth was balanced between net new business and internal growth. Revenue from closed sales and our continued high retention from existing customers contributed 4 points and internal growth primarily positioned growth in trading volumes also contributed 4 points. Foreign exchange impacted recurring revenue by 2 points with the bulk of that impact coming in our GTO business, as you can see in the table on the bottom of the slide.\nI'll finish the discussion on revenue with a view of total revenue on Slide 11. Total revenue grew 3% in Q2 to $1.3 billion, with recurring revenue being the largest contributor driving 4 points of growth. Event-driven revenue was down $27 million from the prior year and was a headwind of 2 points as mutual fund proxy activity slowed to a historically low level, the lower mutual fund proxy activity is driven by the timing of fund and ETF board elections as funds reacted to the combination of weaker markets and record withdrawals. Board elections for these funds may be pushed back from time to time, but they are not an optional activity and over the long term, event-driven revenue will grow in line with fund and ETF position growth.\nLooking ahead to the second half of fiscal '23, we expect the combination of higher contest activity and lower mutual fund activity will have us trending towards the low end of the $240 million to $260 million range that we've seen in recent years. Low to no margin distribution revenues increased by 3% and contributed 1 point to total revenue growth as the higher volumes in customer communications and the impact of the July postal rate increases offset lower event-driven activity.\nWe continue to expect double-digit distribution revenue growth for the full year. And I'll reiterate that the elevated distribution revenue from July and January postal rate increases and higher customer communications volumes have a dilutive impact on our reported adjusted operating income margin.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin for Q2 '23 was 13.4%, a 220 basis points improvement over Q2 '22 and driven by the operating leverage in our business. Higher float income, continued disciplined expense management and the impact of targeted cost actions that we initiated at the end of Q4 '22. Our progress through Q2 gives us increased confidence that we will be able to offset inflation and FX impacts and deliver on our margin expansion objective of approximately 50 basis points for fiscal '23.\nLet's move ahead to closed sales on Slide 13. Second quarter closed sales of $65 million which brings our year-to-date total to $94 million, that's 16% off of H1 '22. Strong ICS sales in the quarter were powered by the large digital wealth and focused sales that Tim mentioned earlier. As a reminder, closed sales are historically weighted towards the fourth quarter. And given our robust pipeline, we remain on track to achieve our full year closed sales guidance of between $270 million to $310 million.\nI'll turn now to cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 14. I'll start with a reminder that Broadridge's cash flow generation is typically negative in the fiscal first quarter and strengthens over the course of the year. And we're seeing that trend play out again this year.\nQ2 '23 free cash flow improved to $104 million, up 276% from $28 million last year. Free cash flow conversion calculated as free cash flow over adjusted net earnings was up 10 points over last year to 51% driven by operating cash flow improvement. This improvement was the product of higher earnings, strong working capital management and most notably, a year-over-year and sequential decline in the level of client platform spend as we expected.\nTotal client platform spent for Q2 '23 was $78 million, a reduction from last year's $154 million and less than half of the Q1 '23 level of $163 million. The wealth platform accounted for the majority of the investment in the quarter and the lower spend is a strong indicator of our progress in completing the development of that project. As we remain on track to recognize revenue on the wealth platform in mid calendar '23, we expect client platform spending to continue to be lower than last year.\nKeeping us on track to deliver free cash flow conversion that is higher than fiscal '22. We remain confident that we will return to more historical levels of free cash flow conversion in fiscal year '24.\nOn Slide 15, you see that the client platform spend is our most significant use of cash and that we continue to return capital to our shareholders through the dividend.\nLet's turn now to Slide 16 to review our fiscal year '23 guidance, followed by some final thoughts on the second quarter results.\nWe are reaffirming our full year guidance on all of our key financial metrics. We continue to expect 6% to 9% constant currency recurring revenue growth driven by healthy growth across ICS and GTO. Approximately 50 basis points of adjusted operating income margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth in the 7% to 11% range and closed sales between $270 million to $310 million. And before I move on from guidance, let me briefly discuss our second half outlook, which is embedded in that full year guidance.\nWe expect Q3 adjusted EPS growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range as the impact of continued recurring revenue growth is partially offset by lower capital markets license revenue. We expect adjusted EPS growth to be higher in the seasonally larger fourth quarter as we recognize the benefit of growth in our proxy business and the timing of investments.\nFinally, let me reiterate my key messages. Broadridge delivered strong Q2 financial results. Demand for our mission-critical technology is strong, and our testing is showing continued equity and fund position growth in a seasonally larger second half of the fiscal year.\nWe are now past the peak period of investment and again, driving strong free cash flow in Q2 '23, and we continue to expect our client platform spend to be lower than last year, resulting in improved free cash flow conversion in fiscal '23 and a return to a more historical conversion level in fiscal '24. We have a resilient business and financial model with a proven track record of performance through the economic cycle when we are reaffirming our fiscal year '23 guidance. With that, let's take your questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) And please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nHead of IR, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cole. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to Broadridge's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2023 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese. Before I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. One, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. Two, we'll also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.\nAdditionally, on September 26, we filed an 8-K announcing changes to our segment reporting regarding the impact of foreign exchange rates on our business. This change is the final step in aligning our foreign currency reporting with industry standards and is reflected in our first quarter report. From this point forward, our earnings materials were referenced recurring revenue growth percentages on a constant currency basis, both for our results and our forward-looking guidance. Please reference our filings and investor materials for the corresponding reconciliations.\nWith that out of the way, let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nCEO & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nEdings, thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. I am pleased to be here to discuss our strong start to fiscal '23. There's a lot to cover. So I'll walk through our strong results for the quarter, provide a business overview and then share some thoughts on why Broadridge is well positioned to drive profitable growth over the balance of fiscal '23 and beyond.\nBefore I start, I think it's helpful to provide some context given the volatile conditions the market and economy are experiencing. Despite market declines, we have seen continued growth in investor positions. Given our forward testing, we have visibility about 6 months ahead, which puts us well into the busy part of proxy season, and we see continued solid growth in investor positions over that period. Our conversations with our large broker-dealer and asset manager clients also continue to be positive as our clients continue to drive to modernize their technology.\nWith that as a backdrop, let's start with our strong results. Recurring revenues rose 9% on a constant currency basis, with strong growth across both our segments. Adjusted EPS was $0.84, down year-over-year, but modestly ahead of our expectations. All in all, a strong start to the year.\nSecond, as I mentioned, demand for our solutions remains strong. We continue to benefit from increasing investor participation, which is fueling very healthy stock record growth. After a record sales year in fiscal '22, we're off to a good start to fiscal '23, keeping us on track to deliver on our closed sales guidance.\nThird, we continue to drive long-term growth across our 3 franchises. In governance, we're enabling increasing shareholder engagement for our fund clients. In capital markets, we're delivering on trading innovation and global simplification. And in wealth, we're seeing a growing pipeline for a powerful suite of modular solutions.\nFourth, remember that our fiscal year extends 6 months into calendar '23. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for that full period, including 6% to 9% constant currency recurring revenue growth, continued margin expansion and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth. That puts us on track to deliver at or above the higher end of our growth objectives for the 3-year period ending next June. When we do, it will be the fourth consecutive 3-year period covering 12 years in total that we've delivered on our recurring revenue and adjusted EPS objectives.\nFifth and last, we remain well-positioned to deliver continued growth in the years ahead even as the economy faces growing uncertainty. Providing mission-critical services that power investing in governance positions us to deliver resilient growth through the ups and downs of the financial cycle. Our visibility into position growth and our $430 million backlog gives us confidence in our outlook for this year, and our investments which are attracting growing interest from clients, positioned Broadridge to deliver increasing returns and long-term growth well into the future.\nNow let's turn to Slide 4 for an update on our business. I'll begin with our ICS or governance business, which had another strong quarter. The biggest driver of that growth was new sales, especially in our Fund Solutions and Customer Communications businesses. Position growth remains robust despite market headwinds, rising 9% for equities in the smallest quarter for equity proxies and 11% for funds. This growth is being driven by continued activity in managed accounts on the equity side and by continued strong demand for passive investments on the fund side.\nBeyond the first quarter, we're now seeing increasing visibility into position growth for the seasonally more meaningful second half of our fiscal year, and the outlook remains very healthy.\nAs you know, we continue to drive innovation and governance, especially around digital solutions. Last year, we rolled out end-to-end vote confirmation for nearly 3,000 public companies. We pioneered pass-through voting for funds, updated our proxy vote app and delivered nearly 2,500 virtual shareholder meetings. This year, we're continuing to innovate. Last month, Charles Schwab announced it is leveraging our network capability to query a sample of retail shareholders to help guide Schwab's voting and select Schwab funds and ETFs. We're seeing similar interest in pass-through voting, including for retail fund shareholders from several of our largest asset management clients.\nBeyond our regulatory solutions, we saw growth across our other product lines. Customer Communications revenue rose 11%, driven by both print and digital. One digital contributor was the launch of our omnichannel wealth and focused solution with Cetera. Today, wealth clients may receive as many as 120 communications a year from their wealth manager.\nWealth and focus consolidates the critical information across various client and regulatory communications. Creating a single simple communication simplifies the investor experience while providing advisers with new communications opportunities, all at lower cost. Following our early rollout, nearly 90% of participants prefer the new solution. It's an exciting example of how our digital capabilities are creating increased engagement at lower cost.\nBefore I leave our governance business, I want to update you on a new SEC regulation on tailored shareholder reports for funds and ETF that was announced last week. Many of you recall, we first highlighted this regulation when it was initially proposed in August 2020, and we've been providing occasional updates since. The SEC voted 5-0 last week to implement a measure that replaces the existing long-form annual and semiannual reports with a shorter 2- to 3-page summary document.\nThe SEC is aiming to use these shorter reports to provide key information in a more digestible format to keep investors better informed and more engaged at lower cost than long-form reports. We're still studying the full implications of the new rule, but let me offer some thoughts. There is no question that the shorter reports will create a better investor experience overall and especially for digital delivery. They will also create a path to even further digitization, which, as you know, is currently about 80%. Long term, that's positive for funds and for Broadridge.\nOn the other hand, our fund clients are concerned about the cost and complexity of the new rule because they'll have to compose both long-form and short-form reports. And we estimate the impact on Broadridge, assuming no offset from new services would be a $30 million reduction in recurring revenue phasing in over our fiscal '25 and '26. Just as we did with 30e-3 which also had its complexities, we will work with our clients to create a cost-effective industry solution, which will be good for investors and good for funds.\nMoving to capital markets. Revenues rose 14% constant currency, driven by strong growth from Broadridge trading and connectivity solutions and from new sales. BTCS continues to perform well. with strong sales and very positive client conversations about simplifying global trading and longer term, driving front to back. We also saw strong growth in the rest of our capital markets business powered by new sales and increased fixed income trading. We achieved a key milestone with the implementation of our next-gen global post-trade platform across the North American fixed income operations of a major U.S.-based bank, and we've already begun the next phase, which will extend to unified global equities and fixed income.\nTurning to Wealth Management. Revenues rose 5%, driven by revenue from new sales. I'm pleased to report that our wealth sales pipeline is growing substantially, up 25% year-on-year as we begin to bring to market completed modular solutions from our new wealth platform. We're now demoing live solutions to our clients, which is creating a much deeper level of engagement, and we're seeing real client interest. We're confident that our sales of module solutions from the new platform are on track to meaningfully contribute to our FY '23 closed sales with an even bigger impact in FY '24.\nThese modular solutions are part of the broader wealth platform we're creating with UBS as an anchor client, and UBS has been a fantastic partner. We're now making very exciting progress in that broader solution. We're development complete on 26 of our 29 platform areas, with the remaining 3 to be complete this month.\nOn the testing side, we're completing the fourth of 5 integrated testing cycles with integration testing largely complete by the end of the calendar year. So it's great progress that keeps us on track for full rollout. And as Edmund will outline, we are now through the peak of our investment in this key program.\nWith that, let me take a step back and put our growth strategy in context. The parts of wealth management technology and operations that we touch are a $16 billion addressable market and wealth managers face a pressing need to modernize and digitize through operations.\nWe expect that the wealth management platform and the suite of module solutions we are building, will put Broadridge in position to be a leading provider in the growing wealth space for the next decade and beyond. That position taken together with the benefits we're already seeing to our product and technology capability across Broadridge should strengthen our ability to build an increasingly strong, profitable and high-return business going forward.\nI'll close my remarks on Slide 5. As we move from more uncertain macroeconomic outlook, Broadridge's resilience becomes an even greater strength. Demand for the critical services we provide has remained strong, giving us confidence in this year, are forward-looking to investor participation in the next 6 months and our $430 million backlog gives us good visibility. As a result, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '23 and will deliver at the high end of our 3-year objectives. Longer term, we're serving a $60 billion market with growth driven by long-term secular trends.\nFinTech innovation is forcing banks to digitize and innovations like managed accounts, 0 commission trading, direct indexing and pass-through voting are continuing to drive investor participation. As our clients seek to reduce costs partly in response to macroeconomic trends, their need for Broadridge's low-cost platform solutions increases.\nThird, we've built a strong and resilient business model, focusing on recurring revenues and sustained growth. Excluding our distribution revenues, fully 93% of our revenues are recurring, covered by multiyear contracts across all 3 of our franchises. This revenue is supported by our long history of putting our clients first, which has driven a 98% revenue retention rate. At the same time, growth enables us to drive scale efficiencies, compelling our margins and funding additional investments to help drive additional growth going forward.\nFourth, as we look beyond fiscal '23, the investments we have made and are making in our digital capabilities and our wealth and other technology platforms and extending our capital markets business leave us better positioned than ever to drive long-term profitable growth with increasing returns through this cycle and beyond.\nFinally, to support this long-term growth, we are also driving forward on sustainability. We recently released our latest sustainability report highlighting our commitment to drive sustainable growth, engage our talent and diverse associates and reduce our and our clients' emissions. I encourage you to go to our site and review our progress.\nBefore I turn the call over to Edmund, let me take a moment to thank our associates. None of what we do is easy and none of it would be possible without their focus on clients, on creating the future and on delivering results today. Thank you.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Edmund to review our financials. Edmund?\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here to discuss the results from another strong quarter, where both top line growth and earnings were modestly ahead of our expectations. Though a seasonally small quarter, our first quarter results represent a strong start to the year and continued conversion of our sales backlog to revenue, our outlook for continued robust demand trends and the operating leverage, coupled with our disciplined expense management and the challenging macroeconomic environment gives us the confidence to reaffirm our fiscal '23 guidance.\nAs you can see from the financial summary on Slide 6, recurring revenues rose to $806 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis, all organic. Adjusted operating income decreased 15%, driven by lower event-driven revenue and carryover impact of investments we made last year.\nAOI margins of 11.7% were also impacted by the continued drag from higher distribution revenues and adjusted EPS was $0.84. Finally, and as Tim noted, we delivered closed sales of $29 million. Our first quarter results benefited from strong position growth across both equities and funds and continued strength from BTCS. I'll also note that while higher interest rates offset operating income, the interest rate impact to Broadridge is offset by higher float income in our ICS segment.\nLet's get into the details of these results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 7. Recurring revenues grew to $806 million in Q1 '23 or 9% coming in at the top end of our full year guidance range of 6% to 9%. Our recurring revenue growth was all organic, again, keeping us on track to exceed our 5% to 7% 3-year growth objective.\nLet's now turn to Slide 8 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. We continue to see strong growth in both of our segments. ICS recurring revenue grew to $443 million or 9% with double-digit growth across 3 of our product lines.\nRegulatory revenues rose 4% and were driven by strong fund position growth. Proxy revenue growth was impacted by the timing of certain annual meetings which can have a disproportionate impact in what is seasonally our smallest quarter for proxies. More importantly, equity position growth of 9% remains strong and in line with our expectations as I'll detail in a moment.\nData-driven fund solutions grew 13%, driven by new client wins across our mutual fund trade processing and our data and analytics business as well as the impact of higher interest rates on our float income. Our issuer business increased by 16% as we continue to see growth in our disclosure products. And finally, our customer communications business grew by 11% driven by continued demand for print and high single-digit digital growth.\nTurning to GTO. Recurring revenues grew to $363 million or 10% driven by continued strength in capital markets, including BTCS, and revenue from sales and wealth management.\nCapital Markets revenue grew 14%, propelled by strong growth from BTCS, new sales and higher fixed income trading volumes. BTCS revenue growth benefited from the removal of the deferred revenue haircut, excluding that impact. BTCS revenues grew at a high single-digit rate. Wealth and Investment Management grew by 5%, driven by revenue from new sales.\nLooking forward to Q2, we expect continued strong revenue growth from sales in Wealth Management to be offset by growing over an uptick in fiscal '22 license revenues from large client renewals.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 for a closer look at volume trends. As you can see by our results, investor participation in financial markets has continued to increase despite the market volatility. Q1 '23 position growth was strong across both equities and funds. Equity position growth was 9% on the back of double-digit growth in managed accounts and mid-single-digit growth at self-directed accounts. Our testing of position growth continues to prove reliable as Q1 was in line with our July testing.\nWe have now extended our testing into the seasonally critical second half of the year, and those results are giving us increased confidence in our forecast from mid- to high single-digit growth for the full year. Mutual fund position growth has also been consistently strong, reaching 11% driven by growth in passive funds.\nAnd turning the trade volumes on the bottom of the slide, trade volumes grew 6% on a blended basis in Q1, driven by a fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in fixed income volumes. Equity volumes were flat as higher trading by institutional investors more than offset the lower activity at our retail wealth management clients.\nLet's now move to Slide 10, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenue growth was all organic. Organic growth was balanced between net new business contributing 5 points and internal growth, primarily volume and expanding our relationships with existing clients also contributing 5 points.\nOur recurring revenue retention rate remained at 98%. Foreign exchange impacted recurring revenue by 2%, with the bulk of that impact coming in our GTO business, as you can see on the table at the bottom of the slide.\nI'll finish the discussion on revenue with a view of total revenue on Slide 11. Total revenue grew 8% in Q1 to $1.3 billion. Recurring revenue was the largest contributor, driving 6 points of growth. Low to no margin distribution revenue increased by 13%, consistent with our outlook for low double-digit growth and it contributed 4 points to total revenue. We continue to see higher volumes in our customer communications business as well as the impact of another postal rate increase in July.\nElevated growth in distribution revenue and the mix of distribution revenue from customer communications continues to have a dilutive impact on our reported adjusted operating income margin, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly. Event-driven revenues were above our 7-year quarterly average and reached $63 million, $14 million lower than an unusually high Q1 '22.\nWe continue to expect full year event-driven revenue to be in the $240 million to $260 million range, in line with recent years. Changes in FX lowered reported revenues by 1 point.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 12. Adjusted operating income margin was down 310 basis points from prior year to 11.7% in Q1. The positive impact of strong incremental margin on recurring revenue growth was offset by 3 items: first, elevated low to no margin distribution revenue. For the full year, we expect 45 to 50 basis points impact on adjusted operating income margin with no impact on adjusted EPS. Second, rate inflation on our material expense, which we passed through at a 1- to 2-month lag. And finally, the carryover impact of investments that we began in fiscal '22. As we enter the second quarter, we expect to see increased margin expansion from the targeted cost initiatives that we initiated in Q4 '22. These actions along with the operating leverage inherent in our business model, give us confidence that we will meet our earnings growth objectives even in this period of macroeconomic uncertainty.\nLet's move ahead to closed sales on Slide 13. Closed sales of $29 million were essentially flat year-over-year. We were encouraged to see strong closed sales across both ICS and GTO with strong contribution from BTCS. And as Tim noted, our pipeline remains strong, and we remain confident in our full year closed sales guidance of between $270 million to $310 million.\nI'll now turn to cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 14. I'll start with a reminder that Broadridge's cash flow generation is typically negative in the fiscal first quarter and strengthened throughout the year. Q1 '23 free cash flow was negative $218 million, down from negative $151 million last year. Total client platform spend for Q1 '23 was $163 million with the wealth platform accounting for the most significant part of that investment. We expect client platform investment to decline for the balance of fiscal '23.\nAnd for the full year, we expect client platform investment to be lower than our fiscal '22 peak year of investment. We project fiscal year '23 free cash flow conversion to be higher than fiscal year '22 and will return to more historical levels in fiscal year '24.\nGiven the significance of the wealth platform investment and the importance to our franchise growth, I want to share some additional insight on the impact to Broadridge margins and earnings growth as well as the expected return on investment. As Tim noted, our progress on the platform is strong, and we continue to expect to go live in mid-calendar '23. As we previously discussed, we expect to begin to recognize revenue and amortize the investment spend when the platform goes live.\nBased on the existing and in-flight client agreements, we project average annualized revenue to be approximately $100 million, with average amortization cost per year of approximately $65 million. The addition of the servicing and infrastructure costs will make the initial platform rollout modestly dilutive to Broadridge AOI margins. We are confident that the operating leverage and ability to prioritize other investments inherent in our business model will allow us to mitigate this dilution and continue to deliver on our earnings growth objectives.\nBeyond the agreements noted above and as Tim noted, our pipeline for wealth management sales is strong and growing, giving us confidence that we will bring on $20 million to $30 million in new wealth sales per year at accretive incremental margins. Together, we expect the combination of existing clients in new sales will drive a return on invested capital that is higher than our cost of capital and along with the continued performance in our core business, drive Broadridge ROIC to mid- to high teens within our next 3-year performance period.\nLet's now turn to Slide 15 to review our fiscal '23 guidance, followed by some final thoughts on our first quarter results. We are reaffirming our full year guidance on all of our key financial metrics. We continue to expect 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth, approximately 50 basis points of adjusted operating income margin expansion, adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 11% and closed sales of between $270 million to $310 million.\nAdditionally, we expect approximately 75% of our earnings to be generated in the second half of the year, with 25% in the first half, in line with our performance over the last 10 years. As a reminder, our fiscal '23 guidance extends into the first half of calendar year 2023. Despite a challenging macro environment, we have confidence in our guidance given the visibility into our forward-looking recurring revenue. Our fiscal '23 recurring revenue growth will be driven by our strong sales backlog, which was $430 million at the end of fiscal '22. And by our equity and fund position growth, where our latest testing supports mid- to high single-digit position growth.\nAnd as I noted earlier, the inherent operating leverage in our business and the targeted cost initiatives that we initiated at the end of last year will help us meet our earnings objectives.\nFinally, let me reiterate my key messages. Broadridge delivered strong Q1 financial results. Demand for our services remains strong and our testing is showing continued equity and fund position growth into the second half of the fiscal year.\nWe expect our capital investment to decline improved free cash flow conversion in fiscal '23 and to return to more historical free cash flow conversion levels in fiscal '24. We have a resilient business and financial model that performs through the economic cycle, and we are confident in reaffirming our fiscal year '23 guidance.\nWith that, let's take your questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Eddings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nHead of IR, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Broadridge's Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. We will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. We will also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nCEO & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Eddings, and good morning to everyone joining us.\nI'm pleased to update you on Broadridge's strong fourth quarter and full year performance for fiscal '22 as well as our positive outlook for fiscal '23. This performance is driven by strong execution, positive underlying trends and our acquisition of Itiviti, which exceeded our expectations in year 1. We expect this strong performance to continue into fiscal '23 and beyond. I'll provide an overview, and Edmund will take us through the key details.\nBefore turning to our results, a note about what we are seeing from our unique position at the center of the equities, fixed income and fund markets. Despite the uncertainty and market pullback in the quarter ending in June, investors continue to be engaged and position growth remains robust. Our broker and asset management clients continue to face the imperative for digitizing their business. At the same time, they face regulatory change greater than any time since the global financial crisis. Our conversations with clients, both in North America and globally, remain very active as they pursue industry solutions for common needs and digital innovation for areas where they seek to differentiate.\nWith that background, let's move to an overview of our results, which highlight the strength and resilience of our business model. First, Broadridge closed the year on a very strong note. Fourth quarter recurring revenues rose 15%, driven by exceptional 12% organic growth. Adjusted EPS rose 21% to $2.65.\nSecond, these results were the capstone on a very strong year. For the full year, recurring revenues rose 16%, driving higher margins, and after accounting for higher interest expense, adjusted EPS growth of 14%. We also delivered an 11th consecutive year of record closed ssales, up more than 20%.\nThird, our growth is powered by execution against strong underlying market trends, including increased investor participation and diversification and the digitization of financial services as well as the successful integration and strong performance of our Itiviti acquisition.\nFourth, we continue to drive balanced capital allocation as a core part of our long-term value creation algorithm. We continue to invest in modern, scalable technology platforms. And yesterday, our Board approved a 13% increase in our annual dividend. Broadridge has increased its dividend every year since becoming an independent company, with double-digit increases in 9 of the last 10 years. It's a testament to our execution, the strength and resilience of our business model, and, of course, the long-term trends driving our growth.\nFifth and last, our outlook for fiscal '23 is positive. Our business model is built to deliver growth to all economic cycles. Our fiscal '23 guidance calls for a strong 6% to 9% organic recurring revenue growth. This will drive double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth. We also expect another year of very strong sales.\nThe combination of excellent fiscal '21 and '22 results, coupled with a strong fiscal '23 outlook, has Broadridge well positioned to deliver at or above the higher end of our 3-year Investor Day objectives for the period that ends next June. That will mark the third successive 3-year period in which we've delivered on our objectives.\nTo build on those highlights, let's turn to a review of our execution against the 3 key opportunities that are driving our growth. First, extending our governance business by driving digital engagement; second, leveraging our acquisition of Itiviti to grow our capital business -- capital markets business; and third, building on our wealth franchise by delivering on the capabilities that make up our open wealth platform. I'll touch on each of these initiatives as I review our businesses, starting with governance on Slide 4.\nOur ICS business delivered another very strong year as recurring revenue growth of 11% was powered by a combination of increased investor participation and revenue from new sales. Investor participation continued to grow at a very healthy pace in fiscal '22. Equity position growth remained well above trend at 18% for the year, and we benefited from increasing investor participation on the fund side as well, with mutual fund and ETF record growth of 14%.\nWe remain positive on the trends driving long-term investor participation and diversification growth, and we see this growth normalizing in the mid- to high single-digit range in fiscal '23 and beyond as market appreciation slows and we lap the benefit from 0 commission trading.\nImportantly, we're delivering increased digitization across our regulatory business. For proxies, digitization rose to 86% from 81% 2 years ago. For funds, digitization rose to 78% from 69% 2 years ago. When you apply that change across some 2.2 billion shareholder communications, you can see that Broadridge generated tens of millions of incremental savings for issuers and funds while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nNew sales was the other big driver of growth as our focus on innovation is increasing shareholder and client engagement across the full governance network from broker-dealers and wealth managers to public companies, to funds, to end investors.\nFor example, for our broker-dealer clients, we instituted end-to-end vote confirmation for nearly 3,000 public companies and are rolling out universal proxy functionality this month. For fund companies, we're helping the world's largest fund managers launch pass-through voting. We launched a new cloud-based European funds reporting platform, and we're growing our data and analytics solutions.\nFor issuers, we rolled out an upgraded virtual shareholder meeting platform across more than 2,500 annual meetings, making it easier than ever for investors to participate. We also upgraded our proxy vote app, enabling deeper investor engagement.\nFinally, our continued focus on digitizing customer communications enabled us to close a landmark deal to serve as the core digital communications infrastructure for a Tier 1 wealth manager while continuing to onboard and serve a growing roster of new clients. These innovations helped drive strong revenue growth and led to what's clearly another strong year for our governance franchise.\nNow let's move to our capital markets franchise where the acquisition of Itiviti is helping to transform our position in the market. In capital markets, we're driving trading innovation, simplifying global post-trade technology and building new enterprise data and network-enabled solutions. Itiviti's leading front-office capabilities have meaningfully extended our franchise, deepening our relationships with key clients. Capital markets revenues rose 39% to $921 million, primarily driven by our acquisition of Itiviti, on which I will touch in a moment.\nIn the meantime, despite our focus on the acquisition, we drove organic growth of 5%. The biggest factor in organic growth was revenue from new sales as we onboarded multiple new clients to our global post-trade platform. It's great to see our platform investments converting to revenue growth.\nWe're also developing enterprise and network solutions. Our digital ledger repo solution is now live with 3 clients, with a fourth signed and others in the pipeline. Our production volume is now averaging more than $50 billion a day, and we expect that will climb further by year-end. Today, our clients are using digital ledger repo to process intracompany transactions and reduce external counterparty expense. We're further enhancing our capabilities in early fiscal '23 to include sponsored repos. While the revenue from this business remains small today, the pipeline is strong, and we see a long runway for future growth.\nAnother key network initiative is LTX, our fixed income trading platform, where we continue to make steady progress towards a full launch.\nThe biggest growth initiative in capital markets this past year has been the acquisition of Itiviti, which is delivering even more value than we first anticipated. So let's turn to Slide 6 for a double-click on the performance of that business.\nI'm pleased to report that the integration is going very well. We are near completion on most streams. We're driving revenue and cost synergies, and we strengthened and deepened the management team. We've also officially rebranded the business, Broadridge Trading and Connectivity Solutions, or BTCS.\nWhen we announced the acquisition last spring, we highlighted 3 key drivers for why we thought this is a strong fit and will generate significant value for our shareholders. A year later, these drivers have only been reinforced. The first driver was the compelling strategic fit with our capital markets franchise.\nWe expected that the combination of Itiviti's front office and connectivity solutions with our back-office capabilities would give us an unmatched ability to add value across the trade life cycle. That thesis is playing out, and we're in dialogues with multiple clients to increasingly see Broadridge as a critical partner in a multiyear process of modernizing their trading infrastructure. We're also well into developing the capability to enable common data sets across the trade life cycle, which will be a significant benefit for many clients.\nOur second driver was to use our expanded global scale and footprint to unlock additional growth. A year later, our international revenues have grown by more than 60%, enabling us to strengthen our position in both Europe and Asia Pacific. Clients see us as an increasingly global player, and Itiviti clients are seeing the benefit of being partnered with a larger player, especially one with a reputation for investment and service.\nLast, Itiviti is delivering clear financial benefits. Fiscal '22 revenues came in ahead of our acquisition case at $256 million, and we exceeded our earnings target. We've actioned almost $10 million in synergies, including $3 million of revenue synergies and $6 million on the cost side. Our incremental scale helped fuel more than $30 million in closed ssales, with multiple competitive wins in fiscal '22. Thanks to those sales, we are on target to deliver double-digit growth in fiscal '23 and beyond.\nSo we're off to a strong start in realizing Itiviti's potential. Looking ahead, we have a clear road map for continued growth, driving share gains in the near term, executing on revenue synergies in the medium term and over the long term, driving a suite of modular solutions covering the entire front-to-back trade life cycle.\nNow let's turn to Slide 7 for an overview of our progress in building the leading wealth tech player. In wealth management, we are building on our core strength as the leading back-office technology provider, delivering new component solutions and developing an agile modular platform that will link the full suite of our capabilities. Wealth and investment management revenues rose 5% in fiscal '22, powered by new sales in both the U.S. and Canada, which helped offset the impact of lower trading volumes as we lapped the peak of a mean stock phenomenon over the second half of last year.\nOur opened component-based wealth management platform remains our top priority. To date, we've rolled out managed account billing and adviser workstation, both to strong reviews. We recently delivered the second generation of the workstation with even more capability. Looking ahead, we're deep into integration on the remainder of the core suite with strong results and anticipate being largely code complete by the end of calendar '22. We remain on track to go live in summer of '23.\nOngoing client discussions are enabling us to sharpen our open value proposition -- open platform value proposition. Our ability to offer clients a set of modular solutions, linked by a common enterprise integration layer, enables them to modernize key parts of their tech stack one step at a time, with clear value at each step. This modular approach is drawing significant interest from clients, and we expect it to drive increased wealth sales in fiscal '23. So to sum up, we are executing well across each of our franchise businesses.\nNow let's move to Slide 8, and I'll wrap up my review with some closing thoughts. First, Broadridge delivered another strong year of financial and operating results.\nSecond, we are executing on our growth plans in 3 attractive opportunities. We're driving digitization to extend governance. We're leveraging Itiviti to grow capital markets, and we're successfully building wealth management. Our investments in each of these areas are creating significant momentum in the marketplace.\nThird, our growth is being propelled by the accelerating pace of change in the financial services industry. Clients are evolving their business models, rapidly seeking to digitize and adopting next-generation technologies. Slowing global growth is likely to further accelerate these changes as our clients invest to compete for market share and drive productivity. By accelerating digitization and mutualizing nondifferentiating costs, our solutions help them meet those needs.\nAnd that brings me to my fourth and last point. Broadridge has never been better positioned for long-term growth. Our guidance calls for 6% to 9% recurring revenue growth in fiscal '23 and 7% to 11% adjusted EPS growth. We're on track to deliver at or above our 3-year objectives. And with a $60 billion market opportunity, we see a long runway for growth.\nBefore I finish, I want to thank our associates around the world. Their work is the driving force behind the innovation that we're bringing to the financial services industry. This work is critical for our clients. And through them, we're making a difference in improving the financial lives of millions around the globe.\nEdmund, over to you.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone.\nI'm really pleased to be here to discuss the results from yet another strong quarter and strong year. I'll also provide you with some additional insights into our guidance for fiscal '23, which will position Broadridge to deliver at or above the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives.\nAs you can see from the financial summary on Slide 9, Broadridge's full year results came in at or ahead of both our fiscal year '22 guidance and our 3-year objectives across all metrics.\nRecurring revenue rose to $3.7 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Organic growth was 9%. Adjusted operating income margin expanded 60 basis points, outpacing our annual margin expansion objective despite the drag from increased low to no margin distribution revenue. And adjusted EPS grew 14% to $6.46. Finally, and as Tim noted earlier, we delivered record closed ssales of $282 million, a strong year across all metrics.\nTurning to the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue grew 15% to $1.2 billion, driven by organic growth of 12%. Adjusted operating income grew 25% and AOI margins expanded 250 basis points as we lapped Q4 '21 elevated investment spend. And adjusted EPS increased 21% to $2.65. Again, operating income growth was partially offset by higher interest expense related to the acquisition of Itiviti. Our fourth quarter results benefited from continued position growth, strong execution across our product lines and the ongoing strong performance of Itiviti.\nLet's get into the details of these results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 10. Recurring revenue grew by 15% to $1.2 billion in Q4 '22. Organic growth was 12%, driven by strong volume growth in new sales. Acquisitions contributed 3 points of growth in the quarter as we passed the 1 year anniversary of the Itiviti acquisition in May. Our 16% recurring revenue growth for fiscal '22 marks 3 consecutive years of double-digit recurring revenue growth. With organic growth at 8% in fiscal '21 and 9% in fiscal '22, well above our 5% to 7% 3-year growth objective, we are well on our way to exceeding our 3-year top line growth objectives.\nNow let's turn to Slide 11 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. We saw double-digit recurring revenue growth in both of our segments. In Q4, ICS recurring revenues grew 14%, all organic, to $807 million, including double-digit growth across all 4 product lines. Regulatory revenues rose 13% to $424 million on strong equity and fund position growth. Data-driven fund solutions revenue grew 11% to $103 million, driven by strong growth in our data and analytics solutions and our mutual fund trade processing unit. Our issuer business increased by 18% to $125 million as we maintained share in our virtual shareholder meetings platform and continued to grow our other annual meeting and disclosure products.\nFinally, our customer communications business had a very strong quarter, growing by 15% to $155 million, driven by a surge in volumes from onboarding new clients and double-digit growth in our higher-margin digital offerings. Customer communications is now delivering solid top line growth. That complements its strong earnings growth as it executes on its print to digital strategy. For the year, ICS grew at 11%, with all of our businesses at or above our organic recurring revenue growth objectives.\nTurning to GTO on Slide 12. Recurring revenues grew by 18% in Q4 to $382 million, driven by continued strong performance from Itiviti, higher capital markets fixed income trading volumes and an increase in wealth management license revenue. Organic growth was 9% for the quarter and 5% for the year.\nCapital markets revenues grew by 28% to $240 million, powered by Itiviti, revenue from closed ssales and higher fixed income trading volumes. Organic growth in capital markets was 12% for the fourth quarter and 5% for the full year.\nAnd let me also take a moment to emphasize the strong performance in Itiviti. Itiviti, now BTCS, contributed 7 points of growth to Broadridge's recurring revenue, right on track with the expectation that we set when giving fiscal year '22 guidance and ahead of our profit expectations.\nTim walked you through the progress that we've made in the year since the acquisition. So I continue to feel good about our integration, the revenue synergies and strong financial performance in BTCS and the strategy for the business going forward.\nWealth and investment management revenues grew by 4% to $142 million, driven by growth from new sales and license revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower trading volumes at our wealth management clients. Full year organic growth was 5%.\nNow let's turn to Slide 13 for a closer look at the volume trends in ICS and GTO. Position growth remained strong in the fourth quarter across both equities and funds. Equity growth was 17% in the seasonally large fourth quarter. Our testing of position data continued to prove reliable as we finished the full year in line with our late April testing. For the full year, equity position growth was 18%.\nMutual fund growth also remained steady at 10% in the fourth quarter and full year growth was 14%.\nTurning to trade volumes on the bottom of the slide. Trade volumes grew 8% in Q4, driven by double-digit growth in fixed income volumes as investors sought to stay ahead of rising inflation in the more hawkish Fed. Equity volumes also increased as higher trading by institutional investors more than offset the lower activity at our retail wealth management clients. For the year, internal trade growth was 1%.\nLet's now move to Slide 14, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenues grew 15%, powered by 12% organic growth and a 3-point contribution from acquisitions, primarily reflecting Itiviti revenue through mid-May. Internal growth, including strong position growth and fixed income trading, drove 8 points of growth, and revenue from new sales contributed 6 points of growth. Our retention rate remained at 98%.\nI'll finish the discussion on revenue with a view of total revenue on Slide 15. Total revenue grew 12% in Q4 to $1.7 billion. Recurring revenue was the largest contributor, driving 10 points of growth. Low to no margin distribution revenue increased by 12% and contributed 3 points to total revenue growth, driven by a combination of higher volumes in our customer communications business and higher postage rates. That growth had a dilutive effect on our reported adjusted operating income margins that I'll highlight in a moment.\nEvent-driven revenues were $70 million in Q4 '22, $2 million lower than last year, as lower contest activity was partially offset by continued mutual fund proxy activity. Looking ahead to fiscal '23, we are not forecasting any major mutual fund proxy events and we expect event-driven revenues to be in the $240 million to $260 million range, in line with recent years.\nTurning now to margins on Slide 16. Adjusted operating income margin for Q4 was 25.3%, a 250 basis points improvement over Q4 '21, driven by strong recurring revenue growth and lapping the increased investment in our digital and technology platforms. For the full year, Broadridge delivered 60 basis points of margin expansion, exceeding our objective of 50 basis points despite elevated growth in low to no margin distribution revenue, which diluted our reported full year adjusted operating income margin by 70 basis points.\nAs I have mentioned previously, we saw a modest impact from higher inflation, both in attracting and retaining talent and in material costs to offset that inflation impact and to prepare for a more uncertain economic environment. We took a series of targeted cost actions in Q4 '22.\nFirst, given our new hybrid work model, we continued to rightsize our real estate footprint and took a $23 million onetime charge related to those incremental actions. We have now closed or reduced 49 offices or 14% of our total square feet since the beginning of the pandemic in fiscal year '21.\nSecond, we initiated additional business alignment initiatives that resulted in a reduction in both existing and open headcount. As a result of these cost initiatives, we expect to realize $70 million in annualized savings, which, along with the operating leverage inherent in our business model, will allow us to mitigate inflation, continue to invest in our long-term growth investments and meet our earnings growth objectives.\nFollowing the decision we announced earlier this year, we are closing our offices in Russia and will relocate associates who want to move. We incurred $1.4 million in expense related to that effort in the fourth quarter and expect another $25 million to $30 million over the course of fiscal '23 to wind down our business in that market. Both the onetime real estate costs and the Russian wind-down expenses have been excluded from our calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS.\nLet's move ahead to closed sales on Slide 17. We ended our fiscal year with another strong selling effort, closing $112 million in closed sales for the quarter. For the full year, sales grew by 21% to $282 million, ahead of our guidance range and marking yet another year of record closed sales. Importantly, these sales were balanced across ICS and GTO products, and we also saw a significant contribution from BTCS.\nStrong closed sales drove a further increase in our recurring revenue backlog, which reached $440 million or 12% of fiscal '22 recurring revenue. Importantly, our backlog gives us strong visibility into the revenue from closed sales that will power fiscal year '23 recurring revenue growth.\nI'll turn now to capital allocation on Slide 18. We are a growth company, and our capital allocation model remains focused on balancing investment for long-term growth and capital return to benefit our shareholders. Broadridge generated $370 million in free cash flow in fiscal '22 after investing $447 million in our client platforms. The wealth platform accounted for the most significant part of this investment.\nAs we previously indicated, we are in a peak period of investment across multiple client platforms, including our wealth platform, where we are on track to reach code complete in fiscal '23. We also expect client platform investment to be lower in fiscal '23, with free cash flow conversion returning to more historical levels in fiscal year '24.\nWe also remain committed to funding a dividend that grows in line with earnings having returned a net of $253 million to shareholders in fiscal year '22. We are pleased that our Board has approved a 13% annual dividend increase to $2.90 per share in fiscal '23, in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 45% of adjusted earnings.\nFinally, we repaid $95 million of debt as we continue to prioritize debt repayment over share repurchases until we reach a leverage ratio that is in line with our objective to maintain an investment-grade credit rating.\nI'll close my prepared remarks this morning with some detail on our fiscal '23 guidance, which is on Slide 19. Our guidance calls for mid- to high single-digit recurring revenue growth, continued margin expansion, solid adjusted EPS growth and another year of strong closed sales.\nLet's take each point in turn, starting with recurring revenues. We expect fiscal year '23 recurring revenue growth of 6% to 9%, all organic, with balanced growth across both ICS and GTO. The biggest driver of our growth is expected to be new sales as we work to onboard our $440 million backlog. We also expect mid- to high single-digit position growth and flat trading volumes. And as always, the recurring revenue guidance reflects a constant currency view.\nIn addition to recurring revenue, we expect low double-digit growth in distribution revenues, driven by solid volume growth and additional postage rate increases. As I indicated earlier, we expect event-driven revenues to be in the $240 million to $260 million range, down from $270 million in fiscal '22. Factoring recurring, event-driven and distribution revenues, we expect total revenue constant currency growth to be in the 6% to 10% range.\nSecond, we expect to expand our adjusted operating margin in fiscal '23 by approximately 50 basis points, driven by the scale in our business, the ongoing mix shift to digital and efficiency gains, including our recent cost initiatives. These drivers should enable us to offset inflation-related increase and the dilution from double-digit growth and low to no margin distribution revenues.\nThird, we expect adjusted EPS growth of 7% to 11%. Embedded in our adjusted EPS outlook is the impact of higher interest rates, which will drive a $35 million to $40 million increase in interest expense and the impact of the stronger dollar, which will lower our adjusted earnings growth by just over 1%.\nKeep in mind that while higher interest rates are impacting our interest expense line, the impact on Broadridge as a whole is largely neutral as our $1.6 billion in variable debt outstanding is essentially matched by cash balances held in our mutual fund trade processing and stock transfer businesses. So any increase in interest expense is offset by an equivalent increase in float revenue in ICS. We are also projecting an overall tax rate of 21% and a modest increase in diluted shares outstanding.\nClosing out our discussion of EPS, we expect to complete the integration of Itiviti and incur expenses related to winding down our operations in Russia. These expenses are not included in our calculation of adjusted EPS guidance.\nTurning now to our final guidance point, closed sales. We expect another strong year in sales, with a fiscal '23 guidance range of $270 million to $310 million including balanced sales between ICS and GTO.\nSo to sum up, our fiscal '23 guidance emphasizes the strength and resilience of our financial model and our ability to drive sustainable recurring revenue growth through any economic environment, fund growth investments while expanding margins and delivering steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth, all while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet and a balanced capital allocation policy.\nBefore I move on from guidance, let me briefly discuss our Q1 outlook. Historically, Broadridge has generated 10% to 17% of our earnings in the first quarter. In fiscal 2023, we expect our Q1 earnings to be at the low end of that historical range, driven by lower event-driven revenues and the carryover impact of higher fiscal '22 expenses.\nAnd one administrative note for fiscal '23 and moving forward, beginning with our first quarter results, we will be completing the final stage of our recasted FX reporting. Given the increased size and scale of our international business and global operations, it is appropriate to incorporate FX changes more fully into our reporting.\nYou will recall that last year, we implemented the first phase of this transition by updating the fixed exchange rate for our segment revenues and for recurring revenue, which reduced the difference between the fixed rate and the actual rate that was recorded in our FX revenue line. We will now be translating changes in FX into our segment and recurring revenue reporting, allowing us to eliminate the FX revenue line entirely. As a result, you'll see the impact of changes in FX directly in our recurring revenue line rather than as a change in the FX revenue line.\nWhile this change will modestly reduce our reported recurring revenue, it will have little impact on our reported recurring revenue growth rate and no impact on our reported total revenue or profitability metrics.\nAs we did last year, we intend to publish our historical revenue results at a recasted actual rate ahead of our first quarter earnings so that you have a chance to adjust your models.\nSo where does that leave us? Let me wrap up by putting our fiscal '23 guidance in the context of our 3-year financial objectives on Slide 20. Our guidance for fiscal '23 has Broadridge well positioned to deliver above the 3-year growth objectives for organic recurring revenue and recurring revenue, in line or ahead of our margin objectives and with adjusted EPS growth at the higher end of our 3-year growth objective range.\nOf course, we need to execute in an increasingly uncertain environment in fiscal year '23. By doing so, we will have delivered again on another set of 3-year growth objectives, just as we did in fiscal '14 to '17 and fiscal '17 to '20. That performance underscores the strength and consistency of our business model, our strategy of growing our governance and capital market franchises and building a wealth management franchise as well as the long-term trends driving our growth.\nWith that, let's take your questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nHead of IR, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kate. Good morning, and welcome to Broadridge's third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. We will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found in the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K. We will also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release presentation.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nCEO & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThanks, Edings.\nGood morning. I'm pleased to be here to discuss our strong results, record sales and outlook for another really good year. I'll start with the highlights for the quarter. First, Broadridge reported another quarter of strong results. Recurring revenues rose 16% and adjusted EPS rose 10%. More importantly, we're entering our seasonally largest quarter with continued momentum, and we are well positioned to close out another year of strong top and bottom line growth.\nSecond, our growth continues to be powered by long-term trends. In an uncertain market, we're benefiting from increased investor participation, the need to modernize and digitize financial systems technology and the ever-present focus on efficiency. Thanks to our investment in multiyear focus, Broadridge is taking advantage of these trends, and you see that in our growth and in our closed sales. We're also benefiting from strong performance in our acquisition of Itiviti.\nThird, the convergence of long-term trends is making what we do increasingly important, especially in governance. In a few moments, I'll discuss those trends and their positive implications. Finally, Broadridge is on track to deliver another strong year. As a result of our year-to-date performance and visibility into the fourth quarter, we are raising our adjusted EPS forecast to 13% to 15% from 11% to 15%. With only a few months to go, we expect to deliver mid-teens recurring revenue and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth along with another year of margin expansion. That, in turn, positions us to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives.\nLet's turn now to our business update on Slide 4. I starting with governance. Our governance business continues to drive our growth. ICS recurring revenues rose 9% to $630 million in the third quarter, driven by new sales and strong position growth. We are now well into the peak of proxy season, and record growth remained strong. Equity stock record growth was 17% in the third quarter, with overall positions increasing throughout the quarter despite volatility in the market. We see this momentum continuing into the fourth quarter, as Edmund will share with you.\nLooking at the drivers of that growth. Our data shows the largest increase in online brokers, complemented by substantial double-digit growth for more traditional players, and we continue to see very good growth across both managed and individually directed accounts. We're also seeing investor participation increasing on the fund side with mutual fund and ETF record growth of 10% for the quarter. ETFs are continuing to gain ground with investors, but we also saw strong growth at a number of active complexes. The continuing strength and breadth of equity and fund position growth reflects the continued breadth of retail investor participation and the power of technology to increase access to markets. Outside of regulatory, we saw solid mid-single-digit growth across our other businesses, including data-driven solutions, issuer and customer communications.\nMoving to capital markets. Recurring revenues rose 56% to $247 million. Itiviti was the biggest driver and is also contributing nicely to our closed sales growth. The combination of Itiviti's modular technology architecture, our commitment to client service and our long-term product road map is resonating with clients and driving market share gains. We're also making good strides on the integration itself, including rebranding the business as Broadridge Trading and Connectivity Solutions, or BTCS.\nWith 3 quarters under our belt, we forecast the rebranded Itiviti is on track to meet our expectations. I'm also pleased to see continued progress in our distributed ledger and AI initiatives. Undistributed ledger repo, we're on pace to go live with a third significant market participants in the next few weeks, which will take our daily average trading volume up over time to $50 billion per day from $35 billion now with a strong pipeline behind that.\nOur AI-powered fixed income trading platform also continues to make steady progress. During the quarter, we completed integration with Charles River, and last week, we announced our buy-side advisory form with many of the world's largest asset management firms, including BlackRock and PIMCO.\nTurning to Wealth and Investment Management. Revenues declined 2% to $134 million as we lapped the elevated trading volumes triggered by the mean stock phenomenon a year ago. More importantly, our wealth sales remained strong in the quarter and are up more than 50% year-to-date, building the base for future growth. Finally, we successfully rolled out our next-generation client workstation and more than 15,000 UBS advisers and others, and feedback from those users has remained exceptionally positive.\nLast, we reported another strong quarter for closed sales, which are up more than 40% year-to-date and set a new record for third quarter and for year-to-date. These new sales are being paced by our investments in enhancing investor engagement, adding and growing activity, building out our DLT and AI-powered solutions and in our wealth product suite, among others. Our strong sales results have us on track to achieve another year of record closed sales and to set the stage for continued growth.\nAs I noted earlier, we are now well into proxy season as more than 80% of annual meetings take place in April through June. Equity position growth remained strong, which speaks to the continued increase in participation in our markets, and that's clearly a strong tailwind for our business. Beyond that growth, however, we see a confluence of long-term trends that are making our role power and corporate governance even more critical and valuable to the investment process.\nSo let's turn to Slide 5 for a deeper dive. The first of those trends is one I've already discussed, which is a growing participation in our markets or the democratization of investing. And that really is a function of following trading costs, enabling a much wider set of products for investors. If you think back over the past 2 decades, we've seen the rise of ETFs, managed accounts and more recently at base investing and zero-commission trading. As we look forward, we see more changes, including pass-through voting and direct indexing.\nTaken together, these trends are bringing more investors, especially younger ones, into the market and giving them access to more diversified and sophisticated investment strategies. At the same time, the important of environmental, social and government factors is also growing, driven especially by climate and social issues. Investors are voting with their assets, as shown by the strong inflows into ESG funds, and increasingly devoting with their shares. Not only are we seeing a rising number of ESG proposals on the ballot for annual meetings, those proposals are getting more support over time. And we've all seen the SEC's proposed rules for further ESG disclosures.\nIt's clear that ESG issues are increasing the engagement of all investors, both retail and institutional. As a result, engagement between retail investors, institutional investors, wealth managers, fund companies and issuers is more important than ever. Facilitating this engagement is what we do, and we are innovating to meet that challenge. We're enabling fund companies to drive pass-through voting to their investors.\nWe've instituted end-to-end vote confirmation for 2,500 public companies, including all the Fortune 500 so that investors can confirm their votes are being counted. And we're implementing universal proxy to simplify contest. At the same time, we're making it easier than ever for voters and issuers to engage with each other with our enhanced proxy about app and an upgraded virtual shareholder meeting platform.\nIn short, we're using our place at the center of a network linking broker-dealers, institutional investors, tens of millions of retail investors and thousands of funds and public companies to make it easier than ever for every investor to vote and to have a voice in the policies of the companies that they own, and we're making it more efficient than ever for public companies and funds to engage with shareholders. These investments are paying off in the form of higher growth and higher value for all of our stakeholders.\nI'll wrap up with some final thoughts on Slide 6 and then turn it over to Edmund. Broadridge continues to execute and deliver on our growth strategy. We're extending our governance franchise and enhancing investor engagement. We're growing capital markets by driving efficiency and enabling trading innovation. And we're building a wealth and investment management business with next-generation technology. Our performance in the quarter and over this year has been driven by the onboarding of new sales and strong underlying volume trends. Looking ahead, we see another strong quarter despite increased volatility as the world copes with rising inflation, higher rates, the slowdown in China, and unfortunately, the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nOur ability to execute in these choppy markets reflects the strength of our run recurring revenue business model and the long-term trends that power our growth. Whether it's the increased investor participation, driven by following trading costs, digitization or the relentless pace of technology innovation. These trends have proven durable in both strong and weak markets and give us the confidence to make investments to drive long-term growth. So even in the face of increased volatility, our business is poised to grow.\nBroadridge is on track to deliver a strong fourth quarter to close out another very good year with FY '22 recurring revenue at the high end of our guidance range with continued margin expansion and with adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 15%. That strong performance in '22 comes on the back of a fiscal year 2021 in which Broadridge delivered 10% recurring revenue growth, 60 basis points of margin expansion and 13% adjusted EPS growth. As a result, we remain well positioned to deliver at the higher end of the 3-year growth objectives we laid out at our last Investor Day.\nBefore I turn it over to Edmund, I want to thank our 14,000 associates around the world for their hard work in delivering the results we're announcing today. The work we do is important, enabling better financial lives for millions of investors around the globe. Our associates high engagement, still 10% above pre-pandemic levels, makes a difference every day for those investors, for our clients and for our shareholders. Thank you.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Edmund.\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here discussing another quarter of strong performance, which highlights the strength and the stability of our financial model and the long-term trends that are driving our growth. Broadridge delivered top line growth above our fiscal year '22 guidance range driven by revenue from new sales, strong volumes and continued contributions from Itiviti. We continue to expect recurring revenue growth to be at the high end of our 12% to 15% growth range.\nAnd that, coupled with our continued ability to create operating leverage, even in this inflationary environment, gives us confidence to increase our adjusted EPS guidance to 13% to 15% growth. As a result of our strong third quarter performance, together with our expectations for a strong fourth quarter, Broadridge remains on track to deliver another year of double-digit revenue growth, higher margins and double-digit adjusted EPS growth.\nTurning to Slide 7, you can see that strong performance. In Q3, Broadridge's recurring revenues grew 16% to $1 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to $313 million, and AOI margins were flat at 20.4% including the drag from low to no margin distribution revenues. And adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.93.\nOur Q3 results included higher-than-expected equity position growth and also benefited from the timing of Itiviti revenue and tax discretes. I'll also reiterate that we will continue to see operating income growth, partially offset by higher interest expense related to the acquisition of Itiviti until we grow over the incremental interest expense in fiscal Q1 '23.\nLet's get into the details of those results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 8. Recurring revenue grew from $873 million in Q3 '21 to $1 billion in Q3 '22, an increase of 16%, exceeding our fiscal '22 guidance range. Organic growth accounted for 7 points of the 16% increase, driven by a balance of onboarding new sales and volume growth. Acquisitions, primarily Itiviti, drove 9 points of growth.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 to look at the growth across our ICS and GTO segments. We continue to see strong growth in both of our segments. ICS recurring revenues grew 9%, all organic to $630 million, driven by strong growth in our regulatory business and balanced mid-single-digit growth across all other product lines. Regulatory revenues rose 13% to $322 million, driven by strong growth in equity positions and mutual fund interims.\nData-driven Fund Solutions revenue grew 6% to $91 million, resulting from higher assets under administration in our mutual fund trade processing unit. Our issuer business increased by 5% to $46 million as we continue to see growth in our disclosure products. That business also benefited from high retention rates for our virtual shareholder meeting platform as the number of meetings are on pace to modestly exceed fiscal year '21. Finally, we continue to benefit from strong demand in our customer communications business as revenues rose 6% to $172 million.\nTurning to GTO. Recurring revenues grew by 29% to $381 million. Organic growth was 2%. Capital market revenues grew by 56% to $247 million. Itiviti now in branded BTCS, was the largest contributor to this growth, adding $79 million of revenue. Q3 Itiviti revenue includes a benefit from the timing of license revenue, but more importantly, Itiviti continues to benefit from strong demand, including market share gains in Europe and Asia.\nOn an organic basis, capital market revenues grew by 6%, driven by new sales and higher fixed income trading volumes. Wealth and Investment Management revenues decrease by 2% to $134 million, in line with our expectations. Lower equity trading volumes resulting from lapping the elevated retail volumes we saw last year at the height of the mean stock phenomenon lowered growth by 4 points.\nLooking forward, we expect both wealth and capital markets growth to pick up in the fourth quarter as we continue to onboard new sales with full year organic growth in our targeted 5% to 7% range for both franchises.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at volume trends. We are now in the peak period for annual meetings and proxies, and we continue to see strong volume growth driven by increasing investor participation. Equity positions continued to strengthen throughout the quarter and reached 17% in Q3. Through the end of April, we have received record data for 97% of the proxies that are expected for the year.\nAnd this data gives us high confidence in our Q4 estimate. For the full year, we expect equity position growth of approximately 18%. We are encouraged by this long-term tailwind and its contribution to driving growth in our business. Growth in mutual fund and ETF volumes was also strong at 10% in Q3 despite choppy markets. We continue to expect low double-digit growth for the full year.\nTurning to the bottom of the slide. Trading volumes fell by 6% on a blended basis as expected, driven by lower equity trading volumes in wealth which more than offset an increase in fixed income trading and capital markets. We continue to expect full year trading volume to be essentially flat for the year.\nLet's now move to Slide 11, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenues rose 16%, powered by 7% organic growth and a 9-point contribution from Itiviti. Organic growth was balanced between net new business and internal growth. Revenue from closed sales and our continued high retention of recurring revenue from existing client contracts drove 3 points.\nAnd internal growth contributed 3 points to recurring revenue driven largely by position growth, which more than offset the decline in equity trading volumes. Our 9 points of acquisition growth were driven by Itiviti, which contributed $79 million, as I noted earlier. And keep in mind, we expect the benefit from acquisitions has declined significantly in the fourth quarter as we lap the 1-year anniversary of the close of the Itiviti acquisition in mid-May. At that point, Itiviti will begin to contribute to our organic growth.\nI'll finish the discussion on revenue with a view of total revenue on Slide 12. Total revenue grew 10% in Q3. Recurring revenue was the largest contributor, driving 10 points of growth. Low to no margin distribution revenue increased by 6% and contributed 2 points to total revenue growth. The biggest driver of that growth came from higher mail volumes in our customer communications business as well as higher postage rates, which offset a decline in event-driven activity. I will reiterate that both elevated distribution revenue and the increased mix of distribution revenue from customer communications suppresses our reported margin. We expect continued elevated growth in distribution revenue in the fourth quarter.\nOver the long term, we expect that the share of distribution revenue as a percentage of total revenue will decline. Event-driven revenues were slightly above our 7-year quarterly average and reached $59 million, diluting total revenue growth by 1 point. For modeling purposes, we continue to believe that the best assumption is our $55 million 7-year quarterly average versus a strong Q4 '21.\nNow the margins on Slide 13. Adjusted operating income margin in Q3 was flat at 20.4% as our strong growth in recurring revenue was offset by elevated growth and low margin distribution revenue and our continued investment in our digital and technology platforms. As a reminder, the increased distribution revenue we have seen throughout the year including the postage rate increase will negatively impact our reported full year adjusted operating income margin by 40 to 50 basis points with no impact on adjusted EPS.\nLike others, we continue to see an impact from higher inflation, both in attracting and retaining talent and in materials cost. To date, this impact has been modest, and we are confident that we can continue to offset most of these costs. Let me also add that we have been increasing our level of investments over the last several quarters with a focus on revenue-generating initiatives, client retention and strengthening our technology infrastructure. I'll reiterate that we have the flexibility to dial up and dial down our investments. That period of elevated investment began in Q2 '21 and continued in the Q3 '22. As we enter the fourth quarter, we are now fully lapping the period of higher investments, and we expect to see increased margin expansion. As a result, we are reiterating our AOI margin guidance of approximately 18.5%.\nLet's move ahead to closed sales on Slide 14. We reported third quarter closed sales of $58 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $170 million, which as Tim said earlier, is more than 40% above last year. Our strong sales performance continued to be propelled by smaller sales. In fact, sales of less than $2 million accounted for 90% of our sales in the third quarter.\nTo me, that's an indicator of strong sales traction and highlights the value of our increasing focus on driving componentized solutions, especially in GTO. Looking ahead to the all-important fourth quarter, we have a very healthy pipeline, and we are well positioned to achieve our closed sales guidance of $240 million to $280 million.\nAnd finally, let's turn to cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 15. For the quarter, Broadridge generated $55 million in free cash flow, bringing our year-to-date total to negative $68 million. Year-to-date, we have invested $54 million in CapEx and software and $350 million in our platforms.\nAs we indicated last quarter, we continue to be in the peak period of investment across multiple client platform investments including our wealth platform. We expect lower investment as we complete the wealth management platform build and begin to recognize revenue from the UBS contract in mid-calendar 2023.\nAs we move past our current investment phase, we expect that our free cash flow conversion will revert to historical levels. More broadly, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy that prioritizes internal investments, value-enhancing M&A and a strong and growing dividend. We have returned a net of $168 million to shareholders in fiscal year '22, primarily in the form of our dividend. And we remain focused on paying down debt and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, all while delivering steady and consistent earnings growth.\nI'll close my prepared remarks with commentary on our updated guidance on Slide 16 and some final thoughts on our third quarter results. We are maintaining our revenue and margin guidance and increasing our adjusted EPS guidance. Specifically, we expect to deliver recurring revenue growth at the high end of 12% to 15% guidance range.\nWe maintain our adjusted operating income margin guidance of approximately 18.5%. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance to 13% to 15%, modestly higher than our original 11% to 15% range, reflecting better-than-expected performance in the third quarter and our continued ability to create operating leverage while delivering steady and consistent earnings growth. And we are reiterating our closed sales guidance of $240 million to $280 million.\nWith that, let me reiterate my key messages. First, Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results across both the top and bottom line. Second, we are positioned to deliver strong fourth quarter results, and more importantly, another strong fiscal year. Our updated guidance calls for the high end of 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, higher margins and 13% to 15% adjusted EPS growth and not to mention record sales.\nThird and last, we continue to balance strong short-term results with long-term growth investments, and we are well positioned going into fiscal year '23 to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives.\nAnd with that, let's take your questions. I'll turn it back over to Kate."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Edings Thibault, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nW. Edings Thibault\n\nHead of IR, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to Broadridge's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call. Our earnings release and the slides that accompany this call may be found on the Investor Relations section of broadridge.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Tim Gokey, our CEO; and our CFO, Edmund Reese.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tim, a few standard reminders. First, we will be making forward-looking statements on today's call regarding Broadridge that involve risks. A summary of these risks can be found on the second page of the slides and a more complete description on our annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe will also be referring to several non-GAAP measures, which we believe provide investors with a more complete understanding of Broadridge's underlying operating results. An explanation of these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to their comparable GAAP measures can be found in the earnings release and presentation. Let me now turn the call over to Tim Gokey. Tim?\n\nTimothy C. Gokey\n\nCEO & Director, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThanks, Edings. I'm excited to be here this morning to talk about our strong results, record sales and our outlook for another really good year. I'll start with highlights for the quarter.\nFirst, Broadridge reported another quarter of strong results. Recurring revenues rose 19%. Adjusted operating income rose 19%, and after the interest cost of activity, adjusted EPS rose 12%. More importantly, we are entering the seasonally larger second half of our year with strong momentum.\nSecond, our growth is diversified across multiple sources and is backed by strong underlying market trends. Our strong organic growth is being driven, first and foremost, by revenue from new sales across both ICS and GTO, as we continue to convert our backlog into revenues. We're also benefiting from the long-term tailwind provided by healthy position growth in our governance business. as well as the continued successful integration of Itiviti.\nThird, we continue to execute on our growth strategy across our governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management franchises. Our strong closed sales underscore how our investments are paying off and how our value proposition continues to resonate in the market.\nFinally, after a strong start to the year, we expect to deliver at the high end of our 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth guidance. We're also reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of 11% to 15%, positioning us for another year of steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth while funding additional investment. After a strong FY '21 and with our guidance for FY '22, we remain well positioned to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year recurring revenue and adjusted EPS objectives.\nExecution against our long-term growth plan has been a key driver of our results over the first half of fiscal '22. So let's turn to Slide 4 for an update, starting with governance. Our governance business is performing really well. ICS recurring revenues rose 10% to $427 million in the quarter, the biggest driver being revenue from new sales across all 4 product lines. The franchise also continues to benefit from strong underlying position growth, including 20% equity stock record growth in a seasonally small quarter for proxies and another quarter of strong ETF and mutual fund position growth.\nPosition growth remains broad-based across both equities as well as funds and ETFs. For example, while equity position growth was strongest in energy and financials, every industry sector reported growth of more than 10%. And we're also seeing almost identical growth across both managed accounts and individually directed accounts. On the fund side, we saw physician growth across both active and passive funds, with growth across equity, fixed income and alternative asset classes. These trends remained resilient in January despite the decline in equity markets. Our weekly testing has actually showed some modest strengthening position growth since the beginning of the year.\nOverall, our data shows more Americans are investing in our capital markets across different types of accounts and an increasingly diverse range of asset classes and securities. Moreover, they're staying invested in the face of market turbulence. For Broadridge, this is an opportunity to continuously raise the bar to serve more accounts and drive enhanced digital capabilities to ensure that investors, both new and existing, get the critical communications they need to make better investing decisions and to participate in the governance of those investments.\nWe are also investing to further enhance the proxy voting system by implementing end-to-end vote confirmation for thousands of public companies. Over the past year, we've worked closely with an industry group led by the Society for Corporate Governance, the Council of Institutional Investors and others to enhance the vote reconciliation process. This spring, we'll be rolling out these enhancements to reassure investments that every vote is counted as cast for all Fortune 500 companies as well as all of the more than 2,500 public companies for whom Broadridge tabulates proxy votes. This is an investment that will further improve an already highly accurate process, and it's a great example of how we work at the center of the governance network in partnership with issuers and funds to strengthen the system as a whole.\nBefore I turn to capital markets, I'm pleased to report that our customer communications business saw a 9% growth in recurring revenues in the quarter. This business has been a strong contributor to earnings growth in recent years, and it's positive to see it adding to our top line as well. Interestingly, we're seeing strong demand for print solutions with several new clients coming on board. These new wins give us more opportunities to upsell digital solutions.\nMoving to capital markets. Recurring revenues rose 41% to $224 million driven primarily by the addition of activity. When we announced the Itiviti acquisition last spring, we highlighted both near- and medium-term benefits. 10 months later, I'm pleased to note that we're delivering on those benefits.\nIn the near term, the team delivered strong second quarter sales, including several integrated solutions where our Itiviti products are helping to drive sales of a broader Broadridge solution. This gives us incremental confidence in our market share thesis in the front office and in our ability to leverage Itiviti's capabilities and geographic reach to contribute to our overall growth.\nJust as importantly, after extensive positive client discussions, we have started to move forward on a fully modular suite of solutions covering the entire trade life cycle by signing our first client for a middle office solution. Over the next 18 months, we will be rolling out a series of phased integrations to bring together our front, middle and back-office solutions by sharing regulatory reporting data and normalizing other data sources across the trade life cycle. It's exciting to be in the execution phase and on the road to making a front-to-back vision a reality.\nIn wealth and investment management, revenues rose 15% to $146 million. We remain on track to deliver the Broadridge wealth platform to UBS. Over the coming weeks, we expect to reach an important milestone with the rollout of our front office adviser workstation to more than 17,000 advisers and others across UBS. The workstation combines Broadridge, UBS and third-party applications that enable an adviser to manage their practice, give advice and initiate transactions under a single sign-on with an intuitive UI with shared context and enhanced look and feel. A beta version of the workstation was rolled out earlier this year, and the response had been overwhelmingly positive. More than 95% of advisers offered the workstation have adopted it even when the current workstation is still available to them. When you consider how resistant to change most of us are, you appreciate what a great endorsement that is.\nLast, Broadridge delivered strong closed sales across all 3 franchises. Second quarter closed sales were $83 million, and the first half was $113 million, up 48% from last year. With both ICS and GTO contributing, it's certainly a strong sign that the Broadridge value proposition is resonating in the market. More importantly, it's a strong start toward what we expect to be another year of record closed sales. setting the stage for continued growth. So I'll sum up my business review that's saying that Broadridge is performing well across all 3 of our franchises with strong execution, driving strong financial results.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 to wrap up. First and foremost, Broadridge is performing well, the growth being propelled by sales and long-term growth drivers. We're executing on our strategy, extending our governance capabilities to enable ever more accurate voting, growing our capital markets business with a blueprint to create front to market -- front-to-back capabilities across the trade life cycle and rolling out a major component of our wealth platform.\nThe biggest driver of organic growth over the past several quarters, even a period of strong position growth, has continued to beat new sales. Those sales and a consistently high 98% revenue retention rates are the direct result of the investments we have made over the past years in strengthening our existing solutions, adding new capabilities through targeted M&A and organic investments as well as strengthening our technology. So it should come as no surprise that we're going to take advantage of our strong performance to increase our investment this fiscal year as we balance our commitment to delivering low teens adjusted EPS growth with attractive investment for the future.\nIn all, fiscal '22 is shaping up to be another Broadridge kind of year. We're delivering strong top line results powered by new sales, continued position growth and strategic M&A. We're doing the hard work to execute on our multiyear growth plan to extend governance, grow capital markets and build wealth and investment management. We're using stronger event-driven revenues and the higher recurring revenue growth to fund additional investment all while delivering strong 11% to 15% adjusted EPS growth.\nAs we look around us at a market that's growing increasingly concerned about inflationary pressures, fed moves and geopolitical risk, we believe that clear formula, coupled with our long-term focus, both of which have served us so well for many years, will continue to resonate with our clients, associates and shareholders.\nSo let me sum up with this message. Midway through fiscal '22, Broadridge's business is strong. We're on track to deliver another year of strong recurring revenue growth and 11% to 15% adjusted EPS growth. We remain well positioned to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, and we're well positioned for long-term sustainable growth.\nBefore I hand the call over to Edmund, I want to thank our associates for their continued engagement and their focus on our clients. Our purpose is strong, and we are making a difference. We're proud of the 8% improvement in our associate engagement score last year. In January, we received the results of our most recent survey. And I'm very pleased to say that engagement is just as high this year, which is not the case across many companies. So to those associates who are listening to this call, thank you for staying focused on our clients and our company. That focus is playing an important role in the strong growth numbers we reported today. Despite the challenges of pandemic, you have kept financial markets working, are driving Broadridge forward. and are making a difference in the financial lives of millions. Now let me turn the call over to Edmund for a review of our financials. Edmund?\n\nEdmund J. Reese\n\nCorporate VP & CFO, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here discussing another quarter of strong performance. As you've just heard, Broadridge's performance remains resilient, and our long-term growth drivers are quite stable. Organic growth from new sales, strong underlying volume trends and the progress integrating Itiviti helped us deliver very strong top line growth and adjusted EPS growth in line with both our guidance and 3-year objectives.\nTurning to Slide 7, you can see that strong performance. In Q2, Broadridge's recurring revenues grew 19% to $798 million. Adjusted operating income increased 19% to $141 million, and AOI margins were flat at 11.2% with a drag from low to no margin distribution revenue. And adjusted EPS increased 12% to $0.82. I'll note that we will continue to see operating income growth partially offset by higher interest expense related to the acquisition of Itiviti until we grow over the incremental interest expense in Q1 '23.\nLet's get into the details of those results, starting with recurring revenues on Slide 8. Recurring revenues grew from $673 million in Q2 '21 to $798 million in Q2 '22, an increase of 19%, well above our fiscal '22 guidance range. Organic growth accounted for 9 points of the 19% increase driven by the conversion of our healthy revenue backlog and volume growth. Itiviti revenues, which were in line with our expectations, drove most of the remaining 9 points of growth.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 and look at growth across our ICS and GTO businesses. Both of our business segments had healthy organic revenue growth. Part of that growth is driven by the secular tailwinds in stock and fund position growth, but as I noted, the biggest driver across both is the contribution from new sales. It is clear that the investments that we've been making in our technology platforms have reinforced our value propositions, boosted our sales and are contributing significantly to this growth.\nICS recurring revenues grew by 10%, all organic, to $427 million, powered by both new sales and continued strong volumes. Regulatory revenues had the largest contribution to ICS recurring revenue rising 15% to $166 million driven by strong growth in mutual fund and ETF communications in the continued equity position growth in our U.S. proxy business.\nData-driven fund solutions revenue grew 3% to $89 million as assets under administration in our mutual fund trade processing unit grew from both new client onboardings and growth with existing clients. Our issuer business delivered $24 million in revenue, up 14% as we continue to see growth in our disclosure products.\nFinally, customer communications revenue rose 9% to $148 million. While we've been expecting modest top line growth in this business, our unusually high growth in Q2 was driven by new client wins in our print business, which we can use as an entry point to pursue higher-margin digital business.\nTurning to GTO. Recurring revenues grew by 30% to $371 million. Organic growth reached 8%. Wealth and investment management revenues increased by 15% to $146 million. This growth was primarily organic driven by an uptick in license revenue from a large client renewal, continued momentum from onboarding of new component sales as well as higher retail trading.\nCapital market revenues grew to $224 million, an increase of 41% with Itiviti continuing to be the largest contributor. Organic recurring revenues increased 3% as revenue from new sales were offset by lower equity trading volumes. We continue to expect both our capital markets business and wealth franchise to deliver fiscal '22 growth in line with our 3-year objective of 5% to 7% organic growth.\nLet's turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at the volume trends. Broadridge continues to benefit from the long-term trends that we've made -- that have made investing more accessible. The biggest driver of our internal growth was mutual fund and ETF volumes, which grew 12%, reflecting steady fund inflows over the past several quarters. We expect low double-digit growth to continue for the second half of the year. Our 20% equity position growth in Q2 was in line with the projection that we provided on our last earnings call.\nAs we approach the spring proxy season, which typically generates over 80% of our equity communications, our latest record positioning testing shows continued strength with low double-digit growth in the second half of the year. For the full year, we expect to be ahead of our historical averages, delivering low to mid-teens growth. And as you can see by our results, investor participation in financial markets has continued to increase, and our digital platform investments in our proxy business have positioned us to support this growth. We remain encouraged by the long-term tailwind and its positive impact on our business.\nTurning to the bottom of the slide. Trading volumes increased 1% as higher fixed income volumes offset the impact of lower equity volumes. Given elevated equity volumes in Q3 '21, we continue to expect lower volumes in the third quarter and full year trading volume growth to be essentially flat for the year.\nTurning now to Slide 11, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenues rose 19% propelled by 9% organic growth and a 9-point contribution from Itiviti. Revenue from closed sales was the biggest driver of our organic growth with strong contribution in both ICS and GTO. Internal growth contributed 4 points to recurring revenue driven by higher fund and ETF communications and ICS and a significant renewal that drove increased license revenue in GTO. Itiviti was the biggest driver of our acquisition growth, contributing $61 million, while our tuck-in acquisitions made in Q4 '21 and Q1 '22 are also performing in line with expectations.\nI'll finish the discussion on revenue with a view of total revenue on Slide 12. Total revenue growth was a healthy 19% in Q2. Recurring revenues was the largest contributor, driving 12 points of growth with elevated distribution revenue, driving 5 points of growth and continued year-over-year contribution from event-driven revenues, which added 2 points of growth. Low to no margin distribution revenues continued to grow at a double-digit pace and reached 17% year-over-year, which is significantly higher than we expected at the beginning of the year. The growth came from higher customer communications mailings as well as significant increases from higher postage rates. We expect continued high levels of distribution revenue for the full year. And I'll reiterate that this revenue suppresses our reported margin. Over the long term, we expect that the share of distribution revenue as a percentage of total revenue will decline.\nFinally, we reported another quarter of strong event-driven revenue on the back of healthy mutual fund proxy activity. We expect event-driven revenue to remain healthy in the second half of the year and believe that our $55 million 7-year quarterly average is the best modeling assumption for Q3 and Q4. Now the margin on Slide 13.\nAdjusted operating income margin in Q2 was flat at 11.2% as our strong growth in recurring in a bit driven revenue was offset by increases in low margin distribution revenue and growth investments. No margin distribution volumes and pass-through revenue from postage rate increases are higher than what we expected at the beginning of the year. This incremental distribution revenue will negatively impact our adjusted operating income margin by an additional 40 to 50 basis points on the full year versus our original guidance. Like many other companies, we're seeing a modest impact from higher labor inflation as we seek to add and retain talent, but we remain confident that we can find the efficiencies to offset these costs.\nSeparately, we are also modestly increasing our investments. As in the past, we are taking advantage of stronger-than-expected position growth and above-trend event-driven revenues as we remain committed to ongoing investments that support our growth.\nIn our ICS business, we have investments to build next-gen capabilities on our digital platforms for fund communications, SRD2, and an upgraded VSM platform all of which we expect to have a near-term impact on our results. In GTO, we continue to invest in our global post-trade management system, our DLT-enabled platforms, including our repo and private market hub solutions and, of course, executing the front-to-back Itiviti product road map that Tim highlighted earlier.\nGiven the higher distribution revenue, and our continued commitment to investment, we are lowering our fiscal year adjusted operating income margin guidance by 50 basis points from approximately 19% of to approximately 18.5%. Broadridge has a long track record of steady margin expansion and continuous accretive investment using our high revenue growth in efficiency gains to create capacity while delivering steady and consistent earnings growth. We expect this to continue in fiscal year '22.\nLet's move to close sales on Slide 14. We reported second quarter closed sales of $83 million, which brings our year-to-date total to $113 million and keeps us very much on track to achieve another year of record closed sales in line with our guidance range of $240 million to $280 million. We were encouraged to see strong closed sales across both ICS and GTO with ICS registering just over half of closed sales for the quarter. As Tim noted, Itiviti was a strong contributor to GTO sales in Q2, which I see as early validation of our investment case.\nAnd finally, let's turn to cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 15. I'll start with a reminder that Broadridge's free cash flow generation typically begins the year negative and strengthens as the year goes on. We generated $28 million of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date free cash flow to negative $124 million.\nWe continue to invest heavily in our next-gen platforms, especially our wealth management platform. For the first 6 months of fiscal year '22, we've invested $29 million in CapEx and software and $236 million in our platforms. We are at peak investment levels for our wealth platform, and that spending will decline as we move to future phases. As Tim said, we remain on track to deliver the wealth management platform, and I expect that we'll begin to recognize revenue in mid-calendar year 2023.\nLooking ahead, we remain committed to elevating potential -- evaluating potential tuck-in M&A opportunities that meet our strategic profile. We will also continue returning capital to shareholders primarily through our dividend as we remain focused on paying down debt and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.\nI'll close my prepared remarks with a quick review of our guidance and some final thoughts on our second quarter results. Starting with recurring revenue. We now expect recurring revenue growth for fiscal '22 to be at the high end of our 12% to 15% guidance range. As I noted earlier, we are reducing our adjusted operating income margin guidance from approximately 19% to approximately 18.5%, reflecting the impact of higher distribution revenues and continued growth investments.\nThird, we are reaffirming our expectations for strong adjusted EPS growth in the range of 11% to 15%. Finally, after a strong start to the year, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million. I will also add that we expect third quarter EPS to be flat to marginally lower driven by tough comparisons to elevated equity volumes and high event-driven revenue as well as the timing of investments. We expect strong earnings growth in the fourth quarter.\nWith that, let me reiterate today's key messages. Broadridge's financial model is strong and resilient. We continue to deliver strong operating results, which drove another quarter of high top line growth and double-digit earnings growth. Looking ahead, we expect continued strong recurring revenue growth, enabling us to continue to balance growth investments with delivering steady and consistent earnings for our shareholders. With that, we'll take your questions. Operator?"

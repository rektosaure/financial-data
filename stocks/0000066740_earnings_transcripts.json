Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded, Tuesday, October 21, 2025.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Chinmay Trivedi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis at 3M.\n\nChinmay Trivedi\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning & Analysis\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Anurag Maheshwari, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Anurag will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions.\nPlease note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2 and take a moment to read the forward-looking statements. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note while today's presentation we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 3, and I will hand the call off to Bill. Bill?\n\nWilliam M. Brown\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Harris Corp.\n\nThank you, Chinmay, and good morning, everyone. The 3M team delivered another strong quarter in Q3 with organic sales growth of 3.2% and the fourth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth across all 3 business groups against a macro backdrop that is largely unchanged and generally soft.\nOur 3 excellence operating model helped drive operating margins up 170 basis points, earnings per share up 10% to $2.19 and free cash flow of $1.3 billion, a conversion of 111%. Our strong performance through the first 3 quarters of the year enables us to increase our earnings per share guidance to $7.95 to $8.05 and on the back of a strong Q3, we now expect full year organic sales growth to be greater than 2% with adjusted free cash flow conversion remaining above 100%.\nOur strategy is working. Our efforts to advance our top 3 priorities are yielding results. Most notable this quarter is our work on commercial excellence. The rigor associated with turning customer opportunities into wins faster is clear. and we are squarely focused on accounts with the highest potential while limiting special pricing actions.\nOur cross-selling program continues to outperform our expectations, and we have nearly doubled the pipeline since last quarter and closed on nearly $30 million of new business. To reduce churn, we are leveraging predictive analytics to win back business lost or at risk. And the sales organization is stepping up its performance embracing the up-tempo operating rigor and leveraging new tools and processes to win at the customer interface.\nWe launched 70 new products in the quarter and 196 year-to-date, both up about 70% versus last year, and we now expect to launch over 250 new products this year, exceeding our goal of 215 and pacing ahead of our Investor Day target of 1,000 new products through 2027. We continue to shift resources towards new product development, align investment to our priority verticals and and drive accountability for on-time launch attainment.\nAnd most importantly, we're beginning to bend the curve on revenue from new products with sales from products launched in the last 5 years, up 30% in Q3 and 16% year-to-date, tracking to be up high teens for the full year.\nI wanted to highlight a few specific product launches this year that contributed to our performance this quarter. Earlier this year, we launched ScotchBlue Pro Sharp Painter's Tape, a great example of a Class III product in our consumer business that replaces an existing offering in this space, but with a better performance and cost profile. We're now regaining share, growing high single digits and outperforming in the category.\nAnother launch in the consumer business expanded our size offering in our filtering business, giving us broader coverage of the market and leading to high single-digit growth in the category in Q3. Last quarter, we launched a new lightweight wire frame self-contained breathing apparatus, which contributed to our high teens growth this quarter in our SCBA business and SIBG. These are just a few examples that individually are not material at the company level, but collectively are beginning to have a positive impact on revenue growth and customer perception that innovation is back at 3M.\nOur second priority is driving operational excellence across the enterprise. Our efforts here are driving margin expansion, improving customer service, increasing asset utilization and reducing cost per quality. Our on-time and full metric was 91.6% in the quarter, improving 200 basis points sequentially and 300 basis points over last year. achieving the highest on-time performance we've had in any quarter going back 20-plus years.\nWe've now been consistently over 90% for 4 months in a row. Improved OTIF shows up tangibly in our financial results as lower service fines, but also intangible through a better customer experience, leading to winning more shelf space and enhancing customer loyalty. Our intention now is a shift to the next stage of operational excellence, sustained or improved OTIF while simultaneously tightening delivery lead times and lowering inventory.\nWe continue to roll out our operating equipment effectiveness metric, which is now being systematically tracked on 229 of our most important assets, representing about 60% of our production volume, an increase of 32 assets since last quarter.\nYear-to-date, OEE is about 63%, up 300 basis points versus last year. This focus on better asset utilization is both reducing change over time and unplanned downtime and increasing run length and run rate, unlocking incremental volume opportunities. For example, in our optical adhesives line at our Jinshan plant in China, we were able to increase utilization from 63% to 81% by optimizing visual defect controls and reducing curing system downtime, freeing up enough capacity to double our share of an electronics customers business.\nQuality is another critical aspect of operational excellence and is a company-wide priority. Our cost per quality in the quarter was 5.7%, down 40 basis points sequentially and 150 basis points year-over-year. Our focus on quality has driven yield launch reductions across all 3 business groups as we leverage Kaizen events and AI tools to optimize changeovers, use automation to replace manual visual inspection and deploy design for manufacturing in our new product development efforts to reduce scrap during scale up.\nWhile we're making progress, we have a long runway for improvement toward our target of achieving less than 4% cost of quality as a percentage of cost of goods sold. Our third priority is capital deployment. We returned $900 million to shareholders in Q3, $400 million in dividends and $500 million of share repurchases. Year-to-date, we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders.\nConsistent with what we said at Investor Day and since then, we continue to evaluate our portfolio at a profit center level to shift our businesses towards higher growth higher profit potential markets. Addressing this portfolio will not only be accretive to earnings over time, but importantly, we'll free up management time to focus on higher-value opportunities. We previously communicated that 2% to 3% of revenue was under review for being divested.\nAnd in the quarter, we made progress with an agreement to sell our precision grinding and finishing business within our SIBG abrasive division. While this business is small at less than 1% of company sales, it's been a drag on results with over a decade of sales declines and 7 dedicated underutilized factories across the U.S., Europe and China.\nAs such, we do not expect this divestiture to be dilutive to earnings. This is a good outcome for shareholders, and it's indicative of the portfolio shaping we spoke about at Investor Day that enables us to be a more focused and higher performing enterprise.\nOn Slide 4, Macro trends remained soft and largely unchanged from Q2. But due to our strong execution, we are outperforming. Looking at our end markets. In Q2, we said general industrial and safety will improve off its low single-digit growth in the first half, and that is what happened despite a surprisingly weak roofing granules market. Electronics was up mid-single digits and flat to the first half and was a bit better than expected.\nConsumer was flat as expected, that auto and auto aftermarket were down mid-single digits with performance improving modestly in auto OE and weakening in commercial vehicles. Slide 5 pulls it all together and puts a spotlight on our 3M excellence framework in action in SIBG.\nOn the right shows 11 quarters of organic growth at SIBG from minus 6% in early 2023 to the most recent quarter at 4.1%, aligned with the key factors driving this improvement. Over this period, new product launches more than doubled. OTIF improved by 12 percentage points, age backlog declined by 13 points. Cross-selling has accelerated and more rigor and management focus was implemented across the sales force. But while progress is evident, we're still in the early innings as we execute on the fundamentals and extend the 3M Excellence framework to other parts of the company. I'm really proud of the team.\nOur third quarter performance gives us confidence we're on the right track and reflects the culture of excellence we're building inside the company as we continue to drive the rigor and OpTempo necessary to deliver on our strategic priorities. As we navigate these uncertain times, we're focused on what we control, innovating for our customers, embedding commercial excellence across our businesses, improving service, optimizing capacity, reducing waste and effectively deploying capital. all with a renewed sense of urgency that defines our new performance culture.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to share the details of the quarter. Anurag?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill. Turning to Slide 6. We had a strong quarter across all financial metrics. We delivered sales growth acceleration, continued solid mileage expansion, double-digit earnings growth and strong cash flow.\nStarting with the top line. In a consistently muted macro environment, we accelerated organic revenue growth from 1.5% in the first half to 3.2% in Q3 driven by successful execution of our commercial excellence initiatives and contribution from NPI underpinned by a strong operating tempo, which resulted in growth above macro.\nBy geography, our growth was led by China, which was up high single digits, with strength in industrial adhesives films and electronics bonding solutions driven by strong commercial execution that led to share gains. The U.S., where we first focused our commercial excellence initiatives grew nearly 4% in the quarter compared to 1% growth in the first half, with strength in general industrial, safety and demand for filter REIT filters partially offset by market-driven weakness in auto aftermarket and roofing granules.\nIt was encouraging to see Europe return to growth in the third quarter up low single digits due to strength in personal safety communication solutions, which more than offset the weakness in auto. Q3 daily order trends were up 3% year-on-year with growth across all business groups. Though our sales came in better than expected and aged backlog continues to decline, the strength in orders resulted in a year-over-year increase in backlog, providing 20% to 25% coverage of fourth quarter sales.\nQ3 adjusted operating margins were 24.7%, up 170 basis points year-on-year, driven by continued strong operational performance. Operating income grew by approximately $175 million in constant currency, including an approximately $325 million benefit from volume growth, broad-based productivity across supply chain and G&A and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by about $50 million of growth investments as planned and $100 million from tariff impact and stranded costs.\nCollectively, this contributed $0.25 to earnings, which was partially offset by $0.04 from FX and nonoperational below-the-line items. Our strong operating performance resulted in adjusted EPS of $2.19, an increase of 10%. Relative to expectations, our operational outperformance was driven by higher volume and productivity as the team continued to execute our strategic priorities.\nI also want to mention 2 items highlighted in our press release issued this morning that are excluded from adjusted results. First, we recorded a pretax charge of $161 million related to the agreement to sell our precision grinding and finishing business.\nSecond, we took a $14 million charge as we begin to invest in the long-term transformation efforts to redesign our manufacturing, distribution and business process services and locations. This initiative is different from the traditional restructuring programs we have previously undertaken like the recently concluded enterprise program, which focused on short-term actions for quicker paybacks.\nAccordingly, the charges related to these actions will be excluded from adjusted results going forward. Adjusted free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion with conversion of 111% as we benefited from strong earnings and capital expenditure efficiency.\nI will provide a quick overview of our growth performance for each business group on Slide 7. We started commercial excellence initiatives in Safety and Industrial and as a result, we are seeing early gains with organic sales up 4.1% in Q3 and 3.1% year-to-date.\nGrowth in SIBG was led by electrical markets, up low teens as we prioritized service performance and capitalize on growth in construction of data centers. Industrial adhesives and tapes add another quarter of mid-single-digit growth as they continue to win share in bonding solutions for electronics auto and appliances from new product introduction and better order conversion.\nBoth personal safety and abrasives accelerated to mid-single-digit growth, up from low single digits in the first half driven by increased sales effectiveness and new product introductions. Collectively, this strong growth more than offset known weakness in automotive aftermarket and emerging weakness in roofing rentals from the slow housing market and weak consumer sentiment.\nOverall, our focus on commercial and innovation excellence helped SIBG grow 4.1% for the quarter the highest growth since 2018 ex-COVID.\nTransportation and Electronics adjusted sales accelerated from 1% in the first half to 3.6% in Q3 and bringing year-to-date organic growth to 1.9%. While there was some discrete timing between Q3 and Q4 in our transportation safety business due to a large pavement marking project, the main drivers of growth were double-digit growth in aerospace, continued momentum in the electronics business and automotive being flattish after a down first half.\nIn electronics, we're expanding from the premium segment into the mainstream with new product introductions and better sales coverage. This quarter, we won content with a major mainstream player to supply optically clear adhesives for smartphones and lower sparkle film for notebooks. In our auto business, the weak commercial vehicle sales were offset by growth due to spec-in wins and increased penetration with Chinese OEMs.\nFinally, in a relatively weak consumer market, our consumer business has demonstrated the ability to grow 4 quarters in a row, including 0.3% organic growth in each of the last 3 quarters. Though consumer sentiment remains soft, we experienced strong demand for filtered filters, Scotch Tapes and McGuire's products supported by new product introductions, continued service improvements and increased advertising and merchandising investment.\nOverall, we are delivering on our commitments with strong year-to-date results, including organic growth of 2.1%, operating margin expansion of 220 basis points to 24.2%, earnings growth of 11% and free cash flow generation of $3.1 billion. We also returned $3.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.2 billion in dividends and $2.7 billion in share repurchases.\nPlease turn to Slide 8 for an update on our '25 guidance. Our year-to-date sales growth of 2.1% gives us confidence we will deliver growth of over 2% for the year. Our focus on productivity has enabled us to deliver strong margins every quarter. And on the back of this performance, we are updating our margin expansion expectations to 180 to 200 basis points for the year. As a result, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the year from a range of $7.75 to $8 to a range of $7.95 to $8.05 representing an approximately $0.12 increase at the midpoint or 10% growth for the year.\nWe continue to expect free cash flow conversion of greater than 100% with absolute free cash flow dollars being higher reflecting the increase in earnings.\nPlease turn to Slide 9. This updated 2025 guidance is ahead of the initial guidance set at the beginning of the year and positions us well to achieve the financial commitments we made at our Investor Day earlier this year. For 2026, we will provide formal guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January, but our framework remains consistent with what we communicated at our Investor Day in February, growth above macro, continued margin expansion and earnings growth and strong free cash flow generation.\nWhile the macroeconomic outlook is uncertain, we will outperform by scaling commercial excellence across all business units and leveraging new product launches. Alongside growth, we will improve productivity in our supply chain and G&A to more than offset investments, stranded costs and anticipated tariff impacts, resulting in margin expansion in 2026.\nFor EPS, we expect operational performance to be the primary driver of earnings growth similar to this year. Nonoperational performance will be influenced by changes in interest rates and FX while tax rates should remain stable and share buybacks will continue to be accretive.\nFinally, we continue to expect to deliver cash flow conversion that exceeds 100%.\nBefore we open the call for questions, I would like to acknowledge and thank the 3M team for their strong commitment to operational and commercial excellence and focus on delivering improvement day after day. Our performance to date and opportunities ahead of us provides us with increased confidence in delivering on our updated 2025 guidance and commitments we laid out at the Investor Day.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

Brown\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Harris Corp.\n\nThank you, Chinmay, and good morning, everyone. We had another quarter of strong performance with second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $2.16, up 12% versus last year and above expectations. Organic sales growth was 1.5% with all 3 business groups reporting positive growth for the third quarter in a row. Operating margins increased 290 basis points year-on-year through productivity and cost controls. While we continue to invest in growth initiatives. And free cash flow was solid at $1.3 billion for the quarter and 110% conversion.\nOur performance reflects the culture of excellence we're building inside the company as we continue to drive the rigor and optempo necessary to deliver on our strategic priorities in this uncertain macro environment. As part of our commitment to innovation excellence, we're increasing the cadence of new product launches.\nIn Q2, we launched 64 new products, up about 70% versus last year. which puts us at 126 launches for the first half and on track to exceed our target of $2.15 for the year. The pipeline remains healthy, enters more rigor and discipline in the process with better business cases and higher launch schedule attainment. And most importantly, 5-year new product sales bottomed last year, and was up 9% in the first half, accelerating from Q1 into Q2 and tracking well to be up more than 15% for the year.\nWith 64 launches in the quarter, there are a lot of exciting new products to discuss. But let me take a moment to highlight just a few. In our Fire Safety business, we launched a low-profile rugged air pack with updated electronics to enable telemetry and connectivity and that has been well received by our largest firefighting customers, especially those who value compacts and maneuverability in small spaces.\nIn our consumer business, we've been building around the Filtrete platform. with 4 new product launches in the last 6 months, including 1 with a reusable filter frame that can be refilled by a collapsible deplete filter analogous to a razor, razor blade model. This innovative design reduces shipping costs and saves retailers storage and shelf space.\nAt the same time, we're continuing our focus on commercial excellence as we drive increased sales force performance capture higher cross-selling opportunities, improved price discipline and reduce churn. You'll recall that our team in Safety and Industrial launched the program in U.S. late last year, and has now expanded this effort into Europe and Asia. We've trained over 400 sales managers and see early results through higher closed on opportunities and improved order rates.\nWe now have 48 cross-selling pairs identified, about double since Q1 with a pipeline value of over $60 million and $10 million of new orders booked to date. We're tightening pricing controls by reducing price deviations and focusing on bigger deals with strategic customers. And we're reducing customer churn by leveraging our predictive analytics model to identify and win back customers at risk.\nSIBG has been first out of the gate on commercial excellence initiative, and we're seeing promising early results with average daily order rates up low single digits in Q2. Our strategy is working. And we're now extending this 3M enterprise-wide commercial excellence model across the organization with transportation electronics quickly leveraging the learnings and best practices from I while adapting it to the unique nature of a more spec-in type business.\nOur second priority is operational excellence. In the second quarter, we made good progress on several fronts, including service, asset utilization and quality. On service, our on-time and full metric reached 89.6%, the highest quarterly performance we've achieved in nearly 6 years, and we exited June at just over 90%. Consumer and TEBG remained consistently above 90%, and SIBG was 83% for the quarter, improving more than 300 basis points year-on-year.\nOur overall equipment effect of this metric was approximately 59%, showing continued improvement both year-on-year and sequentially with a lot of runway ahead of us. We're now at the point where OEE is improving on a consistent basis through better tracking and deeper root cause analysis, and it's highlighting potential capacity consolidation opportunities. For example, a core manufacturing process at 3M is adhesive coding. And we have about 250 different types of coders throughout the network, some quite old and all expensive to replace.\nOne of our larger coders is in Knoxville, Iowa, making fiber adhesive tapes through an extensive effort to reduce changeovers, increase operating speed and improved machine uptime, the team drove a 12-point improvement in OEE and freed up enough capacity to retire two 70-year-old coders at another facility. This is just one example of the broader opportunity at 3M to use a rigorous, methodical approach to get more production out of our higher-capacity assets and proactively decommission aging, less productive assets in the network.\nThis thinking can be extended to all of our core manufacturing processes, making coating, slitting, packaging, and over time, more holistically to the design of our future network. We're also making progress on quality. In the second quarter, our cost per quality was 6.1%, down 30 basis points sequentially and 90 basis points year-over-year.\nWe're using AI-enabled models to optimize machine settings for more efficient changeovers, leading to better utilization and higher yield. Quality is a core element of our enterprise-wide 3M excellence operating model, and we're extending our efforts to improve quality in every function in everything that we do.\nOur third priority is effective capital deployment. In the first half of the year, we returned $3 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, and we'll continue to be opportunistic on buybacks in the second half of the year while preserving balance sheet flexibility. In May, we announced a settlement with the state of New Jersey on PFAS claims, taking the opportunity to settle both site-specific and statewide claims with broad protections against future litigation and cash payments spread over 25 years.\nWe continue to manage other state, federal and international matters, all of which are extensively covered in our 10-Q. On the back of the progress, we're making on our priorities and the strong results in the first half, we're increasing our earnings guidance to a range of $7.75 to $8, now inclusive of the anticipated impact of tariffs. We expect organic growth to be approximately 2% for the year, reflecting the current macro environment as we see it today.\nSlide 4 highlights several of the key macro trends we're tracking and their impact on 3M. All metrics on the left reflect a global economy that remains sluggish and moving laterally not materially improving or worsening. Our safety and general industrial businesses were up low single digits in the first half and are both beginning to see a pickup due to our commercial excellence initiatives.\nAuto will be flattish in the second half, a step up from the decline in the first half due to share gains in new models, while consumer electronics is likely to soften a bit in the back half due to slower demand for premium devices. Auto aftermarket will remain challenged and consumer will likely follow a similar pattern to the first half due to the subdued U.S. retail environment. As we navigate these uncertain times, we're focused on what we control, solving customer problems through innovation excellence, delivering high-quality products on time to customers and driving efficiency and waste elimination, all with a renewed sense of urgency that defines our new performance culture.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Anurag to share the details on the quarter. Anurag?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Bill. Turning to Slide 5. We reported another quarter of strong profitable growth and robust free cash flow generation. Starting with the top line. All 3 business groups delivered positive year-on-year growth despite the fluid macro environment resulting in total company adjusted organic growth of 1.5%. We saw continued momentum across electronics, general industrial and safety end markets, which was partially offset by known softness in auto and automotive aftermarket.\nConsumer was flattish as sentiment remains cautious. By geography, our growth was led by China, up mid-single digits with strength in industrial adhesives, films and electronics bonding solutions driven by strong commercial execution that led to share gains. The U.S. was up low single digits, led by growth in electrical markets and Personal Safety, partially offset by weakness in auto OEM and aftermarket.\nEurope was flat with strength in electrical markets and personal safety, partially offset by weakness in transportation safety and auto. Q2 daily order trends were up modestly year-on-year driven by our progress on commercial excellence in the Industrials businesses, partially offset by weakness in consumer as retailers are watching to see how the season plays out. Our backlog continues to grow, providing 20% to 25% coverage of third quarter sales.\nQ2 adjusted operating margins were 24.5%, up 290 basis points and operating profit increased high teens or $225 million in constant currency, driven by continued strong operational performance. This included a $300 million benefit from volume growth, broad-based productivity, lower restructuring costs and equity comp timing, partially offset by $50 million of growth investments and $25 million from tariff impact and stranded cost headwind.\nCollectively, this contributed $0.31 to earnings, which was partially offset by $0.02 from FX and $0.06 from nonoperational below-the-line items. Our strong operational performance resulted in overall adjusted EPS of $2.16, an increase of 12%. Relative to our initial expectations of approximately $2, this outperformance was driven by 4 factors: first, continued G&A efficiency as we make progress on IT optimization and lower indirect expenses. Second, metering of increase in year-over-year investments in response to a lower demand environment and evolving tariff landscape. Third, weakening of the U.S. dollar. Finally, we had a $0.06 benefit from the sale of an investment below the line, which was initially anticipated in the third quarter and offset the impact from tariffs and other below-the-line items.\nFree cash flow was $1.3 billion, 10% higher than last year as we benefited from strong earnings, and we returned $400 million to shareholders via dividends and executed on a $1 billion in gross share buybacks. For the first half, our gross buybacks were $2.2 billion. I will provide a quick overview of our growth performance for each business group on Slide 6.\nSafety and Industrial organic sales grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, up 2.6% in Q2. This was broad-based with 6 out of 7 divisions posting positive results. Similar to the first quarter, industrial adhesives and tapes and electrical markets continue to perform well on the back of new product innovation and commercial excellence. It was encouraging to see abrasives turn positive as we launch new products and execute our commercial strategy to increase sales effectiveness.\nAuto aftermarket continued to see challenges down mid-single digits amid industry pressure with collision repair claim rates down double digits year-to-date. Transportation and Electronics adjusted sales were up 1% organically in Q2. Growth was led by commercial graphics and auto personalization, driven by demand for a new product, the premium fleet wrap and expanding sales coverage.\nElectronics and Aerospace & Defense showed strength, while our auto OEM business was down low single digits, reflecting continued weakness in auto builds, particularly in Europe and the U.S., which were each down low single digits year-on-year. Finally, the consumer business was up 0.3% organically in Q2. Though consumer sentiment remains soft, we continue to execute on growth initiatives including new product launches in scotch, bright kitchen scouring, ScotchBlue PROShark Painter's Tape and Command and continued service improvements and increase in advertising and merchandising investment.\nAnd along with organic growth, each business group expanded margins year-on-year. SIBG up 320 basis points, TBG, up 230 basis points and CBG up 370 basis points. Overall, our focus on delivering organic growth and improving operational excellence helped us deliver solid results in the first half including growth of 1.5%, operating margin expansion of 250 basis points to 24% and earnings growth of 11%.\nBefore providing the details of our updated guidance, let me start with a reminder of how we framed it in April, which is the middle column on Slide 7. On organic sales growth due to the soft macro we indicated that we were trending to the lower end of our 2% to 3% range. Our first quarter productivity gains were very strong. But given the dynamic environment, we did not flow through this outperformance into our guidance and maintain the EPS range at $7.60 to $7.90. Given that the tariff situation was uncertain, we kept tariffs out of the guidance range at the time, but estimated a gross impact of $0.60 or a net impact of $0.20 to $0.40 after mitigating actions.\nWe have now updated the guidance to reflect our strong first half performance and have also incorporated the tariff impact. We are updating our organic revenue growth guidance to approximately 2% and expect all 3 business groups to grow low single digits for the year with a similar profile to the first half.\nOn the back of a strong first half performance, we now expect margin expansion of 150 to 200 basis points and are increasing both the lower and higher end of our EPS range, which is a [ $0.33 ] increase at the midpoint, $0.23 of that coming from operational performance offset by $0.10 of FX and tariff impact. We now expect our free cash flow conversion to be higher than 100%, building on strong first half performance, efficient CapEx and second half improvement in working capital providing us with further optionality on capital deployment.\nLet me walk you through the drivers of the EPS guidance updated on Slide 8. First, we are flowing through $0.23 of operational improvements which include actions to offset the tariff impacts. This is driven by $0.16 of productivity, which includes the G&A efficiency gains and $0.07 metered investments. As we highlighted previously, we are investing in a metered manner while maintaining the critical growth investments to support our strategic priorities.\nFinally, as mentioned, we have now included tariffs in the guidance which is a gross headwind of $0.20, partially offset by the foreign exchange headwind reduction from $0.15 to $0.05. On the other nonoperational items, there is no change from the prior guidance. Putting this all together, the EPS growth year-on-year is driven by strong operational improvement, and we now expect an operational benefit of $0.95 to $1.20, partially offset by $0.50 of tariff, FX and non-op headwinds for a total EPS growth of 6% to 10%.\nRegarding the second half, we expect year-on-year earnings growth of $0.18 at the midpoint. Similar to the first half, this includes an approximately $0.50 to $0.55 benefit from volume growth and continued productivity net of stranded cost and growth investments, which is partially offset by $0.30 to $0.35 of tariff impact and higher interest expense.\nBefore we open the call for questions, I would like to acknowledge and thank the 3M team for their focus on operational excellence and controlling the controllables in a dynamic macro environment which gives us confidence in meeting our increased guidance and delivering strong shareholder returns in 2025.\nWith that, let's open the line for questions.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Chinmay Trivedi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis at 3M.\n\nChinmay Trivedi\n\nSVP Investor Relations and Financial Planning and Analysis, 3M\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Anurag Maheshwari, our Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Anurag will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please turn to slide two and take a moment to read the forward-looking statements. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nItem 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of these most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to slide three and I will hand the call off to Bill. Bill?\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThank you, Chinmay, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to the year with Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $1.88, up 10% versus last year and above expectations. Organic sales growth was 1.5%, with all business groups posting positive growth. Operating margins increased 220 basis points year over year through productivity and cost controls, while we continued to invest in growth initiatives. Free cash flow was solid at about $0.5 billion, as we benefited from strong earnings, working capital improvements, and disciplined capital expenditures. These results were achieved during a dynamic macro environment and demonstrate the performance culture that's starting to take hold at 3M. The urgency and operating rhythm the team exhibited, along with around-the-clock interactions with customers and suppliers, drove a strong finish to the quarter, and I'm really proud of the resilience and persistence of all 3Mers.\nWe're exercising a new commercial excellence muscle with a much tighter alignment across the supply chain, and we're institutionalizing the March opt-empo to execute at that pace in every month of the quarter and every week of the month. In this environment, it's critical for us to focus on what we control and remain deliberate in executing on the three priorities we discussed at our recent investor day: driving sustained top-line organic growth, improving operational performance across the enterprise, and effectively deploying capital. Central to top-line growth is increasing the cadence of new product launches. In Q1, we launched 62 new products, up about 60% year on year, on top of a 32% increase in 2024, and we achieved more than 70% on-time launch attainment, up from 56% a year ago.\nOur new product pipeline health continues to improve, and we're on track to launch 215 new products this year and 1,000 over the next three years. We bottomed out and turned the corner on five-year new product sales, with Q1 up 3% and tracking well toward the target of growing sales from products launched in the past five years by more than 15% by year-end. The pace of innovation is accelerating at 3M, and our teams are operating with greater urgency and focus than ever before. A few notable new products introduced in Q1 include ScotchBlue ProSharp Painter's Tape with Edge-Lock technology for sharper lines and less paint bleed-through, a low-sparkle optical film with enhanced brightness for the mainstream notebook market, and a new solid-state drive connector for the data center market.\nWe're making progress on our commercial excellence objectives with standardized operating rhythms, improved target setting and performance measurement, and tighter pricing governance. We tripled the number of structured sales manager and sales rep reviews in Q1 and completed more than 100 joint business plans with our largest customers to align on growth opportunities and capture plans. One area of particular focus is cross-selling. We now have more than $40 million of opportunities in our pipeline across 23 product pairs, tracking well against the $100 million and 50-pair goal through 2027 that Chris described at investor day. And finally, we're laser-focused on customer retention and reducing churn, and we've begun deployment of a predictive analytics tool to flag at-risk accounts to proactively address the primary drivers of customer attrition. These initiatives are foundational to building a more commercially driven, customer-focused company.\nAs a result of these targeted actions, we saw solid order momentum in the quarter across all of our business groups. Our average daily order rate is up over 2% for the quarter, accelerating in March and driving company-wide backlog upload teams since the beginning of the year. We continued to execute well on our key operational performance metrics, including leveraging our new 3M excellence operating model. On-time in full, or OTIF, increased 3.5 percentage points versus last year and about one point sequentially to 89%, the best quarter we've had in the past five years. Consumer and transportation electronics performed again above 90%, and safety and industrial was up two points to about 82%, is on a steep climb to achieve 90% by year-end.\nOur metric for equipment utilization, or OEE, was up four percentage points sequentially to 58% and is now deployed on 191 key assets across our 38 largest factories, a 10x increase over this time last year and covering about 50% of production volume. Having a robust baseline on underutilized capacity will help us adjust our sourcing strategy more readily to the changing trade landscape. And finally, safety performance continued to trend in the right direction, with our incident rate down 25% in the quarter, following a similar improvement last year as we continue on our journey to an injury-free workplace. During Q1, we refinanced $1.1 billion in debt, returned $1.7 billion to shareholders, and raised our dividend by 4%.\nIn Q1, the board approved a share repurchase authorization of $7.5 billion, and we now expect repurchases to be about $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of $1.5 billion. We continue to advance our portfolio-shaping efforts with one small divestiture recently signed and others progressing more slowly in view of trade policy uncertainty. Our guidance for the year remains $7.60 to $7.90 adjusted earnings per share before the impact of tariffs and offsetting cost, sourcing, and price actions. We are not flowing through the upside in our Q1 results to our full-year outlook, given the uncertain macro environment with recent data reflecting some softening in GDP, IPI, and global auto build. Tariffs are going to be a headwind this year, but we thought it would be prudent to hold the impact outside of our full-year guidance while we digest the new policies and fully develop and qualify mitigation plans.\nWith the significant footprint we have in the US and the flexibility of our global network, we're identifying a number of ideas to adjust product sourcing and logistics flows to mitigate at least a part of the impact, some of which are no-regret moves regardless of where trade policies eventually settle. Overall, we have a solid game plan. We're executing well against our strategic priorities, and we're focused on long-term value creation for shareholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Anurag to talk through the details. Anurag?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nThank you, Bill. Turning to slide four, we had a strong start to the year, performing ahead of expectations on margins, earnings, and cash. On sales, we delivered a second consecutive quarter of positive organic growth across all three business groups, performing at the high end of the 1% to 1.5% range we provided in March. We saw strength in several of our key end markets and divisions, including electrical markets and industrial adhesives and tapes in SIBG, aerospace in TEBG, and consumer safety and well-being in CBG. We continue to see softer trends in auto, abrasives, and packaging and expression. Geographically, all regions grew year on year with the exception of Europe. China was up mid-single digits with strength in the industrial business and electronic bonding solutions, driven by share gains with key accounts and increased orders ahead of tariff actions.\nThe US was up low single digits despite the challenging macro backdrop, with continued high demand for cable accessories and strength in aerospace, partially offset by weakness in auto. Europe was down low single digits due to the continued weak environment, including a high single-digit decline in auto builds. On orders, we saw good momentum through the quarter, and our daily order rate grew by over 2%, resulting in a robust ending backlog that provides close to 25% of coverage as we enter the second quarter. Adjusted operating margins were 23.5%, up 220 basis points year on year. The operating income growth of $150 million at constant currency was driven by benefits from growth, lower restructuring cost, productivity, and TSA cost reimbursement, which was partially offset by our continued growth investments, timing of equity-based comp, and stranded cost.\nSIBG and CBG margin rates were up year on year, while TEBG was down as expected due to a challenging prior year comparison and inclusion of incremental stranded cost from the exit of PFAS manufacturing. The strong operational performance contributed $0.23 to earnings, which was partially offset by $0.06 of non-operational headwinds, including FX, resulting in adjusted EPS up $0.17, or 10% versus last year, to $1.88. Relative to our initial expectation of flat earnings growth in Q1, this $0.17 outperformance was driven by $0.10 of G&A efficiency while maintaining our growth investments and $0.07 of timing benefits related to spin and cost containment actions in the current quarter. We expect this $0.07 of timing items to be earnings neutral for the first half of the year.\nFree cash flow of approximately $500 million came in stronger than expected on the back of better earnings and disciplined CapEx spending. And we continue to have a balanced capital deployment, including returning $400 million to shareholders via dividends, and $1.3 billion in gross share buybacks, partially offset by higher-than-expected stock option exercise. I will provide a quick overview of our growth performance for each business group on slide five. Safety and Industrial organic sales grew 2.5% in Q1. This growth was broad-based, with five out of seven divisions posting positive growth. We saw particularly strong demand for cable accessories driven by construction of data centers and renewable energy projects. We also saw strength in Industrial and Electronics bonding solutions driven by continued share gains in structural adhesives from improved service and our focus on pipeline management driving higher closed one.\nWe also saw good momentum in personal safety as we continue to win key government contracts in the US and Europe. Auto aftermarket was down low single digits on the back of a market where collision repair claim rates are down high single digits year to date. Transportation and electronics adjusted sales were up 1.1% organically in the Q1. Aerospace delivered another quarter of double-digit growth from commercial aircraft and defense-related business with our strong value proposition in portfolios like films, bonding, and joining, and advanced materials grew high single digits driven by key project wins. The electronics business grew low single digits, softer than expected, driven by lower device demand. Our auto OEM business was down mid-single digits, reflecting continued weakness in auto builds, particularly in Europe and the US, which were each down high single digits year-on-year. Finally, the consumer business was up 0.3% organically in Q1.\nGrowth investments and new product innovation drove strength for filters, respiratory products, hearing protection, and Meguiar's AutoCare, partially offset by soft consumer spending, principally in Command and packaging expression. I will now share an update on our 2025 outlook trends on slide six. Starting with the macro environment, we see a softer outlook than the start of the year. Market forecasts have been lowered, reflecting weaker consumer spending and lower demand in industries such as auto and electronics. The blended GDP IPI 2025 growth was estimated to be 2.1% and has since come down to 1.8% for the year. We continue to believe we can grow above macro due to progress on all our commercial excellence initiatives and focus on new product introductions. However, due to the softer market, we're trending to the lower end of a 2% to 3% range.\nOn operating margins, due to the Q1 performance, we see upside to the midpoint of our margin and earnings guidance range. In terms of non-operational drivers, FX has been more favorable than expected. However, it is offset by share option exercise and a higher net interest. We expect the operational cadence of sales and EPS to be split equally between the first and second half in line with historical performance. On cash, we continue to expect approximately 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion. Additionally, to offset higher-than-expected share option exercise, we're increasing our gross share repurchases in 2025 to $2 billion versus the $1.5 billion discussed previously. As Bill pointed out, we have board authorization for $7.5 billion of repurchases, and we are prepared to be opportunistic in response to market conditions.\nAs you know, we are dealing with tariffs, and I'll provide a quantification of the tariff sensitivity on slide seven. Looking from left to right on the slide, our January guidance was for earnings of $7.60 to $7.90. As I earlier mentioned, given the Q1 strength, we are trending about $0.10 better operationally, while our non-operational is balanced between FX and below-the-line items. Our intention is to continue to drive for results, but we are early in the year, and given the current environment, we are taking a $0.10 contingency and maintaining our 760 to 790 EPS guidance. On the right, I provided a tariff sensitivity. I wanted to quantify the impact as we see it right now and outline our mitigation plan. As we have mentioned before, we import $1.6 billion into the US and export $4.1 billion from the US.\nChina is approximately 10% of the imports and slightly more on exports for a total trade flow of approximately $600 million between the US and China. These flows at the current tariff rates of 125% imports into China from US and 145% from China into US will equate to approximately $675 million of potential annualized tariff impact after anticipated exemptions. In addition, tariffs on products not qualified under USMCA, along with aluminum, steel, and other reciprocal actions, had approximately $175 million impact for a total annualized impact of approximately $850 million before any mitigation actions. Given that most of the tariffs were enacted recently and we typically carry 90 days of inventory, we expect only half of this impact this year, which is approximately $400 million or approximately $0.60 of EPS before any offsets.\nThe team has responded quickly and is working on a number of mitigation plans, including cost and productivity initiatives, optimizing production and logistics, including leveraging our US footprint and selective price increases where feasible. We believe we can partially offset the headwind for an estimated 2025 net impact of $0.20 to 0.40. We will keep you updated as the situation evolves. In the meantime, we are controlling what we can and focus on growth acceleration, strong margin expansion, and delivering strong shareholder returns in 2025. I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for remaining resilient through this environment. With that, let's open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to register a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw, please press star two. If you are using a speakerphone, please lift up your handset before entering your request. Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. We'll go first to Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all that color. Maybe we could start again, maybe a little bit on the macro side. Interesting commentary about the March exit rate, but obviously kind of post-liberation day, all eyes are on what happened in April. I assume that's encompassed in how you've guided here this morning, but maybe give us some color if you could on how things progressed as you moved out of the quarter into Q2 and whether that March activity you saw maybe felt or looked like some pre-buy sort of actions by your customers.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nGood morning, Jeff. It's Bill. I mean, first on the pre-buy, we saw maybe $10 million move from Q2 into Q1 primarily in China. So it was fairly minimal from our assessment on that part of the question. On just the trends, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, our Q1 order rates were up a little more than 2%. We ended backlog at the end of March up low teens. As Anurag mentioned, we have about 25% of our revenue in Q2 covered. As we turn the corner into April, we're seeing continued again, it's early, it's only half of the month, but we're seeing continued momentum in our industrial business and SIBG order rates, pretty similar to where they were in March, which is a bit higher than they were for the overall quarter. So they ended March pretty good and it continued into April.\nA little bit softer on TEBG. Again, it's a little bit early in the quarter, but maybe a little bit softer. Consumer typically starts a little bit weak. It's the start of a quarter. The retailers close the books at the end of April. So it's typically a slower month for us, but generally speaking, industrial in line with March. It just a tad softer in the other two businesses.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. Then just back to the tariffs, I appreciate that kind of build-up to what the gross impact was. That's some great color. Just when we think about, Bill, the levers you're going to pull here on the mitigation side, maybe just a little bit more color there, how much might be price, the ability for the market to actually take price. And I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit more on some of the moves you're making and some of the things you kind of characterize as no-regrets sort of moves.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah. So yeah, there's several things. I put it in maybe three buckets. One is, and we referenced this at kind of high level in the call here, the focus on sourcing and logistics actions. As you know, we've got 110 factories, 88 distribution centers. And at my comments, I talked about being at 58% utilization. So I guess the positive side of that is we have a lot of flexibility to move those assets up and down and move things across our network. So within sourcing and logistics, we can change our source of supply fairly quickly. And we're looking at those kinds of things. We're adjusting our trade flows, logistics flows, leveraging more bonded facilities, free trade zones, a little bit more point-to-point shipments on our logistics that we might have done before in terms of hub and spoke. We're optimizing where value add occurs across our network.\nSo where we might have been shipping a finished good, we may now ship a semi-finished good and do finishing in a different market, different country. We're looking at alternative production sites with different countries of origin to try to optimize the network and minimize the tariff impact on our business. So there's a bunch of things from a sourcing perspective that we're looking at. There are certain things we can do relatively quickly within the first couple of months. Some of the things actually are in flight today or have been enacted. There's others that won't take investment, but just take a little bit of time to qualify something. There's others that might take a little bit of investment, a little bit more time. That's likely to be more of a '26 help for us if we go forward with that.\nSeveral things we can do, some of which are being actioned today. The second big block is around discretionary cost actions we can take. There's a number of things that we're doing like we did in Q1, but still protecting the growth investments we're trying to make in the business. Then the third is selected surgical price actions. They could be in the form of surcharges depending upon the customer. Could be list price changes that might go into effect. They're going to be a bit more limited. But when I put those three pieces together, we talk about our $0.20 to $0.40 offsetting mitigating actions. At the high end of that range, it's probably about 50/50 between cost sourcing and pricing. At the low end, assumes some of the pricing doesn't stick. But we're continuing to work on that.\nThose are all the things I think we're doing, if you will, from a defensive perspective. But I'd remind you, there's some offensive opportunities here as well. We've got a very, very large US footprint. We can bring more things into the US. There are certain products that we compete against that come in from other regions around the world. And perhaps there's an offensive opportunity to take some share here. And we're looking very carefully at that as well, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. Thanks for all that color.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Scott Davis of Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI guess another way to kind of follow on to Jeff's question. I think there'll be lots of questions related. Is just, do you feel like you're more or less exposed than your kind of average competitor to the tariff risk? And perhaps that informs the ability to maybe get price, or if everybody's in the same boat and similarly exposed, then maybe it's a little bit easier to get price versus the alternative. But do you have any feel for that generally? I know you sell a lot of SKUs in a lot of different markets and a lot of different competitors, but is there a general why do you think about that?\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nNo, it's a good question, Scott. Look, we compete against different competitors, different companies across all of our business groups, and across all of our divisions within business groups. So it's going to be fairly mixed. Obviously, we do export $4 billion, as Anurag mentioned, the piece that goes into China. That's mainly for the electronics chain, but it's also for some domestic consumption as well. I wouldn't say it's any better or worse than where our competitors happen to be, but there are certain things we can do with the flexibility of our network that we can take advantage of cost and sourcing actions and then move strategically on what we try to do on pricing. We do see some of our competitors, some things have moved on the consumer side outside of the US, primarily China-sourced. We walked away from some of that business.\nSome of that might be private label today. And there might be some opportunities to pull back on this. But to push pricing is going to be different in every business that we're in. We have to make an assessment of the competitive nature of the business, how differentiated our product happens to be. And we're working very, very closely with all our partners. This is a we, not us versus them, but we're working together on what do we do to mitigate the impact that's hitting all of the companies. So a bit of a mixed bag, Scott, but I think in general, I think we're probably a little bit better positioned than a lot of our competitors.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Then as a natural follow-up, I mean, 3M is a global company, but it's a very American brand, at least that's the perception. Have you seen any kind of anti-American behaviors, purchasing behaviors from your customers, and biases to perhaps go in a different direction in certain areas? Or is that just something that we read about in the papers? It's not a real thing yet.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nWell, Scott, we haven't seen it yet. I mean, it's still early days, but we've not seen that. I'm not sure we're necessarily anticipating that. We do have very strong brands, very global brands. As you mentioned, a very strong position in the US. We've got 50 factories here and a big chunk of our supply base. And we do a lot of R&D here, but we've not seen so far any sort of any risk coming on us because of us being a US-based manufacturer, US-based brands.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Helpful. Best of luck this year, guys.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood luck.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the organic sales outlook first off. So I think you mentioned early on that maybe you're looking at around sort of 2% organic growth for the year in the current guide. And just wondered sort of when we're thinking about the balance of the year, are you assuming kind of steady organic growth around that sort of one and a half, 2% range each quarter through the rest of the year? Or do you think we see sort of a dip this quarter and then some improvement in the back half? Any color on that, and by the sort of segments, would be interesting.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nOkay. Hey, thanks, Julian. Anurag here. So just to start off with, what we said is we're trending towards the lower end of the range right now. But if you look at it through the course of the year, I think it's going to be pretty stable. So let me first probably just talk about the first half, and then we can talk about sequentially. So as I said in my prepared comments, we expect the operating cadence to be split equally between the first and second half. So on the sales side, this would actually imply that Q2 would be at or slightly better than Q1. And as we move into the second half, we should see a little bit of take. So I think it's pretty balanced between the two. As Bill mentioned, on the industrial side, we are seeing good growth momentum.\nWe saw that in Q1, and that should continue through the rest of the year. On the electronics, there are a couple of pockets of weaknesses around the macro side on electronics and auto. We saw that in Q1. So that could be a little bit lower than what we thought at the beginning of the year. And consumer, it's Q1 was kind of 0.3% or flattish growth, but we expect that to pick up through the course of the year. So to answer your question, not seeing a dip in Q2. On the back of the backlog coverage, we have the autos on the industrial side. We should kind of see this momentum continue through the course of the year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThat's very helpful. Thank you. And then just my second question around the tariff impact. So I think it's sort of in the in-year framework; it's sort of $0.60 gross headwind, $0.30 net headwind, potentially at the midpoint of that framework you gave. Any more details you could give us if it is around that middle of the middle type number? How do we think about the phasing of that $0.30 net headwind through the year? And also any color you could give on the impact by segment? Is it sort of better or worse in any division?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah. Again, listen, as we said, the tariffs started in February with non-USMCA aluminum steel, but the ones with the biggest impact started in April, particularly between US and China. And as I mentioned, we typically carry about 90 days of inventory. So we will see this impact mainly in the second half of the year. For the second quarter, we may see a couple of pennies here and there, a small impact, but that's within the guidance range of $0.76 to 0.79. So you'll see this impact in the second half of the year. Now, regarding the businesses and the segments, we'll probably give more color as we kind of go around here. What the team is, more importantly, if you take a step back, is working on actions very quickly across the buckets that Bill mentioned and what we can control.\nSo obviously, on the cost side, you'll see us control a little bit faster. Price will come in. And then the offensive strategy, you'll see more of the benefit come through towards the end of the year or next year. So you will see us mitigating this impact more as we go along through the course of the year into next year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Amit Mehrotra at UBS.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Morning. Anurag, just following up on the cadence, maybe with respect to EPS as opposed to organic sales. In the last couple of years, we've seen 10% or so sequential uplift in EPS. There's a lot of moving parts in terms of stock comp. I know there was a timing in terms of Q1, Q2 stock comp. There's obviously timing of other costs, and then tariffs, but I guess tariffs from more second half given the inventory. Could you just help us think about the cadence in light of all those moving parts as we think about EPS moving from Q1 into Q2 in the rest of the year?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nSure. Yeah. Absolutely, Amit. I mean, I already touched upon the sales, so I'll go more on the earnings side. So first, let me do the year-over-year between for Q2, and then I'll come to the sequential because, as you correctly said, a lot of moving pieces there. So the EPS growth year-over-year should be about $0.15 to $0.20 on the operational side because of the benefits from volume, restructuring costs, productivity, the lower equity comp that you referenced to. But as I mentioned in my prepared comments, there were some Q1 timing events, so that'll be partially offset. Increase in investments, but you see a big step up in Q2 relative to last year because we only started making investments in the second half of last year and the PFAS strategy costs. But operationally, you should see the up $0.15 to $0.20 on EPS.\nBut on the non-op side, we have a total headwind of about $0.10. And a large part of that is driven by net interest as the cash balance last year in Q2 was over $10 billion. And now we're returning back to more normal cash levels. So we will have some impact in non-op pension as well, but all of that will be offset by lower share count. But if you take the net interest pensions offset by the lower share count, it's about a $0.10 headwind year-over-year. So you put that together, we should grow EPS by about $0.05 to $0.10 year-over-year. Now, sequentially, you're correct; it's seasonally, revenue should be up about $300 million, which should come with good flow through. But as I said, there are some offsets around the timing of Q1 items. There is some step up in investments.\nSo what you will see is about $0.05 to 0.10, again, operationally, it should be good and $0.05 benefit from a little bit below the line. So sequentially, also, we should see about $0.10 to 0.15 benefit on the EPS. So overall, if you put all of that together, for the first half, our EPS will grow about $0.22 to 0.27, which is actually pretty much 50% of the growth of what we expect for the full year. And second half should kind of mirror that too.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nOkay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then I guess maybe one for Bill in terms of you obviously have a lot of efficiency actions that the company's pursuing. I wonder if what's happening now gives you an opportunity to accelerate some of those actions. If you can just talk about the opportunity that you see there, that'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nSo it's a good question, Amit. I mean, look, it's a challenging situation that we happen to be in. The environment's moving pretty quickly. But the team has responded very, very well. The actions that I've talked about. I talk about it in very large buckets, but the reality is this has to be done down at an SKU-by-SKU level based on a customer, a flow, a factory to a region. It's a very discrete analysis. And it's really helping us get into the sort of the bowels, if you will, of how we actually run the business. So it's pointing out some good opportunity to do some things differently and better. We have been focused on driving operational performance, operational excellence across the whole enterprise, including on our operations. I went through some of the metrics that we're focused on here. There's an environment that we're in.\nWe're trying to figure out a way to offset some of the tariff effects. But a lot of the things that we're doing are just running our game plan. It's driving on-time and in-full. I talked about that pretty extensively here, driving OEE or overall equipment effectiveness, improving that, driving productivity, driving cost-per-quality down. There's all of these various initiatives. It just puts a lot more focus and attention on. So is there more we can do? There might be simply because we're getting deeper into a deeper understanding of the trade flows and what's happening. But I think we've got a good game plan. It's executing well. You saw it in the margin improvement in Q1. It's also pointing out good opportunities to tighten down on G&A. So look, we're trying to make the best of the situation we're in and drive performance.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYeah. Very good. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nThank you, Amit.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nMorning.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nSo you guys had previously said, I think, negative $0.20 on Forex. What specifically are you now assuming for Forex year-over-year?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nHey, good morning, Steve. Anurag here. So expecting $0.15 right now or $0.05.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOf [inaudible]\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nOf headwind. From a $0.20 headwind to a $0.15 headwind.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOn Forex.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nCorrect. Yeah.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nWhat are you using for your euro rate?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nOkay. So we snapped it at the end of March. So that was around a 108, 109 level, right? It has moved up since then. I guess where you're going is that with FX moving at this rate, why is there only $0.05? So maybe let me just kind of take a step back and say when we gave the guidance in January, we said operationally we'll go $0.85 at the midpoint, and we had $0.40 broken into $0.20 between FX and $0.20, which was non-op. On the FX, as you said, we assume about $0.20 over there. Now, we rerun the forecast at the end of the quarter, and now the FX headwind on the revenue from 2% has become 1.5%, which translates into $0.15 of headwind. But if the US dollar continues the way it is, this headwind should definitely reduce.\nBut as you know, not all FX rates move in the same direction. And actually, in some cases, we are in a net cost position. But if they continue to go where they are, we should see upside in the FX. And that is the reason why we split the operational and the non-operational, which includes FX in our earnings bridge, because we want to drive on the operational side of the business. And if there is upside on FX, we'll share it as we go along.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nRight. So I guess on the non-op side, the non-op, non-FX, then there's really not much change there because there's really not much change in the underlying FX assumption.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nThat is correct.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThat's the point.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah, that is the point. There's a $0.01 or $0.02 here in each of the items, but not material change. For example, on interest rates, right? We had assumed about two cuts this year. There could be three or four cuts, is what we are hearing. So we've kind of calibrated for that, which is low-end interest income. On pension, there's a $0.01 or $0.02 here because of the stock option exercise. Share repurchases are a $0.01 or $0.02. So it's not very material, but the $0.05 that we have assumed in the FX improving is probably mitigated by these other items. But if FX continues the way it is, there should be net upside and below the line.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Okay. And then, just lastly on China, could you just, are there sales there that you could just walk from? I mean, I know you guys export a decent amount there, obviously. I just don't know how critical those are to your customers. I mean, is that an option for the exports from the US to China? I don't know how much a part of that 850 that actually is, but is there an option to just walk from those sales?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nI'd say, Steve, I don't think it's an option of walking from the sales. We have a very strong business in China. We have important domestic and export customers in China. I think we do have some opportunities to shift around our network to bring product into China from other regions that don't have the same sort of tariff effect. I'll give you just an example. Today, we ship products from the US to China that we could also instead ship from Europe into China and then perhaps backfill that volume in the US to where those factories in Europe were directing their products. So there's things we can do to mitigate some of this impact and preserve the relationship and the great business we have in China. Again, it's 10% of our company. It grew double digits last year. We had solid mid-single digit Q1.\nWe follow our international customers there, where they manufacture in China, or moving more there, or moving to other different regions. So we want to be there to support them. But there's some things we can do on our end, just in terms of sourcing, to try to mitigate some of that impact.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nAll right. Makes a ton of sense. Thank you.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nThank you, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Hate to be a bore, but a few more tariff questions. Are there any pricing impacts as a result of these excessive China tariffs? So there's increasing concerns around supply chain sort of impacts here. Shipments not being made, so it will be imposed in light of kind of news flow. Is there any risk that your supply chain could be impacted by shippers just not making their shipments because of the tariffs?\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nNigel, we've not seen anything like that yet. We haven't heard any word of that. We've seen no disruption, no supplier hesitant at the moment to ship to us. We've not actually seen much push onto us in terms of pricing. These things will evolve over the balance of the year, but I've read a lot about what you're suggesting. We have not yet seen that in our business.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's good news. And then, Anurag, just to double confirm, the 50/50 comment on EPS is based on the 775 midpoint, and then the second half would be whatever lands in terms of net tariffs. Is that right?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nThat is correct.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. And then just a quick one on cash flow, again, with the tariffs. Does that put more of a backend load on cash flow because you have to pay the tariffs on day one?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nNo, not really. I mean, if you look at the cash flow, we actually did quite well for Q1 as well. Typically, it's a low quarter for us. Net income is about $1 billion. We consume about $300 million of working capital as we build up inventory. We enter Q2, which is, seasonally, a high quarter, and then we have bonus payments, AIP payments of about $300 million. So that gets about $400 million, but we did better because of discipline, CapEx spending, and receivables. What we're seeing going out is, in terms of areas we are definitely focusing on, the DSO and the AP payments as well. Right now, we're not really seeing a material change in that. We're continuing to manage it.\nSo I don't expect to be a little more pressure in the second half of the year, and we'll probably have a good cadence on cash flow growth as we go through the course of the year.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes. Good morning.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nJust another question on tariffs. Are you modeling any demand destruction related to tariffs in your core guide? Right. Because as prices go up, as you need to substitute things that sort of drives the economic model, we'll tell you it will drive some demand destruction on the margin. Are you thinking about it, or you're just sort of modeling the volume based on your kind of economic forecast?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah. And Anurag here, so the tariff impact is all about the tariff cost impact sensitivity that we've shown. Obviously, because of the tariffs, the market's been a little bit weaker, so that's why we said we're trending lower on that range. But other than that, no, we have not modeled anything more.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah. But Andrew, just to be clear on the pricing, we're trying to be pretty smart, strategic, and surgical about this. And we're not doing this without interaction with our customers. In many cases, when we put out a surcharge, it's through consultation with a distributor or a customer. There's some receptivity to a certain amount based upon the individual customer for a period of time. There's an understanding that that volume won't deteriorate. If we start to get to a point later in the year where we feel like we ought to be pushing price out to accommodate or offset more of the tariff risk and there's a volume impact, we're going to have to sort of take that under consideration. But the team has been very smart and surgical about how we do this.\nSo outside of the macro erosion, we're not expecting much demand deterioration from a volume perspective because of the way we're being smart about pricing.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nJust a follow-up question on buyback. It seems that the buyback is there because folks are exercising their options. Why not be more aggressive? You're doing a lot of good stuff operationally. It seems a lot of momentum that's long-term underway. Why not just take advantage of the stock weakness and be more aggressive on stock buyback? What's the board's and your thinking on that?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah. And Anurag here, it was just a little bit more on the timing side. Let me give you some colors. So as we ended last year, two years out of the past 10 years, options were in the money. And the 2015 options, which expired this year, were not in the money. And in February, they came into the money. So that was a one distinct exercise incident that happened and a couple more which came in the money. So it was more around that as opposed to we're seeing accelerated options being exercised. It was more timing of the 2015 options.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nBut I think to your point, Andrew, I think Anurag mentioned in his remarks, we have a $7.5 billion authorization, went from $1.5 to 2 billion, and we have the optionality to go bigger than that if we need to in the back half of the year based on the situation we happen to have in our business. So Anurag will make the right call as we get out of the quarter into later on in the year.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nI appreciate the answer. Thanks so much.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nGood morning.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust a couple on the outlook within the margin puts and takes. Have you guys actually shifted the G&A productivity expectation for the full year? And same question on growth investments and anything major to highlight on the timing of those if they've shifted at all between quarters?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah. So firstly, on the growth investments, I think we're keeping track. We said we're going to increase by $225 million. The first quarter was around $15 million, and it's a big step up in the second quarter. And we take that cadence as we go along. And you can see that actually in the R&D numbers for the first quarter. As a percentage of revenue, last year was 4.2%. This year is 4.8%. So you see a step up of 60 basis points. And all the other initiatives that Bill was talking about on commercial excellence, we are funding that. On the G&A side, listen, if you roll through our Q1 performance, which we said was $0.17 more than what we expected, $0.10 was more on G&A efficiency and FX, $0.07 of that was G&A. And the remaining part was timing.\nThat was more structural and permanent, right? In the Investor Day, we spoke about we have $2 billion of G&A. Outside that, we also have indirect expense. Late last year, what we started doing, a lot of these external services, for example, were done locally. We pulled it centrally, tried to see if they align with the strategic priorities. If yes, if not, we don't spend. If they do align, then how can we leverage our global buy to kind of get a better rate? We saw some benefits of that in the Q1, and we kind of expect that to probably increase as we move through the course of the year. So we have taken a little bit of a hedge in our guide. As you can see, the Q1 has upside, but we've taken a $0.10 hedge.\nIf we were not to have the $0.10 hedge, then I would say that you should see at least the $15 million of G&A improvement in Q1 flow through the rest of the year.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay. Got it. Thanks, Anurag. That's clear. Just a follow-up on a couple of your market expectations because there's a lot of movement in these two in particular. What are you guys thinking for auto builds and electronics for 2025?\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nSo right now, auto builds, it came down very recently in recent IHS data. It's down, I think, 1.8% global auto builds now. I think it's down about 9% in the US, so pretty big erosion for that from the middle of March. I think middle of March was like 4.5%. It's down 9% now at the latest estimate for the year. I mean, Europe is down around 4% or 5% for the year. I think China is up modestly. That's for the full year. I think from what I heard recently, about 1.5 million units came out of the full year auto build forecast. And that's what's reflected under numbers. We expect our auto OE business to be down mid-single digits both in the quarter and for the year. So that's already modeled into our expectations. Consumer electronics, we think it's probably going to be up low single digits.\nThat's kind of where we were at in Q1. We think it's about that, flat to up low single digits for the year. There might have been a little bit of stockpiling in the channel in Q1, but the reality is we see that to be kind of modest growth, flattish to modest growth for us for this year.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, Bill. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Andrew Kaplowitz at Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi",
    "content2": "I just wanted to ask you about TEBG margin. In Q1, it still looked like it was under still a bit of pressure as it was in Q4. I know you said that that's a segment that's absorbing PFAS-stranded costs, but you also said you expect to grow margin, I think, in all three segments, at least before the tariff impact. So maybe you can give some more color into what's happening in that segment with the issue of just the lower electronics volume or something else.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. So we do expect all three business groups to expand their margins for 2025. In the Q1, we did expect TEBG to be lower. You got the drivers correct. The biggest one is the PFAS-stranded costs and higher investments that we made. But also, it was mixed. If you look at Q1 last year, electronic sales, which is a higher margin business, was quite good in TEBG for the Q1r of last year. And that obviously mix has shifted. So it was a little bit of a mixed impact more in the quarter. But as we go through the year, we do expect all three business groups' margins to expand. We looked at this quarter, for example. SIBG had very healthy margin expansion. So did CBG, and that should continue.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nIt's helpful. I think, Bill, we're all trying to figure out sort of what's going on in the macro. You mentioned your industrial businesses are holding up reasonably well in terms of order growth through April so far, kind of in line with March. As you know, some of the recent regional manufacturing surveys are starting to look a little weaker. It doesn't seem like you're seeing it. Just trying to get your thoughts, talking to customers, you still expect things to hold up even with these surveys starting to look a little weaker?\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nSo it's still very early in the quarter. All of the conversations our teams are having with our customers, distributor channel partners, things to be reasonably solid, at least through the beginning part of April. It's continued from where we were in the month of March. We're watching a lot of these regional indicators like you are. Clearly, things are softening. But it's interesting when we talk to our channel partners about inventory in the channel; generally speaking, it's fairly normalized. We've not seen anything kind of moving from Q2 into Q1 in terms of adding to inventory, adding to stocks. It's fairly normal. So we don't think there's a correction that's happening. Sort of the elongation of orders that we had articulated about a month ago, we see that continuing here in the month of April.\nSo what might have been a 45- or 50-day sort of cycle time now is stretching out a little bit longer. That's one of the things that impacted us in Q1. We saw in February orders that were just pushing out into Q2. We still see a bit of that activity. But the indicators, the macro indicators that we're seeing, still look okay for the industrial business. But again, we're watching it very carefully.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nMorning, Joe.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nCan you just talk about kind of tactically how you approach imports from China and when you think about that 160 million or so, I think, that you were talking about? Just the timing of that. You've got some inventory that you're sitting on. Are you sort of pausing orders right now, kind of waiting for better information, just given the fluid nature of what we're seeing on the tariff headline front?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah. So Joe, Anurag, we're not pausing any orders or any shipments right now. We have 90 days of inventory, which will bleed through by the end of June. And then you'll start seeing the impact of the tariff on the imports after that. So we're not slowing down anything on the business side. What we are looking at is, as Bill earlier mentioned, around sourcing, logistics, discretionary cost, as well as pricing. So that's the way we are tactically approaching it right now. And pricing, for example, in some cases, you can put a surcharge. In some cases, you need to come up with a new list price. So we're working depending upon the situation, keeping in mind that we still business is going on as it was.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah. A lot is coming in from China for consumer that passes through the channel to pretty large retailers. And we're having lots of conversations with them on that. But we're not, at the moment, pausing or stopping any imports from China. And actually don't anticipate doing that.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nJust your comment there to make sure I understood it correctly, there would be kind of a higher weighting of exposure on those imports from China to the consumer side of the business.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nOn that element of the tariff impact that Anurag articulated, yes, it would be more on the consumer business, correct.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThen just one on the guidance side of the corporate and unallocated, and other items for operating profit. I think corporate and unallocated initially $25 to 50 million loss, other $50 to 100 million income. The quarter, I think, looked a little better than we anticipated on the corporate side. But any updates or any changes to that initial expectation on those items?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nYeah. It's probably trending more towards the higher end. And because corporate, just to take a step back, contains obviously the enterprise governance-related costs. So there's G&A costs. There's also the Solventum transition agreements that are sitting in there. So on the G&A side, clearly there were some areas that we did in the Q1. So that helps it to go towards the higher end of the range. But on the spin-related items, it's mainly timing between Q1 and Q2.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nCFO, 3M\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments.\n\nBill Brown\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nWell, thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I want to thank again all the 3Mers for their continued hard work and their dedication delivering value for our customers and our shareholders. I know we covered a lot of moving parts today, but we're focused on executing against our key priorities. We're going to update you on our progress at the next earnings release in July. Thank you very much and have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time."

Finally, we delivered free cash flow of $4.9 billion, or 111% conversion, which included net working capital improvement of eight days and returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2024. Please turn to slide nine as we look into our 2025 guidance. As Bill indicated, we expect organic sales growth of 2% to 3, earnings per share of $7.60 to 7.90, representing growth of 4 to 8%, and free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%, all on an adjusted basis. We expect all business groups to grow low single digits, which is in line with or above macro.\nWe expect this higher growth trajectory to be supported by a focus on commercial excellence, improvement in service levels, and new product launches. We have largely moved past product portfolio prioritization headwinds, and the small amount that remains is incorporated into our guidance and won't be specifically called out going forward. Our EPS growth is anchored by margin expansion in a range of 130 to 190 basis points, which reflects our relentless focus on operational excellence.\nAdjusted free cash flow conversion is expected to be approximately 100%, driven by strong operating income growth and a focus on working capital management. Adjusted CapEx of approximately $1 billion will be in line with depreciation and amortization. Let me take a minute to walk through the EPS drivers for 2025 on slide 10. We expect EPS growth of 4% to 8, driven by operational performance that is partially offset by non-operational headwinds.\nWe are confident that our focus on operational excellence will contribute $0.70 to 1, or 10% to 14 to adjusted EPS growth. This growth will come from volume, restructuring, and net productivity, more than offsetting growth investments and stranded costs. We expect non-op headwinds of approximately $0.40, half from FX due to recent strengthening of the US dollar and the other half from below-the-line items, including pension expense, net interest, and tax, partially offset by share buyback. We plan for a gross share repurchase program in 2025 to be approximately $1.5 billion.\nPutting all this together, we expect strong operating performance and capital deployment to drive EPS growth. As we think about the cadence through the year, we expect sales and EPS to be split equally between the first and second half, in line with historical trends. Within the first half, we expect Q1 sales growth to be similar to Q4, and earnings will reflect the annual equity grants, which last year were deferred to Q2.\nThis will result in Q1 earnings being similar to that of last year, and we expect sequential improvement into Q2 as we lap the Solventum spin items, with earnings being approximately equal between the two halves. I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the strong finish to the year, and I'm confident in our ability to deliver another strong year in 2025 with growth acceleration, strong margin expansion, and return cash to our shareholders in excess of $3 billion. With that, let's open the call for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to register a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw, please press Star two. If you are using a speakerphone, please lift up your handset before entering your request. Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThank you. Good morning, Bill and Anurag. Just on the top line in particular, Bill, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of to what degree sort of the operational execution, product development has actually impacted the top line already versus what you expect to kind of play out in 2025, just thinking of some of these product launches and the like came later in the year. So perhaps we could start there.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we were very pleased with the acceleration and new product introductions, as I mentioned in my remarks, came in above expectations, in fact, quite a bit above expectations. But it's still very early. A lot of the products that we're launching are what we call Class 3, so they're incremental. So year one sales on these products are going to be somewhat light, and it'll grow over time over the next several years.\nMore importantly, as we grow our NPI launches next year by double digit, we shift to more what I call high-octane or Class 4 type products, which have more sales capability. We'd likely see more impact on the top line from these launches. It's an important dimension. I think the team has built momentum. It's part of the governance process. A lot of it's the enthusiasm of the team.\nSome of it is shifting some resources around. We added 50 people in Q4, and we moved about another 100 people into R&D development in the quarter. So we're on the right track. This is a good sign. We've got to see it turn into reasonable and substantial margin and income over time. But whatever we see in terms of the launches, it's built into the two to three guidance we see next year.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. And then maybe just one for Anurag. A lot of conversation last year as we were all trying to fine-tune our models on kind of the restructuring versus stranded costs and the like. Just wonder within that $0.70 to 1 bridge item, Anurag, if you could give us a little bit of granularity on restructuring investments and stranded costs in particular.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nOkay. Good morning, Jeff. Sure. Let me do that. And probably what I'll do is I'll break the pieces to the bridge. So at the midpoint of our EPS guidance, we are growing 10% to 14, excluding the non-op items, which is quite strong relative to the midpoint of organic growth. So there are three factors for that. One of them is sales volume, which creates significant volume leverage as well as incrementals. So at 2.5% volume growth at the midpoint of the guidance and 35% incrementals, that's about $200 million or so.\nSecond is the lower restructuring cost to your specific question. That's about $200 million tailwind into 2025. So that's another $200 million. And finally, on the net productivity, that's about $150 million as well. And lots of pieces in that. The PFAS stranded cost is a negative $100 million. We're making some growth investments as well, but offsetting that as overall net productivity through the factories, through our SG&A function as well. So you put all the three buckets together, it's about $550 million of margin improvement.\nFX is offsetting about $125 million of that or so. So the $425 million is at about at the midpoint, about 160 basis points of margin expansion. So those are the three big pieces driving the operational growth of $0.70 to 1.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you for that. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning. Good morning, guys.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nThanks for the shorter presentation too. Hey, Bill, you mentioned the quota pull forward. I think you mentioned something about some changes in the sales organization. But if we just back up a little bit, perhaps you could just frame kind of what you're trying to change with the sales organization and maybe a little bit more detail on what exactly does that mean when you talk about a quota pull forward as far as trying to drive growth.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So it's a great question. Thank you for that. When I laid out the original plan around driving top-line growth, the basis is around driving more innovation. That's going to take time. I commented on that a little while before. Growth in the near term is going to come from selling more of what we have on the market today. That's an important dimension to this, which is just the more aggressiveness in our front-line sales and marketing resources. They're dealing with, right now, not a lot of new things to say to the customers because we haven't been innovating as much.\nOur on-time and full performance out of the factories has not been that great. It's improving, but it has not been that great. So the sales force is challenged in some ways to sell. I think they've been on their back feet in some ways. I think what Chris and the team at SIBG and others across the company are doing is really leaning into this. What we're trying to push for is making sure that the sales leaders, the sales reps out in the field, they know what they're expected to do in 2025 early in the year.\nThey're getting out of the gates 1 January with their quota, their targets, and specific things around closed-won wins. Typically, that would have been in early April when it rolls out. That's why Q1 might not have had some momentum. A little more structure around how the sales managers and area leaders are working in terms of their cadence, reviewing progress with their sales reps. That's quite important.\nSome of the other dimensions that we're pushing on here is around cross-selling. It's a pilot. It's six combination pairs that we've done, six or eight different distributors. So it's small pieces here. But in December, we saw some pretty good momentum building. And I'm pretty optimistic that over this year and next that there's going to be some benefits for cross-selling. We're working on pricing, reinstituting some price corridors, and changing our governance process around pricing.\nSo when you step back, I think all of this gets back to the original premise was we've got to get better at selling what we have today on the marketplace. And that's where the back end of 2024 and then most of 2025 is going to come from, which is why I think it's important to investors to understand that piece. The NPI will come over time. I'm very confident about that. But we've got to get better at selling more what we have on the market today.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nMakes sense, Bill. And just I think when you talk about on-time and full, it seems very fundamental. But in theory, if you had 100% on-time and full, would your growth rate be 100 basis points higher, 200 basis points higher? Is there any way to kind of narrow that down?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, it's hard to quantify, Scott. It's a good question. Clearly, running at 88% is not where we need to be. We're running around 93, a little over 93% in consumer. We should be in the high 90s. That's the expectation of some of the big-box retailers. So we're getting there. We're doing better there. We're over 90% in the transportation business. That's good. It should be better. The concern really is in SIBG, the safety and industrial business, in the low 80s. We're definitely losing business for sure there. We are not delivering.\nWhen somebody needs something right now and we don't have it available, that is causing them to go someplace else, even though we have a better brand, sometimes a better product, an attractive price. So it is costing us sales. I do know that as a fundamental part of driving top line, we've got to get better at executing the supply chain and making sure we meet our customers' expectations.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. That's a lot. Thank you, guys.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning, Nigel.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGood morning. Bill, you sound a little skeptical about the 1.9% IPI forecast just based on that's where we were this time last year. So I'm just wondering, when you went through the plan process, looked at the bottoms-up kind of projections from the businesses, and then you overlaid that with the top-down, what kind of haircuts have you taken to that 1.9%? And that brings me on to my next question, well, the real question, I guess. What have you baked in for pricing in 2025? And then just going forward, what is the sort of framework here? Is it IPI plus price?\nIs it IPI multiplied by some kind of factor plus price? I mean, any way to think about that growth function going forward?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nSo it's a good question. I don't think we're going to deconstruct the elements of growth between price, volume, share gain, and other parts of it. But look, we did enter 2024 with an expectation IPI was going to be a bit better, and it softened through the year. There was an expectation of auto builds, and that softened quite a bit in the back end of the year. As we were three months ago thinking about IPI in 2025, it was higher than we actually are sitting at today. It was around 2.4%. The auto build was, at that point in time, higher expectation for 2025 than we sit here today.\nSo these indicators, they're just that. They're indicators. And we use them. It's an important dimension. But it's sort of a starting point. Of course, we've done a bottoms-up review of our business. We feel confident that 2% to 3 is the right place to be. When you look at a blended macro between IPI and GDP, because we're about 80% weighted to IPI, 20% to GDP, it's around 2.1. So the center point at 2.5 is a little bit above the macro.\nWe know that some of the initiatives we're putting in place around commercial execution, new product development, getting our factories run a bit better. Those are all very important dimensions. But Nigel, again, we're two, three weeks into the year. We've got a new administration in Washington. There's lots of conversations floating around tariffs. We'll see as the year goes by both progress and traction of some of the initiatives we have internally, plus what happens in the macro, and we'll update investors accordingly.\nSo right now, we feel good about 2% to 3 is the right place to start in 2025.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks, Bill. And then, Anurag, to you. Thanks for the details on the margin bridge. The 150 of net productivity, that appears to be mainly the payback on the restructuring actions in 2024. So I'm just wondering if there's anything from some of the more structural drivers, such as improving OEE, improving footprint, supply chain, etc.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. There is. So let me break up the $150 in a little bit more detail. So first, just on the headwinds over there. So I said it was $100 million of stranded costs. The incremental investments we are making as well, which is about $225 million. Some we did in 2024, some in 2025. It's both a carryover as well as in-year. So if you add the two together, it's about $325 is $350 million. Now, offsetting that, you're correct. There is probably $70 million of restructuring benefits, about $280 million.\nBut then to get to the positive 150, we're driving about more than $400 million of net productivity. And that is coming through, again, through supply chain, be it procurement, more on the G&A efficiency, and a few of the other areas that Bill has spoken about. So overall, I would say the productivity driving is $450 million. That's being offset by all these other line items to get us to 150.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nHey, good morning, everyone.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nBill, you had mentioned in the conference circuit in December that you saw a bit of an uptick in industrial demand in Q4. Did that continue into January here? Do you think it was just related to pre-buy ahead of tariffs? Or could it have been a reflection of maybe some modest recovery in short-cycle markets? How would you characterize it?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So we did see, I'd say, across the industrial part of the portfolio, and that was referring to the consumer side, but the industrial part of the portfolio, we did see order rates. First of all, they're very steady through the quarter, which I think was very positive. They were a tick higher than they were in Q3. The order rates were somewhat higher than the growth rate, organic growth rate in the quarter. So there's a bit of backlog that was built into 2025. Those were all good indicators. But we are a shorter-cycle business, so we don't really live off backlog.\nIt's more of a book and ship type business. But there's small little indicators. It was pretty broad-based. There was no specific region or business that was the driver of it. That also is somewhat encouraging. Again, I contrast that to where we were in Q4 of 2023, where I think there was a pretty dramatic tail off in orders towards the back end of December, which got the team a little bit shaken in some ways. We did not see that happen here.\nSo those are all good indicators, which is why when we look at 2%, 2.1% organic growth in Q4, that we feel that that's a good floor, if you will, for 2025. But I think it's good news. It's holding steady and a reflection of some modest improvements in the industrial markets. But again, it's kind of early days.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nCouple. And then, Anurag, can you give more color into 2025 margin guidance by segment, and then also comment on T&E margin in particular in Q4 2024, as it seemed a little weak in Q4 versus the other segments?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So first, let me talk about Q4, and then I'll get into 2025. So overall, Q4 came in better than expected across from our expectations, what we gave in the October guide, across all the three segments. And as I noted in my prepared comments, it's probably $0.05 higher than where a midpoint of a guide was because of volume and productivity, with FX being the big headwind in the quarter, which was unexpected.\nNow, on TEBG, we did expect the margins to be lower in Q4, seasonally, of course, between Q3 and Q4 because of under absorption as we clear out inventory. So that was a big reason. And if you look between Q3 and Q4, sequentially, we improved inventory by eight days. So that clearly has an absorption issue. Second is we started making growth investments, which we are seeing in the revenue right now. That was a driver for it. And FX and TEBG does have a fair amount of business outside the US, so that impacts it as well.\nWe put all these three things together. The margin is lower. It actually came in better than what we expected. Overall, if I look at all the three business groups for 2024, the margins came in a little bit better than expected. As we go into 2025, we're probably not giving guidance right now, very specific to each of the segments. The 130 to 190 range that we gave in terms of margin expansion, we expect all the three business groups to grow quite a bit. TEBG could be a little bit lighter than the other two because of the PFAS stranded costs. A large part of it is in TEBG.\nBut having said that, we expect good margin expansion across all the three business groups.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nVery helpful, guys. Thank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just the first question, trying to understand the sort of operating margin expansion framework. So you talked about, I think, Anurag, $450 million of overall productivity improvement in 2025. In the past, or recent past, let's say, Bill, you've talked about that sort of 250, 260 COGS productivity number as a sort of annual placeholder. So just trying to understand the kind of delta between that. I'm guessing 450 is not a medium-term placeholder because you have some extra savings this year from the 2023 plan.\nBut maybe just help us understand sort of how to think about productivity on top of that 35% core leverage placeholder.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nSure. So Julian, you're correct. What we have said is on the COGS line, 2% net productivity, which is about $250 million. The productivity which I'm talking about is overall for the company, which also includes SG&A, other parts of the business as well. It also has one quarter of the TSA reimbursement, which overlaps over there too, right? So those are the pieces which takes us to $450 million.\nI mean, we'll provide more on the Investor Day in terms of the framework looking forward, but I think our goal is still to get 2% net productivity in COGS and even on SG&A line to see whatever productivity we can get to offset inflation and other investments that we are making.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nThanks a lot. I'll leave other medium-term questions for that event. So maybe just on the very short term, Anurag, I think you'd mentioned sort of 170-ish of EPS adjusted in Q1. The first half is just under $4, though, I think, based on that 50% comment. So you've got a decent sequential step up in the second quarter in EPS. Maybe just any very large puts and takes. It seems like organic growth, pretty steady year on year, but anything you're calling out, the sort of Q1 to Q2 delta.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. So let me break it up into two parts. One is some discrete items in the first quarter, and then second is on the recurring operational performance and non-op impact, which you should see through the year. On the discrete items, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, due to the Solventum spin, there were a few pieces, but a large part of it was the equity-based compensation, which I called out last year. We accrued in the second quarter. And as this year, as we're returning back to historical trends, we'll be accruing it in the first quarter.\nThis is about a $0.15 headwind in the first quarter, which becomes a tailwind in the second quarter. On the operational side, we'll see good flow through from volume, lower restructuring costs, TSA absorption, all the productivity that we spoke about, which will offset PFAS stranded and mixed headwind, and also all the growth investments. So this should be about $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS growth in the quarter. On the non-op, we have $0.40 for the year. So the first quarter is probably going to be closer to $0.08 to 0.10.\nSo if you put all these items together, Julian, you've got $0.20 to 0.25 of operational EPS growth. You minus the $0.08 to 0.10 of non-op and the $0.15 of equity-based com. So the earnings are flat to Q1 of last year. Now, as you move into the second quarter, if we continue the similar trajectory on operating performance and the non-op headwind, it will be $0.10 to 0.15 of EPS growth.\nAnd then you add back the $0.15 of the equity-based compensation. So the growth in Q2 would be closer to $0.25 to 0.30. So that's the bridge between Q1 and Q2. And then to your math, the first half and second half should be fairly equal in terms of EPS.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst of US Industrials, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nHey, good morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nCould you just talk a little bit about, I'm not sure you mentioned it before, but the price assumption for this year?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nNo, we've not talked about that. I don't think we're going to disaggregate organic growth. And it's embedded in the 2% to 3. I think, as we said before in the past, we do get price increases. The price increases cover material cost inflation. And I expect it to be in a similar magnitude in 2025, but we're not going to sort of give that specific number here today.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nIs that a net positive, or you're just covering it?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nNo, it'll be a net positive in this year. Yeah.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Then just one follow-up on the T&E segment in Q4: margin was a little bit weaker than we were expecting. Anything in particular going on there in Q4?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nNo. In fact, as I mentioned earlier, Steve, it's probably a little bit better than expected. Nothing unusual. It's a combination of seasonality as you bring inventory down, some growth investments we made. But as you move into 2025, you should see margin expansion again in TEBG. TEBG was actually our highest margin expansion segment in 2024 by growing over 220 basis points. So I would say nothing unusual other than the fourth quarter, just timing of different things.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nSorry, one more. Just on the corporate side, a little bit lower in expense this year. How does that look going forward? Is that a sustainable number in the model going forward into 2026, 2027, the corporate side?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. We'll talk about 2025 right now first, Steve. Just on 2025, two pieces over there, both equal halves. It's about $60 million each. One is just a reallocation between corporate and the business group. It's the one last quarter of overlap over there because we did it for nine months of the year. So one is just a reallocation. And the second is covering the TSA absorption cost of $60 million. So those are the only two pieces on corporate.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. All right. Thanks a lot.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, yes. Good morning. How are you?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nGood, Andrew. Good morning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYeah. Can we just talk about free cash flow, good improvement of free cash flow conversion this year? As we think about next year, this squiggly line 100% free cash flow conversion, what kind of working capital benefit do you have dialed in? And what are their offsets in terms of cash flow to keep it at 100% because you do have working capital release program? And I would have expected that you could deliver over 100% quite sustainably for a number of years.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. Thanks for the question. Yeah. We did very well in 2024, as you could see, 111% conversion, very good on the working capital as well, where we improved the cash conversion cycle by eight days. It's early days right now in 2025. The reason we put 100% conversion is one is CapEx is in line with depreciation. We're kind of doing invest on the growth side as well as sustainability. So CapEx in line with depreciation. On the working capital, two things.\nAs revenue goes up, obviously, we're going to consume more on the receivable side, but we're continuing to offset it by inventory. Our goal is to get to 75 days. We showed good progress in 2024. We'll continue that in 2025. Now, we strive to do better than that. So as the year goes by, if we do better on inventory to offset the DSO impact, there could be more than 100%. But that's the number we're going to start with and move from there.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. And just a question on abrasives and industrial specialties. It seems to be a sort of nice canary in the coal mine, short-cycle business. It's been consistently declining for a while. You do sound more optimistic. But if you look at these numbers, they seem to be relatively flat for the past four to six quarters. Any visibility there? When do they turn positive? What are you seeing in the channel? What are you seeing at inventory levels at OEMs? I know auto is probably a decent market there, but just more color as to when do you think these businesses could turn? Thank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nSo good question. I mean, so both businesses in the year were down low single digits. They're very different. Industrial specialties is a grouping of lots of different pieces. Some are growing, some are not. Overall, it's been declining. But we see that flattening out and starting to grow over time. On the abrasive side, we should see a better 2025 than 2024. Part of it is because of the industrial economy. Part of it is because of the launch of a new product offering called Cubitron 3 that we launched over the last year.\nIt's now moving into a variety of different instantiations of different abrasive products. It's growing. It's got tremendous differentiation versus competitors. So we feel very positive about that. So we see that getting a little bit better here in 2025. Part of it is because of the new products being introduced. We think it's going to both turn the corner here in 2025.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nBut no commitment Q1, Q2, nothing specific like that.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nIt's a little bit granular. We'll come out. We probably can say more about this at the investor day when Chris talks about the individual components of his business, but nothing more today. You asked about the inventory in the channel. That's been pretty normalized. There's not any significant concerns one way or the other about inventory in the industrial channel. So that's not really the big driver here.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGreat. I appreciate it. See you in February. Thank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nThanks. Morning, everybody. Anurag, one of the things that obviously stood out to me is the expectation for profit growth to be well in excess of revenue growth for this year. You obviously provided a very helpful walk around how we get there. But as we're coming up in kind of late February, we think about the multi-year outlook. Do we expect a high level of incrementals to be sustainable?\nIt doesn't have to be over 100%, but can we expect a higher level of incrementals kind of on a sustainable basis as some of these cost initiatives have legs? And I also assume cash flow is going to grow in excess of earnings growth over the next several years. If you could just talk about that, and I'm trying to square that with a 2025 buyback guide that's a little bit lower than what you kind of exited at from a run rate perspective.\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nRight. Good morning, Amit. Thanks for the question. So an investor day will provide a framework as we look out at the medium term as to what's kind of going to drive the sales growth. And from the sales, are we going to get gross margin expansion, which is going to flow through to the bottom line? So you're absolutely correct. We will provide that framework as we get into the end of the month in February. Yeah.\nOn the cash flow side, listen, as growth, as we continue to grow, that is going to be a drag on receivables. But we have put an inventory goal out there for 2025. We feel there's a good path for us to get there. We're executing well towards that. And it's 100% conversion. If you look historically at 3M, it's been around there. But going forward, depending on revenue being the big variable, yeah as well, but on inventory being something we can control, a drive would be to be over 100% conversion. Yeah.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nOkay. And just maybe a bigger picture question for Bill. Would love to get it. You mentioned earlier about industrial OTIF kind of stubbornly in that low 80% level. Obviously, that's a pretty big deal just given the size of that business. Can you talk about maybe when you expect to see more progress on that and talk a little bit about the manufacturing and DC footprint and when you expect to make more progress on that as well?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nSo Amit, look, I may expect more progress on SIBG OTIF in January. We expected in February. We did not expect the deterioration we saw in November and December. Part of it is certain specific issues, quality issues, a couple of specific assets, SIBG. One of the things that I've been reminded about by people is it's a much more complicated portfolio. It's about 35% more SKUs in SIBG than TEBG, and it's probably more than double the number that's in CBG. So it's a pretty complicated portfolio. And there's some unique supplier challenges in that business as well.\nBut that being said, we expect that business to be closer to 90% this year. Maybe it's towards the end of the year, but we need to be making sequential improvement throughout the year on SIBG OTIF. And I know Chris is depending upon that. His sales force is depending upon that. More importantly, our customers are. We're on it. We're pushing on it. It's certainly gotten a lot of attention inside the company. The team is pretty laser-focused on making those improvements. I think you talked about the complexity as well in the network.\nLook, it's part of a longer-term plan in terms of operational excellence. The first part really is making sure that all of our factories have an improvement target, an improvement plan for how they run their four-wall spend. We will also be looking at how we can run this network that we have today more efficiently.\nAnd then over time, as we really mature the operating equipment efficiency metric, which is a measure of utilization of assets, as that gets more mature, then we can start taking on a little more of a holistic look at the overall network. But right now, it's really just focused on blocking and tackling inside the factories. And I think we've got a lot of opportunity in front of us to improve in those dimensions.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director and Industrial Sector Head, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYou bet. Thanks, Amit.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and US Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Good morning.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning, Nicole.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and US Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nMaybe just starting with China. I think you're expecting a little bit of a slowdown to mid-single digits in 2025, but definitely not too shabby. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing on the ground there?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So from a macro perspective, China is expected to slow a little bit, both from the GDP and IPI perspective. But again, it depends on what you believe in those forecasts and those numbers. Now, I do think that tariffs could have an effect on what's happening in China, certainly on the export part of China. So we're watching it very, very carefully. There's news of the minute on tariffs for sure. So just stepping back, Nicole, China is about 10% of our revenue globally. Last year, it was up about 10%. It was up about 13% in the first half. It sort of slowed down in the back.\nPart of it is from electronics. When I look at so half the business is export, and electronics have been an important driver. But the other half that's really, so if you will, China for China, that did grow, was up about 3% last year. So we saw decent growth on the ground, not quite at macro, but decent growth. We had quite a bit of activity in December, quite a bit of activity happening here in January. Again, you never know. It could be some pull-aheads. It could be just getting ahead of Chinese New Year, which is the end of January.\nWe do expect that our business in China will be slower in 2025 than it was in 2024, probably in the low single-digit range is what we expect for revenue for 3M in China.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and US Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. That's really helpful. Thanks, Bill. And then any update on insurance recovery? I think you promised us an update each quarter. Thank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nSo we're making progress on insurance, and we're actively engaged in arbitration, negotiations, and in some places, litigation with insurance carriers for both PWS and Combat Arms. In Q4, we recovered about $170 million. So to date, through last year, was about $340 million, mostly in the Combat Arms area. Again, we're pretty active in pushing this. The legal teams are driving this pretty hard. And as I said last time, I'll say it again, we expect our insurers to honor the commitments they have to us and their policies, and we're going to make sure that they go and do that.\nSo that's kind of where we stand today.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director and US Multi-Industry and Electrical Equipment Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks so much. See you in February.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Joe.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nJust wanted to ask you on cash and just what you think the right amount of cash to carry is. So you ended the year with cash and marketable securities at about $7.7 billion. Where do you expect to end 2025? And then thinking maybe a little bit farther out, just what you think the right amount of cash to have is, whether that's percent of sales or dollar amount?\n\nAnurag Maheshwari\n\nEVP and CFO, 3M Company\n\nHey, Joe. It's Anurag here. So as you correctly said, we ended the year at $7.7 billion. It's probably 2x of the working capital requirement for the business. If you look at 2025, we said we're going to buy back shares worth $1.5 billion. At current dividend rate, we're paying about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion in dividends. We got $3 billion to settle on Combat Arms and PWS as well. So these are the big ones we have for the year. And our plan is to refinance the majority of our debt. So if you put all of that together, we should end 2025 at over $6 billion in cash.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nAnd then also, Bill, just on industrial production, and what are you watching most closely there, whether it's a region or whether it's an end market, in terms of how you're thinking about where the best potential sits for this accelerating industrial production that we're kind of all waiting for?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So we're looking at all the different pieces. Obviously, we're pretty levered to the manufacturing economy within IPI. So that's an important one. And we're a little bit heavier weighted in the US, probably Europe, and others after that. So clearly, US is an important focus of ours in watching IPI. The current forecast, it does turn positive from minus 0.3 to plus 0.5, I think is what it was in 2025. Europe, we have to watch. We've got a pretty good presence in Europe as well. It's a very big turnaround in Europe from down 60 basis points to up 130 basis points next year.\nThat's a pretty big movement. So those are the key things that we're looking at, I think, pretty carefully on IPI. It's on the industrial side. On auto, look, I'm a little bit concerned about that only because we had some deterioration last year. The auto build forecast for this year is weakened a little bit, down 60 basis points. But as I mentioned in my remarks, when you disaggregate that, US and Europe are down three to four points. China's flattened. The rest of Asia is up a little bit. So we have to watch that and look at where our content per vehicle happens to be.\nObviously, the team is very focused on gaining share, gaining content in those automakers that are growing faster. That's a very important strategic focus of Wendy and her team. But those are some of the things that we're looking at from a macro perspective.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nI appreciate the color. Thank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYou bet. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, I wanted to circle back on the strategies for reinvigorating new product introductions, but specifically reinvigorating innovation. I know we're going to start off the analyst event at the technology center. Just, I think there's art and science here when it comes to innovation. I'd just be interested in your thoughts. You can't just dump cash at the front door and say, \"Innovate,\" but I know you're adding some headcount.\nAre there any other thoughts there in terms of kind of ramping up innovation? And how do you feel about that longstanding policy at 3M R&D where the senior scientists get 15% of unbudgeted time? Does that still fit into the equation? Thanks.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. Look, so 15% of time is sort of a hallmark of the company. I sort of joke that it's 115%, not going from 85 to 100, but everyone gets their 15%. I think that's important because it gives people the time to step back, think, and ponder. I mean, I do the same thing. I go into my office and I think about what are the issues upon the company. We all have to do that. So I think that's a hallmark of the culture of the organization. Look, I think the first, look, it's not a shortage of ideas and concepts for where we can innovate. I think we've got a great list of products.\nAs you turn the scientists, the engineers on, the people doing product development, those in the business units, those out meeting with the customers themselves, the ideas are there. The pipeline is pretty full. We've got to do more to keep filling it up. But the pipeline has been full. I think it's about just turning on that and unleashing that energy that's in the folks that do the innovation. And so part of it is eliminating some of the bottlenecks in the processes. And I went through last time a number of pieces of that.\nWe are shifting within our capital budget more investment to R&D for lab equipment, for prototype equipment to speed up the prototyping and scaling up of innovation. We are adding resources there. I think if you put the right framework in place and you're motivating the teams in the way we are, and we're starting to kind of focus people on the growth verticals that we really want to focus our investment and time on, I do think that that's going to pay dividends over time. This is something that Wendy and TEBG are going to lay out pretty clearly when we get out to the end of February.\nWe have our investor day. How do we get closer to those innovation partners so that we're really tied with them very closely so their ideas translate back to us and we're working with them in not a transactional way, but in a strategic way? And I think if you do all of these things, this machine will turn on. And again, we saw good progress over the last six months. It's early days. I think we'll have another good year in 2025.\nBut ultimately, this is going to come down to are we growing faster than the market, therefore we're gaining share, and are we driving margin and margin expansion because the products we're offering to the marketplace are better than what the competition puts on the marketplace? And I think that's the end objective. We have a good start.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's great to hear, especially that support of that 15% unbudgeted time. I'm sure a lot of people like hearing that. And then just a second question, quick follow-up on the plan for reducing inventory days. I mean, I know there's an immediate benefit for free cash flow, but is there any pressure on service levels once you start to reduce the level of inventory, and is there any kind of trade-off there? Thanks.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nLook, that's something that we're watching very, very carefully. We came down two days year over year, and I think it was eight days sequentially in Q4. In SIBG, we saw sort of OTIF come back. So we're watching this very carefully. Our intention is to prioritize OTIF over inventory, frankly. That's what we think is really important. That's a greater lever. That being said, there are opportunities to eliminate the waste, if you will, in inventory. Not all the inventory we have is good inventory. We have a lot that's stuck on the water.\nWe have a lot of components in warehouses and factories. We have to make sure we have the right inventory. That's why I believe this is the and not the or. I believe that we can get to 75 days and over 90% OTIF, and I think we can get there. That's our goal.That's what we ought to be shooting for. It's not going to be linear. And we saw in Q4, it wasn't linear. We had better inventory, not as good on OTIF, at least in one segment. But that's the objective. And again, we're going to prioritize OTIF over inventory, knowing that we'll get the inventory over time.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes the question-and-answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M Company\n\nOkay. Well, thank you. I appreciate everyone's time and attention today. I know we're running top of the hour here, but I want to thank all of the 3Mers for their continued hard work and dedication to our customers and our shareholders. I look forward to introducing you all, the analysts and investors, to the senior leadership team at 3M at our investor day coming up on 26 February in St. Paul. It's going to be brisk. Today's minus 18 degrees Fahrenheit, so dress warmly. So we look forward to seeing you on the 26th. Thank you very much, and have a good day.\n\nOperator\n\nWe thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time.",

Welcome to the 3M second quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session at that time. If you do have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this call is being recorded on Friday, July 26, 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, 3M\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Bill Brown, 3M's Chief Executive Officer, and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Bill and Monish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our investor relations website at 3m.com. Please turn to slide two.\nPlease take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note, throughout today's presentation we will be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to slide three and I'll hand the call off to Bill. Bill?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nOkay, thank you Bruce, and good morning everyone. This morning we reported second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.93, up nearly 40%, with 1% organic revenue growth. Adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%. I'd like to thank the 3M employees for all their hard work in delivering solid second quarter results. Monish will provide further details on the quarter, and then I'll wrap up our prepared remarks with guidance for the year before opening the call to Q&A. I've now been in the job for nearly three months and have been busy visiting a number of our factories and labs as well as taking a fresh look at our strategy and how we're executing against it.\nAs you know, 3M has been undergoing a lot of change in the past few years following COVID, most recently with a successful spinoff of the healthcare business, executing on a significant restructuring effort and working to mitigate risks including discontinuing PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 and settling legal matters. You've also seen a number of changes to our organizational model, shifting from a geographic to a global business unit structure and centralizing our global supply chain activities under one senior leader.\nCollectively, this has been a massive transformational change for 3M and the team has executed really well as a result of these efforts. You're seeing the benefits in operating margin expansion, strong cash generation, and a solid balance sheet with low leverage ratios and an incrementally more positive view from the rating agencies.\nCredit to Mike and Monish for the.\nSteady hand in guiding the company through these changes, but my job is to look forward, and while much progress has been made, we have more to do, including navigating PFAS-related matters where, fortunately, we have a strong, terrific team managing the exit and our ongoing legal matters. As I see it, we're still in the early innings of our operational excellence journey, and we haven't yet cracked the code on organic growth, which I know is essential to creating shareholder value. So my top priorities are number one, driving sustained top line organic growth, number two, improving operational performance across the enterprise, and number three, effectively deploying capital on the first priority. I believe that the company has significant organic growth opportunities as we participate in end markets with favorable secular trends and have a strong foundation and long history in material science innovation.\nHowever, as you well know, organic growth has been below market indices and peers over several years and up only about 1% year to date. Driving sustained organic growth requires both getting more out of R&D as well as improving commercial excellence. As I've gotten into the details, what I've learned is that ex-Solventum, R&D investment for core 3M, which is running about $1 billion per year or about 4.5% of revenue, has been flat nominally over the past five years and down on a real basis as the focus was on investing in and strengthening the healthcare business, and within the lower spend. The amount we invest on new product development has declined even further as the company shifted more dollars to efforts to exit PFAS manufacturing and work to reduce supply chain cost and resolve COVID-related sourcing constraints.\nAs a result of the decline in investment, along with a strategic shift to fewer but larger innovation opportunities, the number of and revenue from new product introductions has steadily declined over the past decade. The simple fact is our products are aging while we've been shifting our portfolio towards higher growth markets like auto electrification, industrial automation, data centers, and semis, climate tech, and others. These efforts aren't material enough today to offset erosion in our core. They remain for the most part attractive growth platforms, and we need to continue to balance investing appropriately in markets that are evolving quickly while also investing incrementally to sustain the core products we have today.\nBut before we make any adjustments to our R&D budget, I want to first explore opportunities to get more from what we currently spend. For example, improving the velocity of our new product development process and increasing the effective capacity of our engineers by eliminating bottlenecks and non-value-added work, and over time redeploying those currently working on PFAS exit activities to growth initiatives. With enhanced data transparency and a more coordinated governance process, we can improve R&D effectiveness by deploying resources on the highest return projects. These efforts are essential to reinvigorating the 3M innovation machine, but will take time to bear fruit.\nIn the near term we have to focus on commercial excellence and to sell more of what we currently offer. That means better salesforce and distributor effectiveness, targeted marketing, optimized pricing, and much better execution at the customer interface. In particular on time in full performance, which is a key part of my second priority, operational performance.\nWe have a terrific ops leadership team in place executing on a number of opportunities, and I want to give you some color on what I'm seeing so far. I've been looking at our manufacturing and distribution network to understand our global supply chain and distribution capabilities. I see opportunities to reduce complexity, drive lean manufacturing and logistics, improve supply chain management, lower yield loss, and increase service levels with lower inventory. While our network of 110 factories and 95 distribution centers have historically served 3M well, it is incredibly complex and interconnected.\nWith most SKUs we produce touching multiple.\nFactories before reaching the customer. For example, a Command strip touches five factories and two distribution points before it hits the store shelf. This extends cycle times, increases goods in transit, and drives up logistics and freight costs. In lean manufacturing and logistics, we're developing a consistent metric around operating equipment efficiency or OEE, to increase equipment utilization and rein in capital spending, and mapping modes and flows to lower freight and distribution costs. In supply chain, we have significant opportunities to improve our sourcing effectiveness. We have more than 25,000 direct and indirect suppliers, including nearly 4,000 contract and component manufacturers, yet more than 80% of our raw materials are sole sourced. We haven't been holding our suppliers accountable to the same quality and delivery standards as our customers hold us to, and we're only beginning to leverage our scale.\nTo reduce cost.\nRelative to yield loss.\nOur raw material waste is running close to 5% of cost of goods sold due in part to how we design and manufacture our products, but also due to inefficient production scheduling and changeovers. Finally, we have too much inventory at about $4 billion in 102 days at the end of Q2, and yet our service levels are only in the mid-80s. Our bottoms-up analysis indicates we should be closer to 75 days of inventory or lower, which would imply about a billion-dollar cash opportunity over time while we drive on-time-in-full above 90%.\nMy third priority is effectively deploying capital, and our approach remains the same as it's been: investing in R&D and CapEx to fund organic growth, paying an attractive dividend which we just recalibrated with the spin of Solventum, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and using excess capital for M&A or share buybacks. We repurchased about $400 million in stock in the second quarter and have the capacity to do more in the second half and next year. While no acquisitions are on the near-term horizon, I'll be taking a fresh, dispassionate look at our portfolio, determine if any assets have greater value owned by others, and, along the same line, what assets might be a good fit for 3M.\nI don't have anything further to say on that today, but you can expect to hear more from me regarding portfolio prioritization as I deepen my understanding of our businesses and end markets. So for the past three months it's been pretty busy with a lot still to learn. I think we have a good foundation to build upon and believe that this focus on fundamentals back to basics approach will drive value creation. I'm encouraging everyone at 3M from top to bottom to every day challenge the status quo and the way we've done things in the past, to act with speed and urgency, and to off board those things that distract us from growing, innovating, and executing for customers and shareholders. With that I'll turn it over to Monish to cover the quarter and I'll come back to discuss guidance.\nMonish?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide four. I would like to take a moment to briefly remind you of a few items that we highlighted during last quarter's earnings call. Beginning with the second quarter, our results for business segment operating income includes prospectively the impact of dis-synergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. Therefore, for historical pre-spin periods presented, the dis-synergies are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated. In addition, we added a new operating category named Other for Solventum transition services agreement activity. Other includes our Q1 cost associated with supporting the agreements for which 3M started to be reimbursed for in April.\nAnd finally, Corporate and Unallocated incorporates the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on April 1st and retrospectively picks up certain operations of the former health care business retained by 3M.\nTurning to our second quarter performance, we posted solid adjusted results including sales of $6 billion, operating margins of 21.6%, earnings per share of $1.93, and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We delivered adjusted organic growth of 1.2% or up 2.4%, excluding geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives. These results reflect the trends that we have previously discussed including strong growth in electronics, mixed industrial end markets, and continued softness in consumer retail discretionary spending. We had another strong quarter of execution with adjusted operating margins expanding 440 basis points year-on-year, and delivered adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion with conversion of 109%.\nPlease turn to slide five. On an adjusted basis, we delivered operating margins of 21.6%, up 440 basis points, and earnings of $1.93 per share, up 39% versus last year's second quarter. Our second quarter year-on-year performance was driven by organic growth, productivity, strong spending discipline, and restructuring savings, which combined benefited operating margins by 310 basis points and earnings by $0.31 per share. In addition, income from the transition services we are providing to Solventum increased margins by 50 basis points and earnings by $0.05 per share. These benefits were partially offset by stock-based compensation, which was shifted into the second quarter due to the spin of Solventum. This was in line with what we discussed during our first quarter earnings call.\nThis change in timing negatively impacted operating margins by 200 basis points and earnings by $0.18 per share versus last year's second quarter.\nLower year-on-year restructuring charges were a benefit of 270 basis points to margins and $0.23 to earnings. For the second quarter, restructuring charges were $44 million, which were lower than anticipated for the full year. We continue to expect pre-tax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million-$300 million.\nForeign currency was a negative $0.04 per share impact as a result of the stronger U.S. dollar.\nAcquisition and divestitures were a benefit of 10 basis points to margins and $0.03 to earnings year-on-year. This benefit is related to last year's Q2 reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies along with the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum.\nBelow the line items benefited earnings by a combined $0.14 per share. This benefit was primarily due to increased interest income year-on-year on a higher cash balance due to in part by cash proceeds received from the spin of Solventum.\nTaking into account our first half of the year performance, we now expect our full year non-operating expense to be in the range of $50 million-$75 million versus a prior range of $75 million-$100 million.\nA quick comment on Corporate and Unallocated and Other before moving on to cash flow. Q2 Corporate and Unallocated sales were $86 million with a $2 million adjusted operating loss.\nYear to date, Corporate and Unallocated sales were $112 million with an adjusted operating loss of $73 million. This is in line with our full year anticipated sales range of $225 million-$275 million with a forecasted adjusted operating loss in the range of $125 million-$175 million.\nOur other category had operating income of $37 million, which reflects the level of activity and effort to support the successful spin out of Solventum. Year to date, Other had an operating loss of $28 million, which is in line with our full year expectation of flat to a loss of $25 million.\nPlease turn to slide six. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our second quarter performance was driven by strong operating income, lower CapEx spending partially offset by higher working capital.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $250 million in the quarter as we continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability.\nDuring the quarter we returned a total of $800 million to shareholders, split equally between dividends and share repurchases.\nAnd finally, net debt at the end of Q2 stood at approximately $3 billion. These strong results build on our track record of robust cash generation.\nFor the first half of the year, we have generated $2 billion of adjusted free cash flow. Our strong capital structure continues to provide us the financial flexibility to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders, and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matters. Please note that in the month of July, we will make total combined payments of $3.7 billion related to the public water supplies and Combat Arms settlements. Before I move on to our business segment performance, I want to highlight a couple of items for your awareness that were excluded in arriving at our Q2 adjusted results.\nFirst, note that we reached settlements of approximately $120 million with insurance carriers related to Combat Arms. We remain in discussion with multiple carriers and anticipate additional future recoveries.\nSecond, during the quarter we incurred a non-cash charge of approximately $800 million related to a $2.5 billion pension risk transfer on a portion of our U.S. defined pension obligation with Met Tower Life. This action helps us to reduce risk and administrative fees related to our U.S. pension plan. Please turn to slide seven, starting with our safety and industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion, up 1.1% organically. Industrial adhesives and tapes posted mid-single-digit organic growth driven by strength in bonding solutions for consumer electronic devices. Personal safety and automotive aftermarket grew low single digits. Electrical markets was up slightly, while roofing granules was flat due to unplanned customer manufacturing challenges. Finally, we experienced year-on-year organic sales declines in abrasives and industrial specialties.\nGeographically, industrial markets grew low single digits in the U.S. and Asia Pacific while EMEA was down low single digits. Overall industrial end market demand continued to be mixed in the quarter, and as end user and channel remain cautious.\nAdjusted operating income was $623 million with adjusted operating margins of 22.6% up 40 basis points year-on-year. This performance was driven by higher sales volume, benefits from ongoing productivity and restructuring actions, and lower year-on-year restructuring charges. These benefits were partially offset by the timing of stock-based compensation and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum.\nMoving to transportation and electronics on slide eight, which posted adjusted sales of $1.9 billion, or up 3.3% organically. Our electronics business outperformed the market, up low double digits organically as we continue to gain spec in wins on consumer electronic devices and in semiconductor manufacturing.\nOur auto OEM business increased nearly 5% in Q2 versus a half a point decrease in global car and light truck builds. Looking at the first half of the year, our auto OEM business was up 9% organically versus a flat global build rate of cars and light trucks as we continue to gain penetration on new platforms. Looking at the rest of transportation and electronics, advanced materials grew mid single digits organically, and commercial branding and transportation was down low single digits year-on-year.\nTransportation and Electronics delivered $426 million in adjusted operating income, up 16% year-on-year.\nAdjusted operating margins were 22.3%, up 250 basis points year-on-year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on electronics volumes. Ongoing benefits from productivity, restructuring actions, and lower year-on-year restructuring charges.\nPartially offsetting these benefits were the timing of stock based compensation grants and cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Turning to slide nine, the consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 1.4% year-on-year with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending. This included a 2.7 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization. Home improvement grew mid single digits. Consumer safety and well being grew low single digits. Packaging and expression declined low single digits while home and auto care declined mid single digits organically. Geographically the U.S. was up slightly, Asia Pacific was down mid single digits, and EMEA was down high single digits. Consumer second quarter operating income was $219 million, down 7% compared to last year with operating margins of 17.4% down 80 basis points year-on-year.\nOperating margin performance was driven by lower volume and timing of stock-based compensation grants along with the cost inefficiencies due to the spin of Solventum. Partially offsetting these headwinds were benefits from lower restructuring charges.\nBefore I turn it back over to Bill, I want to take a moment to thank the 3M team for the tremendous progress and they have made positioning the company for success. I am very proud of the relentless focus our teams have brought to create value by driving performance through our improved productivity and efficiency, spinning out of our healthcare business, and reducing risk and uncertainty by managing legal matters. I am confident that under Bill's leadership, the team will continue to build on this momentum to create consistent value for our people, our customers, and our shareholders in the years to come. I would also like to thank all the analysts and investors for our rich discussions and engagements over the last four years. With that, please turn to slide 10, and I will turn it back over to Bill for an update on our guidance.\nBill\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThanks Monish. Given the strong operational execution in the first half of the year, we're raising the bottom end of our full year adjusted earnings guidance by $0.20 to a range of $7.00-$7.30 versus $6.80-$7.30 previously, now up 16%- year-on-year. Full year adjusted operating margins are now expected to be up 225 to 275 basis points. Full year adjusted organic growth remains unchanged at flat to up 2%, with expectations for second half organic growth in line with first half performance at the midpoint. While significant macro uncertainty remains, our business segment and market trends are largely playing out as expected year to date. Safety and Industrial organic growth is approximately flat versus a full year expectation of.\nFlat to up low single digits.\nWe expect that industrial end markets will remain mixed as channel partners and end customers continue to remain cautious on overall demand trends. On an adjusted basis, transportation and electronics is up nearly 5% organically in the first half versus a full year expectation.\nOf up low single digits.\nStrength in the first half was due in large part to consumer electronics. Along with automotive, we continue to monitor auto build rates along with consumer electronics demand trends for the back to school and holiday season. And finally, consumer is down nearly 3%.\nOrganically through the first half of the.\nYear versus a full year expectation of down low single digits. We continue to expect that consumer retail discretionary spending on hard line goods to remain muted in the balance of the year. Before we open up to your questions, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank Monish for all his contributions and impact on 3M over the past four years. While I've only had a short time working with him, he has been a strong partner and has helped me get up to speed on the company, and I've enjoyed working with him. I appreciate everything he has done to navigate through a number of challenges and to make 3M stronger along the way. With that, let's open the call to your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to register a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw, please press star two. If you are using a speakerphone, please lift up your handset before entering your request. Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGood morning everyone.\nHello Bill and Monish. Thanks for all the help up until this point. Hey Bill, thank you very much for that very thorough and detailed kind of deconstruction of the history on organic growth and the like. You know, I appreciate your comment that it will take some time to kind of get after these things, but are you actioning some of these ideas already? Can you give us a sense of how some of these changes on the front end of the business as it relates to organic growth may be kind of put in action.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nGood morning, Jeff, and thanks for the question.\nAs I mentioned in my remarks, there's two major thrusts here on driving organic growth. One is to spur innovation and driving innovation to turn the top line up, drive organic revenue. And you know, so part of it is we've got to sort of bottom out on how much we're spending on new product development and start to turn the ship. First half of this year we launched about 75, 76 new product introductions. You know, this year we'll do probably less than 150. And as I reflect back over the last eight or nine, 10 years, at one point in time we did over 1,000. So we really got to turn that around. It's going to take some time to do. We continue to invest some of our precious R&D dollars on cost reduction and PFAS exit, you know, stabilizing our supply chain.\nI made a comment about 80% of our raw materials coming from one source. We've got to qualify other vendors to be able to reduce cost over time. So that's going to take some time. What I'm really working on as well in R&D is ideas for how we can offload non value add activities from our researchers. It really comes in two themes. One is both efficiency as well as effectiveness. I think there's an opportunity to drive effective capacity of our engineering team. I think we have an opportunity to drive velocity through the new product development pipeline. We have an opportunity to think differently and how we govern differently on R&D where we place our precious dollars so that they can move across the company to the highest ROI investment. So that's what I'm focused on in R&D.\nBut again, it's going to take a little bit of time. So we've got to of what we have on the market today. That, that's simply commercial excellence. Some digging into a number of different factors. You know, we've, we've got a sales force today. It's just over 5,000 people we know over the last four or five years is down about 25%. That's partly because of the export model we move to. But we have an opportunity to take.\nA look at our coverage, our incentives.\nOur training around our sales force. I think there's some opportunities there. We distribute to almost 30,000 distributors. I think we have opportunities there. So probably some opportunities pricing at a high level. We've done a very good job at covering inflation, and we'll see some incrementally positive pricing this year. But when you get down to a granular level, you know, there's some disconnects between pricing, discounts, and margins to the volume or size of the customer. We have an opportunity to take a.\nHarder look at that.\nWe're looking very hard at advertising and merchandising. It's, it's a lever that's important in our consumer business. You know, we, we're down quite substantially from where we were before relative to consumer packaged good type companies were down. So we have an opportunity to think differently, and very tactically around advertising and merchandising. And again, lastly, we're looking at cross selling. There's certain examples, certain places where we sell products into a distributor or into a customer. But those customers, they should be buying a different product from us, but they don't. You know, for example, for customers that buy surface conditioning products to polish metals and woods, you know, you always use a respirator to do that. You want to. We look at our customers; there's a bunch that don't buy the respirators from us. So there's an opportunity there.\nAll of those things are levers that we're going to be pulling here in.\nThe short term, Jeff.\nWe'll keep updating analysts and investors as we learn more about how do we really drive the top line, which is so crucial to driving value creation at 3M.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nRight.\nThanks for that.\nMaybe just one other quick. Well, maybe it's not a quick one. I appreciate the detailed answers on kind of the operational excellence side of the equation. And a lot of these, you know, kind of KPIs that you're, you know, speaking to on delivery quality and the like, does this require sort of a, you know, a heavy lift on restructuring? You know, the company has gone through a lot of restructuring recently, including just coming to the end of a, you know, a big program. Or do you kind of view these as just more kind of process improvements and things of that nature?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nSo, you're right. We've been through and are actually getting through a very substantial restructuring program, about 75% complete. It'll drag into 2025. The team is executing very well on that. A lot of the things I'm talking about in terms of improving OpEx, they're incremental pay as you go type of opportunities. You almost get the savings as you're covering investment. There are potentially over time, some bigger bites. If you think about the complexity of our broader network, a few years out there could be additional restructuring, but can't size it today. Right now, the opportunities that I'm seeing are almost pay as you go. Reducing waste and inefficiency in factories are things you can do and just execute against without substantial charges to get there.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. Thanks and good luck. Appreciate it.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hello, Bill. It's been a while and I wish good luck.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThank you so much.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nSo I think you might well have answered my question. But I do want to just kind of ask about the plants and the distribution of the footprint. I think you mentioned 105 plants and 95 DC, 110 plants, 95 DCs. So are we talking here about over time a significant shrinkage in that footprint or the more reconfiguration to reduce the complexity of the product velocity around those around that network? And then thinking about the opportunities around sort of investing to drive growth versus efficiency. How should we think about margins beyond 2024? Are you comfortable we can still grow margins beyond 2024, even though it sounds like you're going to be investing.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nOkay, so a couple of good questions and I'll try to hit on pretty quickly.\nYou're right.\n110 factories, 95 distribution centers. The fact is, if you go back in time, the team here has actually been reducing the number of factories, the number of DCs in our network. There is some in-flight that in the restructuring program we have today. Looking forward, I don't. We don't think we necessarily need 110. I can't decide what it exactly is, you know, when, when that, that cadence might happen. But we're taking a hard look at it, you know, but it's not just factories, it's also cells within factories. When you look at, you know, what we have in assets and cells within these factories, we have 250 coating assets that are spread almost through half of our factory. Then you have to sit back and ask, as we drive operating equipment efficiency, do we really need all those assets.\nIn all those factories, or do we?\nHave an opportunity to increase effective capacity? So these are things that we're working on. Peter Gibbons and the team are doing a great job at this. This is going to happen over time. I can't really size how many factors of the restructuring that's required to get there relative to margins. The team has done an outstanding job. You can see in the first half of this year, up almost 500 basis points. So the margins have come up quite substantially. We've got more we can do here in terms of just basic blocking and tackling productivity. Volume clearly, as it comes back, volume clearly is going to be a high leverage ratio for us. So where they can go from here, I can't size it today. Certainly, as we get to the balance of the year into 2025, we'll give you some more outlook on that.\nBut there's lots of levers here including driving organic volume.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat, thanks Bill. That's great color. And then Monish, a quick follow on the insurance recovery.\nThat's obviously great news.\nOn the combat arms recovery, can you just disclose how many carriers are you negotiating with on combat arms and maybe just bring us up to speed in terms of, you know, what's the opportunity within the water settlement?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah. So Nigel, as you know, there's a Met Tower Life insurance here. So we are dealing with multiple insurance providers. We were pleased with what Kevin Rhodes and the legal team have done on getting the $120 million this quarter. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we believe that there is more to be had here and we'll definitely keep you all informed as these things happen.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, that's great.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning Bill.\nWelcome, Bill.\nWe'll miss you, Monish.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you, Scott.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGood morning, Bruce, too.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nBill, I don't want to read too much into this, but is it your view that 3M is just too diversified and needs to kind of narrow down even a little bit more than what we've already seen with the spin?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nWell, I'm not sure I would say that today, Scott. In fact, as I think about it, it's a big business, a complicated business, a lot of different end markets, different business segments, and different ways of going to market. A lot of the stuff that we make goes across all of these factories. So there's a lot of interconnection across the business, you know. But as I've done in my past, I'll do the same thing here, which is take a fresh, hard look at what businesses that we're in. And as Mike said in my prepared remarks, dispassionately do that, really look hard at what is better owned by us, and we'll make some determinations over time on that.\nYou know, at the same time as we think about the kind of business that we want to be in over time, are there assets that aren't owned by 3M and that are better owned here, and we'll take a hard look at that piece there as well. So I wouldn't draw any specific conclusion from my remarks other than we're going to take a hard look at it, and if we determine that something is better owned elsewhere, then we'll move forward, in that it's all about value creation for ownership.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nFair enough. I guess when I look at your long, you know, your list of priorities, operational excellence, all these things are kind of basic. You know, I don't want to minimize, but this is, you know, it almost feels like you're walking into a situation where a lot of things weren't done right.\nI don't want to point fingers, but the point being is, what was the fail? Was it just compensation and kind of, you know, where people's priorities were placed and you need to change your compensation plan? Was it just that a lot of these things like Lean Manufacturing were just not seated or seated early enough? I'm just trying to get my arms around, you know, followed 3M for a long time, and we've had a number of different CEOs have come in and had kind of a similar tick list that we want to fix this, this, and this, but have struggled to kind of get there. I'm trying to just get my arms around what, what, what do you think was the main fail that kind of led us to where we are today?\nYou know, is there, is there kind of, you know, one main thing that you can kind of tick the box first and work on kind of through the list? Well, I know that's a little bit of a tough question, but. And again, not trying to point fingers, just saying that, you know, it's, it's a pretty, it's a pretty heavy lift. I think some of these things a lot of people have tried pretty hard to fix.\nThanks.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nNo, look, I'll just say it's not about fail or success or right or wrong. It's. I come in with a different set of experiences, different background, fresh look at the way we do business. From the things that I've done in.\nThe past, I think the team here.\nHas done a marvelous job in managing through a lot of complex situations. I was a CEO of a company through COVID, and what we dealt with is it is well short of the challenges that 3M has faced. You bring on top of that a lot of the liabilities that Mike and the team have managed through the structural changes. You know, there's been an enormous transformation effort. As I said, they launched the restructuring program. We're 75% complete. It's gone very, very well. You can see that in the margins. That's gone very well. I come in. I just look at it the way it is today with sort of looking at the cold, hard facts, and it's a back to basics focus on the fundamentals approach. Does sound quote unquote basic.\nAt the end of the day, I do think that there's a lot of value that can be created from the raw materials that we have here. Just focusing on just how do you turn the business to top line growth through the things that I've talked about, commercial excellence, driving growth from R&D, and driving a real culture of operational excellence through the company and move at these things with speed and with urgency. You know, I've been in situations like this before. It's easy to fall into a trap of this is the way things have been done. As I said in my remarks, I'm encouraging people to challenge the way we've done things in the past every single day. That's what continuous improvement is really all about. That's what I'm encouraging people to do.\nI'm looking from here forward and I see a great opportunity for value creation.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nFair enough, Bill.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nBest of luck.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much. Welcome to Bill and Monish. Thanks for all the help down the years. Maybe just the first question around the reinvestment point and organic growth. So Bill, it sounds as if you can reinvest sufficiently in the business in the medium term to get growth moving but still see reasonable margin expansion. Just wanted to confirm that that is what you're saying. And then on that growth rate point, I wondered sort of what your initial thoughts were on the growth entitlement for 3M. You know, maybe what you think its addressable markets are growing at, how you view the growth rate of its aggregate peer set. Just the context I suppose is 3M has grown around 1%-2% the last 5 to 10 years ex-Solventum. Wondered what you thought the market growth rate was versus that.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nSo, a couple of good questions. I mean, first, we do expect that we have some capacity in the back half to incrementally invest in the business. I think Monish and Mike have talked about this in our guidance model, we still see some opportunities to incrementally invest. We'll talk more about where that might be in the back half. But we always said, with the savings that we're generating from restructuring, some of that savings would be reinvested back in the business. That's been the case so far. And we see some additional opportunities in the back half of the year.\nMy comments around salesforce, my comments around advertising, merchandising, or at least a couple of different items. I can't say much about R&D today. You know, I want to look harder at how do we free up capacity of the, of the investment we make already today and can that be more streamlined and redeployed effectively on top line growth. That's really a big focus of mine in terms of entitlement growth. You know, certainly we should be growing better than we have. I mean, we're guiding 0%-2%, midpoint of 1%. We know there's 1% headwind because of exiting certain geographies and parts of our portfolio, you know, but still on an adjusted basis 1%-3% organic, it probably should be a bit more than that. GDP is in a 2.5% range. IPI I think this year is around 1.7, 1.8, or thereabouts.\nWe should be growing at least at the level of the economy, if not perhaps slightly better. But more comments as we get towards the back end of the year and into 2025 and give you some longer term outlook for where the company might go.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's helpful, thank you. Then just maybe toggling back to the short term as a lot has been asked about the medium term. If we're just thinking about the sort of framework for the second half guidance, you know, I think it's implying an operating margin in the second half of maybe 21% or so, a little bit better perhaps. And that's fairly flattish year-on-year and half on half. Just wondered if I had that right because it looks like restructuring charges are shrinking year-on-year, and half on half, and the top line is pretty steady. So just wondered if that was the correct assumption, any drivers behind that, and if there was any preliminary thoughts on sort of Q3 versus Q4 dynamics here.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nSo yeah, you've let me offer a couple of comments here, and I'll ask Monish to maybe fill in a little bit of the blanks on the quarterly progression. But you know, just, you're right in terms of the cadence here. We do expect revenue, you know, to be very similar in the second half to the first half. And that does reflect historical trends. You know, we continue to see strong operational execution and spending discipline just like we saw in the first half. You know, we'll see some tailwinds from the benefit of lower restructuring cost, which is now 60/40, first half, second half. Last time we thought it was 70/30, so some has shifted to the back half. But you do see a bit of a step down, and we do see reimbursement of transition services agreement with Solventum, which began in April.\nBut at the same time we have higher wages in the back half of the year. You know, we have two full quarters with a wage increase. Our wages went out on April 1, so not in Q1 but in Q2. So that's a bit of headwind that's offset by some lower stock comp. You know, as you know, we made our grants here in Q2. We do see some headwinds in our factories. You know, we built inventory through Q2 that caused some positive absorption. We'll see inventory coming down in the back half of the year. That's going to cause some negative absorption or some headwinds there. And then some higher non-operating expenses driven by pension and higher interest costs. We had a lot of cash balance here in Q2.\nCash went out the door in July for some legal payments, legal settlements. So we are interest costs, interest expense is going to go up or interest income will come down in the back half of the year. And then of course, as I mentioned before, we do see some step up in some investments we have in the back half of the year. So those are the biggest drivers. A little bit of tax geography, but those are the biggest drivers. Maybe I'll ask Monish to comment on Q3, Q4 cadence.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nSure. And just Julian, to add on to Bill's points on first half, second half, just data points. We spent $165 million in the first half on restructuring, and at the midpoint that would be another $110 million in the second half. So that's the tax rate will be around 19% in the second half versus 20% in the first half. If you now go to just the guidance between Q2, Q3 or Q3, Q4, you know, Q3 revenue trends will be very similar to what we saw in Q2. I think Bill already talked about what it looks like in the market. So that's where the team is seeing right now. I would say continued strong operational execution and spending in Q3. Also, you will get a tailwind from the timing of stock comp, which we announced in Q2. Approximately $100 million of it.\nThat comes back as a tailwind in Q3. But at the same time, as Solventum matures in its ability to execute independently, we also believe that they will keep exiting their TSAs. As I've told you, the TSAs, some are short term, some are as long as two years, that could go up to three years. We will see lower fees as Solventum begins to exit. And that's an impact of approximately $0.09 from a headwind on an EPS perspective, which is overall still in the range. Q2 was heavier than Q3 and Q4. Bill talked about the seasonal impact in our factories as we bleed down inventory in Q3. Restructuring costs based on what the team sees right now is flat Q2 to Q3. So the balance will go into Q4 as we talked about, and then you will see.\nYou know, we talked about $0.11 EPS impact for the second half on Combat Arms and PWS. As you know, we have made payments. By the end of July, we would have made $3.7 billion of payments under our agreements under the settlements under Combat Arms and PWS, which means you have a lower cash balance, investments in Q3, and that impacts 0.06 of EPS. So, between pension and interest cost, that's a headwind Q2 to Q3. The team continues to believe that they can step up to drive long-term growth, to step up investments, and then tax rate for the third quarter will be in the range of 20% to 21%. And the fourth quarter is the whole year is, I mean the second half is 19%. So you can back into the fourth quarter, which would be lower.\nHopefully this is helpful to get your models right.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stephen Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, good morning, and Monish, thanks. Thanks for all the help. It wasn't always easy for you guys, but you know, really appreciate you being front and center with the details and always doing your best to give us visibility into things. So we really appreciate the help there.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nBill, my first question is, will you get any summer vacation at some point? Because it sounds like.\nI'm not sure I've ever seen a new CEO in the first three months be shot out of a cannon like this and have this kind of detail. You're usually supposed to wait for about a year so you can reset and, you know, get the options before you get the long-term target. So we really appreciate the detail here. It sounds like you've been busy. Just the elephant in the room though. You talked a lot about capital allocation and, you know, I think the narrative obviously around PFAS is that there's negative optionality from the balance sheet, if you will, that it's a drag. You're talking about being a little bit more on your front foot from that perspective. And the only place PFAS is mentioned is in the, you know, Slide 2, which is in the legal disclaimers.\nYou didn't talk about it really at all in the slides.\nWhat's your take there? Do you have any, perhaps, pivot and strategy around PFAS and that liability?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nWell, thanks for the question. Look, you know, the first of all, we've got a great team of advisors, legal inside and outside, that are managing PFAS and other liabilities. You know, when I step back and look at just where we've been, you know, the public water supplier settlement was a great step, important first step really in managing some of the risk. But there's more to be done. You know, we're continuing to manage litigation from some of the opt-outs, you know, other cases within the MDL. There's Europe that's sort of hanging out there. We continue to control what we control in that, in that area. You know, we've got very exhaustive disclosures in the 10-Q and the 10-K, and you know, we just, again, we have a great team that are, that are really focused on managing that.\nYou know, where I think I'm best putting my time are the things that drive value creation for our owners, and that's driving the top line and driving operational excellence in the business. We do have. We generate great cash flow. We see it in the quarter. We saw the first half, you know, 90%-110% free cash flow conversion for the year. You know, I've got ideas on how we can drive that further over time. We're at 0.3 leverage ratio. So when I sit back, I think we actually have a very strong balance sheet. You know, we can manage, you know, appropriately the risks that we see in front of us. You know, and even through that we have options here to do things with our balance sheet.\nI'm focusing on the things we can control and really getting the team pivoted back to what do we do to drive growth and operational excellence.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nWhat do you think the market is missing in its pretty harsh and negative narrative around this PFAS overhang?\nFrom what you've heard,\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M",
    "content2": "I can't really comment on what the market may or may not be missing on that. Steve. What I'm focusing on the things that we control. I read the Q very, very thoroughly like all of our investors do, you know, it takes a long time to get through it. I think we've done it. We do a great job at the disclosure there. But again, we've got a great team that's managing this. It's a dynamic situation and I trust what they're doing. I'm involved in that. Mike's been very helpful. He has a lot of expertise in this area because of the time he had to spend on it. I'm relying on him here as well. And again, I think where my time is best placed is what do we do to drive the other 64,000 of the 65,000 employees?\nWhat are they going to do to drive value creation? We've got a lot of people focused on PFAS. We have to get people focused back on the core things of what makes 3M great.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nRight.\nIt's good to know you're reading the Q. Some time in your travels, to sit back with a nice scotch and read the Q. Thanks a lot. Good luck, and looking forward to connecting.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nLikewise.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question now from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes, good morning.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nMorning.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nMorning.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nMonish, thank you for all the help over the years. It's been a pleasure.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you. Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nJust a question on, just follow up on capital allocation. You know, it seems that, you know, with a lot more visibility on PFAS, you know, sort of operational focus, you know, the market is clearly reacting to the message very positively. What are the thoughts about maybe front loading share buyback, particularly as you release working capital, improving on time delivery? And I know you sort of highlighted buyback as one of the key opportunities, but in transformational stories like this. Right. Buying stock at the bottom tends to pay off longer term. What's your view and the view of the board on buybacks?\nThank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nWell, thank you. I mean, you're right. I mean, I do. I was very purposeful in the four top priorities for capital deployment. And number four was around excess cash for repos or M&A. There's just not M&A on the horizon. So you saw a step into the market in the second quarter that was under Mike and Monish's leadership. $400 million worth of buyback. We do have capacity. Our balance sheet looks very strong. We have an open authorization with our board. It's close to $4 billion. You know, we'll keep evaluating this as we sort of manage the risks that happen to be out there. Our ability to generate cash, drive down working capital in the back half.\nThrough all those levers, we'll look hard as to what we do with excess cash in the back half as well as into next year. You know, nothing more to say about that than that today.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nSure.\nAnd you know, historically, 3M has been one of the companies that investors would buy towards the bottom, towards the economic bottom, as things reaccelerate. I guess two-part question. First, do you think 3M has still has this cyclical leverage? You know, because you talked about new product introduction being down quite a bit. But generally, do you think this fundamental quality of the business to really re-accelerate into improving industrial and maybe one day consumer fundamentals is still there? And Bill, second question is, you know, how far away do you think we are from sort of industrial bottom? Because it just seems like there is no end, you know, we just can't, PMIs can't find a bottom. If, you know, if you could just sort of provide us with your view if and when there is any visibility on things bottoming out.\nI know a long question, but appreciate your answer.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nNo, no, good question. I mean, I do think, I do hope that we're bouncing along the bottom. It all depends on what happens here in the back half in the U.S., certainly, and you know, what the Fed does with interest rates and what's going on with inflation. There's a lot of geopolitical questions around the world. So you know, I'm optimistic that the market is going to start to recover. But again, I don't have a crystal ball like nobody on the call really does. So at the end of the day, I sit back and I look at what do we do with the assets that we have, and I think about the long history that 3M has in core innovation, new to the world ideas.\nI think as we reground ourselves back on that long-term mission, that culture, you know, that spirit of innovation, and we reignite that across the thousands of employees in this company that drive it every single day. To me, that's what I'm focused on. That's what I can control. You know, there's lots of great markets out there, lots of different pockets of places where we can invest in, to innovate, to penetrate, to grow, to differentiate offerings versus our competitors. That's what I'm focusing, focusing my time on. You know, the economy is going to do what it's going to do. I'm just watching where the trends happen to be and investing in places where we think we can drive some differentiation and grow higher than the market. Long answer to your question, but that's the way I think about it.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nReally appreciate it. Look forward to working with you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nLikewise.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citigroup.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nMorning.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nMorning.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nMonish. Thanks for all your help, Bill. Look forward to working with you. So maybe Bill or Monish, you mentioned that growth across your businesses has generally been in line with your expectations. But just focusing on transportation electronics, I know comps get a little more difficult in Q4, but would you say there's some upside? There's your original low single-digit growth forecast there. Do you see consumer electronics holding up in the second half, and have you seen any improvement yet in semiconductors?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nWell, thanks for the question. We actually had a very good first half. It's partly due to consumer electronics. There was some, you know, spec and wins that we happen to have there. We had a pretty good first half in, in auto, you know, as Monish mentioned in his prepared remarks, you know, company wide, we're up 9%. A lot of things are going to be in that TEBG segment. We're outgrowing the build rate. But as we watched over the last 90 days, the build rate for the year, which was down 50 basis points, now down 200 basis points for the year, a lot of it's going to be in the back half of the year. So we've got a little bit of caution on auto builds in general, which is factored into the guidance that we provided.\nMaybe I'll ask Monish to offer more commentary on that if there's any more.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nNo, same thing. I think we'll have to. Andy, as you know, this is cyclical, so we'll have to watch what happens in the second half. Bill mentioned that even in the prior question, and that's what the team is watching. We are watching all the trends that all of you watch, which is build rates on cars, build rates on consumer electronics. What the holiday season turns out to be, I think, are all factors the team will; they have watched in the past and will continue watching. And based on what we know right now, the team feels the guide that we've given you, which is for the company as a whole, is fair.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAnd then Bill, maybe can you talk about 3M's ability to price across its portfolio? When I hear the conversation regarding limited new product intros and R&D, obviously the thought is that can all impact price. So how, you know, structurally, you know, how effective can you be and how fast in sort of impacting pricing? And then it's hard not to notice. Consumer, for instance, remains pretty muted. I think that there's just the market. But is it particularly challenging to price in that segment?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThat's a very, very good question. You know, from what I can tell, last year, you know, we had significant, pretty significant price increases, and we did cover inflation this year in our sort of 1% center point of our Q2 guidance. You know, we have positive price within that. So we continue to see pricing. It's certainly lower than on a year over year basis than it was last year. You know, so on a macro basis, you know, our ability to price has been pretty good. We're capturing back inflation. But what I'm looking at is the more details around how we price by customer, by segment, and by product, you know, not just gross price, but net price. So, discounts, market development funds, and all those things between gross and net price. Is there an opportunity at the real micro level to price better?\nMy instinct is that there is an opportunity here, and this is an area that I'm going to focus a lot of time and attention on, that sometimes it's training, sometimes it's systems, sometimes it's data visibility, but there's an opportunity on a much more granular level. Take a look at how we price, and I'll know more in the next number of months and a couple of quarters as we go through the analysis. But I do believe we'll find some opportunities to do a better job on pricing. And the other point you mentioned about new product development, you're exactly right, which is as we innovate and develop differentiating features, we should be able to get better margin and better pricing on those new products that are coming out.\nSo as we reinvigorate the NPI engine, which I expect to do, hopefully that does drive price improvement, margin improvement over time as well.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nAppreciate the color.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nSure.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joseph O'Dea of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nJoeseph O’Dea\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning.\nThanks for taking my question.\nIn the interest of time, I'll just keep it to one. But Bill, just curious if you could expand a little on the dispassionate portfolio review comments. I understand sort of no specifics today, but if you could just talk about your timeline for completing reviews and then.\nYou know, as you do these, what.\nAre the key metrics that you ask business leaders to present on in the reviews as you sort of focus on decision making there?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nSo good question. 90 days in a job, I'm trying to learn the business, learn, you know, meet the team, understand what's going on in the business. So there's a lot that's happening right now, and I'm really focused there. I'm not to the point of any particular conclusions. I'm not necessarily near that, you know, but it is something that's something that's on our mind. You know, we're going to look hard at the teams. Are looking at this as well is how are we growing in each segment versus competitors? You know, what's the growth, earnings growth outlook, are we able to expand margins or not? You know, what's our NPI pipeline look like? And, and based on who we compete against, do we have an opportunity through better execution, through better operations, through new products coming down the path to improve our positioning in certain segments?\nYou know, at the end of the day, you know, we're an innovation-driven company. You know, technology differentiation is the lifeblood of how we compete. You know, so I'll be looking hard at businesses where we can bring technology differentiation into the business and provide value to customers that's different than our competitors. And I contrast that with commodity-like businesses that perhaps don't really fit so well. So no specific lens other than that. But we'll take a hard look at this and make some conclusions in the coming quarters next year as we get our arms around what's the business we should be in and also which businesses that we ought to be looking at outside the company.\n\nJoeseph O’Dea\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nI appreciate the thoughts, thank you.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, 3M\n\nJoe, are you there?\n\nOperator\n\nMr. Ritchie, your line is open. Please proceed with your question. We are not hearing your question at this time.\nMr. Ritchie, please check your mute button. We are still unable to hear you at this time.\nMr. Ritchie, please.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, 3M\n\nOperator, let's move on.\n\nOperator\n\nPlease re-register for your questions. We'll take our next question now from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nGood morning, all. Welcome, Bill, and best of luck to Monish.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director and Senior Industrial Equity Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nHey, yeah, Bill, I appreciate the rundown on the priorities. I thought the example on the Command strips was quite striking as you're thinking strategically about optimizing some of these touch points. Do you think you have the personnel, resources internally, the incentive structure internally to drive these changes or are you looking to third parties? Just trying to understand the timeline and what needs to be done here.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nOh, thank you. Yeah, this is a complicated problem. It's, you know, a lot of products, a lot of SKUs across a lot of factories and distribution points. You know, if you look at this on a global basis, you map all the DCs and all the flows, all the factories. It's a hairball, you know, spider's nest.\nI mean, it's a lot going on here, and we do have a great team in operations that are looking hard at this. We have outside advisors that are, have been involved, and you know, this will take some time. It's not, you know, a quarter, two quarters away. We'll continue to take a hard look at optimizing the networks and the flows. So, so we do have, we have the right people at the top level, and I do think that, you know, we've got the right incentive structures around as well, and motivations for the team.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director and Senior Industrial Equity Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nOkay, great. Appreciate the color. I'll leave it there.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nOkay.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question now from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director, Deutche Bank\n\nYeah, thanks.\nGood morning, guys, and welcome, Bill. Thanks, Monish, for all the help.\nMaybe, Bill, you could talk about the level of employee response and engagement. I suspect that you've probably been making a bit of a world tour in your first few months.\nAll of this change sounds really exciting.\nWould just love to hear how employees have been responding to what you'd like to do.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nLook, I think, I think employees here are excited. They're engaged. They want to make a difference. They want to see 3M grow, they want to see share price come up. They want to see, you know, recognition for doing great things in the world and developing new products. You know, that that's, that's the message I'm providing to you today. That's the message I'm offering to our employees. My priorities, as I explained to you, is what I've explained in some, maybe some more detail with employees in town halls. So this is, I think it's resonating well. I think hopefully it's energizing people, you know, but again, we've got a lot of strong people here, been here for a while that really want to make a difference and.\nI'm appealing to that. So I think the response has been good so far. Again, 90 days in.\n\nNicole DeBlase\n\nManaging Director, Deutche Bank\n\nThanks, Bill. In light of time, I'll pass it on and let someone else ask.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question now from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning and welcome, Bill. All the best to Monish.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThanks, Dean.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nLots of impressive game plan in terms of all the different operational initiatives, Bill. And it just raises the question for me is how you can't do everything at once. So what's the element of triage? And also, this is not a one-man show. Talk about your team. Are you deputizing internal folks? Do you have an army of consultants? You got a CFO search you've got to do. And then how much change can the organization handle at once? Is there any element? I mean, every, lots of stuff needs fixing. But is there a sense of how you can layer these in, and can change be too disruptive?\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nIt's a great question. I mean look, these are all important priorities, and I do think we can both try to drive growth through the mechanisms that I mentioned as well as operational excellence. I think it's fundamental. I've been through this before. It's not my first rodeo on these things. I can see a path to getting this work done. We have a great team of employees here. We have engaged outside advisors to help us, you know, across these different pieces and focus in some of these dimensions. You know, this is, yeah, it's a busy start. But I think we have the right team to deliver it. I think we have the right focus and priorities. We're going to sort of manage it and manage the capacity of the team to respond to all these pieces.\nBut yeah, I'm optimistic. I think we'll look at these pieces individually as we go forward. I've laid out a pretty full laundry list of things we want to do, but we'll prioritize these things as we get towards the back end of the year. But at the end of the day we're not going to be able to invest to grow unless we drive operational excellence.\nI would say operational excellence is.\nIn fact, a growth driver. When you're running your on-time investment full out of your factories at mid-80s, 86% and change was our Q2 results. We should be above 90%. You know, the fact is when you're below 90%, we're missing sales. So by getting our operations to run better, we actually, that is a growth lever. You know, as we drive productivity in our factories and create savings there that we can reinvest in growth initiatives, that's a growth lever. So I think you've got to do both of these two pieces at the same time and work the pedals. And that's what I plan to do.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\nI'll leave it there.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question now from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies and Company. Please proceed with your question.\n\nKevin Estok\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate of Chemicals, Emerging Technologies and Industrial Biotech, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning, this is Kevin Estok.\nEstok for Laurence. So I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more granularity.\nOn what you're seeing in terms of.\nChinese demand and whether you're seeing any green shoots there, and I'll leave it there just because of time.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nSo thank you for the question. Look, China for us is about 10% of our revenue. We had a good first half. You know, we're up about 13% in the first half. Part of that's electronics. You know, when you look at the piece that's sort of local for local, if you will, it's about 1%. So flattish and pretty similar to what other multinational, maybe even better than what a lot of other multinationals seeing in China. So again, it's about 10% of our business, an important market, and we've seen good growth in the first half of the year simply because of the consumer electronics and auto builds.\n\nKevin Estok\n\nEquity Research Senior Associate of Chemicals, Emerging Technologies and Industrial Biotech, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Bill Brown for some closing comments.\n\nBill Brown\n\nCEO, 3M\n\nOkay, well, thank you everybody for joining and participating today and for the thoughtful questions.\nI want to again thank all.\n3Mers around the world for their hard work and their dedication. I want to wish Monish well in his future endeavors. Thanks again for joining the call, and I wish everybody a good day. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question and answer session at that time. If you do have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this call is being recorded Tuesday, 30 April 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, 3M\n\nThank you and good morning everyone, and welcome to our Q1 earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mohnish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Mohnish will make some formal comments, then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our investor relations website at 3m.com\nPlease turn to slide two.\nPlease take a moment to read the forward looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nItem 1A of our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note, throughout today's presentation we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. Please turn to slide three.\nDuring today's presentation, Mike and Mohnish will discuss our Total Company Q1 2024 results, which are inclusive of the health care business and are on the same basis on which 3M provided Q1 guidance back in January. As we have mentioned, it is important to note that Solventum Corporation's separate financial reporting will differ from the basis of presentation used by 3M for the Health Care segment.\n3M's full year 2024 earnings guidance initiated today is on a continuing operations basis reflecting Solventum as discontinued operations for the full year including the Q1 of 2024.\nIn addition, we will be treating changes in the value of our 19.9% equity interest in Solventum as a special item and arriving at non-GAAP results adjusted for special items.\nAnd finally, we are providing additional financial information this quarter in our press release and slide presentation. Given the impact of the Solventum spin.\nWe hope that you find the information useful in understanding our Q1 performance and outlook for 2024. We also plan on filing additional information on a continuing operations basis, including in late July or early August, Form 8-Ks with recast 2023 Form 10-K and Q1 2024 Form 10-Q information.\nPlease turn to slide four for a summary of our updated post spin financial reporting framework.\nBeginning with Q2, Safety and Industrial, Transportation, Electronics, and Consumer business segment operating income will include the impact of the dis-synergies or stranded costs previously associated with Solventum. In addition, we have added a new operating category named Other for Solventum Transition Service Agreement costs which 3M will be reimbursed for beginning here in April.\nFinally, Corporate Unallocated will incorporate the commercial agreements between 3M and Solventum that started on 1 April 2024.\nOne final comment: in the appendix on slide 27, you will find information on our public water suppliers and Combat Arms legal settlements, including the pre-tax payment schedule by year and total combined pre-tax present value and after-tax estimates.\nWith that, please turn to slide five and I'll now hand the call off to Mike.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nMike, thank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the Q1, we delivered strong results that were better than our expectations as we returned to adjusted organic growth and achieved double-digit adjusted earnings growth. We improved performance across our businesses and in our operational execution. We also completed the spin-off of Solventum and finalized two major legal settlements. Our results demonstrate the positive impact of the changes we have made over the last several years. We've also made significant progress in executing our strategic priorities, which has positioned the company for long-term shareholder value creation. In the Q1, on an adjusted basis, we delivered revenue of $7.7 billion including improved organic growth, operating margins of 22% up 400 basis points, and earnings of $2.39 per share up 21%.\nOn 1 April 2024, we successfully completed the spin-off of our healthcare business, Solventum, creating two world-class companies well positioned to deliver greater shareholder returns through distinct and compelling investment profiles. As independent companies, both 3M and Solventum are better able to tailor their capital allocation and investment priorities to win in their respective markets. I want to thank and congratulate the teams whose dedication made this major accomplishment possible and wish the entire Solventum team, led by CEO Bryan Hanson, great success in the future. In Q1 we also finalized two major legal settlements. First, our settlement agreement with US-based public water suppliers received widespread support and participation. It was granted final approval by the court on 29 March. We anticipate making total payments with a pre-tax present value of up to $10.3 billion over the next 13 years.\nThe first payment is expected in Q3 of 2024. It is important to note our agreement with public water suppliers addresses the detection of any type of PFAS at any level. This includes PFAS that have already been detected or may be detected in the future, including those that are the subject of the US EPA's recently announced limits in drinking water. Second is our settlement of the Combat Arms Multi-District litigation. As of today, more than 99% of claimants have chosen to participate. This provides us the certainty and finality the settlement was intended to achieve. We anticipate making total payments up to a pretax present value of $5.3 billion through 2029.\nWe also continue to make good progress on our exit of all PFAS manufacturing. We are on track to meet our commitment by the end of 2025 and are working closely with each of our customers to complete an orderly transition. In summary, the progress across all three of our strategic priorities has helped make 3M stronger, leaner, and more focused on what we do best. Utilize 3M science to make indispensable products for our customers. I will now turn the call over to Mohnish for more details regarding our performance in Q1 and to discuss our guidance for 2024.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide six.\nWe continue to build upon the strong foundation we laid in 2023. We remain focused on our priorities and the team continues to deliver improving results. We posted strong adjusted results in the quarter including sales of $7.7 billion, operating margin of 21.9%, earnings per share of $2.39, and free cash flow of over $800 million.\nThese results were better than our expectations as we continue to drive strong operational execution and spending discipline. We also benefited from significant operating leverage, particularly in transportation and electronics, which was driven by strong organic volume growth in electronics and automotive. Our results also benefited from the acceleration of certain non-recurring actions which I will go through in more detail on the next slide.\nOur Q1 adjusted sales of $7.7 billion exceeded our expectations of $7.6 billion as we delivered improved organic growth, which was partially offset by a headwind from foreign currency. Translation, we delivered adjusted organic growth of nearly 1% or up 2.4% excluding geographic prioritization, product portfolio initiatives, and last year's disposable respirator comp.\nOrganic growth was driven by our transportation and electronics business as the team won share gains from spec-in wins and new product introductions with automotive and consumer electronics OEMs. This drove strong organic growth as the OEMs ramp production for new launches for end customers.\nGeographically, year-on-year strength in China and EMEA was driven by our strength in electronics and automotive. Sales in the US were flat year on year, with industrial and healthcare end markets showing relative strength offset by consumer retail softness.\nPlease turn to slide seven for details of the components that drove our year-on-year Operating Margin and Earnings Performance.\nAs mentioned, on an adjusted basis we delivered operating margins of 21.9%, up 400 basis points, and earnings of $2.39 per share, up 21%, versus last year's Q1. Our Q1 performance was driven by improved organic growth, particularly in transportation and electronics, along with a continued focus on operations, restructuring actions, and spending discipline, which drove better than expected improvements in operating margins of 340 basis points and earnings of $0.42 per share.\nAs disclosed in our Form 10-K and as factored into our Q1 guidance that we provided in January. Our year on year margins and earnings were benefited from the delay of our stock based compensation grants from our normal timing in the Q1 to the Q2 due to the Solventum spin. This timing adjustment added 140 basis points to margins and $0.15 to earnings per share as compared to last year's Q1.\nWe also accelerated certain non-recurring benefits including property sales as we progress on our asset-light strategy. This benefited first-quarter year-on-year operating margins by approximately 70 basis points and earnings by $0.08 per share.\nWe accelerated restructuring actions in the quarter, incurring pretax charges of $122 million, which was higher than our guidance of $75 to 100 million. This compared to last year's restructuring charge of $52 million, resulting in a negative year on year impact to margins of 90 basis points and $0.10 to earnings.\nForeign currency negatively impacted adjusted margins by 60 basis points or a negative $0.09 per share as a result of the strong US dollar. This headwind was larger than we had expected.\nThe reconsolidation of Arrow Technologies in Q2 2023 resulted in a $0.01 benefit year-on-year to earnings per share and was neutral to margins.\nAs expected, our adjusted tax rate was 20.5% this year, which was higher than when compared to 17.7% in last year's Q1, resulting in a $0.09 headwind to earnings. And finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.04 per share year-on-year impact. This benefit was primarily driven by interest income on proceeds from Solventum's issuance of $8.4 billion in debt prior to the separation, partially offset by a non-Op pension headwind. Please turn to slide eight.\nQ1 Adjusted Free Cash Flow was over $800 million. Adjusted Free Cash Flow conversion was 63%. In line with our historical Q1 trend.\nWe continue to focus on driving working capital efficiency, including improved cash conversion cycle times. I am pleased with the progress we have made, yet there remains significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $355 million in the quarter, down 20% year on year. The lower year on year spend is primarily due to nearing completion on water filtration investments at our manufacturing facilities.\nAnd finally we returned $835 million to shareholders via dividend.\nTurning to the balance sheet, net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $10.4 billion, a decline of 13% year on year driven by strong free cash flow generation of our businesses.\nAlso of note, in late February Solventum issued debt of $8.4 billion for which the repayment obligation went with Solventum, while 3M kept approximately $7.7 billion in proceeds upon Spin on 1 April 2024.\nThese proceeds combined with our business strong and reliable cash generation have further strengthened our balance sheet. In addition, the retained 19.9% equity stake in Solventum will provide additional future liquidity.\nAlso during the quarter we retired $2.9 billion of debt.\nOur strong capital structure and robust cash generation provides us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders, and meet the cash flow needs related to legal matter.\nNow please turn to slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance.\nStarting with our safety and industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 1.4% organically, industrial end market demand remained mixed in the quarter. We delivered strong double digit growth in roofing granules, driven by replacement demand and storm repair.\nIndustrial adhesives and tapes posted low single-digit organic growth driven by spec-in wins in new bonding solutions for consumer electronics devices.\nThe personal safety business declined low single digits as strong demand for self-contained breathing apparatus for the first responder market was more than offset by year-on-year comp headwind from disposable respirators.\nAnd finally, we experienced year on year organic sales declines in electrical markets, abrasives, automotive, aftermarket, and industrial specialties.\nGeographically, industrial markets in the United States were up 1% while China remained challenged. Adjusted operating income was $664 million, up 18% versus last year.\nAdjusted operating margins were 24.3%, up 410 basis points year on year. This performance was driven by benefits from ongoing productivity actions, timing of stock-based compensation, and strong spending discipline. These benefits more than offset headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs.\nMoving to transportation and electronics on slide 11, which posted adjusted sales of $1.8 billion or up 6.7% organically.\nConsumer electronics end markets were stable in the quarter while the semiconductor market remained soft.\nOur electronics business outperformed the market up mid-teens organically year on year. The introduction of new products continues to be well received in the market as evidenced by recent spec-in wins. In addition, we also experienced continued channel inventory normalization as electronics demand stabilizes.\nOur auto OEM business increased 13% in Q1 versus a 1% decline in global car and light truck builds.\nWe continue to win increased penetration including strong momentum in automotive electrification which was up over 30% year on year in Q1. We also saw an increase in channel inventory at tier suppliers during the quarter given the forecasted 8% sequential increase in the auto OEM builds from Q1 to Q2.\nLooking at the rest of transportation and electronics, commercial vehicles and transportation grew low single digits organically, and advanced materials was flat year on year. While our transportation and electronics business is off to a good start to the year, we estimate that approximately 2/3 of the strong Q1 organic growth was driven by initial buy ahead by customers as they ramped production and introduced new products along with channel inventory normalization.\nTransportation and Electronics delivered $479 million in adjusted operating income, up 68% year on year.\nAdjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 960 basis points versus Q1 last year. The team achieved this result through strong leverage on improved electronics volumes, ongoing productivity actions, strong spending discipline, and the previously mentioned timing of stock based compensation grants.\nPartially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from restructuring costs.\nTurning to slide 12, the consumer business posted Q1 sales of $1.1 billion. Organic sales declined 3.9% year on year, with continued softness in consumer discretionary spending, which included a 2.4 percentage point impact from portfolio and geographic prioritization.\nHome improvement and consumer safety and well-being declined low single digits, and home and auto care declined mid single digits, while packaging and expression declined high single digits. Organically, we continue to invest in the business, including supporting successful new product launches such as Command Heavyweight Hanging products and sustainably focused Scotch-Brite Cleaning Tools and Scotch Home and Office Tapes.\nOrganic growth declined across all geographies. The US was down low single digits, Asia Pacific mid single digits, and EMEA high single digits.\nConsumer's Q1 operating income was $216 million, up 21% compared to last year, with operating margins of 19%, up 400 basis points year on year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from productivity actions, portfolio initiatives, strong spending discipline, and the previously mentioned timing of stock-based compensation grants.\nPartially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and higher restructuring costs.\nFinally included in the appendix is a slide on the Q1 performance for healthcare.\nThe business delivered results within our expectations with organic growth of 1% and operating margins of 17.5%.\nNow turning to guidance for the year on Slide 14.\nAs Bruce mentioned at the beginning of the call, our full year 2024 outlook initiated today is on a continuing operations basis, reflecting health care as discontinued operations for the full year, including the Q1. We have confidence in the momentum we have built throughout 2023. We continue to deliver strong results, including the Q1, which was better than expectations.\nThe guidance initiated today represents a return to growth, adjusted margins up 200 to 275 basis points year on year versus the illustrative midpoint of 18.7% for 2023, and over 15% earnings per share growth at the midpoint.\nWe anticipate full year adjusted organic growth of flat to up 2% or up 1% to 3 excluding the impact from geographic prioritization and product portfolio initiatives. We are taking.\nThis estimated organic growth rate incorporates full year external forecast for major end markets, including an expectation of continued mix growth in industrial end markets. Automotive OEM build rates are currently forecasted to be down slightly. Consumer electronics are expected to grow low single digits for the year, while semiconductor market is currently forecasted to start the year slow and improve as the year progresses.\nFinally, consumer retail discretionary spending is expected to remain muted for the year.\nAs mentioned, we expect a strong expansion in adjusted operating margins of approximately 200 to 275 basis points year on year, up from an estimated midpoint of 18.7% in 2023.\nWith respect to adjusted EPS, we anticipate full year 2024 earnings in the range of $6.80 to 7.30 per share on a continuing operations basis or over 15% year-on-year growth at the midpoint.\nTurning to cash. Our businesses continue to deliver strong and consistent free cash flow. Our expectation is that adjusted free cash flow conversion performance post spin will remain in the range of 90% to 110.\nPlease turn to slide 15 for more details on our full year guidance.\nIncluded in our outlook is for normal sequential patterns through the year coupled with the end market trends just discussed. As a result, we anticipate that our second half of the year sales will be slightly stronger than the first half. Our expectations also include a 1% foreign currency headwind to sales given the strength of the US dollar at current spot rates or a negative $0.20 to earnings per share.\nWe also anticipate an approximately 75 basis point benefit to sales from the commercial agreement with Solventum. Please note that this benefit will be reflected within acquisition and divestitures. From an external reporting perspective.\nWe expect adjusted operating income and earnings per share to show relative strength in the second half of the year. This is primarily due to the impact from the timing of the Solventum spin on 1 April, along with our pre-tax restructuring charges of $250 to 300 million that are weighted 70% to the first half of the year.\nWe will continue to benefit from productivity and restructuring actions partially offset by increased investments in the business as we progress through the year. Looking at below the line items, we estimate full year other expense net will be in the range of $75 million to 100 million, mostly weighted to the second half of the year.\nOur 2024 adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 19% to 20%, with the first half of the year coming in at the high end of the range, as Bruce mentioned earlier and detailed further on slide 26 in the appendix. The new operating category named Other is forecasted to have a net operating loss of approximately neutral to $25 million. This range includes Q1 net operating loss of approximately $65 million on a continuing operations basis.\nBeginning in April, Transition Service Agreement costs plus a markup will be reimbursed to 3M, and therefore we will generate modest income in the remaining three quarters of the year. Finally, Corporate and unallocated includes full year 2024 sales in the range of $225 million to 275 million. For commercial agreements with Solventum beginning in April, we expect full year corporate and unallocated net operating loss in the range of $125 million to 175 million.\nThese ranges include Q1 revenue of approximately $25 million and net operating loss of approximately $75 million.\nAs we have previously discussed, we estimate annualized dis-synergies of approximately $150 to 175 million. These costs were previously associated with Solventum and will now be allocated to safety and industrial, transportation and electronics, and consumers starting in April.\nSpecific to Q2, we expect continued strong execution to drive operating performance. As disclosed in our Form 10-K, stock-based compensation grants were delayed to Q2. As a result, we expect to incur $125 million to 150 million in expense in Q2. We will also increase investments to support end market demand and drive growth and productivity.\nPlease turn to slide 16 for more details by business group.\nTaking into account my earlier comments regarding current foreign full-year macroeconomic, and major end-market forecasts, we estimate organic sales growth in safety and industrial to be flat to up low single digits. Adjusted organic sales growth for transportation and electronics is forecasted to be up low single digits. This is better than our estimated range of flat to up low single digits provided in January. Recognizing our strong Q1 growth performance.\nIn consumer we estimate organic sales to be down low single digits, which includes our ongoing product portfolio initiatives. These actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind for the consumer business of approximately two percentage points. I want to take a moment to thank our team for the work they have done in successfully executing across our three strategic priorities. Their disciplined work has created value and returned capital to shareholders with a successful spin out of our healthcare business. They have also helped reduce risk by reaching two large settlements while making progress on the exit of PFAS manufacturing, and, most importantly, our teams have made tremendous progress on fundamentally improving how we work, which is driving better performance across the business.\nIn closing, we delivered a strong start to the year. As we look ahead, we are focused on building on our momentum, supporting expectations for a return to organic top line growth, margin expansion, investments in high growth and attractive end markets, and continued strong cash generation. This leaves us well positioned for long term success and consistent value creation for our customers and shareholders.\nPlease turn to Slide 17, and I will turn it back over to Mike Roman.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThanks, Mohnish. Paying a competitive dividend has been a priority for 3M for more than 100 years. This will continue to be true following the spin-off of Solventum. As part of the spin, we distributed 80.1% of Solventum's outstanding shares to our shareholders, and post-spin, we have made the decision to reset 3M's dividend. As a result, we anticipate a dividend of approximately 40% of adjusted free cash flow. This represents a dividend that is in line with our industrial peers and well above the S&P 500 median, with the potential to increase over time. We expect to seek board approval to declare the Q2 dividend in May with payments anticipated in June. In addition, post-spin, we have stepped back into the market for share repurchases.\nBefore I conclude, let me emphasize some important points from the quarter. Q1 was a strong start to the year, driven by significant improvements in operational execution as well as the achievement of several major milestones toward our strategic goals, including the successful spinoff of Solventum and the settlement of two major legal matters. I would like to thank our people for their dedication and continued focus on delivering value for our customers and shareholders. Through their efforts, we are well positioned to deliver a strong 2024. Tomorrow, 1 May 2024, I transition into the role of Executive Chairman. I look forward to working with Bill Brown as he assumes the role of CEO. That concludes our formal remarks, and we will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to register a question, please press Star one on your telephone keypad. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw, please press Star two. If you are using a speakerphone, please lift up your handset before entering your request. Please limit your participation to one question and one follow up. We go first this morning to Julian Mitchell of Barclays.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks very much. Good morning, and congratulations, Mike, on the transition, and obviously you'll stay very involved in the Executive Chairman role.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYes, thank you Julian.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nAbsolutely. Maybe just to start off with Mohnish, you packed a lot of clarification on the moving part into the prepared remarks, so thanks for that. Maybe just to try and understand a little bit better the quarterly sort of cadence here. So it sounds like Q2 EPS, you know, down slightly maybe versus the sort of $1.70 on ops number for Q1. That's really because of the stock comp and the one-timers that you talked about. So do we think about sort of Q2 revenue being similar to Q1? Margins down a bit because of the stock comp and one-timers. Then as we step into H2, you've got higher revenues, half-on-half, and then sort of good operating leverage off the stepped up revenue, maybe just. Any thoughts around that?\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah, I would say, Julian, so you summarized it. I would go back and say there's so many moving pieces that I would really say first look at first half, second half, and then when you do that, we would also show you that on revenue we are starting to hit normal seasonality trends. So on revenue the first half, second half is 4,951. And then the margin split first half, second half is 47.53. And the reason for that is some of the items that you've mentioned. Part of the biggest item there is Solventum's Q1 where we don't get reimbursed for TSAs. That's driving the 47 to 53.\nIf you now go into the important factors just into Q2 to make sure that I cover all the points, restructuring charges are between $250 to 300 for the year. 70% is weighted to the first half. Similarly, you mentioned it too, and I said that in my prepared remarks. We will incur stock-based compensation headwind around $120 to 150 million FX. The stronger dollar continues to remain in the Q2. We've got to factor all that in. I would say that's why we've given you first half, second half guidance. There are more details. I know Bruce and the team can walk you through it, but if you start with that, I think you'll get directionally in the zone that we're talking about.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThat's very helpful. Thanks, Mohnish. Then maybe a second question, perhaps more for Mike, but on capital allocation. So clearly you and the board spent a lot of time thinking about balance sheet leverage of 3M to settle on that sort of 40% dividend payout ratio. You also mentioned though that on the buyback some step up since the Solventum spin. So maybe help us understand kind of how you and the board are thinking about 3M's leverage requirements from here, how meaningful could a buyback be, and then tied to that. Mohnish, any clarification on interest expense guide for this year based on that balance sheet?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nSure. Julian. Yeah, I would start with, you know, we continue to be a strong cash generator and we're well capitalized to invest in our business, which continues to be the first priority for capital allocation and also return capital to shareholders, including the dividend that we've been talking about and share repurchases. And I, you know, my comment, we're back in the market, you know, the pace will depend on how we view the macro, how we look at our performance, the intrinsic value of our stock. We haven't declared really how we're going to move forward on that. So well positioned to, like I said, invest in and drive the capital allocation priorities that we talk about.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nJulian, I'll answer your second question. You know, when we talk about below-the-line items, we talk about two things mainly: it's pension and it's interest expense/income. So I'll combine the two. So our guide is net expense of $75 to 100 million or $0.10 to 0.15 per share.\nQ2, as I mentioned, will continue to benefit from the interest income that we received from the dividend that we received from Solventum of $7.7 billion. So therefore, the $75 to the $100 million guide for the year will mostly be weighted to the second half of the year.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOh thanks. Good morning.\nMorning. Morning. Mike, hopefully the executive chairman role is a bit less stressful than chairman CEO role. So congratulations on that. So just a few more, maybe a few more details on the Q2, Mohnish, the restructuring. Understands 3% in the first half, 3% in the second half. How does that phase between Q1 and Q2? I'm just trying to understand whether that's fairly level loaded or whether there's a bit more coming through in the Q2. And then on the restructuring, I see the total charges. But in terms of the gross payback, what kind of payback are we assuming on that restructuring, and are we still, you know, on a 3M Roman basis, still on track for $700 to 900 million of savings by 2025.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah. So I'll start with the first one, Nigel. As I said, it's 70% weighted in the first half of the $250 to 300 range in Q1. At a whole co basis, we did $122 million of restructuring that I said in my announcement, and then you'll see health care was approximately $20 million of that. So you've got $100 million that is on co basis, and so the balance is.\nSo you can get the math. When I come to your next piece on payback, I just wanted to start again. I've said this before. I'd say it again. You have to look at restructuring in total. So when we started this program, we said there are multiple things we wanted to achieve. Number one was we wanted to change the way we work, and the way we achieved that was streamlining our supply chain, getting a shorter path to customers. And third was reduce stranded cost, have a lighter center, as well as create oxygen to invest in the business. And when we put that program together, that was including Holcomb. As we have now spun out healthcare, you can see all those items starting to come in, which is margin expansions coming in.\nThat is big happening because of the improvement we have in our supply chain and the way we work. It's happening because we are closer to customers. It's happening because we have reduced stranded cost. When we started our journey and we announced the spin of healthcare, we had said industry benchmark was somewhere between 1 to 1.5% of sales, which is like $400 to 450 million. Now our dis-synergies from the spin out of healthcare and the $150 to 175 million, and we're going to keep working that, in some cases grow into it, in some cases we'll keep working down, and you've seen we've been able to do that, and at the same time we've created oxygen to invest in the business. Mike mentioned some of the spec-in wins that we have got in TBG.\nWe have continued to invest in CBG in a down market. We've done the same with SIBG, and we had over 30 new launches across the company in the Q1. So that's the way I would look at it on a payback basis. I would tell you that we are still continuing to have very good payback, and in fact we were able to accelerate some of our restructuring actions as well as get some one time gains like property sales in Q1. So overall, look at the total margin, 200 to 275 basis points up on a year over year basis, which is a reflection of all the actions the team has taken.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks Manish.\nMy follow-up questions on the dividends. There's been a huge sort of chatter in the industry about the potential dividend scenarios, but so hopefully that's now behind us. But the 40% payout ratio on adjusted free cash flow is the intent, Mike, to keep that 40% relatively stable going forward. So as you grow earnings and free cash flow going forward, the dividend should increase as well.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, I would think of it as a guide of how we're thinking about it. You know, the approximately 40% of Adjusted Free Cash Flow, you know, that's the way the board, that's the guide that the board is looking at as we go forward. So that's where we start as we go forward with continuing operations.\nThe best way to think about it, Nigel.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nOkay, fair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Andrew Kaplowitz at Citi.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nHi Andy.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nHi Andy.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nMike, thanks for all your help over the years. Congratulations. Can you update us on your industrial channels within safety and industrial? Are they generally to the point where you have better visibility and destocking is mostly over, and it does seem like precision industrial adhesives and tapes has been turning the corner over the last couple quarters? Is that a bit of a canary in the short cycle industrial businesses that you have?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, Andy, I would say if you look at inventory in the channels as kind of a measure of that, that's, I would say, it's been reducing some of the inventory in the channel really around improving supply chains. We talked a bit about this last quarter. As supply chains improve, our distributors in the channel are taking advantage of shorter cycle times and managing down some of their inventory. There's also a bit of a cautious outlook. You know, Mohnish talked about a mixed outlook for industrial markets. And you know, if you think about it, look at our results from Q1 industrial adhesives and tapes and personal safety when you adjust for the year-over-year respiratory change. Those were both; they're multiple market, multiple industrial market focused, and they were both up slightly in the quarter.\nSo they're seeing a bit of both across their markets. We have some market-focused businesses like industrial mineral that's seeing strong demand, and then we have some other market-focused businesses, industrial, like automotive aftermarket and our kind of industrial specialties, which was a lot of our products that go into shipping. So the shipping dynamics, the mild winter impacts on auto repairs, those are; we're seeing kind of the downside of that in some of those markets. So it's a mixed market. Again, the channel's adjusting, taking advantage of improving supply chains, and I would say somewhat cautious about the broader mixed nature of those end markets.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThat's helpful, Mike. And then Mohnish, obviously you mentioned a relatively good T&E start. You know, you did have a pretty easy comparison in Q1, but you know, 7% growth, you're still guiding the low single digits. I know it's up a little bit. You mentioned the backend was a big part of the Q1 improvement. But is there any reason why your improved spends wouldn't continue in electronics? And then are you seeing any improvement at all yet, you know, in semiconductors and those kind of end markets?\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah, I would say first we are thrilled that we've got these back in. So that's a big positive. As I said, 2/3 of the total, 6.7%, that's approximate. We don't have the perfect number. We believe is partly driven by inventory normalization both in auto and electronics.\nPlus customers starting to buy ahead as they start building for end markets or consumer end markets. What I would tell you is second half is so important for the consumer electronics business, and we are watching that trend. If there is a big pickup in consumer electronics, we will definitely grow with it because we are now specced into many more devices than before. So that I would say second half is what we are watching. But this is where we see it right now. And then on semiconductor, our view is we saw the Q1 slow, and we believe that this will pick up in the second half. Andy. And that's what we are watching there too.\nAll indications keep saying that it's going to get better, but we are watching those trends.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nHelpful, Mohnish. Thanks guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Scott Davis of Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning guys.\nBest of luck to you, Mike, in your next endeavors, et cetera.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThanks Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGuys, a couple. I'll just start with a nit and then, and then ask a real question. But I'm looking at slide 27. Why does the 2026 payment dip? What was kind of the. Just walk us through a little bit of the color of the kind of how these payments were negotiated annually.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah. So there were so many facts that were put together, Scott. This is one of them on how these profiles were scheduled. So there's no particular reason to give it out to you. This is a lot of factors, pluses and minuses that put the whole agreement together.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay.\nSo, there's nothing specific in there that 2026 you...\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nNo.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nI can take it offline.\nOkay. More importantly, you know, Mike, if you look back at the long-term growth rate ex healthcare of 3M, it's been kind of sub 2%, so below GDP, and that includes some price. Inevitably, I would assume.\nWhat do you think the entitlement Growth rate of this business longer term? I mean, this goes back 10 years. I think that's a full cycle for sure. But when you think about the next three or five years, what do you think that the business should be able to grow at? You know, obviously Bill is going to have his own, you know, his own initiatives. But what is your view on that?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, Scott, I won't get ahead of Bill and kind of how he's going to think about going forward. I, you know, you saw our guidance for this year. It's in line with macro. Importantly, when you look at what drives our growth, it's really investing in the business. Organic investments have been the dominant driver of growth for us as a company, and we expect that to continue as we move forward. Like I said in my speech, making indispensable products for our customers, and that means leveraging our innovation, our technologies, our manufacturing capabilities to come up with differentiated solutions for our customers and do that more and more prioritizing our investments. As we've talked a lot about, where do we prioritize investments in attractive marketing markets that are, you know, have growth dynamics that are better than the macro.\nThat's kind of the way to really drive this growth strategy forward. And that's how we think about it. That's how we focus. It's important that we really do prioritize leveraging our innovation so that we create not only the growth, but the differentiated value leader. In a way, we deliver value to shareholders in terms of margins. And so it's a, that's the way I think about the formula for growth. And it's been the foundation for building the company. And it's a foundation for success as we go forward as well.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nTotally fair. I'll pass it on. But congrats on getting all this work done the last year. I'm sure it's been a lot of heavy lifting. So congrats and best of luck this year.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Andrew Obin of Bank of America.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, good morning. It's Andrew Obin.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nHey, Andrew.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nGood morning, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey. Mike, congratulations. Great job getting all this legal stuff out of the way.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThanks, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nYeah, so I would take an issue with Scott's statement about lack of growth at 3M. I don't know where he's getting his numbers because pre-COVID company has grown at on average at 3.7% organically based on my model. So I actually have the exact opposite question.\nWhat is this? For example, safety and growth. You say that industrial production has grown 2%, yet the guidance is 0% to 2%. You have 100 basis points, sort of this portfolio geography drag. Can we just dig in as to what you think are impediments to growth coming out post-COVID? Because it does seem things have changed after that. Because I would have expected that you would outperform industrial production. Right. And you know, every year they seem to be sort of new headwinds, you know, that are completely logical but they seemingly come out of nowhere. Why the company's growth sort of seems to be below average. Thank you.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, Andrew, you know, it's kind of building on maybe my answer to Scott. You know, the macro is an important part of this. We think about the macro for us, for 3M, is a combination of GDP, where we have the, you know, our consumer business, and then it's also around industrial production in a broader industrial and transportation electronics. But importantly, we go down, and we really look at the markets that we're part of, and so driving that growth. And you know, again, the way we deliver on growth better than macro or in line with macro is to pick markets where we can really leverage our innovation and be differentiated, and drive our growth out of those attractive markets. And so what is the driver of it? Maybe if you don't do this well, that's your impediment.\nQuestion is to really prioritize those attractive markets where you can, where we can deliver differentiated 3M solutions. That's the model that will drive us forward.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nRight. And then maybe just a follow up. I know you guys are tweaking your global distribution, exiting. Some. Right. Direct distribution. You are starting to utilize distributors. Can you just talk about sort of what have you experienced so far with these changes to the models? What are the pros and cons? Because, you know, some of the commentary referred is that 3M was leaving money on the table with distributor, you know, some sort of legal risk associated. How do you mitigate those and what has the experience been so far? Thank you.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, Andrew, just talking about the change. So this was part of the restructuring. Actually, it was part of the model change that we've been making. Really focusing on leading through our businesses globally and prioritizing where they, you know, the most important parts of their business and looking at what's the best model to put in place. And so geographic prioritization was the way we termed it. And so we focused on some of the smaller countries that we operate in. We talked about approximately 30; we've launched this in 27 countries at this point. It's really a model to move to an export model, and we do have to. It's much more than kind of the way we've talked about on the headlines.\nYou have to set up a successful model. You have to set up a model to support distributors. You're changing from the traditional 3M model in those countries to an export-driven model. So it's important that we not only have capabilities, you know, in region but globally to support that kind of model in those countries. It's also important that we have strong governance everywhere we operate around the world. So we continue to focus on, you know, advancing our governance model as we make those changes. So it is a much, you know, more dimensions to the change. We're off to a good start and successful with that. We call it a, you know, a revenue impact this year because we're switching to an, you know, export model. And so we are, you know, we're driving a different price model with our distributors.\nBut that is going to continue to drive, I think, as it succeeds, will drive very good performance for us on a go-forward basis.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nIt also helps us to add on to Mike's, you know, your comments on pros benefits. You take a lot of structure out from those countries. That also has benefited us on the margin line. It also helps us focus our portfolio like what are we going to sell? And therefore it's SKU rationalization that once you get through this you will have a different inventory profile that support those smaller countries. So they're still very important countries for us. In no way are we walking away. It's just a different way of approaching them.\n\nAndrew Obin\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nThank you very much.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey guys, good morning. And Mike, like always, best of luck. Congratulations.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThanks Joe.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI'm going to start just to start with a quick just clarification, so just apologies on this, but like slide 15 where you give the operating income number of $1.2 billion. So if I just kind of back out the performance this quarter, it assumes health care, you know, stranded costs of roughly $100 to 150 million go into the segment. So just want to make sure I have that right. And then also on that slide on the restructuring charges, Mohnish, going back to your comments from earlier. So is the way to think about it is $100 million ish the Q1 x the health care number, that's the apples to apples comparison to the restructuring charges of $250 to 300 for the year.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M",
    "content2": "Try me again on the first piece of a question I didn't follow exactly, but I'll answer your second one. So the $250 to 300 is embedded in here, and that's on a continuing ops basis. So that does not include healthcare.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, all right, great. Yeah. So just on the operating income quickly, you know, I think you guys did roughly $1.7 billion this quarter. I think we had like roughly call it $350 million or so in healthcare profit. So you backed that out. That's above the $1.2 billion number. So I was just basically trying to understand how much of the healthcare stranded costs go into the other segments.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah, so I think that there are two pieces to this. One is the dis-synergies of healthcare, which on an annualized basis right now we think it's $150 to 175 million. Then the second piece of this is, as I've mentioned, there's $250 million of costs that we hold on behalf of Solventum for which you get reimbursed 1 April onwards. So you eat Q1 with no reimbursement, basically. So if you look at our other segment, Joe, you will see or other category, you will see a loss of $65 million in there, in Q1. And that's basically. We don't get reimbursed for that in Q1.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Okay. No, I think I've got it and can follow up afterwards.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah, Bruce can follow up offline with you.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, yeah. And then just another quick follow-up on the electronics business. And so I know the stats you kind of gave on demand and then inventory normalization. Is it possible to kind of parse out the inventory benefit that you're seeing? I'm just curious like how much of that 15% came from just inventories normalizing just because, you know, maybe I'm just not close to it anymore. But I'm just curious like what other products are really kind of driving end market demand for electronics at this point?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, Joe, what we talked about in the results for TBG in Q1 and electronics, these are spec in wins on some of the mobile platforms. So the inventory, it's getting ready for the demand, really the demand that they're seeing into Q2. At this point it's really, that's, that's the step up and there's a portion of it that's inventory kind of filling into the value chain of those OEMs. But the bigger part of it is the spec in for us anyway. The bigger part of it is the wins and the spec inside of it.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nMike, that's smartphone demand.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nIt's mobile devices, largely phones. Yep, yep, largely phones.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay.\nOkay, great. All right, thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nHey, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nMike, congrats again and thanks for all the help over the years and the effort.\nJay, just to be clear, you said 40% of adjusted free cash flow. Can you just help us with what the construct of that is? What is adjusted free cash flow?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYou're referring to the dividend, Steve, I presume?\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, just the construct. I don't need a number for cash. Just how do you define that adjusted free cash?\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nIf you look at all our material that we have submitted, you will see historically what we have broken out is from our GAAP results. There are certain items that we have been adjusting to get to adjusted results, which is litigation.\nExpenses, number one. Number two is PFAs, because we've been exiting. We've been showing PFAS as an exit. And number three was all the cost incurred to spin out Solventum or the healthcare business. So same construct there. And as always, Steve, if we decide to change something, we'll keep you all posted on changes to adjustments, but those are the big ones. And if you see our press release.\nStatements or schedules, you will see that split by category in there.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYes, Steve, it's all detailed in our press release attachments.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nRight. So whatever you're paying out in cash for these liabilities, that is adjusted out of free cash. So, for example, the 4.3 billion or whatever this year will be adjusted out, and then you take whatever we want to assume for free cash flow and then take 40% of that, correct?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nCorrect.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nOkay.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for the clarification.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nAppreciate it.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYep. Yep.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nHey, Jeff.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for clarifying that on the dividend. That was a key question. Also, I just wonder, you know, to any degree, you know, has Bill Brown been involved in the kind of the formulation of the updated guidance here, whether explicitly or tacitly? And I know he's formally starting tomorrow, but just any color on that would be interesting and helpful.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nSure, Jeff, you know, Bill's as you would expect, getting ready to step into the role. He's been engaged with myself, senior management, and the board since the announcement, but he's really, you know, his part is being informed and getting ready to start, as you said, tomorrow. He's not part of the decisions on what we've laid out here in the earnings call today. So he's, he starts tomorrow. Bill starts tomorrow. And I look forward to working with him as he does.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat.\nThen just thinking about again the cash flows as it relates to the liability outflow that we're looking at here.\nWhat guidance, if any, could you provide on, you know, what you're thinking on insurance recoveries and if you're successful in those claims, you know when those might start flowing as potential offsets to the liability schedule?\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah. So we believe that we are eligible for insurance payments. We have put our insurance providers on notice for PWS and for Combat Arms. And in fact, for Combat Arms, we are working on an arbitration to recover that. So as you know, these things take some time to work through and that's what the teams are working on. And we'll keep you posted as soon as we come to know on what that number could look like.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat, thank you. I'll leave it there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Brett Linzey of Mizuho.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHey, good morning, all, and congrats to Mike.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThanks, Brett.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nHi, Brett.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nYeah, I wanted to come back to the portfolio and the geographic prioritization. So you called out the 100 basis points headwind in 2024. Should we think of the Q1 as the starting point and just simply, you know, anniversary that headwind for the balance of the year and it's complete, or is this more of a multi year initiative with some top line drag?\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThere's a little bit of drag next year, but it's not big. I would just say the first half of this year will be slightly heavier than the second. Directionally I would say yes. You can use the Q1 as the math that gets you across the four quarters.\n\nBrett Linzey\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nOkay, great. I guess the follow-up you called out some contribution from those initiatives in each of the segments. Are you able to size what that benefit is? And I would imagine it's sort of structural, but any color would be great.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nYeah. I would just say when we look at it in total, it's why are we doing these portfolio moves or geographic moves? It comes down to it allows us to do better focus, better prioritization. So at the end of the day, you're going to see it in multiple places. You're going to see better sales growth in other products because we're exiting these and the teams can focus whether it's ad merch, et cetera. You will see it in inventory because again, we'll be able to focus our inventory on the products that we want to focus on. And you're going to see it a little bit in margin. That margin will take a little bit of time to come through. But some of these products that we are exiting are below our average margin. So it does help us lift the average margin.\nThen as I said on the geographic prioritization side, you get a lot of structure out, which is already embedded in our margin that we are seeing. We are getting some one-time benefits on property sales that we disclosed this quarter.\n\nJoe Ritchie\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, great. Appreciate the detail. Best of luck.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my time. Hi, wanted to ask on PFAS, and you've talked about the exits there, kind of progressing to plan, if not a little bit ahead of plan. But just how do we think about alternatives? I think there's been press over the years on different applications across a number of different end markets, and we think about semiconductors, military, or auto. Do you expect to participate in that? Where are you on the sort of product innovation pipeline and being able to sort of provide alternative products to what you're exiting?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nAnd Joe, you know, as I said in my comments, we work with each of our customers as part of the transition. I would say there's kind of three alternatives for them. One is PFAS from another source. A number of the applications, many of the significant applications, they're challenged to find an alternative. So that's what they're looking to do is source PFAS from another supplier. The second one is perhaps there's a chemistry that has similar properties that isn't PFAS and you can move into that. We're exiting PFAS and we're not going to move into other chemistries. They'll be durable and persistent to meet the requirements of these applications. The one area where we can help in what we're doing for ourselves is working to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products.\nWe're engineering them out, we're designing around them, and there's a number of applications our customers have where that's very difficult to do and challenging, and they don't know a solution today. But for us, the majority, the vast majority, we're already worked through solutions. So that's something that we can help customers with, and we are. We're helping them look at alternative ways to design and engineer their processes and products.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThat's helpful.\nAnd then second question is just related to CERCLA designation and really just trying to understand what the designation versus not getting the designation means at a high level. I think when you first announced this being proposed, you talked about how 3M's view was this would not lead to a timely or appropriate kind of remediation. But just to try to understand, you know, having, having the designation versus not having it, you know, at the end of the day kind of what, what that means.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, there are, there are certain, you know, I would say EPA responsibilities that would come with CERCLA designation. We, at this point, we don't anticipate an impact on our ability to serve customers and will, you know, as we better understand all those requirements, and we're committed to meeting and complying with the requirements under CERCLA and the EPA guidelines.\n\nJoe O'Dea\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next now to Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\nGood morning everyone.\nMy congrats to Mike and also to the team on orchestrating all these moving parts.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, thanks.\n\nMohnish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M\n\nThank you, Deane.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, and just a quick follow-up on that last PFAS question. So the enforcement actions by the EPA, they set PFAS as hazardous. So, that's a milestone. And then in the process of setting up the Superfund. So would either of these actions put you closer to being able to set a reserves? I know you couldn't before. For accounting purposes, it was not estimable or the probable. But now we're closer to that. So are you closer to where you could be setting reserves for these remaining unaddressed PFAS liabilities?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nYeah, Deane, we're, you know, we are, as I've said a number of times, we're proactively managing this, all aspects of the PFAS dynamic. And as soon as we can get to probable and estimable, we will, you know, we will take the reserve. So it, and we'll, you know, we'll keep you informed. And I would refer to our SEC filings for updates.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThat's real helpful. And just one other one, I'm sorry, is there any scenario where 3M would continue to manufacture PFAS after the year-end 2025 target?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nNo, Deane, we're committed to that exit. We're on track and we're committed to follow through.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAll right, loud and clear. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M\n\nThis concludes my last earnings call as 3M CEO. I would like to thank the investors, shareholders, analysts, employees, and family who join these calls each quarter. I greatly appreciate your questions and diligence in working to better understand our company. I'm confident that under Bill's leadership, our people will continue to build on the momentum from our strong start to the year. Thank you for joining us and have a great day.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line at this time."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, 23 January 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nSVP for Investor Relations, 3M Company\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Q4 earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3M.com. Please turn to slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement.\nDuring today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. Please note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release.\nPlease turn to slide 3. During today's presentation, Mike and Monish will discuss our 2024 outlook. This outlook will be provided on the same adjusted basis used during 2023. In the coming months, there are significant milestones that the company expects to complete, including the spin of the Healthcare business and the finalization of the public water supplier, and Combat Arms legal settlements. The Healthcare spin remains on track for H1 2024, subject to customary closing conditions as detailed in our SEC filings.\nWe continue to expect the business to be spun off with an estimated net leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA and with the proceeds to be distributed to 3M prior to the completion of the spin. We are working through the processes with all parties and the courts in both the public water supplier and Combat Arms earplugs legal settlements. Our goal is their finalization and ultimate implementation. Absent the proceeds from the intended spin-off of the healthcare business, the company has not concluded how it would fund amounts due under the public water supplier and Combat Arms earplugs legal settlements. Therefore, we have not included the potential impacts of changes in net debt that may be needed to fund amounts under these agreements.\nFor illustrative purposes only, in the absence of the proceeds from the spin, the adjusted earnings per share impact from financing legal settlements could be up to approximately a $0.20 per share headwind based on current market conditions. Also, please note that we will be treating the dilutive earnings impact of 3M's option to satisfy the $1 billion in payments related to the Combat Arms earplug settlement with 3M shares as an adjustment in arriving at results adjusted for special items. Finally, it is important to note that when considering 3M financials post-spin, it is not appropriate to simply remove the healthcare business financial results. There are other factors such as transition services agreements, stranded cost, and below-the-line items that need to be taken into account.\nWe are planning on holding an investor meeting later this year following the spin of Healthcare, where we will provide an update to our full year 2024 guidance along with our medium-term financial framework. With that, please turn to slide 4, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 3M delivered a strong Q4 as we continued to improve our operational performance, with adjusted EPS growth of 11%, operating margin expansion of 180 basis points, and robust cash flow. Monish will cover more details of the quarter, but first, I would like to comment on our full year performance. Throughout 2023, we delivered on our commitments with results that exceeded our original earnings and cash flow guidance. While organic sales declined 3%, reflecting softness in certain end markets, including consumer retail and electronics,\nour disciplined execution supported year-over-year adjusted margin expansion. Excluding restructuring, we delivered increased margins of 60 basis points, helping drive earnings of $9.24 per share, along with a 30% increase in free cash flow and a conversion rate of 123%. Our strong cash flow enabled us to continue investing in the business while reducing net debt by $2 billion, or 17%, and returning $3.3 billion to shareholders through our dividend. Please turn to slide 5. As you recall, in January of last year, we committed to take a deeper look at everything we do.\nOur success in 2023 reflects that commitment, along with our execution of three strategic priorities, which are unlocking value for customers and shareholders both today and into the future. Let me highlight key achievements in these areas, including how we will build on our progress in 2024, starting with driving performance through the 3M model. In 2023, we implemented the most significant restructuring in 3M history to streamline the organization, reduce costs at the center, and get us closer to our customers, which generated more than $400 million in savings during the year.\nThese efforts included aggressively cutting management layers, reducing corporate shared services, and modernizing our technology by removing hundreds of legacy systems. We reduced rooftops worldwide and took actions to help us address stranded costs as we progressed the healthcare spin. We simplified our supply chains and are doing more to leverage data and data analytics to visualize the flow of goods so we can serve customers more efficiently. We optimized our global go-to-market models for each of our business groups. In consumer, for example, we simplified our division structure,\nwith each of our global area teams now better aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and brands. At the same time, we have transitioned to an export-led model in approximately 30 smaller countries around the world, allowing us to reduce costs and complexity while still bringing 3M innovation to local customers. The simplification of our organization also frees up resources to prioritize exciting growth opportunities for 3M, such as automotive electrification, climate technology, and industrial automation. While we have more work to do in 2024, our actions are helping us improve our operational performance and create a more competitive 3M.\nOur next priority is the spin-off of Solventum, our healthcare business. Last year, we appointed experienced healthcare leaders to Solventum, including Brian Hanson as CEO, Carrie Cox as board chair, and Wayde McMillan as CFO. The spin is on track to be completed in the first half of this year, and we are confident in the value it will create for customers, care providers, patients, and shareholders. As we look to 2024, we will continue to optimize our portfolio as we prioritize geographies, markets, and products where we see the greatest opportunity. Finally, we are focused on addressing risk and uncertainty.\nThe Combat Arms settlement we announced last August has received strong support from both claimants and the broader military community. We completed the first three milestones of the settlement as planned, including earlier this month when we reached agreement with all plaintiffs who were being prepared for trial. We will continue to work with all parties in the courts to fully implement the settlement. With respect to PFAS, our settlement with public water suppliers is on track for the final approval hearing scheduled for 2 February. We will continue to address other PFAS litigation by defending ourselves in court or through negotiated resolutions as appropriate.\nWe also remain on schedule to exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, with production volumes down 20%. Looking back, in a year full of change, I am pleased how 3Mers around the world stepped up to lead. Importantly, we stayed relentlessly focused on doing what 3M does best, using material science to make a difference in the world. I see exciting examples of innovation across our company. Earlier this month, we unveiled the world's first solar-powered communications headset, building on our decades of leadership in both personal safety and sustainability. We are advancing more durable, energy-efficient, and connected vehicles with an array of solutions,\nincluding new thermal barrier materials that improve the range and safety of electric car batteries, just one element of our automotive electrification program, which grew 30% in 2023 on top of 30% growth in 2022. Our medical solutions business, a world leader in advanced wound care, just announced a partnership with the US Army, where we will collaborate with the military and leading universities to develop traumatic wound solutions. And in consumer, last year, we launched more than a dozen new products, including new solutions for heavyweight hanging, part of our $0.5 billion Command franchise, which leverages our world-class adhesives technology.\n3M's innovation engine is strong. It will remain the heart of our business and our ability to deliver differentiated value for our customers. In summary, the 3M team delivered a successful 2023, and I am confident we will accelerate our progress in the coming year. I will come back to talk about our 2024 priorities and guidance after Monish takes you through the details of the Q4. Monish.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to slide 6. The Q4 culminated a year where we took significant steps to improve our operational execution, resulting in better financial performance. We aggressively controlled spending and initiated restructuring actions to simplify our supply chains, reduce structure, and streamline our go-to-market models to better serve customers. At the same time, we continued preparing for the successful spin of our healthcare business and worked to reduce risks and uncertainties related to legal matters.\nWhile there is more to do, our teams made tremendous progress in 2023 that we build upon in 2024 and beyond. Looking at Q4 performance, adjusted sales were $7.7 billion at the high end of our guidance. End markets continued to play out as anticipated. Notably, the auto OEM market remained strong in the Q4, and we saw signs of end market stabilization in consumer electronics. As expected, China, and consumer retail end markets continued to be soft. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 1.4% versus last year. The expected decline in demand for disposable respirator negatively impacted organic growth by 60 basis points of $50 million.\nExcluding this impact, Q4 adjusted organic sales were down 80 basis points. Adjusted operating margins were 20.9%, up 180 basis points year-on-year, or up 320 basis points, excluding the impact of restructuring charges. Adjusted earnings were $2.42, up 11% year-on-year. Versus our guidance, Q4 earnings were benefited by $0.06 due to a lower-than-expected tax rate, which was partially offset by the acceleration of restructuring actions, which impacted earnings by approximately $0.03. And finally, Q4 adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion, up 18% year-on-year.\nFor the full year, we delivered $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow versus an originally expected range of $4.2 to 5 billion at the start of the year. Please turn to slide 7 for a recap of the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. Benefits from manufacturing productivity, sourcing actions, restructuring, strong spending discipline, and selling prices more than offset headwinds from lower sales volumes, investments in the business, and last year's disposable respirator sales comparison. This net benefit drove a year-on-year expansion in Q4 operating margins of 400 basis points and earnings per share of $0.43 per share.\nPretax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $109 million, or a negative impact to margins of 140 basis points and $0.17 to earnings. Raw material, logistics, and energy cost inflation was a slight year-on-year headwind of 10 basis points to operating margins or minus $0.01 to adjusted earnings per share. Foreign currency translation was a negative 70 basis points impact to adjusted operating margins or negative $0.07 per share. This result was primarily due to the net impact of hedging and the devaluation of the Argentinian peso. As previously mentioned, our adjusted tax rate was lower than expected, coming in at 14.9%.\nThis compared to 16.6% in last year's Q4, resulting in a $0.05 benefit to earnings. And finally, other financial items and shares outstanding netted to a positive $0.01 per share year-on-year impact. Please turn to slide 8. Q4 adjusted free cash flow was $2 billion, up 18% year-on-year, with conversion of 145%, up 800 basis points versus last year's Q4. Our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory, continues to yield results. Inventory was down $550 million year-on-year and is now at 14.8% of sales, a 90 basis points improvement year-on-year.\nI am pleased with the progress to date and see significant opportunity to further improve performance in all aspects of working capital. Adjusted capital expenditures were $308 million, down 32% versus last year's abnormally high Q4. For the year, we invested over $1.4 billion versus an expected range of $1.3 to 1.5 billion. Finally, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends during the Q4. Turning to the balance sheet, net debt at the end of Q4 stood at $10 billion, a decline of $2 billion year-on-year, or 17%. 3M continues to be a reliable and robust cash generator. In addition, the upcoming spin of our healthcare business will further strengthen our balance sheet.\nAs Bruce mentioned, we anticipate receiving a one-time dividend from Solventum at an initial leverage of 3 to 3.5x EBITDA. We will also retain a 19.9% equity stake, which will provide additional liquidity. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders, and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now, please turn to slide 10 for a discussion on our business group performance. Starting with our safety and industrial business, which posted sales of $2.7 billion, down 3.9% organically.\nThe expected decline in demand for disposable respirators was a headwind of approximately $50 million, negatively impacting segment organic growth by 160 basis points. Organic growth was led by a double-digit increase in roofing granules, while industrial adhesives and tapes was flat, while all other businesses declined. Geographically, core industrial markets in the United States were relatively strong, while China remained weak. Our businesses were impacted by reduction in channel inventory towards the end of the quarter, particularly in the Greater China and EMEA regions, as channel partners manage cash and are cautious as we enter 2024.\nAdjusted operating income was $524 million, down 6% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.7%, down 70 basis points year-on-year. This decline was driven by lower sales volumes, which was partially offset by benefits from restructuring, pricing, and strong spending discipline. Moving to Transportation and Electronics, which posted sales of $1.8 billion, or up 2.7% organically. Our Auto OEM business continued to perform well and increased 13% versus a 9% increase in global car and light truck builds.\nThe electronics business was flat organically year-on-year as demand for consumer electronic devices began to stabilize while semiconductor remained soft. We continue to closely monitor these trends and are well-positioned to grow with our customers in these large and important end markets. Looking at the rest of Transportation and Electronics, advanced materials grew organically high single digits, commercial solutions grew low single digits, and transportation safety declined low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $370 million in adjusted operating income, up 28% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 20.9%,\nup 380 basis points versus Q4 last year. The team achieved this result through restructuring actions, pricing, and strong spending discipline. Turning to our Healthcare business, Q4 sales were $2 billion, or down 1% organically versus last year. Sales in our Medical Solutions business grew low single digits organically, while Separation and Purification, and Oral Care were both down low single digits. Health Information Systems organic sales decreased high single digits. Looking at the year, our businesses within Healthcare continued to see lingering COVID-related impacts.\nFull-year organic growth in Healthcare was approximately 1%, with both Medical Solutions and Oral Care posting positive low single-digit growth, while Health Information Systems and Separation and Purification were both down low single digits. Healthcare's Q4 operating income was $372 million, down 10% year-on-year. Operating margins were 18.3%, or down 1.9 percentage points, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 26%. Year-on-year, adjusted operating margins were impacted by lower sales volumes along with added costs associated with the pending spin. Lastly, the Consumer business posted Q4 sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year.\nHome improvement increased low single digits organically, while home health and auto declined low single digits and stationery and office declined high single digits. Geographically, organic growth was down slightly in the US, while EMEA was down mid-single digits, and Asia-Pacific declined low double digits. Consumers' Q4 operating income was $221 million, up 4% compared to last year, with operating margins of 18%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. The improvement in operating margins was driven by benefits from restructuring actions, portfolio optimization, strong spending discipline, and productivity actions.\nBefore I turn it back to Mike for him to discuss outlook for 2024, I wanted to take a moment to reflect on our 2023 total company performance. As the year progressed, we made strong improvements in adjusted operating margins. For reference, slide 23 in the appendix provides our quarterly adjusted operating margin recons for the year. As you can see, we delivered significant improvement in performance, particularly when setting aside the impact from restructuring charges. Please turn to slide 12, and I will now turn the call back over to Mike. Mike.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Monish. We are entering 2024 with strong momentum from our strategic priorities as we build on the actions taken in 2023. We will remain focused on improving operational performance as we progress our restructuring while driving even greater supply chain productivity and inventory reductions. These represent significant opportunities to deliver sustainable margin and cash flow expansion in 2024. We will also further accelerate efforts to optimize our portfolio, which has been an ongoing strategy for 3M. In addition to finalizing the healthcare spin, we will continue implementing our geographic prioritization strategy.\nWe will also step up our efforts to prioritize our product portfolios based on market potential, right to win, supply chain complexity, margins, and returns. For example, in our consumer business, we have identified approximately 5% of the portfolio where we have limited market growth and a poor right to win. While exiting these portfolios will impact consumers' growth rate in the near term, these actions will better focus our efforts on products that best utilize 3M invention and ultimately drive improved growth and margins in the long term. At the same time, 3M succeeds across market cycles because we remain close to customers and invest in innovation.\nWe will continue to invest in R&D and capital expenditures, enabling us to win in our core and also in new attractive markets where 3M can make a difference. Finally, we will stay focused on reducing risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation, including finalizing legal settlements. We will advance the ramp-down of PFAS manufacturing while continuing to make progress on our sustainability goals. In 2024, for example, we expect to complete the investments in state-of-the-art water filtration technology across our chemical manufacturing sites. Please turn to slide 13.\nBased on these focus areas, along with the macroeconomic outlook, we are laying out our guidance for 2024. We expect the execution of our priorities to support the strengthening of our competitive position, continued underlying margin improvement, and strong cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital. As we start 2024, the macro environment remains muted, similar to what we saw in the Q4. On an adjusted basis, we anticipate organic full-year growth of flat to +2%. Excluding the impact from geographic prioritization, and portfolio actions, we expect organic growth of 1% to 3%. With respect to EPS, we anticipate earnings of $9.35 to 9.75 per share.\nWe expect continued strong margin expansion along with another year of strong cash flow with an adjusted conversion rate of 95% to 105%. As Bruce noted, following the completion of the healthcare spin, we will host an investor meeting and provide strategic updates along with updated guidance for 3M. As always, underpinning our success will be the strengths of 3M, our industry-leading material science, advanced manufacturing, global capabilities, and iconic brands, along with some of the best and brightest people around the world. Before I turn it back to Monish, let me repeat a few important points.\nAs I look across 3M, 2023 was a pivotal year for our enterprise. We executed our plans and delivered on our commitment to exit the year stronger, leaner, and more focused. We improved our operational performance, advanced the spinoff of Solventum, and addressed risk and uncertainty. I am proud of everything we accomplished in 2023 and equally excited about the year ahead. We are in excellent position to build on our progress, continue to improve our operational performance, and deliver another successful year. I thank all 3Mers for their dedication and for everything they do for our company. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on our guidance. Monish.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nThanks, Mike. Please turn to slide 14. As Mike highlighted, we expect another year of strong execution on our priorities, including strengthening our competitive position, continued margin improvement, and robust cash flows as we aggressively manage working capital. Let's now look at our 2024 expected performance for our business segments, starting with safety and industrial, where we estimate organic sales growth to be flat to up low single digits. As we start the year, we continue to see demand in industrial end markets remaining mixed. Full-year 2024 industrial production forecast is currently expected to be at approximately 2% worldwide, with the US being flat.\nThis business is not only impacted by general industrial manufacturing, but also production activity in automotive and electronics end markets, which I will cover next with my comments on transportation and electronics. Adjusted organic sales growth for transportation and electronics is forecasted to be flat to up low single digits organically. This range excludes the impact of the exit of PFAS manufacturing. Consumer electronics end markets are expected to be up slightly year-on-year as the market works to turn the corner. The semiconductor market is forecasted to start the year soft, however, improve as we progress through the year.\nAutomotive unit volume production is forecast to be down slightly year-on-year. Despite this forecast, we continue to see significant opportunities in the automotive sector through our offerings in both electric vehicle and internal combustion engine vehicles. Healthcare's organic sales growth is anticipated to be flat to up low single digits year-on-year. Brian and his team are excited to lead this great business and will be providing more details on 2024 and beyond as we progress towards the spin. Turning to Consumer, organic sales are expected to be down low single digits as discretionary spending is expected to remain muted, especially in the US,\nalong with our ongoing portfolio optimization initiatives. As Mike mentioned, these actions are estimated to create a year-on-year organic growth headwind of approximately $100 million or 2 percentage points. As you create your models for 2024, I want to highlight some important items. We anticipate pre-tax restructuring charges in the range of $250 million to 350 million and incremental savings in the range of $150 million to 250 million. As I've previously mentioned, our savings are net of the necessary costs required to provide sustained benefits from our restructuring. For example, this includes structure necessary to enhance our go-to-market models, automate processes,\nand continued investment in cybersecurity. Additionally, the restructuring actions have helped to partially reduce stranded costs associated with the pending spin of Healthcare. Overall, our restructuring program remains on track to deliver pre-tax savings in the range of $700 million to 900 million with a similar level of charges upon completion. We anticipate our actions will be largely done by the end of 2024, with benefits carrying into 2025. Moving to pension expense, we estimate a non-operating pension headwind of approximately $100 million in 2024 or a $-0.15 per share.\nThis headwind is primarily due to the updating of assumptions, including mortality, along with the amortization of prior period losses. While we will have an earnings headwind in 2024, it is important to note that our global plans are well funded, ending 2023 at 94%. Net interest expense is anticipated to be a small year-on-year benefit of approximately $0.03 per share. Again, this excludes the pending impact of the healthcare spin and legal settlements that Bruce mentioned at the start of the call. Our adjusted tax rate is expected to be between 18.5% and 19.5% for 2024.\nThis compares to our adjusted tax rate of 17.5% in 2023, resulting in a year-on-year headwind of approximately $0.17 per share at the midpoint. Therefore, the net impact of these below-the-line items is forecasted to result in an earnings headwind of approximately $0.29 per share. This combined headwind is included in our full-year 2024 adjusted earnings range guidance of $9.35 to 9.75 that Mike mentioned. Please turn to slide 15. Before we go to Q&A, let me briefly cover our thoughts on the Q1. As we look at the Q1, we see our adjusted sales being approximately $7.6 billion or down slightly versus last year.\nThis forecast factors in an expectation for similar macroeconomic trends that we saw in Q4. It also includes an approximate $100 million year-on-year sales headwind from geographic prioritization and consumer portfolio initiatives, along with the impact of last year's disposable respirator comp. Turning to earnings, we expect Q1 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to 2.15 per share. This expectation reflects adjusted operating margins in the range of 19.5% to 20%. This range includes continued stand-up costs related to the pending spin of healthcare, along with over 100 basis points impact from restructuring and related charges.\nExcluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins are forecasted to increase by over 250 basis points year-on-year. In the Q1, non-op pension will be a $0.04 per share headwind to adjusted earnings. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate in the Q1 to be in the range of 20% to 21%. In closing, I would like to emphasize a few things. We remain focused on our priorities, and the team continues to drive results through strong operational execution. Our decisive actions in 2023 set the foundation for a strong 2024. As you know, there are many important milestones in the coming months, including completing the spin of healthcare.\nFinally, as a reminder, if you are creating financial models for 3M post-spin, please keep in mind that simply removing the healthcare business from total 3M financials will not equal 3M post-spin. There are other factors such as transition service agreements, stranded costs, and below-the-line changes that need to be taken into account. As mentioned, once the spin is complete, we will hold an investor meeting and provide an update on our outlook for 2024 that incorporates these factors. In summary, we are building on our momentum and driving sustainable operating improvements that will drive improved financial performance.\nI want to thank the 3M team for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you would like to register a question using a landline phone, please press the 1 followed by the 4 on your telephone keypad. You will hear a three-tone prompt to acknowledge your request. If your question has been answered and you would like to withdraw your registration, please press the 1 followed by the 3. If you're using a speakerphone, please lift your hands up before entering your request. Please limit your participation to one question and one follow-up. One moment, please, while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. You may proceed with your question.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nGood morning, everyone. Morning.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning, Andy. Mike\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nRoman, Monish, could you give us a little more color into the consumer and industrial channels that you deal with? I know you said you're seeing signs of consumer electronics improvement, but also mentioned the destock in China, for instance, at the end of Q4. Maybe you could elaborate on what you're seeing across the consumer industrial channels. Then you are modeling Q1 sales, I think, to be sequentially flat, excluding the $100 million of sales headwind you called out, which seems conservative if your early cycle business starts turning. So what are you seeing?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, Andy, I'd start with Q1 looks to us a lot like Q4. So some of the dynamics that you're asking about are part of that. We talked about electronics stabilizing in Q4. So starting year-over-year comparison and stabilizing against that. As we look forward, consumer retail is similar as well. We saw still softness in discretionary product categories, the discretionary purchases.\nConsumer spending has been strong, but it's been shifting all through the year, as you know, to experiences, services, and even food as inflation has impacted that. So we see that dynamic continuing to play out as we go forward. If you look at the channels, I'd say broadly the channels are stabilizing. Consumer, as we went through the first part of last year, there was aggressive reduction in inventory in the channel. That played out, and it's more balanced as we come through the Q4 as we look into Q1. There was some caution at the end of 2023. At the end of the Q4, we saw some caution in the channel in China and Consumer, but I think they're fairly well balanced at this point.\nThe one area where we continue to note some adjustments is in the industrial channels, and that's as supply chains continue to perform better, they're reducing their safety stock, and that's been a steady. I think there's a little bit of caution as we go into the new year in areas like Europe, Middle East, and Africa. There's a caution about demand. China, as I already said. But I think generally broader, I would characterize it as more stable and in line with what the expectations are.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nI just would add, Andy, to Mike's comments that auto bills are expected to be down 10% sequentially. And then historically, if you just look at a couple of our businesses, just consumer and healthcare, they seasonally do come down Q4 to Q1. So we baked all that into the guide that we've given of approximately $7.6 billion.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nThat's helpful, guys. Then, Monish, could you give us a little more color in terms of what's happening with your restructuring program? You pretty much were matching benefits to cost in 2023, and as you said, you even pulled forward a few pennies of restructuring versus your expectations in Q4. But for 2024, I think you're modeling now a $100 million difference in terms of higher restructuring costs versus benefits. So maybe you give us more color into why you can't get that sort of one-to-one faster return on your 2024 actions.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nNo, I think, Andy, let me explain that first. I'll just go all the way to the top again on our benefits and then explain the math to you. So for everyone's benefit, in 2023, we implemented the most significant restructuring in our history. It generated $400 million in savings last year and approximately the same amount in costs. But when you look at the overall program, it remains on track to achieve the annual run rates of $700 million to 900 million upon completion. Assuming a no-spin scenario of healthcare, as Bruce mentioned earlier, we expect nearly 200 to 300 basis points of margin improvement to be realized upon completion of the whole program.\nThe program, as you said, Andy, remains on track. We said that remains on track, and we did pull in or accelerated some of our restructuring into 2023 based on the success that we have had in the program. What I would tell you to answer your question specifically is what I've said is the $150 million to 250 million is incremental benefits. So on a cumulative basis, if you did $400 million in 2023 and you say midpoint of $150 million to 200 million, that's cumulative $600 million. So on a year-over-year, that's incremental $200 million.\nWhile on a cost basis, we said we incurred $400 and change in the Q4. I think it's $441 million. I said we'll have $250 million to 350 million of cost. So on a cumulative basis, the cost will be around $750 million again at the midpoint. As I've also said in my prepared remarks, we believe this program will be largely completed by the end of 2024 from an expense perspective, and the benefits will continue into 2025 and beyond. I just want to make sure one other thing when we think about restructuring. I just want us to also think through this is, and want you all to know, this is how we work. This is not a series of one-time actions.\nI know a lot of investors have asked us, \"Show us the break between benefits and costs.\" So we are definitely trying to do that the best we can. In 2023, it made all the sense because these were new actions. It was good to show it as individual. But as it becomes the way we work, my request to all of you is focus on the total margin of the company, which is demonstrated in 2024, where our guide is saying we'll improve margins another 75 to 100 basis points in total. So for example, and the reason I bring this up is you have to look at all of this in totality. For example, we announced that we were going to change our distribution model in 27 countries.\nThe savings of the rooftops, the headcount is shown as a benefit in our restructuring program, but as you all know, there's a corresponding impact on the revenue. The action has to be looked at in totality versus standalone events. I just want to make sure we bring that out too. But we'll continue showing what it helps you all, and that's what we have tried to do with this go-around. So hopefully I cleared that question, Andy, that you had.\n\nAndrew Kaplowitz\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nYeah, no, I appreciate the color, Monish. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. You may proceed with your question.\n\nScott Davis\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research LLC\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Mike, Monish.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research LLC\n\nGuys, can you help us understand the ebb and flow when you go to an export model for 30 countries and maybe help us understand the materiality of that? It could be 30 really small countries. It could be a mix. I don't know. But you think about kind of the revenue headwind versus the cost tailwind. Is there some numbers we can talk around or perhaps even some color on how that ebbs and flows?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So Scott, the total impact of geographic prioritization and portfolio actions that Mike mentioned is around 100 basis points for the company. Of that, 60% is product portfolio optimization. The balance is geographic prioritization. And overall, when you look at the margin rate in these smaller countries, they were at lower margins than the average for 3M. So that's when you refocus. What happens is since you're going through a distributor, you basically have to drop price to some extent because now they're picking up your cost. And so that's why you see the revenue headwind.\nBut on a margin rate perspective, this is beneficial for us to do. It helps us focus on the bigger countries. It also allows us to reinvest in those bigger countries while at the same time making sure that in the smaller countries where we are changing the model, we can continue to serve those customers well with what we would call internally as an export-led model, which is we are going to ship our product out from the United States or wherever our end manufacturing is into those countries. So we're still taking care of the customers. We're just following a more efficient way to transact with those customers. So hopefully that answers Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research LLC\n\nOkay. I think it does. And just separately, working capital has been a real source of benefit for you folks, particularly in 2023. But as an entity, are you learning to run at lower working capital levels? And more specifically, really, what I'm talking about is inventory. And I think historically, just having covered you guys for a while, inventory levels kind of went up and down based on demand. You're not expecting much demand in 2024. So explicitly, I suppose that means you can run at lower inventory levels. But if demand were to start to snap back at better levels than you're expecting, would you still be able to run at relatively low inventory levels if there had been enough structural change, I guess, is what I'm asking to 3M, where you can run more productively and efficiently from a working capital perspective?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nI would say so, Scott. The team has done, Peter and the supply chain team have done a great job. One is learning through the pandemic on how do you manage the ebbs and flows as you go through supply chain disruptions. Two is we have spent a lot of time and energy investing in digital resources that allow us to more efficiently look at demand plans, look at where our inventory is, and we have continued to keep working on dual sourcing, etc., that helps us get alternate sources of supply whenever you could have a disruption in one place. My view is this inventory still has ways to run using data and data analytics. We can keep producing inventory. Working capital is going to continue to be a source of 3M's cash generation machine, along with the good EBITDA that we generate.\nAt the same time, I would tell you, if you see volume come back up, the factories are ready and we have the capacity, and we'll act accordingly. So I would say the team's done a really nice job, but there's always more we can do and we'll keep doing.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nHey, Scott, just to add, the actions that we have been talking about all through 2023, the actions to streamline our supply chain operations, simplify our go-to-market model, that streamlining supply chain operations, it was more than a restructuring. This was about aligning our global supply chains to our go-to-market models, really optimizing what we do across plan, source, make, deliver, and with a focus on and an expectation that we're going to drive improvements, improvements in service, improvements in costs, improvements in working capital, and cash.\nSo Monish said earlier, it's the actions we've taken about the way we operate, and it's an expectation we're going to continue to improve our execution. So there's a plan and strategy and data and data analytics gives us a basis for driving a better visibility and improvement as well. So it is part of that. So we do expect to continue to drive improvement as our guide for 2024 has us, again, driving improvements in how we execute, showing up in growth in earnings and expanded margins and another year of strong cash generation. So it is an important part of those actions that we took as we went through 2023.\n\nScott Davis\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Melius Research LLC\n\nFair enough. Best of luck this year, guys. Thank you.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYep, thanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Julian.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Julian.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning. Maybe first off, I just wanted to clarify some of Monish's comments on operating margins year on year. So I think Monish, you were saying that Q1, the margin is up 250 basis points excluding restructuring, and then the full year is up 75 to 100 basis points including restructuring. I just want to make sure if those numbers were right. Okay. You're right. And any color on sort of segments within that or the corporate costs? There was some reallocation you talk about on slide seven. Any kind of major moving parts that you'd call out year on year on a segment basis or what that new sort of corporate run rate is?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, I would say, Julian, as with prior years, there are a number of miscellaneous items in corporate and unallocated that are always subject to a fluctuation on a quarterly annual basis. So if you look at 2023, our incurred cost was $44 million, and in the Q4, it was a $120 million benefit. The Q4 benefit was largely the result of annual incentive compensation accrual for the first nine months that were allocated to the businesses finally based on performance.\nThis adjustment had no impact on total company margins. So it's just a bucket swap between corporate unallocated and the businesses. And so for the full year of 2024, again, based on healthcare being a part of 3M for the whole year, so it's just the assumption, we expect the expense range of being somewhere in the $100 million to 200 million on an adjusted basis for corporate unallocated.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. Thank you very much. And then just my second question, just trying to understand the free cash flow guidance, because I think you did $6.3 billion of free cash in 2023, and this year is guided at about $5.3 billion. So it's a big decline year on year, even with net income, I think, growing $200 million in the guide, and CapEx is up about $100 million in the guide. Anything to sort of call out on that?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nI would just say, Julian, 3M has historically always been a good cash generator, and that's what we plan to continue doing. If you look at 2022, we had 86% of free cash flow conversion, which we were not happy with at all. The teams have done a great job in 2023 to get us back. If you take the two years, it's around 100%. If you look at the history of 3M, we have always been in that range, and I would say we'll continue doing that. At the same time, we'll keep investing in growth, productivity, and sustainability as and when the volume comes up, as and when the opportunities arise, because at the end of the day, our first priority is organic growth because that gives us the best return, and the best way to do that is organic investment. That's our first priority.\n\nJulian Mitchell\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. You may proceed with your question. Thanks.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nGood morning. Can you hear me?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nHi, Nigel. Yes, we can.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning, Nigel.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nHi, good morning. Great [to see Casper,] by the way. So just want to dig into the corporate line again, Monish.I think you said $100 million to 200 million kind of a run rate for 2024. That's EBIT, not EBITDA. I just want to make sure that's the case. And are you affecting any corporate synergies or standalone costs for healthcare within that $100 to 200?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nIt's EBIT. It's EBIT, Nigel. Can you hear me?\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nYes, I can, yes.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYes. I'm sorry, what was your follow-up question? I didn't catch the.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nYeah, no, no. The second part of that question was, are you affecting any standalone costs or standalone costs or corporate synergies from the healthcare spend within that number? Would that be additive to that range?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nNo, that number, again, if you just go back to Bruce's comment at the beginning of the call, our current assumption is that healthcare is a part of 3M, even though the spin is on track for first half 2024. As we go through the spin of healthcare, we plan to have an investor day post-spin where we'll update you on the stranded costs, the impact of transition services agreements, as well as what 3M looks post-spin.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, Nigel, just to highlight, Monish, during his prepared remarks, did mention that there is additional cost in healthcare for standing it up as a standalone entity. So that is having some margin impact within healthcare.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC",
    "content2": "Oh, no question. No, just wanted to make sure that was the case. And then my follow-up question is just really trying to dig into the restructuring cadence. You obviously quantified the Q1 impact, but if I take the $152 million of cost savings in Q4, Monish, and then multiply that by 4, you get to mathematically about $650 million of cost savings. And the midpoint of your guide for 2024 is $617 million. So, I'm just actually wondering; it doesn't look like we're getting any incremental costs coming through from here on in 2024. So just wondering, what is the offset to that? Is there some level of investment here? Just wondering what's going on here.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, so I would say it's the same thing I've said before. If you remember, we have said our total benefits are $700 million to 900 million once the program is done with equal costs. We are saying our actions will be largely done at the end of 2024, so you will see benefits continuing into 2025. As I've previously mentioned, our savings are net of the necessary investments required to provide sustained benefits from our restructuring programs. So for example, these investments include structure necessary to enhance our go-to-market models. As we talked about, we have exited or changed the distribution model for 27 to 30 countries.\nSo, making sure we have a structure that supports that change, continuing to automate our backend processes as we continue with the spin of Healthcare, upgrade rooftops as we consolidate space because you see the savings as we have exited the space, but I got to make sure that the rooftops are upgraded so people can come into work there, and then continued investment in cybersecurity. We have also said this before, that the restructuring actions that we have taken, one, it's a way of how we work, but two, it'll help us partially reduce the Stranded Costs associated with the pending spin of Healthcare.\nSo all put together, I still see the programs on track at $700 million to 900 million. But as I mentioned before, too, I would just ask you all to think through. There's a side of cost cadence, which once we are done with those actions, those cost cadence will go away, and the benefits will continue into 2025 and beyond at an annualized basis of $700 million to 900 million, assuming healthcare remains as a part of 3M.\n\nNigel Coe\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC\n\nGreat. Okay, thanks a lot. That's great.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed with your question.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. I also wanted to ask on 2024 margins. If we look through the restructuring, it seems like the guide is implying flat margins year on year for the business. And I guess, why isn't there expected margin expansion? Because the company is expecting to grow volumes or at least grow organically in the year. And it sounds like some of the exits the company is making should be accretive for margins of the underlying business. Just what are some of the headwinds there? Thank you.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nSo I would say exactly the same thing I said before. When you look at it in total, our plan for 2024 assumes a margin expansion of 75 to 100 basis points, which includes a piece, which includes the restructuring benefits and the lower restructuring costs. But at the same time, it also includes many other factors that we take into. For example, we're going to continue to invest in growth, productivity, and sustainability as the macro starts improving. We're going to continue to invest in product areas. We're going to continue to invest in our people.\nSo, I would again ask you all to look at, in total, if you exclude restructuring costs in 2023, we expanded margin 60 basis points. And in 2024, our total margin expansion, including the benefits of restructuring, is 75 to 100 basis points. So, Chris, I would say, as the year progresses, and I've said this before, volume gives us the best leverage. So, as we get more volume, we're going to continue to see leverage increase.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nI appreciate that. And then, just to follow up on the margins, I know you guys said 150 to 250 year on year net restructuring for the full year, but could you tell us what is implied in the Q1 guidance? And then also, I believe you said that the Q1 margin includes some level of stranded costs for healthcare. Could you just tell us what those are expected to come in at? Thank you.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So the benefits, I would say, again, it depends on which way you're looking at it. Chris, I would tell you on a year-over-year basis, as I said, there's approximately 75 to 100 basis points. Sorry, $75 million to 100 million of restructuring cost on a year-over-year basis. So if you exclude that, margin rates are 19.5% to 20% for Q1. No, sorry. It's 19.5% to 20% is the guide, which includes $75 million to 100 million of costs. So if you adjust for that cost on a year-over-year basis, margin rates will be up 250 to 300 basis points.\nAnd then on standup cost, again, timing will determine what the final standup cost is, but currently, we see approximately $0.07 to 0.08 of total cost that we are incurring as Brian and the team get ready for spin-off of healthcare.\n\nChris Snyder\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\n\nJoseph Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, and Head of U.S. Multi-Industrials Coverage, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning, everyone.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Joe.\n\nJoseph Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, and Head of U.S. Multi-Industrials Coverage, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, just so obviously, the volume environment remains fairly muted, but I'm curious, how are you guys thinking about pricing for 2024, and particularly what's embedded in the guide from a price-cost standpoint?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nSo 2024 outlook assumes we will have selling prices year on year. It's helping us offset some of the moderate inflation we are seeing in certain raw materials. And then the labor market continues to remain strong. But I would just tell you, you have seen we've become good at monitoring this. We'll make sure we continue to take actions as needed. And you've seen it, we've done that in 2022, we've done that in 2023. But I would say more importantly, when you think about margin rate and the supply chain teams and the business teams, we are not just taking price raw as one item.\nIn total, we are just saying, how do we improve margins? So a lot of actions have been taken on, whether it's through selling price increases, driving global sourcing benefits, dual sourcing, driving yield in the factories, and then, of course, prioritizing demand. And all of that put together, including the new way we work with all the restructuring-related items we have announced last year, just help us continue to drive margin between 2024, 2025, and beyond.\n\nJoseph Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, and Head of U.S. Multi-Industrials Coverage, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. That's clear, Monish. I guess there's been a lot of discussion on the restructuring expenses and the benefits coming through in the next couple of years. I guess just for 2025, as we're thinking about the low end versus the high end of the benefits range, maybe how would you kind of handicap what are the key drivers that potentially put you guys at the low end of the $700 versus the high end of the 900 million dollar benefit range?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nSo I would first say, number one, again, I keep reiterating this just because there's an assumption that's out there that we have assumed that healthcare remains as a part of 3M. That's just the guide. But healthcare is on track for a H1 2024 spin. Keeping that in mind, when you think about $700 million to 900 million, it's driven by two pieces. One is the pace at which we can execute some of these actions, as well as some of the rooftop consolidations that we are working on. In total, I still feel good that the range of $700 million to 900 million is good for the overall program.\nBut as you have seen, Joe, quarter to quarter, there's always going to be a little movement because there are multiple actions that we're working through regulations and countries, and we're working through making sure we are doing it in a safe manner that you could have a month or two delay. But overall, I still feel good. $700 million to 900 million is a good range.\n\nJoseph Ritchie\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, and Head of U.S. Multi-Industrials Coverage, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Stephen Tusa with J.P. Morgan. You may proceed with your question.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\n\nHi, good morning. How are you?\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nHi, Steve.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Steve. Good.\nI'm still not 100% clear what the sequential decline is in EPS from Q4 to Q1. Can you maybe just help bridge that a little more specifically? I know there's tax impact there, maybe a little bit of sequential sales decline. I'm just having a little bit of a hard time reconciling the walk. I mean, I think you had a $0.07 charge in Forex from Argentine devaluation. Maybe that's a factor. I don't know. Just maybe a little more color on the sequential EPS bridge from Q4 to Q1.\nSure. And Steve, as I said, as you start lapping quarters and the benefits of restructuring start showing up in the results, it's going to get harder and harder to do sequentials. But anyway, I'll do my best, and hopefully that answers your question. So I would start by first saying you're going to see another strong quarter of execution on a year-over-year basis. I would ask you to look at that first. When you look at our guide for January, we are saying it's approximately $7.6 billion. There are no surprises in January so far. It's very similar to Q4 trends. So volume is a little lower, Q4 to Q1.\nThat has an impact. Secondly, there is usual seasonality that we see in our business when it comes to resetting some of our pay plans and some of the other compensation things that we do. So seasonally, you see that as an impact. Third is, as I mentioned earlier, we are incurring incremental costs to stand up the healthcare business as we get ready for the spin. The total impact is approximately $0.07 to 0.08.\nIt's the total cost in the quarter. We have headwind from our pension accounting that we talked about, which is $0.04 of headwind. Then from a tax rate basis, we expect our Q1 tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 21% versus we ended the Q4 at 14.9%. So I hope that kind of gives you all the puts and takes to get you to the range that we have of $2 to 2.15.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\n\nYeah, that makes sense. Then just one last thing on restructuring. I mean, I usually think of restructuring as building. Once you do a certain number in a quarter, you kind of carry it over annually. You guys are run rating at a pretty high level of benefits in the third and the Q4 that ramped pretty hard sequentially from the first half. Is there any seasonality to these cost saves? Or I'm just curious as to why they're not maybe carrying over a little more into the first half of 2024, like of a compounding of those benefits, if you will. I can understand the expense numbers are very clear, but it seems like you're kind of underpunching the benefits based on that carryover in 2024, especially in the first half.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nI'm not sure one would agree with that, but when you look at Q1 of 2023 versus Q1 of 2024, there was no restructuring benefits pretty much in Q1 of 2023, and we had a little bit of cost in 2023. So if you look at Q1 versus Q1, you actually see margin rates up 250 basis points-ish, excluding the impact of restructuring costs. So you are seeing the benefits, Steve, on a year-over-year basis in Q1. For the year, as we have previously mentioned, our savings that we are showing you in the 700, 900, which it always has been, are net of the necessary investments that we are required to provide, which we are going to spend to provide sustained benefits.\nSo again, just to repeat, things like we changed our method of delivery in certain geographies, 30 countries. You need a structure that has to get put into place to serve that. You got rooftops. So we have exited the rooftops. You're starting to see the savings, but we have to spend the money to upgrade the rooftops that we are left because we have to consolidate that space so that people can come and work in that space. And then we'll continue to invest in things like customer operations and automate customer operations, which was a part of the whole. There was a reason why we did this.\nMike said it. I've said it. It's the way we work. And some of these savings you're seeing come ahead as you have made those actions. And now we're going to put in the necessary costs so that we can continue to see those savings. And that's why I keep saying at the end of 2024, we'll be largely done with these actions. The benefits will carry on into 2025 and beyond at $700 million to 900 million.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, just so it's clear, Steve, the investments that Monish is highlighting is included.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nIn the 700 million.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nIn the 700 million and 900 million.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\n\nYeah. Okay. That all makes sense. So it's kind of a bit of a timing thing.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nCorrect.\n\nStephen Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\n\nOkay. Thanks a lot.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may proceed with your question.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nMorning, Jeff.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nGood morning.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nHey, I just wanted to come back just to thinking about kind of the separation and just some of the math. Monish, you've taken some pains here to kind of remind us that it's not as simple as just splitting this in two. So just a couple of questions. I think you had previously said that just kind of standalone corporate costs for the healthcare business was about $100 million. I wonder if that's moving around at all, if you could provide any additional color on that. And is there some color you could provide on what you're expecting on the TSAs?\nI think that's going to have to be an input to what the EBITDA is for healthcare at the time of the spin and the associated dividend that comes off that. So I know when we get to 4 and 10s, you get a little bit closer, you're going to be more precise on this, but it does seem like you're directionally warning us to be prepared for some friction here. So I wonder if you can give us a little bit more color.\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, Jeff, as I said, I think the timing of the spin will definitely determine some of these costs. I would just say, let us work through it. As we get closer to it, Brian and the team will walk you through as they get closer to getting ready for the spin. As committed, we are going to have an investor day post-spin where we'll walk you through all the factors that you have to take into account, which is not only post-3M, what does that revenue and margin look like, but also the impact of transition services agreements because there will be transition services agreements for a period of time and then the amount of stranded costs.\nThe good news, Jeff, is that through all the restructuring actions that we have done, to some extent, we have been able to reduce the amount of standard cost that would have been there if we hadn't taken these actions to reduce some of the cost at the center.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nThen unrelated, just on slide three, have you definitively decided to use the $1 billion equity option to fund part of Combat Arms?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nHave we decided? I'm sorry.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nHave you decided to go ahead and use the equity option of $1 billion for the Combat Arms settlement?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nNo, we have not, Jeff. That's an option we hold, and we will make the appropriate decision once we see the progress in the number of opt-ins for the Combat Arms litigation.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, Jeff, the purpose of our statement is so you guys can think about your outstanding share count, that if we do exercise that option to pay in equity, that that will be treated as an excluded item in arriving at adjusted results. So that was only just to highlight. Don't worry about the impact. It is at our option. That is yet to be determined. But you don't have to take that into account relative to your share count on an adjusted basis.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nBut it sounds like you then would be planning to use an adjusted share count if you go down this path, right? So we're kind of compounding adjustments on top of adjustments, it sounds like.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nThere would be a difference in GAAP shares outstanding versus adjusted shares outstanding if we decide to exercise this option to issue equity.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research Partners LLC\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you. Yep. Yeah.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nWe'll make it clear in our financial reporting if that were to occur.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. Just had a couple of questions on some of the outliers in the Q4 results. Hopefully, I didn't miss this. For transportation electronics, significant upside on the top line. I saw that you have an adjusted flat organic revenue growth. So what were those adjustments that were to the good? Then on the corporate line, it swung to a significant benefit. Just give us a sense of what those adjustments were that would have caused that. Maybe you answered that question with Julian, but just wanted to get those clarified, please.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, Deane, I think what you're looking at is the adjustment for PFAS, the exit of PFAS. If you recall, we're excluding the PFAS-related manufacturing and related business as we report. And that was part the primary business for that was transportation electronics. So that's where you saw that, maybe that adjustment.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThat's helpful. And how about the corporate line?\n\nMonish Patolawala\n\nPresident and CFO, 3M Company\n\nYeah. So as with previous years, Deane, there are a number of miscellaneous items in corporate and unallocated that are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. So if you answer specifically your question, if you look at for the year, corporate and unallocated was $44 million. And in the Q4, it was a benefit of $121 million.\nThe Q4 benefit was largely the result of annual incentive compensation accrual for the first nine months that has now been allocated back to the business segments based on final performance. This adjustment had no impact to total company margins because it's a move from corporate and unallocated to the business segments. For the full year 2024, we expect the expense range to be in the range of $100 million to 200 million on an adjusted basis.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nGreat. I appreciate that. Just one last follow-up from me, Mike. You talked about the goals for 2024 related to PFAS to advance the ramp down. From what you see today, would there be any circumstances where 3M would continue to produce PFAS after 2025, or is this just a non-negotiable? Will you dismantle the equipment, or can it be repurposed? Thanks.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nYeah, Dean, we're committed to what we announced, to exit PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. And as I said, we're making good progress to that. We're working to help customers transition. I think we talked about this at one of our earnings calls. We will not sell the equipment. We won't transfer any of the assets. We won't sell the business. We won't license our intellectual property. So we are going to exit and complete by the end of 2025. Everybody's focused on that goal.\n\nDeane Dray\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes the question and answer portion of our conference call. I will now turn the call back over to Mike Roman for some closing comments.\n\nMike Roman\n\nChairman and CEO, 3M Company\n\nTo wrap up, we are executing our priorities and delivering on our commitments. We will stay focused on continuing to improve our performance, optimize our portfolio, and reduce risk while using 3M science to create unique solutions for our customers. Thank you for joining us.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."

Welcome to the 3M Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, October 24, 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Monish Patolawala, our President and Chief Financial Officer. Mike and Monish will make some formal comments, and then we'll take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2. Please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement. During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results. These statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-Q lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.\nPlease note throughout today's presentation, we'll be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures can be found in the attachments to today's press release. With that, please turn to Slide 3, and I'll now hand the call off to Mike. Mike?\n\nMichael F. Roman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the third quarter, we built momentum through strong operational execution as we again delivered for our customers positioning us for a solid close to 2023. On an adjusted basis, we delivered earnings ahead of our expectations, expanded margins sequentially across all 4 businesses and achieved our third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-on-year growth and free cash flow.\nAs we make progress and deliver improved financial results, we are increasing our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.95 to $9.15, up from a previous range of $8.60 to $9.10. And our adjusted free cash flow conversion range to 100% to 110%, up from 90% to 100% previously. We continue to deliver against our priorities. We are driving performance throughout 3M with strong operational execution, restructuring actions and spending discipline.\nWe are progressing the spin of the health care business, which we expect to be completed during the first half of 2024. And we are reducing risk and uncertainty by reaching significant settlements to address Combat Arms and PFAS litigation. I will now provide some additional context around how we are advancing these priorities.\nNext slide, please. Our margin expansion clearly demonstrates the performance our team is driving throughout 3M. We delivered 240 basis points of year-over-year adjusted operating income margin expansion excluding 80 basis points of restructuring-related charges. We are strengthening our business in several important ways. We are progressing with our restructuring actions to streamline our organization, reduce structural costs and get us closer to customers. We have leaned out the center of our company, simplified our global supply chain organization and optimized our global go-to-market models.\nAt the same time, we are advancing supply chain performance to improve service, drive productivity and yield, expand gross margins and increase cash conversion. These results are being supported by initiatives that use our continuous improvement toolkit and leverage data and data analytics. For example, we have benefited from more than 60 Kaizen events this year to improve existing processes in our largest plants. We are also progressing the spin of our health care business, building the leadership team as we work toward completing the spin in the first half of 2024.\nDuring the quarter, we added 2 experienced leaders, naming Bryan Hanson as the CEO of the stand-alone health care business and Carrie Cox as the Board Chair. Finally, we continue to manage risk and uncertainty by proactively and effectively managing litigation. We announced the Combat Arm Settlement and we are working with all parties and the courts to implement it. The settlement administration process has been established and funded. The bellwether trial verdicts have been settled, and the process for notifying and settling with claimants has begun.\nWith respect to PFAS, the public water supplier settlement we announced last quarter has received preliminary court approval. We successfully resolved objections from state attorneys general and are working toward approval with the final hearing set for early February next year. In closing, I want to share a few thoughts about our future. Our momentum accelerates our ability to define where we go next at 3M as we prioritize attractive markets where we have the right to win and the opportunity to differentiate ourselves through our unique capabilities and strengths.\nA good example is our automotive OEM business where we continue to outperform the market with double-digit growth this quarter. Auto electrification is on track to be a $600 million business this year and has delivered organic growth of 30% year-to-date. Our material science expertise has led us to build a new business and we see similar opportunities in other core platforms such as safety, home improvement and consumer electronics.\nWe are also prioritizing emerging global trends that have attractive growth rates and customer needs that match up well with 3M capabilities. We are building new platforms in areas like climate technology, industrial automation and next-generation electronics. Before I hand it over to Monish for additional insight into our performance, a few closing thoughts. I am pleased with the way our teams are executing. They delivered third quarter results that build on the momentum we saw in the second quarter, setting us up for a solid close to 2023. We are advancing our priorities, driving performance, progressing our health care spend and reducing risk and uncertainty. 3M is delivering today lower cost, better margins and greater cash generation and building for tomorrow prioritizing growth platforms, innovating with impact and empowering our teams. I will now turn it over to Monish for more details on the third quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Monish.\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As Mike mentioned, we are seeing significant traction from the actions we are taking to strengthen the business. Through our focus on customers, effective adjustment of production, benefits from efficiency and productivity initiatives, ongoing proactive spending discipline and the relentless focus on managing inventory, we were able to deliver solid adjusted third quarter results, including sales of $8 billion at the high end of our guidance range of $7.9 billion to $8 billion. Operating margins of 23.2%, an increase of 160 basis points year-on-year and 390 basis points sequentially. Earnings per share of $2.68, a year-on-year increase of 3% and free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with conversion of 130%. Organic sales on an adjusted basis declined 3.1% versus last year. This included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million, 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and last year's exit of our operations in Russia. .\nExcluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.4%. Consumer and electronics end markets continue to be soft. Our adjusted organic sales declined year-on-year mid-single digits in our electronics business and high single digits in consumer. This softness was partially offset by strength in our automotive OEM business. Regionally, the U.S. was up slightly despite continued challenges in retail. Europe remains soft, and China was down mid-teens year-on-year organically due to continued end market softness along with lapping strong sales backlog recovery in the prior year.\nOur strong adjusted EPS of $2.68, exceeded our expectations of $2.25 to $2.40. Roughly 2/3 of the beat was driven by operational execution in our supply chain and proactive spending discipline, and the balance driven by restructuring timing. The restructuring actions we announced earlier this year are largely on track, and we are seeing favorable margin impact in our results. We continue to expect full year pretax restructuring benefits of $400 million to $450 million with offsetting charges.\nTurning to Slide 6 for the components that drove our year-on-year operating margin and earnings performance. Manufacturing productivity and restructuring actions, strong spending discipline and selling prices, partially offset by lower sales volumes, investments in the business and the previously mentioned headwinds from disposable respirator and last year's exit of Russia resulted an improvement to operating margins of 260 basis points and to earnings of $0.22 per share.\nPretax restructuring and related charges in the quarter were $68 million or a negative impact to margins of 80 basis points and $0.10 to earnings. This charge was lower than our anticipated range of $125 million to $175 million in Q3 due to factors that impacted the timing of actions that are being pushed into Q4. The carryover impact of higher raw material logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $25 million or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.03 to earnings.\nForeign currency translation was a positive 0.6% impact to total adjusted sales. This resulted in a $0.01 tailwind to earnings per share. Last year's food safety divestiture and the reconsolidation of Aearo Technologies resulted in a net year-on-year tailwind of 10 basis points to margins and no impact to earnings. Finally, other financial items decreased earnings by a net $0.02 per share year-on-year.\nIn summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions and controlling spending continues to yield results. These actions drove meaningful year-on-year and sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Please turn to Slide 7. Third quarter adjusted free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 39% year-on-year with a conversion of 130%, up 360 basis points versus last year's Q3. This year-on-year improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory.\nInventory was down over $200 million sequentially and $550 million year-on-year as we benefit from the power of daily management and data and data analytics to speed up inventory terms. As always, there is more we can do and will do to continue to realize benefits from our actions as we move forward. Adjusted capital expenditures were $367 million in the quarter, as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividends. Net debt at the end of Q3 stood at $10.8 billion, a reduction of 11% year-on-year. Our business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated onetime dividend from the spin of health care at leverage of 3x to 3.5x EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake will provide additional financial flexibility.\nThis combined with our existing strong capital structure provides us with the ability to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters. Now please turn to Slide 9 for our business group performance.\nStarting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 5.8% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $130 million or 4.3 percentage points due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline and exit of our operations in Russia. Excluding this, Q3 adjusted organic sales were down 1.5%. Personal safety was down high single digits due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically.\nClosure and masking continued to be impacted by lower packaging and shipping activity and industrial adhesives and tapes by end market softness in electronics. Abrasives, electrical markets and automotive aftermarket declined versus last year's strong comparisons. And finally, organic growth in our roofing granules business was up high single digits. Adjusted operating income was $708 million or up 5% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 25.7%, up 250 basis points year-on-year and up 350 basis points sequentially.\nThe year-on-year improvement in margins was mainly driven by ongoing productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume and restructuring costs. Moving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q3 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 1.8% year-on-year, largely due to expected weakness in electronics.\nOur electronics business experienced a year-on-year mid-single-digit decline in adjusted organic sales as semiconductor and data center end market demand continues to remain soft. We are starting to see signs of stabilization in consumer electronics end market. However, we are closely monitoring demand trends as we head into the upcoming holiday season. Our auto OEM business had a strong quarter, increasing approximately 16% year-on-year versus a low single-digit global car and light truck build, as we continue to gain penetration on automotive platforms.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Commercial solutions and transportation safety both declined mid-single digits year-on-year, mainly driven by weakness in China, while Advanced Materials grew low single digits. Transportation and Electronics delivered $494 million in adjusted operating income, up 21% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 26.3%, up 460 basis points year-on-year and up 650 basis points sequentially.\nThe year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. Looking at our health care business on Slide 11. Q3 sales were $2.1 billion, with organic growth up 2.4% versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up high single digits year-on-year and medical solutions grew grew low single digits organically, including continued impact from lower post-COVID-related biopharma demand. Health Information Systems declined low single digits due to tighter hospital budgets.\nAs procedure volumes continue to improve and hospital budgets stabilize, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business. Health Care's third quarter operating income was $460 million or up 2% year-on-year. Operating margins were 22.2%, up 50 basis points year-on-year and up sequentially 240 basis points. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, restructuring benefits strong spending discipline and price.\nThese benefits were partially offset by restructuring costs. Finally, on Slide 12. Our Consumer business posted third quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 7.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending trends on hardline categories remains subdued. The back-to-school season was soft and rising interest rates continue to impact the housing market and related spending.\nConsumers third quarter operating income was $269 million, down 10% compared to last year with operating margins of 20.5%, down 70 basis points year-on-year, however, were up 230 basis points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in margins was driven by headwinds from lower sales volumes and restructuring costs. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from productivity actions, restructuring and strong spending discipline and price.\nThat concludes our remarks on the third quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year's expectations. Our strong third quarter performance shows the results of the significant actions we have put in place this year to generate better productivity yield and efficiency from our supply chain, drive simplification, manage costs and deliver for our customers in an uncertain macro environment.\nAs a result, we are raising our full year 2023 adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow conversion guidance. We now expect full year adjusted earnings in the range of $8.95 to $9.15 versus our prior range of $8.60 to $9.10. We are also updating our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion to be in a forecasted range of 100% to 110% versus 90% to 100% previously. Based on our year-to-date performance, we expect full year adjusted organic growth to be down approximately 3% versus our prior guidance to be at the lower end of flat to minus 3%. This updated expectation includes an incremental headwind of $50 million from continued softness in disposable respirator demand. We now estimate a full year sales decline for disposable respirators of approximately $600 million versus $550 million previously. Looking ahead to the implied fourth quarter, we expect end market trends to be consistent with Q3.\nHence, we anticipate fourth quarter adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.6 billion to $7.7 billion, taking into consideration normal seasonality with fewer sales days due to holidays. Fourth quarter pretax restructuring charges are expected to be in the range of $70 million to $120 million, incorporating the timing impact I mentioned earlier, with pretax benefits of $145 million to $195 million. Taken together, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.33.\nTo wrap up, we are very focused on our priorities by driving improved performance through strong operational execution, progressing on our restructuring actions and spending discipline successfully spinning off health care and reducing risk by managing litigation exposures. At the same time, we are positioning 3M for the future as we prioritize the most attractive markets, invest to support continued innovation and capitalize on emerging opportunities. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and drive long-term improvement in our organic growth margins and cash flow performance into the future.\nAs we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and a more focused 3M, and I remain confident in our future. Our solid third quarter is a direct result of the hard work of 3M employees. I want to thank them for their dedication and focus as they continue to deliver in partnership with our suppliers for customers and shareholders. That concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.",

Welcome to the 3M second quarter earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, July 25, 2023.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bruce Jermeland, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at 3M.\n\nBruce Jermeland\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. With me today are Mike Roman, 3M's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Monish Patolawala, our Chief Financial and Transformation Officer; and Kevin Rhodes, our Chief Legal Officer. Mike, Kevin and Monish will make some formal comments, then we will take your questions. Please note that today's earnings release and slide presentation accompanying this call are posted on the homepage of our Investor Relations website at 3m.com.\nPlease turn to Slide 2.

During today's conference call, we'll be making certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about 3M's future performance and financial results.

Roman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. In the second quarter, we made significant progress on the important actions we have been taking to improve our performance and shape the future of 3M. We posted adjusted organic growth of negative 2.5%, which includes a negative 1.7% headwind from the expected decline in disposable respirator sales. Revenue for the quarter was at the high end of our guidance range.\nOur adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, impacted by restructuring charges of $212 million or a headwind to adjusted operating margin of 2.7 percentage points. Excluding these charges, we increased operating margin year-over-year. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 and adjusted free cash flow of $1.5 billion driven by continued improvements in inventory management.\nToday, we are updating our full year earnings per share guidance to $8.60 to $9.10, up from a previous range of $8.50 to $9. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, realize additional benefits from our restructuring actions and position 3M for the future.\nIn the quarter, we maintained a strong focus on serving customers, driving operational execution and maintaining spending discipline. All business segments delivered sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins. Our restructuring actions and strong focus on cost management drove these margin improvements.\nLooking at our markets, trends played out as expected. We saw strength in automotive, both OEM and aftermarket, as well as highway infrastructure and personal safety, excluding disposable respirators. Health Care, which was up slightly, continues to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related demand, notably in our Biopharma, Health Information and Medical Solutions businesses. We also saw continued weakness in electronics, consumer retail and China.\nPlease turn to Slide 4. As we focus on improving our performance and managing a dynamic external environment, our teams are driving 3 strategic priorities: improving operational execution, successfully spinning off our Health Care business and addressing litigation.\nWe are on track with our restructuring actions and have made significant progress in leaning out the center of the company, simplifying our management structure and streamlining our supply chain. The changes to our enterprise supply chain organization are enabling improvements in service, cost and inventory, which helped drive our second quarter results. We are also taking advantage of the continued healing and supply chains to reduce logistics costs and improve production yields.\nWe've also made progress in advancing our go-to-market models to bring our innovation closer to customers. In support of these changes, to date, we have initiated the transition to a new export model in 24 countries. I am pleased with how these changes are helping drive performance.\nWe've made good progress on our planned spin of our Health Care business, including regulatory filings and system updates in preparation for soft spin. We are also in the final steps of naming a CEO. We continue to work towards closing the transaction by year-end 2023 or early 2024, subject to the required conditions and additional factors we have disclosed in our SEC filings.\nLast month, we announced an agreement, subject to court approval, to resolve public water systems claims nationwide in the AFFF multi-district litigation. This agreement will benefit U.S.-based public water systems that provide drinking water to a vast majority of Americans. The settlement covers all forms of PFAS. As we announced, we have taken a Q2-related charge of $10.3 billion payable over 13 years. Also related to litigation, we continue to participate in the confidential mediation process as part of the Combat Arms MDL, and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\nTo provide additional details on our PFAS settlement agreement, I will now turn the call over to Kevin. Please turn to Slide 5. Kevin?\n\nKevin H. Rhodes\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Legal Affairs Officer, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning. This is an important step forward for 3M. As Mike said, we have entered into a broad class resolution with public water systems that provide drinking water to the vast majority of Americans. We are taking a proactive approach to managing PFAS by establishing a more certain path forward for public water systems, communities and 3M.\nSubject to court approval, 3M has agreed to support PFAS remediation for public water systems that detect PFAS at any level, and our agreement addresses all PFAS, not just those compounds that have been the primary focus of litigation to date. Our agreement also provides funding for eligible public water systems that may detect PFAS into the future, and we have agreed to fund additional testing by public water systems as well.\nAs Mike shared, the agreement terms entail a present value commitment of $10.3 billion paid over 13 years. Additional details regarding the payment schedule are available in our Form 8-K filed in June. While this agreement provides an alternative to continued litigation for class members and for 3M, we remain prepared to defend ourselves in litigation should the agreement not receive court approval or should public water systems choose to litigate instead.\nWe are building on actions 3M has taken and continues to take. We were the first company to exit the manufacturing of 2 forms of PFAS, namely PFOA and PFOS, which we announced more than 20 years ago. We have invested in state-of-the-art water filtration technology in our chemical manufacturing operations. And we have announced that 3M will exit all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025. We will continue to build on this important progress as we focus on the future and work to proactively manage PFAS.\nNow let me turn it over to Monish to provide more details regarding our performance in the quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Kevin, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 6. Our second quarter performance was driven by continued focus on serving our customers, improving manufacturing and supply chain productivity while also maintaining strong spending discipline. Also, during the quarter, we initiated a large part of our restructuring program to simplify and streamline the organization. We are aggressively reducing management layers and rooftops while also streamlining our go-to-market models and supply chain, bringing us closer to our customers.\nEnd-market trends continue to play out as anticipated with ongoing weakness in electronics, soft discretionary spending patterns in consumer retail and mixed trends in industrial end markets. Regionally, China's recovery has been slow, impacted by electronics and soft export trends. Europe remains challenged as the uncertain geopolitical situation persists, while end markets in the U.S. largely remain steady.\nSecond quarter total adjusted sales were $8 billion or down 4.7% year-on-year. This result was a little better than forecasted as we experienced a smaller-than-anticipated headwind from foreign currency translation of minus 0.9% versus a forecast of minus 2%. On an adjusted basis, organic sales declined 2.5% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 1.7 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand. Excluding this impact, Q2 adjusted organic sales declined 0.8%.\nOn an adjusted basis, second quarter operating income was $1.5 billion with operating margins of 19.3% and earnings of $2.17 per share. These results included pretax restructuring charges of $212 million, which negatively impacted adjusted operating margins by 2.7 percentage points and earnings by $0.31 per share. Without the impact of restructuring, second quarter adjusted operating margins were 22% or up 40 basis points versus last year, and earnings were $2.48, up $0.03 year-on-year.\nTurning to other components that impacted results year-on-year. We were able to more than offset the impact of lower sales volumes and inflation impacts through improved manufacturing productivity, benefits from restructuring, strong spending discipline and selling prices while continuing to invest in the business. The net result was an increase to margins of 1.4 percentage points and $0.15 to earnings.\nThe previously mentioned headwind from disposable respirators resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 50 basis points and to earnings of $0.09 per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $30 million or a negative 30 basis points impact to operating margins and $0.04 to earnings.\nAs mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 0.9% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 20 basis points to margins and $0.02 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, did not impact margins but resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.06 per share year-on-year primarily driven by a lower share count, which was partially offset by a lower non-op pension benefit.\nIn summary, our team's focus on driving productivity, executing restructuring actions and controlling spending is starting to yield results. These actions, coupled with improvement in global supply chains, drove sequential improvement in adjusted operating margins across all of our business groups. Excluding restructuring charges, adjusted operating margins improved 3.6 percentage points sequentially.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. Second quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion, up 44% year-on-year with conversion of 122%, up 50 percentage points versus last year's Q2. This year-on-year improvement was driven by our ongoing focus on working capital management, especially inventory, and the timing impact related to restructuring charges. Inventory was flat sequentially versus a typical historical build from Q1 to Q2. We continue to adjust production output to end markets and leverage the power of daily management and data and data analytics to increase the velocity of inventory turns.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $328 million in the quarter or similar year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned $828 million to shareholders via dividend. Net debt at the end of Q2 stood at $11.7 billion or down 12% year-on-year.\nOur business segments continue their long history of robust cash flow generation. In addition, our proven access to capital markets, along with the anticipated onetime dividend from the spin of Health Care at 3 to 3.5x EBITDA and 19.9% retained stake, will provide additional financial flexibility. This, combined with our existing strong capital structure, provides us the flexibility to continue to invest in the business, return capital to shareholders and meet the cash flow needs related to ongoing legal matters.\nNow please turn to Slide 9 for our business group performance. Starting with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 4.6% organically. This result included a year-on-year headwind of approximately $140 million or 4.8 percentage points due to last year's COVID-related disposable respirator decline. Excluding disposable respirators, Safety and Industrial sales grew 0.2% organically in Q2.\nOrganic growth was led by mid-single-digit increases in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket, while personal safety declined due to last year's disposable respirator comp. Excluding disposable respirators, personal safety was up high single digits organically.\nClosure and masking declined due to slowdown in packaging and shipping activity, while industrial adhesives and tapes continue to be impacted by end-market softness in electronics. Adjusted operating income was $614 million or down 2.4% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 22.2%, up 70 basis points year-on-year and up 2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year improvement in margins was driven by productivity actions, strong spending discipline and price. Partially offsetting these benefits were headwinds from lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 10, which posted Q2 adjusted sales of $1.9 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 2.4% year-on-year, largely due to the continued decline in demand for electronics. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 21% year-on-year, approximately 600 basis points higher than global car and light truck builds.\nOur electronics business continues to be impacted by soft end-market demand for electronics. As a result, this business experienced a year-on-year decline in adjusted organic sales of approximately 22%. Electronic end markets continue to remain highly uncertain. We expect our year-on-year organic growth rates in electronics to remain negative in the second half, however, improve versus down nearly 30% in the first half as we start to lap easier comps.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Transportation safety grew high single digits organically, while commercial [indiscernible] digits year-on-year. Transportation and Electronics delivered $369 million in adjusted operating income, down 19% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margins were 19.8%, down 3.6 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased 3.1 percentage points sequentially. Margin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\nLooking at our Health Care business on Slide 11. Q2 sales were $2.1 billion with organic growth up slightly versus last year. Organic sales in oral care were up low single digits year-on-year, and Medical Solutions business grew slightly. Separation and purification and Health Information Systems declined mid-single digits and low single digits, respectively. These businesses continue to be impacted by lower post-COVID-related biopharma demand and ongoing stress on hospital budgets. As procedure volumes continue to improve, hospital budgets stabilize and we work through post-COVID-related impacts, we are confident in the long-term outlook of this business.\nHealth Care's second quarter operating income was $411 million, down 16% year-on-year. Operating margins were 19.8%, down 2.8 percentage points year-on-year, however, increased sequentially 1.9 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by lower sales volume, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\nFinally, on Slide 12. Our Consumer business posted second quarter sales of $1.3 billion. Organic sales declined 2.2% year-on-year as discretionary spending on hardline categories remains soft. We expect this trend to continue into the second half of the year.\nOrganic sales grew slightly in home, health and auto care, while home improvement and stationery and office businesses both declined. Consumer second quarter operating income was $235 million, down 5% compared to last year, with operating margins of 18.2%, down 40 basis points year-on-year but up 3.2 percentage points sequentially. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volumes, restructuring costs and inflation impacts. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from strong spending discipline, productivity actions and pricing.\nThat concludes our remarks on the second quarter. Please turn to Slide 14 for an update on our full year expectations. During our January earnings call, we highlighted that we expected macroeconomic and end-market uncertainties to continue to persist into the year. In addition, we noted that we were starting to see the healing of supply chains. However, we expected to continue to see headwinds from raw material availability and inflation, although at a lower level than 2022.\nWe also stated that we were not satisfied with our performance and we would be taking a deeper look at everything we do as we continue to prepare for the spin of Health Care. As a result, we noted that as we move through the year, we would be taking additional actions to improve supply chain performance, drive simplification and bring us closer to our customers.\nWhile we have more work to do, let me take a moment to provide a few examples on the progress we have made through the first half of the year. Starting with our sales performance. While end markets continue to play out as expected, Q1 and Q2 revenue was slightly above our expectations. Our teams continue to relentlessly focus on serving our customers, work down backlogs and leverage the use of data and data analytics to drive improvements in demand planning.\nNext, as we have mentioned, we are aggressively addressing structure. We are on track with our actions to reduce structure across the company, including at corporate, in our business segments and in manufacturing supply chain. We have initiated the transition of 24 countries to an export model, partnering with local distribution to serve those customers and markets.\nIn addition, we have made good progress in reducing corporate structure, including the exit of our aviation operations and our conference center in Northern Minnesota. And finally, we continue to adjust our production levels to end-market trends, manage inventory and aggressively control spending.\nAs a result of our actions, along with improvements in global supply chains and raw material availability, we are able to deliver first half performance better than anticipated, particularly for margins, earnings and cash flow.\nIn the first half of the year, on an adjusted basis, we delivered sales of $15.7 billion, operating margins of 18.6% and earnings per share of $4.14. These results included $264 million in pretax restructuring charges or a headwind to margins of 1.7 percentage points and to earnings of $0.38 per share. In addition, our strong operational execution and working capital management, particularly inventories, helped us to deliver $2.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow with a conversion rate of 105%.\nTurning to guidance. We are raising our full year adjusted earnings expectation as a result of our strong first half operational execution as evidenced by an improving margin rate. We now expect full year's earnings in the range of $8.60 to $9.10 versus a prior range of $8.50 to $9.\nWe continue to closely monitor end-market trends across all our businesses, particularly in electronics, consumer retail, industrial and China and have yet to see signs of improvement in trends. Therefore, we currently see organic growth tracking to the lower end of our range of flat to minus 3%. This reflects our performance to date along with our year-on-year headwind from disposable respirators tracking to the high end of our anticipated range or down approximately $550 million along with continued macro and end-market uncertainty. And finally, our full year adjusted free cash flow conversion expectation remains unchanged in a forecasted range of 90% to 100%.\nLooking ahead to the third quarter. We expect end-market trends to be very similar to Q2. Hence, we anticipate third quarter adjusted sales to be approximately $8 billion. The impact from the COVID-related decline in disposable respirators and last year's exit of Russia is anticipated to be a year-on-year headwind to sales of approximately $130 million or 1.5 percentage points.\nThird quarter pretax restructuring costs are expected to be in the range of $125 million to $175 million with pretax benefits of $125 million to $150 million. Taken together, we expect third quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $2.25 to $2.40.\nTo wrap up, we continue to have a strong focus on serving our customers, improving the execution in our supply chain, making progress in our restructuring actions, managing costs and investing in the business while navigating ongoing end-market weakness. We expect our actions will continue to build momentum and improve our organic growth, margins and cash flow performance into the future.\nI want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnership and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue to deliver for our customers and shareholders. I am confident in our future. As we have said, as we exit 2023, we will be a stronger, leaner and more focused 3M.\nThat concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.",

Roman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Bruce. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I recap our first quarter, I want to discuss actions we are taking to improve our performance. As you recall, over the past few years, we have implemented a new global operating model led by our 4 business groups, which included moving to a common global supply chain design end-to-end. We have since advanced our digital capabilities, further repositioned our portfolio and continued to invest in growth and productivity.\nOur experience throughout this journey, including lessons learned during the pandemic, supply chain disruptions and changing global trends has shown us what is working and what we can do better. As I said last quarter, we are looking at everything we do. Today, we are announcing additional actions to improve our cost structure, streamline our corporate center, strengthen our supply chain, enhance our go-to-market models and drive greater focus in markets where 3M science gives us a clear competitive advantage.\nWe will reduce costs at the corporate center by eliminating management layers across the company. We are broadly reducing our corporate shared services like our central design group. We are reducing rooftops worldwide, including exiting our conference center in Northern Minnesota. We are also simplifying and modernizing our technology by moving to the cloud and removing hundreds of legacy systems. This reduces costs and provides us greater agility and flexibility to invest in differentiated digital areas like data, analytics and automation while increasing investments in cybersecurity.\nWe are simplifying our supply chain structure to better align with our businesses and improve performance in every aspect of plan, source, make and deliver while adding industry expertise to help drive our progress. The actions we are announcing today will help us complete our shift from area to global management, simplifying reporting lines and clarifying accountability.\nWe are also taking out layers of management and duplication of activities across all areas of supply chain. Our progress in digital gives us better tools to use in the areas of planning, sourcing and logistics, removing redundant work and improving productivity. And we will prioritize our continuous improvement efforts in our largest factory operations. We will have a more efficient support structure and operating model to improve service, cost and inventory.\nWe are streamlining go-to-market models to better align with customers, improve agility and reduce management structure. This is driven by our relentless focus on optimizing the path to our customer. We are not adopting a one-size-fits-all approach. We are customizing an approach for each business that ensures greater focus.\nIn Safety and Industrial and Transportation and Electronics, we will eliminate certain area-based business group leadership and move to a division-led model. In Transportation and Electronics, we will also combine 2 divisions, further reducing structure. In Consumer, we will simplify how we go to market with each area team aligned around their prioritized product portfolios and leading brands.\nIn addition, we are changing our go-to-market model in approximately 30 countries around the globe, which represent less than 5% of our revenue. In these countries, we will leverage our digital and export capabilities and move to a model partnering with distributors with deep local knowledge and infrastructure, enabling us to significantly reduce our people, real estate and other related costs.\nThrough our actions, we plan to eliminate approximately 6,000 positions globally in addition to the reduction of 2,500 global manufacturing roles we announced in January. In total, this represents about 10% of our global workforce and senior executive roles. Reductions will span all functions, businesses and geographies and be completed in accordance with local regulations. We expect to take total pre-tax restructuring charges of $700 million to $900 million with approximately half of the charges to occur in 2023 and the balance to be largely taken in 2024.\nWe anticipate the actions will drive savings in the range of $700 million to $900 million, expand margins and position 3M for future growth. We estimate that approximately half of the annualized savings will be realized in 2023.\nAt the same time, we are continuing to build 3M for the future, prioritizing high-growth markets like automotive electrification, personal safety, home improvement, semiconductors and health care. We are also investing in large emerging markets that demand our material science innovation, including climate technology, industrial automation, next-generation electronics and sustainable packaging. As we move forward, we will drive additional cost reductions through improvements in sourcing, yield, productivity, factory automation and network optimization of our plants and distribution centers.\nToday, we are also announcing changes to align our leadership to our future direction. Effective immediately, Mike Vale is appointed Group President and Chief Business and Country Officer, a new role on the company's corporate operations committee reporting to me. In this new role, he will have responsibility for 3 of the company's 4 business groups: Safety and Industrial, Transportation and Electronics and Consumer and also Country Governance.\nJeff Lavers, who is leading our Consumer and Health Care business, will now lead our Health Care business and support the company's progress towards a spin-off and the transition to a new CEO and management team. Jeff continues to report to me. Karina Chavez will become Group President, Consumer. Chris Goralski will become Group President, Safety and Industrial. Ashish Khandpur will continue as Group President, Transportation and Electronics.\nAll 3 are experienced leaders at 3M and well positioned to help drive the actions we announced today to improve our performance. Karina, Chris and Ashish will report to Mike Vale. In total, today's action will make 3M more streamlined and competitive.\nNow please turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our first quarter. In an economic environment that remains challenging, we stayed relentlessly focused on serving customers and aggressively managed costs. We posted adjusted organic growth of minus 5.6% or minus 2.2% excluding our Russia exit and decline in disposable respirator sales. We delivered adjusted margins of nearly 18% and adjusted earnings of $1.97 per share while expanding our adjusted free cash flow to $900 million.\nToday, we are affirming our full year guidance for organic growth, EPS and cash flow, which is inclusive of the restructuring charges and related savings. End-market trends played out as expected with ongoing weakness in consumer-facing markets. We saw continued strength in certain industrial markets, including automotive, electrical markets and abrasives.\nOur actions to reduce costs, which included plant spending, external services, travel and hiring, helped drive stronger-than-expected earnings and margins. We also continued to improve inventory levels, enabling us to deliver strong cash flow. At the same time, we are advancing our strategic priorities for long-term value creation as we make progress on the spin of our Health Care business.\nTurning to litigation. On Combat Arms, 3M continues to support Aearo Technologies through mediation discussions. We are focused on achieving a resolution that is efficient and equitable for all parties. With respect to PFAS, we continue to address litigation by defending ourselves in court or negotiating resolutions as appropriate. We also have a dedicated team to facilitate an orderly transition as we exit PFAS manufacturing and work to discontinue the use of PFAS in our products by the end of 2025.\nIn summary, we are improving day-to-day operational execution, advancing our strategic priorities and taking necessary actions to move 3M forward. We are dedicated to building on our progress, delivering greater value for our customers and shareholders and exiting 2023 a stronger and more focused 3M.\nMonish will now take you through the details of the quarter. Monish?\n\nMonish D. Patolawala\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Mike, and I wish you all a very good morning. Please turn to Slide 5. As Mike mentioned, the first quarter macro and end-market trends have played out largely as anticipated. We experienced significant end-market weakness in consumer electronics, shifting consumer spending patterns along with the retailer destocking and mixed industrial end markets. We also continue to navigate COVID-related impacts in China and the ongoing geopolitical challenges in Europe.\nGiven the expected challenging start to the year, we relentlessly focused on serving our customers and took very aggressive actions to manage costs and spending. These actions, coupled with a lower-than-expected foreign currency headwind, enabled us to deliver a first quarter that was better than forecasted.\nFirst quarter total adjusted sales was $7.7 billion or down 9.7% year-on-year. In addition to focusing on serving customers, first quarter sales benefited from a smaller-than-anticipated headwind to sales from foreign currency translation. The first quarter year-on-year translation impact was a minus 2.8% or approximately $230 million versus a forecast of minus 3% to minus 4%.\nWe also experienced a 1.3% sales decline from divestitures or approximately $120 million versus Q1 last year. This decline was largely from the third quarter 2022 divestiture of Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies.\nOn an adjusted organic basis, first quarter sales decreased 5.6% versus last year. This result included an expected year-on-year headwind of approximately $300 million or 3.4 percentage points related to lower disposable respirator demand and the exit of our operations in Russia last year in the third quarter. Excluding this decline, Q1 adjusted organic sales growth was minus 2.2%.\nFirst quarter adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion with operating margins of 17.9% and adjusted earnings of $1.97.\nTurning to the components that impacted first quarter operating margins and earnings year-on-year performance. Our Q1 margin and earnings reflect the previously mentioned lower sales volume. This lower sales volume, combined with our efforts to reduce inventories, resulted in lower manufacturing productivity versus last year's first quarter. We were able to partially offset these headwinds through pricing performance and aggressive cost management, resulting in a net headwind to margins of 90 basis points and $0.17 to earnings.\nAs mentioned, we faced a challenging Q1 comp from last year's Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand, along with the exit of operations in Russia. This sales comp headwind resulted in a negative impact to operating margins of 1.1 percentage points and to earnings of $0.21 per share.\nWe continued our focus on improving our manufacturing and supply chain operations, including executing on restructuring actions to streamline the organization and adjust to slowing end-market demand. Restructuring charges in the quarter were $52 million or a year-on-year headwind of 50 basis points to margin and $0.05 to earnings per share. The carryover impact of higher raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation created a year-on-year headwind of approximately $100 million or a negative 130 basis point impact to operating margins and $0.15 to earnings.\nAs mentioned, foreign currency translation was a negative 2.8% impact to total sales. This resulted in a headwind of 30 basis points to margins and $0.10 to earnings per share. Divestitures, primarily Food Safety, along with the deconsolidation of Aearo Technologies, resulted in a year-on-year headwind of $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter. Finally, other financial items increased earnings by a net $0.05 per share year-on-year driven by lower share count, partially offset by higher non-op pension expense.\nPlease turn to Slide 6. First quarter adjusted free cash flow was approximately $950 million, up 24% year-on-year with conversion of 87%, up 37 percentage points versus last year's Q1. This year-on-year improvement was driven by lower annual incentive cash compensation and a strong focus on working capital management, particularly inventory improvement.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to address manufacturing production levels to better align with end-market trends. Since last August, we have driven an approximately $500 million reduction in inventory levels. As I've said before, as supply chains heal and we progress the use of data and data analytics, we will see a reduction in inventory levels.\nAdjusted capital expenditures were $445 million in the quarter, up 15% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability. During the quarter, we returned nearly $900 million to shareholders. Net debt at the end of Q1 stood at $12 billion, down 10% year-on-year with net debt-to-EBITDA at 1.5x.\nPlease turn to Slide 8 for our business group performance. I will start with our Safety and Industrial business, which posted sales of $2.8 billion or down 6% organically. This result included a year-on-year comp headwind of $285 million due to last year's Omicron-driven disposable respirator demand and exit of Russia. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators and Russia exit, Safety and Industrial sales grew nearly 4% organically in Q1.\nOrganic growth was led by high single-digit increases in automotive aftermarket, electrical markets and abrasives, while the personal safety business declined mid-teens primarily due to the decline in disposable respirator demand. Excluding the impact from disposable respirators, the personal safety business grew low double digits organically.\nTurning to the rest of Safety and Industrial. Organic growth declined high single digits in industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronic softness. And closure and masking systems was down low single digits as consumers pull back on discretionary spending, impacting e-commerce shipments. Roofing granules were down low single digits.\nAdjusted operating income was $562 million or down 19% versus last year. Adjusted operating margins were 20.2%, down 2.4 percentage points year-on-year. Margin headwinds were driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions.\nMoving to Transportation and Electronics on Slide 9, which posted Q1 adjusted sales of $1.7 billion. Adjusted organic growth declined 11.3% year-on-year, heavily impacted by a significant decline in demand for consumer electronic devices. Our auto OEM business increased approximately 6% year-on-year, in line with global car and light truck builds. We continue to gain penetration on new automotive platforms and expect to outperform build rates over the long run.\nOur electronics business saw adjusted organic sales declines in the mid-30% range. This business continues to be impacted by significant end-market weakness along with tiers and OEMs aggressively reducing inventories, particularly for smartphones, tablets and TVs.\nTurning to the rest of Transportation and Electronics. Advanced Materials had adjusted organic growth of high single digits year-on-year, while both transportation safety and commercial solutions declined. Transportation and Electronics delivered $284 million in adjusted operating income, down 36% year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 16.7%, down 5.5 percentage points year-on-year.\nMargin headwinds were driven by sales volume declines, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation, investments in the business and impacts from China COVID-related challenges. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions.\nLooking at our Health Care business on Slide 10. Q1 sales were $2 billion with organic growth of 1.4% versus last year. Excluding the impact on the exit of Russia, Health Care grew Q1 organic sales by approximately 2%. Sales in our Medical Solutions business and oral care grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while Health Information Systems was flat due to strained hospital budgets. Separation and purification declined high single digits due to the normalization of post-COVID-related biopharma demand.\nFirst quarter elective healthcare procedure volumes were approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels as nurse labor shortages and strained hospital budgets continue to impact the pace of recovery. We continue to expect procedure volumes to improve as we progress through the year.\nHealth Care's first quarter operating income was $360 million, down 19% year-on-year. Operating margins were 17.9%, down 3 percentage points. Year-on-year operating margins were impacted by manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, carryover raw material logistics, and energy cost inflation, and investments in the business. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline, and productivity actions.\nLastly on slide 11, our Consumer business posted first-quarter sales of $1.2 billion. Organic sales declined 6.8% year-on-year with particular weakness in the U.S., which was down high single digits. Stationery and office grew low single digits organically year-on-year, while the home improvement, home health and auto care business declined organically. Relative to first quarter last year, consumers have shifted their spending patterns to more nondiscretionary items and retailers have aggressively reduced their inventory levels. We expect consumers to remain cautious with their discretionary spending as we move forward through the year.\nConsumer's first quarter operating income was $179 million, down 18% compared to last year with operating margins of 15%, down 1.8 percentage points year-on-year. The year-on-year decline in operating margins was driven by lower sales volume, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds and carryover raw material, logistics and energy cost inflation. These headwinds were partially offset by benefits from pricing, aggressive spending discipline and productivity actions.\nThat concludes our remarks on the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 13 for a discussion on our outlook for the year and the second quarter. We are maintaining our full year guidance, reflecting a macroeconomic and end-market environment that remains very fluid and uncertain. Our outlook continues to incorporate the expected second half improvement in macroeconomic forecasts, including in China.\nWe also anticipate the continued healing of global supply chains, which will help support ongoing product cost improvements in our manufacturing and supply chain operations, along with working capital performance, particularly inventory reductions. As a reminder, our full year adjusted organic sales growth is expected to be in the range of minus 3% to flat. This range includes an estimated 2 percentage point headwind from the ongoing decline in disposable respirator demand, along with the impact of our exit from Russia. Adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $8.50 to $9 per share. Full year adjusted free cash flow conversion remains forecasted in the range of 90% to 100%.\nTurning to our outlook for the second quarter. First, looking at external macroeconomic forecasts, both global GDP and IPI are currently expected to improve year-on-year and sequentially. The softness we experienced in Q1 in consumer electronics and consumer retail is expected to continue into Q2. We expect both sequential and year-on-year increase in auto bills, while health care procedure volumes are anticipated to be similar to Q1 levels and industrial end markets are expected to remain mixed.\nAs discussed, we implemented very aggressive cost controls in the first quarter given the challenging start to the year, including on travel, advertising, external services and head count management. While we will remain disciplined, we expect to increase investments as we progress through the year to support end-market demand improvement in the second half and into the future.\nIncluding these factors, our expectations for Q2 are for total adjusted sales to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion versus $8.4 billion last year or down 6% to 8% year-on-year. Organic sales is expected to be down low to mid-single digits, which includes the forecasted year-on-year headwind of approximately 1.5% from disposable respirators.\nAnd finally, foreign currency translation is expected to be approximately a minus 2% headwind to sales versus last year's Q2 and divestitures a year-on-year headwind of minus 1%. From an EPS perspective, we estimate that second quarter adjusted earnings per share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.75, including a pre-tax restructuring charge of $175 million to $250 million or $0.25 to $0.35 per share. This range also incorporates the continued softness in organic sales and expected increase in investments, higher non-op interest costs and an adjusted tax rate of 18.5% to 19.5%.\nTo wrap up, 2023 is a pivotal year for 3M from an execution perspective. As I mentioned, we aggressively managed cost, focused on serving customers while navigating end-market weakness, particularly in consumer-facing markets as we started the year. We expect organic sales volumes will improve as consumer retail and consumer electronics markets stabilize, China work through its COVID-related challenges as our year-on-year comps ease.\nThe actions we announced today will enable us to exit 2023 stronger than we started and provide for significant margin and cash flow improvement into the future. I want to thank our customers and suppliers for their partnerships and the 3M employees for their hard work and dedication as they continue delivering for our customers.\nThat concludes my remarks. We will now take your questions.",

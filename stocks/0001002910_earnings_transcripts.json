Welcome to Ameren's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call.\n[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. At this time, I'll now turn the conference over to Andrew Kirk, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Modeling. Thank you. You may now begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, along with other members of the Ameren Management Team.\nThis call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans projections financial performance and similar matters which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nNow here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks Andrew. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the financials, I want to highlight the strategy that drives our actions and deliver strong long-term value for our customers communities and shareholders. Pursuant to this strategy, we've been investing in the electric and natural gas infrastructure of Missouri and Illinois to harden it and make it more reliable, resilient and safer. And we've been adding new energy generation resources to meet the needs of our communities today and in the years to come. Because we are committed to providing a strong value proposition for our 2.5 million electric and 900,000 natural gas customers, we are also laser-focused on optimizing our operations to keep customer rates affordable.\nAs we look ahead, the region and communities we serve are poised for significant economic growth, bringing investment, jobs and tax revenue as well as necessitating incremental investment in utility infrastructure. To support this growth, we are actively engaging with stakeholders on economic development opportunities and to advance constructive regulatory frameworks designed to serve new large load customers and maintain just and reasonable rates for all customers. We're excited about the opportunities in front of us and believe the future is bright for Ameren and the communities we serve. Michael and I will dive into more details on the pages ahead.\nNow let's turn to Page 5 for a summary of our third quarter results. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2025 adjusted earnings of $2.17 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $1.87 per share in the third quarter of 2024. Our recent FERC order provided guidance on ratemaking for net operating loss carryforwards. And as a result, we recorded a tax benefit of $0.18 in the third quarter of 2025. Given the nature of the tax benefit, we have excluded it from our adjusted third quarter 2025 earnings.\nThe key drivers of our strong third quarter results are outlined on this page. As we move to Page 6, I'll cover how execution of our strategy has translated into tangible results for our stakeholders throughout this year. During the first 3 quarters of 2025, Ameren delivered on its commitments, deploying more than $3 billion in critical infrastructure upgrades for customers. For example, as part of our Ameren Missouri 2025 Smart Energy Plan, 11,300 electric distribution poles were replaced, 600 of which were upgraded to stronger composite poles. 300 smart switches were installed to reduce outages and speed restoration. 32 miles of subtransmission lines were hardened. 5 new or upgraded substations were energized and 55 miles of underground cable were replaced to strengthen system reliability.\nIn Illinois, our customers are benefiting from the replacement of more than 8,500 stronger electric distribution poles, 8 miles of coupled steel gas distribution pipelines and 13 miles of gas transmission pipelines for safety. Further, our transmission business placed in service 11 new or upgraded transmission substations and 40 miles of new or upgraded transmission lines to deliver energy more efficiently. These are just a few of the many projects completed through September.\nWe also continue to execute on Ameren Missouri's preferred resource plan. As you know, we updated this plan in February to reflect the growing energy needs of our customers and communities, including during extreme weather conditions. The plan calls for the addition of approximately 10 gigawatts of generation capacity by 2035, including 3.7 gigawatts of natural gas generation, 4.2 gigawatts of renewables and 1.4 gigawatts of battery storage. Through September, we've invested more than $825 million in new or existing generation resources and have requested CCNs from the Missouri Public Service Commission for 1.45 gigawatts of additional resources.\nIn 2025, we also made the decision to spend more on operating and maintenance by accelerating certain tree trimming and energy center maintenance activities. All of these efforts underscore our commitment to delivering reliable energy for the long term. And as you know, our electric rates remain below both national and Midwest averages, a testament to our unwavering focus on continuous improvement and affordability.\nNow let's turn to Page 7. We have a long track record of strong and consistent earnings per share growth. As we look ahead, we expect this to continue. In February of this year, we updated our long-term earnings growth guidance, which included our expectation to grow earnings at a 6% to 8% compound annual rate from '25 through 2029 based off of our 2025 original guidance midpoint of $4.95. For 2025, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10, up from our original guidance range of $4.85 to $5.05. We're well positioned to continue our long history of delivering above the midpoint of our original earnings guidance range.\nFor 2026, we now expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.45. And we expect consistent earnings growth near the upper end of our 6% to 8% EPS compound annual growth rate range in 2027 through 2029. Consistent with prior years, we plan to update our long-term earnings growth guidance on our fourth quarter call in February 2026, including our 5-year capital and financing plans, which will reflect, among other things, firmed up capital estimates related to Ameren Missouri's preferred resource plan.\nTurning to Page 8. I'll provide an update on economic development activities in our region and associated sales growth expectations. We remain closely engaged with potential data center customers and are building a robust pipeline of large load opportunities that extend into the next decade. Data centers represent significant private investment opportunity for our states, bringing in thousands of jobs in fields such as construction, plumbing, electrical work and technology as well as substantial tax revenue.\nAs we discussed on our earnings call in August, data center developers continue to evaluate opportunities in Missouri, given the numerous desirable construction sites in our territory, available transmission capacity and our ability to deliver power when needed at competitive rates. As a result of this engagement, Ameren Missouri's executed construction agreements with data center developers have expanded to 3 gigawatts, up from the previous total of 2.3 gigawatts. The developers of the data center sites with construction agreements in place have now made nonrefundable payments to us totaling $38 million to cover the necessary transmission upgrades and which demonstrates their confidence in and commitment to the proposed projects.\nWe also continue to actively engage with potential data center customers to negotiate electric service agreements that are aligned with our proposed Missouri large load rate structure and, among other things, would establish anticipated minimum ramp schedules. I'll talk more about progress on that large load rate structure in a few minutes.\nAs outlined in Ameren Missouri's preferred resource plan, we expect 1 gigawatt of new load from data center customers by the end of 2029 and a total of 1.5 gigawatts of new data center demand by the end of 2032. To give you a sense of the proportions, 1 gigawatt of new data center load by 2029 would represent approximately 5.5% compound annual Missouri sales growth from 2025. In addition, we're seeing notable expansion in the region's defense and geospatial intelligence ecosystem which is stimulating growth across multiple sectors, including advanced manufacturing.\nOne such example is the opening of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's new nearly $2 billion campus in St. Louis this September. The campus, which employs more than 3,000 people, represents the largest federal investment in St. Louis' history. Private sector participation is also strong with companies like Scale AI choosing to locate their headquarters downtown. The presence in St. Louis of federal and private sector geospatial operations, including advanced mapping, satellite imagery and spatial analytics, strategically aligns with our region's strength in defense and defense tech industries.\nLooking ahead, Boeing has begun construction of new facilities to build the F-47 fighter approved earlier this year. Production of the F-47 is scheduled to start in 2026. These developments further strengthen St. Louis' position as a national hub for innovation and strategic investment.\nIn Downstate Illinois, developers are also advancing data center projects with expected incremental energy demand totaling 850 megawatts. We have signed construction agreements with these developers and received payments to support the necessary transmission interconnections. Energy supply for these projects is expected to be provided through third-party supply agreements. We expect to provide an update on our Missouri and Illinois 5-year sales growth expectations in February.\nMoving now to Page 9. We provide an update on generation resources currently in progress at Ameren Missouri. We have procured long lead time components such as turbines and transformers for our planned energy centers with expected in-service dates through 2029. And we have secured production slots for the 3 turbines for our combined cycle energy center expected to be in service in 2031, remaining on track to deliver the dispatchable resources called for in our preferred resource plan.\nIn August, we requested a certificate of convenience and necessity for the Reform Solar Energy Center, a planned 250-megawatt solar facility to be located adjacent to our existing Callaway Nuclear Energy Center. Generation projects with CCN requests pending before the Missouri Public Service Commission will support progress toward our goal of maintaining a balanced energy mix. We're targeting approximately 70% generation from on-demand resources and 30% from intermittent resources by 2040.\nAmeren Missouri's planned generation portfolio is expected to provide an estimated $1.5 billion in customer savings from tax credits through 2029, of which approximately $270 million has been realized so far in 2025. Building, maintaining and operating a sufficient and optimal mix of energy centers to meet our customers' needs in an affordable manner is critical for our stakeholders, and I'm proud of the work our team is doing in those regards.\nOn Page 10, we outline Ameren Missouri's proposed large load rate structure, which was filed with the Missouri PSC in May and updated in surrebuttal testimony earlier this week. In accordance with Missouri State law, any future large load data center customers would be required to pay for cost to connect them to our system and for their share of ongoing cost of service. Under the proposed large load rate structure, we would deliver service under our existing large primary service base rate, which is currently approximately $0.06 per kilowatt hour, and customers would agree to additional terms and conditions as part of an electric service agreement.\nThe additional terms would include a service commitment of 12 years after ramp, a minimum demand charge of 80% of contracted capacity, exit provisions and credit and collateral requirements, all designed to protect existing customers. In addition, new customer programs would be available that would allow qualifying customers to advance their clean energy goals by supporting the carbon-free energy resource of their choice through incremental payments, which would help offset costs for other customers. This structure would offer a fair and competitive rate to large customers and maintain just and reasonable rates for all customers. While no deadline exists for Missouri PSC approval of our proposed large load rate structure, based on the existing procedural schedule, we would expect a decision by February of 2026.\nMoving now to Page 11 for an update on the long-range transmission planning process at MISO. Our focus remains on building the LRTP Tranche 1 and Tranche 2.1 projects that were assigned to us and developing strong proposals for Tranche 2.1 competitive projects. We are carefully evaluating each bidding opportunity, and we'll submit bids for projects when we believe we offer a clear advantage on project design, cost and execution. As we have successfully done in the past, when it enhances the strength and competitiveness of our proposals, we expect to partner with other entities.\nFor example, in August, we submitted a joint proposal with 3 other partners on a Tranche 2.1 competitive project in Wisconsin. We expect MISO to select the developer for this project in early 2026. The bidding and selection process for the 4 remaining Tranche 2.1 competitive projects will continue to take place over the remainder of this year and next. As a reminder, we do not include investment related to competitive projects in our 5-year plan until projects have been awarded to us.\nFurther, MISO continues to analyze increasing energy demand and updated resource mix assumptions across the region as part of the futures redesign process. We expect this analysis will show the need for significant incremental transmission investments that would benefit the wider MISO region over time. MISO is expected to issue its report in early 2026.\nMoving now to Page 12. Looking ahead over the next decade, our pipeline of investment opportunities continues to grow, standing today at more than $68 billion. We will provide further details in February as to the planned capital investments expected for the period of 2026 through 2030 and the associated financing plan. These investments will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner and by powering economic growth in our communities.\nTurning to Page 13. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth from 2025 through 2029. This earnings growth expectation is primarily driven by strong anticipated compound annual rate base growth of 9.2%, reflecting strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to strengthen the grid in each of our business segments and to build new energy resources to meet increased demand. We expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plan and our broader strategy across all 4 of our business segments as we have a skilled and experienced team dedicated to achieving our growth objectives while keeping customers at the center of everything we do.\nNow before turning the call over to Michael, I'd like to briefly share a leadership update. Effective January 1, Michael will assume the role of Group President of Ameren Utilities, overseeing the operations of each of our business segments. Michael is an experienced leader, bringing to this newly created position, deep financial and broad operational expertise, qualities that will continue to support our focus on delivering value for customers and shareholders.\nWhen Michael transitions to this new role, Lenny Singh, currently Chairman and President of Ameren Illinois, will transition into the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Lenny has nearly 35 years of utility leadership experience with substantial operational, regulatory and profit and loss responsibilities. These experiences will ensure we continue to practice financial discipline aligned with our regulatory frameworks and deliver value for our customers and shareholders. I'm pleased with the strength and alignment of our leadership team and believe these changes position us well for continued execution of our strategy and strong performance.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2025 GAAP earnings of $2.35 per share, which included a tax benefit related to our Ameren Transmission segment. This tax benefit was recorded due to IRS guidance and a FERC order issued to another taxpayer regarding treatment of net operating loss carryforwards. Pursuant to this guidance, this quarter, we decreased income tax expense by $48 million or $0.18 per share. Excluding this benefit, third quarter 2025 adjusted earnings were $2.17 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $1.87 per share for the third quarter of 2024.\nThe key factors that drove the $0.30 increase in adjusted earnings per share are highlighted by segment on Page 16 and reflect the important investments we've made to strengthen the energy grid across our service territory. In addition to benefiting from new electric service rates in Missouri and warmer-than-normal weather in July, we continue to experience strong sales growth within Ameren Missouri's service territory. In fact, total normalized Ameren Missouri retail sales over the trailing 12 months through September increased across all customer classes with an overall increase of approximately 1.5%. Further, in light of the benefit from weather this year and to support stronger reliability, we've increased energy center and discretionary tree trimming expenditures, the latter in targeted areas to address vegetation growth near our power lines.\nMoving to Page 17. Since 2013, we've delivered strong, consistent normalized adjusted earnings per share growth of greater than 7.5% compound annually. Yesterday, we increased our 2025 earnings per share guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. The midpoint of the new range represents approximately 8% growth compared to both our original 2024 earnings guidance range midpoint and our 2024 results. Outlined on the page are select earnings considerations for the fourth quarter of 2025, which I encourage you to take into consideration as you develop your expectations for the balance of the year.\nAnd moving to Page 18, we provide detail on our 2026 earnings per share expectations, which we also announced yesterday. We expect our 2026 earnings per share to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.45, the midpoint of which represents 8.2% growth compared to our original 2025 earnings guidance midpoint of $4.95. Expected 2026 earnings details by segment compared to our 2025 expectations are highlighted on this page. Robust planned infrastructure investment, strong expected sales and economic growth and strategic business process optimization opportunities give us confidence in our ability to grow earnings in 2026 and the years ahead.\nNow turning to our financing plan on Page 19. To support our strong credit ratings and maintain our balance sheet while we fund our investment plan, in February, we outlined a plan to issue approximately $600 million of common equity each year through 2029. We have fulfilled our equity needs for 2025 and 2026 through forward sales agreements that we expect to physically settle near the end of these years. Having utilized most of the capacity available under our existing equity sales distribution agreement, in August, we increased the program capacity by $1.25 billion to enable additional sales to support equity needs in 2027 and beyond. And in September, Ameren Illinois issued $350 million of 5.625% first mortgage bonds due 2055, completing our planned debt issuances for this year. We feel great about our financial position and the progress we've made in our financing plan.\nTurning to Page 20. I'll provide a brief update on ongoing regulatory proceedings in Illinois. Our Ameren Illinois natural gas distribution rate review is pending with the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, and we expect a decision this month. As a reminder, we have requested $135 million annual base rate increase. In October, the Administrative Law Judge, or ALJ, recommended an annual base rate increase of $91 million based on a 9.93% return on equity and a 50% common equity ratio. The difference is primarily driven by allowed ROE, the common equity ratio and the treatment of other post-employment benefits. Following the ICC's decision, we expect rates to be effective in December.\nTurning to Page 21. Our 2024 annual reconciliation proceeding under the electric multiyear rate plan continues to progress. In September, the ICC staff revised its reconciliation adjustment recommendation to a $47 million increase compared to our updated request of $60 million, with the variance primarily driven by treatment of other post-employment benefits. The ALJ recommendation and the reconciliation proceeding is expected later today. An ICC decision is expected by mid-December and rates reflecting the approved reconciliation adjustment will be effective by January 2026.\nTurning now to Page 22. Our strong performance so far this year has positioned us well to continue executing our strategic plan, which will drive superior value for all of our stakeholders. We continue to expect strong earnings per share growth to be driven by robust rate base growth, disciplined cost management and a strong customer growth pipeline. Our strategy and team are well aligned and focused to ensure we capitalize on these opportunities for our customers and shareholders. We believe our growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. And further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Modeling for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Man, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nNow here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. In Ameren, we power the quality of life for millions across Missouri and Illinois. Our strategic approach is built on 3 fundamental pillars: making prudent investments in rate-regulated energy infrastructure, advocating for responsible energy policies and continuously optimizing our operations to create long-term sustainable value for our customers, communities and shareholders. This strategy is not just about keeping the lights on. It is about paving the way for a cost effective, more reliable and resilient energy grid that meets our customers' growing needs and driving regional growth for decades to come.\nAs highlighted on Page 5, we made solid progress on our key strategic objectives in the first half of the year, which will help us deliver on these commitments to our customers and shareholders. During the first half of the year, we invested over $2 billion in critical infrastructure, advanced key regulatory proceedings and delivered strong operational performance all while keeping our average electric rates below the national and Midwest averages.\nIn the second quarter, we experienced a high number of severe weather events, including an EF3 tornado on May 16 and that spanned a mile wide and traveled 23 miles through Central St. Louis County and Northern parts of St. Louis City and into Illinois. This tornado caused extensive damage and widespread outages across Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. We deployed more than 2,700 field personnel in the days following the tornado including Ameren crews, contractors and supporting resources from across the Midwest, who responded swiftly and safely rebuilding damaged infrastructure, replacing nearly 1,000 poles and restoring service to more than 290,000 customers.\nWeather events like those experienced earlier this year underscore the importance of our ongoing investments in a more resilient energy grid. Enhancements like upgraded substations, composite poles designed to withstand high winds and smart technologies that enable faster outage detection and automated grid self-healing are helping us restore power safely and more quickly when these serious storms strike. We remain focused on making these investments responsibly, balancing reliability and resilience with affordability.\nNow let's cover the financial results for the quarter as shown on Page 6. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2025 earnings of $1.01 per share compared to earnings of $0.97 per share in the second quarter of 2024. The key drivers of these results are outlined on this slide. We continue to expect 2025 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 per share and $5.05 per share. Turning to Page 7.\nI'll provide an update on economic development activities in our region and associated sales growth opportunities. We continue to expect approximately 5.5% compound annual sales growth from '25 through 2029 in Missouri, primarily driven by increased data center demand. We remain engaged with potential data center customers and are building a robust pipeline of large load opportunities that extend well into the next decade. As discussed on our first quarter call in May, we've executed construction agreements with data center developers representing approximately 2.3 gigawatts of future demand with this load expected to begin ramp up in late 2026 and beyond. These developers have demonstrated their confidence in and commitment to their potential projects by submitting nonrefundable payments totaling $28 million towards the cost of necessary transmission upgrades.\nAnd we are actively engaged with potential customers to execute electric service agreements, or ESAs that are aligned with our proposed Missouri large load rate structure and, among other things, would establish anticipated minimum ramp schedules. Like our proposed rate structure, which I'll talk about in a moment, these ESAs will be subject to Missouri PSC approval. In addition, data center developers with existing construction agreements have requested that we study expanding their data center projects, given our competitive power rates and access to desirable construction sites with available transmission interconnection. Of course, in order to support economic opportunities, as we outlined in our preferred resource plan in February, we must quickly accelerate generation portfolio additions to provide the energy and capacity needed to serve these customers.\nOn Page 8, we provide an update on generation resources currently under development at Ameren Missouri and new certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCN, requested from the Missouri PSC. In June, we requested a CCN for the big Hollow Energy Center, which, as proposed will consist of an 800-megawatt simple cycle natural gas energy center and a 400-megawatt battery energy storage facility. Both of these facilities will be located at the site of Ameren's retired Rush Island Energy Center which will reduce construction time and cost for our customers and keep jobs and tax base in the community. Subject to commission approval, we expect the Big Hollow Energy Center will begin serving customers in 2028.\nOur generation development efforts remain on schedule as we work toward achieving targeted in-service dates to proactively manage supply chain risks we've already secured key components with long lead times, such as turbines and transformers for our energy centers with expected in-service dates through 2029. We and we've begun equipment procurement activities for our first natural gas combined cycle energy center. We expect to have purchase commitments in place for turbines and related equipment by the end of this year and for the combined cycle energy center to be serving customers by 2031. It's important to note that the significant investment needed to construct data centers as well as the energy infrastructure needed to support them will create meaningful job growth and tax revenues to support our local economy. In addition to the energy and capacity to serve these large load customers to realize this opportunity, we must also offer attractive rates.\nOn Slide 9, we outlined Ameren Missouri's proposed large load rate structure, which we filed with the Missouri PSC in May. Under the proposed large load rate structure, we would deliver service under our existing large primary service base rate, which is currently approximately $0.06 per kilowatt hour and customers would agree to additional terms and conditions as part of an ESA. The additional terms would include a minimum service term of 15 years, a minimum demand charge of 70% of contracted capacity, customer exit provisions and customer credit and collateral requirements. In addition, new customer programs would be available, allowing customers to advance their clean energy goals [Audio Gap] we would expect a decision by February 2026.\nMoving now to Page 10 for an update on the long-range transmission planning process at MISO. Our focus remains on building the tranche 1 and tranche 2.1 long-range transmission planning projects assigned to us and developing strong proposals for tranche 2.1 long-range transmission planning competitive projects. The bidding and selection process for the $6.5 billion portfolio of competitive projects will take place over this year and next. We are carefully evaluating each bidding opportunity and will submit bids for projects where we believe we offer a clear advantage on project design, cost and execution to deliver value for customers in the MISO region. As we have successfully done in the past, when it enhances the strength and competitiveness of our proposals, we expect to partner with other entities.\nFurther, MISO continues its future scenario redesign efforts, which will incorporate significantly increasing energy demand and updated resource mix assumptions across the region. We expect this analysis to show the need for significant transmission investment in the region, which is expected to be incorporated into later project portfolios in MISO's long-range transmission planning. MISO is now expected to issue its final report outlining 4 scenarios of possible future energy grid conditions in early 2026. We expect this will lead to identification of specific transmission infrastructure investment needs in our region late in 2026.\nMoving to Page 11. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities, which stands today at more than $63 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner and powering economic growth in our communities.\nTurning to Page 12. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2025 through 2029. And we expect to be near the upper end of our guidance range in the mid- to latter part of our 5-year plan. This earnings growth expectation is primarily driven by our sales growth assumptions and strong anticipated compound annual rate base growth of 9.2% and reflecting strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to meet these demands and strengthen the grid in each of our business segments based on their regulatory frameworks. We expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plan and strategy across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to achieve our growth objectives. Again, thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in Ameren.\nI will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2025 earnings of $1.01 per share compared to earnings of $0.97 per share for the second quarter of 2024. The key factors that drove the increase are highlighted by segment on this page. Our investments to strengthen the energy grid and provide more energy resources to serve our customers to continue to be the primary driver of earnings growth across the company. In addition, we continue to experience solid customer growth at Ameren Missouri, where total normalized retail sales over the trailing 12 months through June increased across all customer classes with an overall increase of approximately 1%. Moving to Page 15.\nDue to strong year-to-date performance, we are well positioned to deliver earnings per share in the top half of our 2025 guidance range. Here, we have outlined select earnings considerations for the remainder of the year, including the expected quarterly earnings impact from the constructive resolution of Ameren Missouri's 2024 electric rate review.\nFurther, I'd like to also highlight the Commission approved a unanimous settlement in our Ameren Missouri 2024 gas rate review last month. New rates for our natural gas customers will take effect on September 1. As mentioned, normalized sales in Missouri have remained strong. The strength is particularly evident in the industrial class, with sales up more than 2.5% on a trailing 12-month basis through June. Growth in this sector has been supported primarily by ongoing manufacturing expansions and the continued growth of new digital and communication services firms.\nLooking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect sales growth from a few new small-scale data centers, along with continued strength in the manufacturing sector. We continue to maintain disciplined cost management throughout the company. In the second half of the year, we plan to increase vegetation management set in targeted operating regions to support system reliability and grid resiliency. This is in response to more robust vegetation growth driven by weather conditions experienced this spring and early summer. I encourage you to take these supplemental earnings drivers into consideration as you develop your expectations for quarterly earnings results for the balance of the year.\nNow turning to our financing plan on Page 16. To support our credit ratings and maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our investment plan. In February, we outlined a plan to issue approximately $600 million of common equity each year through 2029. We've effectively fulfilled our equity needs for 2025 and 2026 through forward sales agreements. We feel very good about our financial position and the progress we've made in our equity financing plan. Having utilized most of the capacity available under our existing equity sales distribution program, we expect to increase the program capacity to enable additional sales to support equity needs in 2027 and beyond.\nOn the balance sheet front, Moody's and S&P affirmed our [ BAA1 ] and BBB+ issuer credit ratings, respectively, in their annual credit opinions issued in the second quarter a signal of our ongoing financial strength and stability. On Page 17, we provide an update on federal tax and energy policy enacted in July. Significant [ advocacy ] across the industry helped ensure that federal policies continue to support investment in energy resources nationwide to meet rising energy needs as we work to provide the substantial generation required to serve growing demand energy-related tax credits helped to reduce the cost of these resources for our customers. We expect these credits to provide approximately $1.5 billion of cost savings for our customers from 2025 through 2029. Under the 1 big beautiful Bill Act, we are well positioned to realize all the energy tax credits reflected in our current 5-year plan. Approximately $750 million worth of credits are expected to be generated by wind and solar projects either already in service or planned to be in service by 2027. We also expect to begin construction before the end of the year on battery projects, which we anticipate will generate $250 million of credits. And finally, we expect to begin construction on additional solar projects this year and meet in-service dates for safe harbor to generate the remaining $500 million of credits.\nOn Page 18, we provide a brief update on ongoing regulatory proceedings in Illinois. Our 2024 annual reconciliation proceeding under the electric multiyear rate plan continues to progress. In July, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC staff recommended a reconciliation adjustment of $49 million compared to our updated request of $60 million with the variance primarily driven by treatment of other post-employment benefits. An ICC decision is expected by mid-December and rates reflecting the approved reconciliation adjustment will be affected by January 2026.\nTurning to Page 19. In July, the ICC staff recommended a $103 million annual base rate increase in Ameren Illinois natural gas distribution rate review. The variance from our request for $135 million increase is primarily driven by staff recommendation of a 9.93% return on equity and a 50% common equity ratio. An ICC decision is expected by early December with new rates effective later that month. We also saw regulatory progress in transmission development in July for both Missouri and Illinois as the Missouri PSC and the Illinois Commerce Commission approved CCNs for tranche 1 long-range transition projects. These approvals will allow the construction to begin on schedule in 2026.\nIn summary, turning to Page 20. Our strong performance in the first half of the year has positioned us well to continue executing our strategic plan. which will drive superior value for all of our stakeholders. We continue to expect strong earnings per share growth to be driven by robust rate base growth, disciplined cost management and a strong customer growth pipeline. Our strategy and team are well aligned to capitalize on these opportunities for our customers and shareholders. We believe our growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we had an attractive total shareholder returns. That concludes our prepared remarks.\nWe now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Modeling for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers. .\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Now here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. I will begin on Page 4. At Ameren, we remain steadfastly committed to our strategic plan, which continues to drive value for our customers, communities and shareholders. Our focus is clear: deliver reliable, affordable energy while making prudent investments in energy infrastructure. In the first quarter of 2025, we made great strides. Key energy infrastructure investments are enhancing the reliability and resiliency of the system for our 2.5 million electric customers and more than 900,000 natural gas customers across our service territory, ensuring they have the energy they need when they need it and facilitating economic growth in the communities we serve.\nToday, we'll provide an update on first quarter performance and how execution of our strategic objectives outlined on this slide are translating into tangible benefits for customers, communities and shareholders. Let's get started with details on our financial progress this quarter, which I will cover on Page 5. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2025 earnings of $1.07 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share in the first quarter of 2024. The key drivers of these results are outlined on this slide.\nWe continue to expect 2025 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.85 per share and $5.05 per share. Moving to Page 6. On our call in February, I highlighted some of our top priorities for 2025 as we invest strategically to benefit customers, enhance regulatory frameworks and optimize business processes. The Ameren team's efforts during the first quarter have already begun to yield positive results, as you can see on Page 7.\nStarting off, Ongoing investments continue to improve the reliability, resiliency, safety and efficiency of service for customers while facilitating and contributing to economic growth. And as we look ahead, more will be required. In February, we filed our analysis with the Missouri Public Service Commission, or MoPSC, supporting a change to Ameren Missouri's preferred resource plan which calls for significant investments in dispatchable natural gas and renewable generation resources as well as battery storage to ensure reliable service for our customers over the next decade.\nEnabling such investments requires collaborative efforts among key stakeholders, and we believe regulatory and legislative results this year in Missouri demonstrate a commitment to fostering a constructive environment for investment, which will allow Ameren Missouri to continue to attract capital on favorable terms in order to facilitate economic growth in the state.\nIn April, the Missouri commission approved a constructive settlement in our electric rate review that supports necessary grid reliability investments while also maintaining customer rates that are well below national and Midwest averages. And in April, the Missouri General Assembly and Governor enacted comprehensive energy legislation signaling that investment in the state's utility infrastructure is valued and paving the way for significant economic development within our communities and further job creation.\nWe're excited about the prospects for growth in Missouri and remain committed to creating lasting value for our customers, communities and shareholders through our strategic investments. Before moving on, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to our Ameren team members who work safely and efficiently to reliably serve our customers, especially in extreme weather conditions like the cold wintery conditions we experienced in January and the wet windy, and tornetic conditions we experienced in March.\nAnd it's worth noting that the grid hardening investments we have made in recent years performed exceptionally well, considering the severity of the storms. So far in 2025, we have prevented more than 114,000 customer outages through smart switching during major storms, equivalent to more than 30 million outage minutes avoided. For context, this means that our investments in smart technology have prevented more customer outages this quarter alone than in any full year since we began tracking these statistics in 2021.\nWe continue to focus on optimizing our operations to deliver safe, reliable, resilient and affordable energy to our customers. Now moving to Page 8, where we provide more in terms of the Missouri legislative update.\nIn April, the Governor signed Senate Bill 4, a wide-ranging energy bill into law. This bill includes multiple provisions that will support our ability to continue to meet the needs of our customers and maintain the state as an affordable and attractive place to do business. Some of the key provisions of Senate Bill 4 include expansion and extension of plant and service accounting, or PISA, a modified integrated resource planning, or IRP process, which accelerates generation project review and requires the Missouri Public Service Commission decision, authority for the commission to grant construction work in progress for qualifying generation investments and authority for the commission to approve use of a forward test year for our Missouri natural gas business.\nBy extending PISA for another 7 years through 2035 and expanding PISA to include new natural gas generation, our regulatory framework will continue to support investment in reliable energy for years to come better positioning Ameren Missouri future needs of our customers and communities. Importantly, PISA's extension and expansion and the modified IRP process are expected to help key stakeholders align more quickly on generation needs and provide more certainty around future investment plans, enhancing our speed to deploy new resources for customers and communities.\nTurning to Page 9 for an update on the economic development opportunities. Our team is focused on doing all we can from an energy perspective to facilitate growth in our communities. We serve a diverse regional economy that spans multiple sectors, including manufacturing, aviation and defense, food and beverage and biotechnology, among others.\nIn the first quarter, we successfully supported nearly a dozen projects, which will bring over $700 million of capital investment from these businesses and over 1,000 jobs across both states. In Missouri, we continue to expect approximately 5.5% compound annual sales growth from 2025 through 2029, primarily driven by increasing data center demand.\nFurther supporting our growth opportunities, we now have signed construction agreements with data center developers representing a total of approximately 2.3 gigawatts of future demand, up 500 megawatts from our earnings call in February. These developers have demonstrated their confidence and commitment by submitting nonrefundable payments totaling $26 million towards the cost of necessary transmission upgrades.\nSubject to agreement on rate structure, potential large load customers would sign separate electric service agreements which would specify expected ramp-up schedules among other terms. We continue to expect to file for approval of the proposed rate structure with the MoPSC in the second quarter. While there's no deadline for commission approval, we are optimistic that we'll receive a decision and have an effective rate structure before the end of the year.\nWe're committed to working closely with regulators, customers and stakeholders to ensure we meet the evolving needs in our service territory in a responsible and sustainable manner. Our balanced approach to generation laid out in our IRP ensures reliable service to our customers, while also providing energy to serve rising customer demand and to support economic growth in our communities.\nOn Page 10, we provide a brief update on the 1,200 megawatts of new generation currently under development at Ameren, Missouri. These projects remain on schedule and on budget. Notably, we've executed contracts to acquire all 8 turbines and other long lead time materials needed for our next 2 simple cycle natural gas energy centers expected to be in service in 2027 and 2028.\nFurther, for solar energy centers under construction, including Vandalia, Bowling Green and Split Rail, nearly all imported equipment needed to execute the projects was in the U.S. prior to the April 2 trade tariff announcements, thereby limiting possible exposure to higher costs associated with announced tariffs on materials imported.\nWe continue to monitor the dynamic tariff situation and work diligently to deliver cost-effective energy resources for our customers. Finally, we expect to file additional certificate of convenience and necessity requests with the commission in the coming months with respect to planned investments in gas generation, solar generation and battery storage.\nMoving to Page 11 for an update on MISO's long-range transmission planning portfolios. We're focused on developing proposals for the Tranche 2.1 long-range transmission planning competitive projects. We will evaluate each bidding opportunity carefully and submit bids for projects where we believe we have a competitive advantage with project design, cost and execution to deliver value for customers in the MISO region. The bid process for the $6.5 billion of competitive projects in the portfolio will take place over this year and next.\nFurther, MISO continues its future scenario redesign efforts which consider growing demand for energy and the effects of changing resource planning across the region. We're actively engaged in this analysis with MISO and other transmission owners and expect MISO to issue its final report on the future redesign by the end of the year.\nGiven this time frame, we'd expect work on the identification of Tranche 2.2 projects, which will address further transmission needs in the MISO region to commence as early as December 2025. Moving to Page 12. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of more than $63 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner and powering economic growth in our communities, bringing significant tax base and jobs.\nMoving to Page 13. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2025 through 2029. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong compound annual rate base growth of 9.2%, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our business segments based on their regulatory frameworks. We expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return.\nI'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. Again, thank you all for joining us today and for your continued interest in Ameren. I'll now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2025 earnings of $1.07 per share compared to adjusted earnings of $1.02 per share for the first quarter of 2024. The key factors that drove the increase are highlighted by segment on this page. Our infrastructure investments to strengthen the energy grid and to provide more energy resources to serve our customers continue to be the primary driver of earnings growth across the company.\nFurther, the economic outlook for our service territories remain strong. In fact, over the 12 trailing months ended in March, Ameren Missouri's total weather-normalized retail sales have increased by approximately 3% compared to the year ago period. We've seen continued strategic wins that highlight the strength of our service territory. Notably, Boeing was recently awarded The Next Generation Air Dominance contract by the federal government valued at least $20 billion.\nBoeing's ongoing St. Louis campus expansion to support this contract and other defense work is expected to create a significant number of new jobs and manufacturing work and reaffirms their commitment to the St. Louis community. In addition to aerospace, we're seeing growth in other sectors of our regional economy such as health care, education services and mining.\nTurning to Page 16, I'll provide an update on our 2024 Ameren Missouri's rate review. In April, the Missouri PSC approved a constructive stipulation and agreement for $355 million annual revenue increase. As our fifth consecutive settlement of electric revenue requirements in the state, this agreement continues our strong track record of achieving win-win results for our customers, communities and shareholders. The agreement does not specify certain details, including return on equity, capital structure or rate base.\nThe agreement provides for the continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause. New rates will be effective on June 1. Importantly, new electric rates are expected to remain well below national and Midwest averages.\nMoving to Page 17. As we think about the remainder of the year, we remain confident in our 2025 guidance range and continue to expect earnings to be in the range of $4.85 to $5.05 per share, and we remain focused on delivering at the midpoint or higher. Here, we have provided the expected quarterly earnings impacts from our 2024 Missouri rate review for the remainder of the year. I encourage you to take these supplemental earnings drivers into consideration as you develop your expectations for quarterly earning results for the balance of the year.\nBefore moving on, I want to take a moment to discuss the trade tariffs recently proposed by the current administration. As Marty discussed, we have a robust capital spending plans in 2025 and the years ahead to meet critical customer needs. Our sourcing practices are designed to ensure we have materials where we need them and when we need them at competitive prices.\nIn light of uncertainties associated with the tariffs, we are closely examining potential impacts on our capital budget. However, as we said here today, we expect any impact to be very manageable. We will continue to navigate the developing environment to ensure we remain well positioned to execute on our projects on time and as affordably as possible for our customers.\nTurning to Page 18, we'll provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position and made excellent progress to date on our 2025 financing plan. In March, Ameren Illinois issued $350 million of 5.625% first mortgage bonds due 2055 and Ameren Parent issued $750 million of 5.375% senior unsecured notes due 2035. In April, Ameren Missouri issued $500 million of 5.25% first mortgage bonds due 2035.\nTo date, we have completed over 80% of our debt financings for the year. Also, we continue to systematically layer in hedges to mitigate interest rate exposure with respect to planned future parent debt issuances. Further, in order for us to support our credit ratings and maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund a robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $600 million of common equity in 2025.\nWe have sold forward approximately $535 million of equity under our at-the-market or ATM program, consisting of approximately 5.8 million shares, which we expect to issue near the end of this year. And we expect the remainder of our equity needs for the year to be issued under our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. Having utilized most of the capacity available under our existing equity sales distribution program, we expect to increase the program capacity in the coming months to enable additional sales to support equity needs in 2026 and beyond.\nWe'll continue to be thoughtful about our approach to executing our equity plan. On the balance sheet front, in April, S&P affirmed our BBB+ credit rating, and we expect Moody's to issue its annual credit opinion update later this month. As we said before, we value our current ratings, and we continue to target credit metrics at or above agency published downgrade thresholds.\nOn Page 19, we provide an update on Illinois Regulatory Matters. Earlier this week, Ameren Illinois requested a $61 million revenue adjustment as part of the annual performance-based rate reconciliation proceeding under the electric multiyear rate plan. This adjustment reflects 2024 actual cost, actual year-end rate base and return on equity and common equity ratios established in the multiyear rate plan. And the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, decision is expected by mid-December and rates reflecting the approved reconciliation adjustment will be effective by January 2026.\nBefore moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss the MISO planning resource auction that took place earlier this week for the upcoming June 2025 through May 2026 planning year. Importantly, there are adequate resources able to maintain reliability across all zones and seasons. That said, new capacity additions did not keep pace with reduced accreditation, suspensions and retirements of generation and slightly reduced imports, which resulted in a notable increase in capacity prices for June through August 2025 in all MISO zones.\nThe results reinforce the need to invest in new regional generation capacity as demand is expected to continue to grow with new, large load customer additions and as we expect continued retirement of existing generation. That said, annualized capacity pricing for Zone 5 located in Missouri moderated since the prior year's auction, due in part to its strategic infrastructure investments in the energy grids transmission capabilities and generation resources.\nChanges in energy and capacity prices do not materially affect our earnings for Ameren Missouri or Ameren Illinois as they're passed on to customers with no markup. In Zone 4, some of our Ameren Illinois customers will see increases in the energy supply component of their bill for the summer months. That will ultimately depend on if they are taking supply services from Ameren Illinois or the terms of their contract with another supplier.\nNotably, we would expect prices to return to pre-auction levels in October. We remain actively engaged in discussions with key stakeholders to develop long-term solutions to benefit of our Illinois customers by ensuring system reliability, promoting regional generation development and maintaining affordability while supporting the transition to cleaner energy in the state. We will continue to support our customers and communities by connecting them with bill assistance programs and resources where needed.\nTurning to Page 20. Our Illinois natural gas review remains in progress with intermediary and direct testimony expected next week. An ICC decision is expected by early December, with new rates effective later that month. In summary, turning to Page 21, we're off to a strong start in 2025, and we're well positioned to continue executing our strategic plan, which will drive consistent superior value for all of our stakeholders.\nWe continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth, disciplined cost management and a strong customer growth pipeline. As we said before, we have the right strategy, the right team and the right culture to capitalize on these opportunities and to create value for our customers and our shareholders. We believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Further, [ Ameren continued ] to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Senior Director, Investor Relations and Corporate Modeling for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team.\nThis call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nNow here's Marty.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we will discuss 2024 financial results, recap events and accomplishments and look ahead to 2025 and beyond. What you'll hear is that the Ameren team's collective efforts produced strong results operationally and financially in 2024. And just as important, the team accomplished strategic goals that position our company to provide higher levels of satisfaction for our customers and strong returns for our shareholders in the years ahead.\nIn 2025, we are again set up to deliver strong results but also to take meaningful steps towards enabling our communities to benefit from significant economic development opportunities. Those opportunities offer direct investment in our states, bringing jobs and incremental tax revenue.\nAnd for Ameren, as we discuss our plans today, it means sales growth and the need to accelerate capital investments to meet the energy needs driven by that industrial demand.\nStarting on Page 4. We continue to be guided by our 3-pillar strategy: to invest in rate-regulated infrastructure, to enhance regulatory frameworks, and advocate for responsible energy policy and optimize our operating performance. This strategy has served us well for the last decade, and we will remain focused on solid execution year in and year out to maximize value for our customers, communities and shareholders.\nWith that, let me summarize our 2024 performance on Page 5. I'm pleased to say that we accomplished all our key business objectives outlined at this time last year and on this page. Importantly, we strategically invested approximately $4.3 billion in energy infrastructure, secured timely regulatory approvals for future investment and prudently managed our operating costs while delivering reliable energy service.\nAnd yesterday, we announced 2024 adjusted earnings of $4.63 per share compared to earnings of $4.38 per share in 2023. This result was above our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance midpoint.\nTurning to Page 6, which highlights the benefits of the investments we are making for our customers. The successful execution of our strategy continues to drive improved reliability and strong customer service while keeping customer rates low in comparison to the national and Midwest averages. Further, our ongoing infrastructure investments improve grid resilience as demonstrated by the performance of our system during severe winter storms in early January of this year.\nDespite challenging conditions, our grid improvements prevented over 3.5 million minutes of potential outage time across our service territories in Missouri and Illinois. Importantly, we had no issues on the more than 250 miles of power lines that have already been updated through Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy Plan.\nOn Page 7, we summarize our strong performance for shareholders over time. Our goal, like we said in the past, is to deliver at the midpoint or higher within our earnings guidance range. Our weather-normalized adjusted earnings per share have risen at an approximate 7.6% compound annual growth rate since 2013, while our annual dividends paid per share have increased approximately 68%. This has driven a strong total return of nearly 250% for our shareholders over the same period, which was significantly above utility index averages.\nMoving to Page 8. As we look to the opportunities ahead, in 2025, our focus will be on continuing to provide safe, reliable service to our customers at competitive rates while bringing additional growth opportunities to our states. We'll do this, first and foremost, by investing approximately $4.2 billion in electric, natural gas and transmission infrastructure to bolster the safety, security, reliability and responsiveness of the energy grid.\nFurther, we're focused on enhancing our generation plans to meet customers' needs, achieving constructive regulatory outcomes and advocating for policies that enhance reliability and resource adequacy as well as attracting new businesses to our communities. As always, while we work to accomplish these objectives, we will remain focused on operating as efficiently and effectively as possible.\nMoving to Page 9 for an update on our long-term growth outlook. We continue to extract 2025 earnings to be in a range of $4.85 per share to $5.05 per share. The midpoint of this range represents approximately 7% earnings per share growth compared to our adjusted 2024 earnings results. Building on the execution of our strategy and track record of strong earnings growth, we expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2025 through 2029, using the midpoint of our 2025 guidance of $4.95 per share as the base.\nWe're excited about the robust sales growth and energy infrastructure investment opportunities in front of us, which strengthen our confidence in our ability to deliver strong long-term earnings growth. I'll speak more about those things in a moment.\nIn addition to growing earnings per share, last week, Ameren's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of approximately 6%, resulting in an annualized dividend rate of $2.84 per share. This represents our 12th consecutive year of increasing our dividend, which reflects continued confidence by Ameren's Board of Directors in our business outlook and management's ability to execute our strategy.\nLooking ahead, we expect to grow our dividend in line with our long-term earnings per share growth expectations and for our dividend payout ratio to range from 55% to 65% of earnings per share. Combined, these elements support our strong total shareholder return proposition.\nTurning to Page 10 for more on the foundation of our earnings outlook. Our strong long-term earnings growth expectation is driven by robust rate base growth, reflecting investment in energy infrastructure, included in Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy Plan, which incorporates its preferred resource plan, Ameren Illinois's Multiyear Rate Plan and projects awarded to Ameren and MISO's long-range transmission planning.\nToday, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base at a 9.2% compound annual rate from 2024 through 2029. This robust rate base growth is driven by a 20% increase in our 5-year capital plan compared to the previous capital plan laid out last February, primarily reflecting accelerated generation needed to serve our updated sales growth expectations.\nNow turning to Page 11 for more detail on the growth opportunities in Missouri driving the significant increase in our capital plan. We expect tremendous opportunities for economic growth over the next 5 to 7 years. Our region economy spans multiple sectors from aviation, biotechnology, chemicals, financial services, beverage and food manufacturing, life and plant sciences to health care and logistics and a variety of other manufacturing concerns. And increasingly, it is an attractive location for data centers.\nBased on our robust economic development pipeline, we are now expecting our weather-normalized retail sales to increase approximately 5.5% compounded annually from 2025 through 2029, compared to our prior plan expectations of flat to up 0.5%. This sales growth expectation is consistent with the notice we filed with the Missouri Public Service Commission of our intention to update our preferred resource plan. That plan assumes approximately 500 megawatts of load growth by the end of 2027, a total of 1 gigawatt by the end of 2029 and 1.5 gigawatts by the end of 2032.\nSince our third quarter earnings call, we have signed additional construction agreements with data center developers for 1.5 gigawatts of new load to be interconnected to our transmission system, bringing our total to approximately 1.8 gigawatts. These construction agreements are subject to acceptance of a modified industrial tariff under which new customers would receive energy service. Earlier this week, we submitted the necessary transmission load request related to these agreements to MISO for expedited project review and expect approval in April.\nFurther, we are actively working to propose a modified tariff for large industrial customers, including data center customers, and we expect to file for approval of the tariff with the Missouri Public Service Commission by the second quarter. While there's no deadline for commission approval, we are optimistic we'd receive a decision and that the tariff would be in effect before the end of the year. We remain aligned with key stakeholders across the state in our efforts to attract new businesses to the region.\nOur economic development pipeline beyond our current construction agreements remains robust and we will continue to pursue each opportunity vigorously to maximize value for our customers and communities.\nAs the green shading on our slide indicates, a range of sales growth outcomes could ultimately occur. But based on our planned generation resource build out, we expect to have the capacity to serve 2 gigawatts of new demand by 2032 and even more thereafter.\nMoving then to Page 12 for an update on Missouri's generation plans. Considering the significant sales growth potential, the lead time needed to construct new generation and other key considerations, Ameren Missouri notified the Missouri PSC that we are changing the preferred resource plan in our September 2023 IRP, which lays out generation -- our generation plan for the next 20 years.\nAs mentioned, our new preferred plan is designed to serve 1.5 gigawatts of additional demand by 2032. And as I mentioned, it provides for a range of outcomes. The key objectives of our resource planning remain the same: a balanced mix of resources to provide reliable, lowest cost and cleaner energy for our customers. Our preferred plan calls for acceleration and expansion of natural gas generation and battery storage, acceleration of solar generation investment, potential extension of the life of our [indiscernible] Energy Center by up to 3 years and investment in additional nuclear generation by 2040.\nIn total, the change in preferred plan represents the addition of 2.3 gigawatts of generation capacity by 2035 and when factoring in updated costs for all planned resources, represents approximately $7 billion of increased investment by 2035 compared to the 2023 IRP. Our execution of this investment plan will lay the foundation for reliable economic expansion in Missouri. For further details on the differences between the preferred resource plan from the 2023 IRP and new 2025 Preferred Resource Plan C Page 31 of this presentation.\nTurning to Page 13 for an update on the new generation recently placed in service or under development. This past year was just a start to the robust generation portfolio additions. 3 new solar facilities totaling 500 megawatts and representing approximately $1 billion of investment were placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2024 as planned. Combined, the 3 facilities are expected to generate energy sufficient to power 92,000 homes annually, and we continue to execute our IRP. We have another 1,200 megawatts of approved generation currently under construction. And we expect to file a request with the Missouri PSC for approval of additional generation and battery energy storage in the coming months.\nMoving now to Page 14 for a transmission update. In December, MISO approved a nearly $22 billion Tranche 2.1 portfolio, which is expected to provide significant reliability and capacity benefits for the region. MISO has already selected Ameren to lead $1.3 billion worth of these critical grid infrastructure projects in Missouri and Illinois. The portfolio also includes $6.5 billion of projects, which will be open for competitive bid, of which approximately $1.8 billion are in Illinois. We believe we are well positioned to compete for all these opportunities as we have a strong track record of developing and operating cost-effective and high-quality transmission infrastructure.\nMISO and its transmission owners will continue to assess the current long-range transmission future scenarios to support our region's energy needs in the years ahead. This analysis is expected to be followed by development of the Tranche 2.2 project portfolio.\nMoving to Page 15 for a legislative update. In January, the Missouri legislative session began. Several bills are currently under consideration, including the Power Predictability and Reliability Act, the Missouri First Transmission Act, proposed modifications to integrated resource planning and the opportunity for future test year regulatory frameworks for natural gas and water utilities.\nWhile these bills are at various stages in the legislative process, they collectively demonstrate Missouri's commitment to enabling a reliable and efficient energy future and supporting economic growth and job creation within our communities. Ameren will remain actively engaged with policymakers and key stakeholders in the months ahead to advocate for constructive energy policy.\nTurning to Page 16 for an update on our 10-year investment pipeline. Looking ahead, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $63 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid more reliable, stronger and smarter. In addition, these investments will support many thousands of jobs within our local economies. Of course, constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure will be critical to meeting our region's energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nTurning now to Page 17, to sum up our value proposition. We remain convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2025 and beyond will continue to deliver superior value to our customers and shareholders. Our earnings growth expectations are driven by strong compound annual rate base growth of 9.2% and strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our business segments based on their regulatory frameworks.\nInvestment in Ameren presents an attractive opportunity for those seeking a high-quality utility growth story. Combined, our strong long-term 6% to 8% earnings growth plan in an attractive and growing dividend results in a compelling total return story. Further, we have a strong track record of execution and an experienced management team. I'm confident in Ameren's team's ability to execute our investment plans and other elements of our strategy across all 4 of our business segments.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Page 19 of our presentation with our 2024 earnings results. Yesterday, we reported 2024 adjusted earnings of $4.63 per share, compared to earnings of $4.38 per share in 2023. Our 2024 earnings exclude 2 charges totaling $0.21 per share. The first is related to the NSR settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri for the Rush Island Energy Center. The second is related to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's order on base return on equity.\nOn Page 20, we summarize key drivers impacting adjusted earnings at each segment. Our strong 2024 adjusted earnings results were largely driven by our strategic infrastructure investments. In addition, weather-normalized retail sales grew approximately 2% across Ameren Missouri, with 2%, 1.5% and 3% growth in our residential, commercial and industrial classes, respectively. Notably, industrial sales continue to remain robust, driven largely by growth from customers in the manufacturing and technology sectors.\nThis year's sales growth reflects the strong economy across our service territory, which will serve as a solid foundation for future potential growth. Our focus remains on balancing necessary investments with prudent cost management to support both system reliability and customer affordability.\nAt the beginning of last year, we set an ambitious goal to hold O&M expenses flat given the importance of cost control and managing customer rate impacts. I'm proud to report that we've made significant strides in this area. Importantly, at Ameren Missouri, when excluding the onetime NSR charge, all in O&M expenses were down $12 million year-over-year.\nAs we navigate the current economic landscape, we expect our proactive cost management and strategic investments will continue to drive operational efficiencies and keep our customer rates below the national and the Midwest averages.\nMoving to Page 21 to cover regulatory progress made in the fourth quarter. In December, the Missouri PSC staff recommended a $398 million annual revenue increase in our 2024 Ameren Missouri electric rate review. The difference between our request of $446 million and staff's recommendation is primarily driven by staff's proposed return on equity of 9.74% versus our request of 10.25% and treatment of high priority Energy Center, partially offset by estimated off-season sales and fuel costs, which will be subject to true-up in regulatory recovery mechanisms. The equity ratio will be updated to use the capital structure as of December 31, 2024.\n[indiscernible] true-up direct testimony will be available later today. As we have in the past, we will seek to work through these and other differences with interveners over the coming weeks. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in mid-March and the decision for the Missouri PSC is expected by May, with new rates effective by June 1.\nTurning to Page 22 for an update on our regulatory proceedings in Illinois. In December, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, issued orders in 2 of our pending Illinois rate reviews. The ICC approved our revised grid plan and the corresponding Multi-Year Rate Plan, or MYRP for 2024 through 2027 for a cumulative revenue increase of $309 million versus our request for an increase of $332 million. These annual revenues reflect our recoverable costs, average rate base of $4.8 billion by 2027, and as anticipated, no change in the 8.72% return on equity.\nInvestments in the energy grid under this multiyear plan is expected to preserve safety, reliability and the day-to-day operations of our system while also making progress towards the clean energy transition. We're pleased to have an ICC approved grid plan through 2027, which provides clarity on the work ahead.\nIn addition, the ICC approved our request for $158 million reconciliation adjustment in the final electric distribution reconciliation of 2023's revenue requirement. The full amount will be collected from customers in 2025 replacing the prior reconciliation adjustment of $110 million that was collected during 2024. New rates from the 2023 reconciliation in 2024 through 2027 MYRP were affected at the end of last year.\nMoving now to Page 23 for an update on the Illinois gas regulatory matters. In January, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas Distribution requested $140 million annual base rate increase based on a 10.7% return on equity, a 52% equity ratio and a $3.3 billion average rate base during our future 2026 test year. An ICC decision is required by early December, with rates expected to be effective in December 2025.\nTurning to Page 24. We look ahead to our company-wide capital plan for the next 5 years. Here, we provide an overview of our $26.3 billion of planned capital expenditures for 2025 through 2029, by business segment, which support our consolidated 9.2% compound annual rate base growth expectations.\nAs Marty highlighted, we have a robust capital investment opportunities ahead of us. The 5-year infrastructure investment plan we are releasing today represents a 20% increase over our investment plan issued last year. This increase includes additional generation reflected in the Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan including the new preferred resource plan and the Ameren Illinois MYRP order. As you can see on the right side of this page, we are continuing to allocate capital consistent with the a lot of return on equity under each regulatory framework.\nPage 32 in the appendix of this presentation provides a summary of the Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan, now filed with the Missouri PSC, which outlines CapEx by year over the next 5 years.\nTurning to Page 25. Here, we outlined the expected funding sources for the investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. From a tax perspective, we expect to generate significant tax deferrals, driven primarily by the timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. We will continue to advocate, along with others in our industry, to retain clean energy tax credits for the benefit of our customers.\nFrom a financing perspective, we expect to continue to see long-term debt to fund a portion of our cash requirements. To maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust investment plan, we expect to issue approximately $600 million of equity each year from 2025 through 2029, a portion of which we expect to be issued through our dividend and reinvestment and employee benefit plans. These actions are expected to maintain our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.\nTurning to Page 26 for further details on our 2025 financing plan. To fund a portion of the $4.2 billion of investment in 2025, we expect debt issuances totaling $500 million, $650 million and $750 million in Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and Ameren Parent, respectively. In addition, as of today, we've entered into forward sales agreements for $265 million of common stock issuances under our at-the-market equity distribution program to address a portion of our 2025 equity needs. We expect to settle these by the end of the year.\nMoving to Page 27 of our presentation for our 2025 earnings guidance. Today, we are affirming our 2025 diluted earnings per share guidance range of $4.85 per share to $5.05 per share, the midpoint of which represents approximately 7% growth compared to our 2024 adjusted earnings results. These earnings drivers are summarized on this page and remain largely consistent with those discussed on our third quarter earnings call. We expect our disciplined cost management to hold operations and maintenance expenses to around a 1% compound annual growth rate over the 5-year plan.\nFinally, turning to Page 28. We remain confident and excited in our long-term strategy, which we expect will continue to drive consistent superior value for all of our stakeholders. We have strong investment opportunities that benefit our customers and attract and support new business. We expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth, disciplined cost management and a strong customer growth pipeline.\nAs we said before, we have the right strategy, the right team and the right culture to capitalize on opportunities, to create value for our customers and shareholders. We believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Modeling for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Now here is Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to have you joining us today as we cover our second quarter 2024 earnings results and recent developments across our business segments.\nOverall, it was a very productive and positive quarter, as always, our dedicated and experienced management team remain laser-focused on executing our strategic plan, positioning us well to take advantage of future opportunities to drive significant value for our customers and shareholders. Speaking of opportunities, I'm tremendously excited about the investment opportunities ahead for us in this dynamic period for the utility industry. In my 20-plus years with the company, our economic development and sales growth pipeline is the most robust I have seen, which I'll touch on more in a moment.\nFirst, let me cover our earnings and operations results for the second quarter. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2024 earnings of $0.97 per share compared to earnings of $0.90 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Key drivers of these strong results are highlighted on this page. And for the first 6 months of the year, our results have been solid, driven by infrastructure investments made for the benefit of our customers, encouraging weather-normalized retail sales and disciplined cost control. We remain on track to deliver earnings within our guidance range of $4.52 per share and $4.72 per share.\nTurning to Page 5. Our strategic plan is designed to deliver on our steadfast commitment to providing safe and reliable energy in a sustainable manner. We do this by investing in rate regulated infrastructure, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy policies, while optimizing operating performance through our ongoing continuous improvement in order to keep rates affordable. I'd like to express appreciation for my Ameren coworkers unwavering commitment to our strategy.\nOn Page 6, we highlight our key accomplishments in the second quarter as we execute our strategy to deliver on our 2024 objectives. The strategic infrastructure investments we have made in the first 6 months of the year are designed to maintain the safety and reliability of the energy grid to modernize the grid and to harden against more frequent severe weather events. Over Memorial Day weekend, severe thunderstorms swept through Missouri and Illinois, bringing strong wins, flooding and golf ball-sized hail, as always, our teams quickly and safely assess the damage, cleared trees and worked long hours to make repairs to restore power as quickly as possible, allowing critical infrastructure to continue operations businesses to remain open in homes to stay cool and safe. But even better during the first half of 2024, over 22,000 Missouri and 11,000 Illinois customer outages were prevented during storms due to rapid detection, rerouting and restoration of power by automated switches across our system and over 6.4 million minutes of customer outages across both states were avoided due to investments to modernize the grid.\nAs we look ahead to future investment for the benefit of our customers, it's important to operate on a constructive regulatory jurisdiction and legislative policies. This quarter, we've made significant regulatory advancements which Michael and I will cover in more depth on the coming slides. At Ameren Missouri, our largest business segment, we continue to make regulatory progress with the Missouri Public Service Commission for new solar and natural gas generation which supports our integrated resource plan. Our Cast County Solar project was approved in June and is expected to be 1 of 3 solar projects placed in service this year, which collectively, along with [ Huckfan ] and Boomtown represent an investment of approximately $1 billion. The commission also approved a constructive order for the securitization of costs associated with our Rush Island Energy Center in connection with its retirement in October of this year. And finally, regarding generation updates. In June, we filed the CCN with the Missouri PSC for our dispatchable Castle Bluff Energy Center. Overall, we continue to make significant progress on our smart energy plan in Missouri, a combination of distribution, transmission and generation projects to bolster reliability and empower our customers. In late June, Ameren Missouri filed its electric rate review request with the commission, which is substantially driven by infrastructure improvements made under this plan. If approved, Ameren Missouri customer rates would still remain well below national and Midwest averages.\nTurning to transmission. The Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, or MISO's long-range transmission plan continues to evolve. In April, MISO concluded the bid evaluation process for the Tranche 1 competitive projects in our service territory. Ultimately, awarding all three competitive projects to Ameren, and they continue to develop the $23 billion to $27 billion tranche 2.1 project portfolio which promises Meaningful brownfield and greenfield investment opportunities within our service territory. Finally, in Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued an order on the rehearing of Ameren Illinois' multiyear rate plan for '24 through 2027. Importantly, the order supports our planned base level of grid reliability investment that was reflected in our 2024 earnings guidance. Further, the ICC order reflects 94% of the rate base in our ongoing multiyear rate plan proceeding. We look forward to an ICC decision on the multiyear grid investment and rate plans by the end of this year. In addition to these significant regulatory advancements, we have seen strong operational performance across the business with a focus on delivering safe, reliable, affordable energy service through enhanced automation, optimization and standardization, which Michael will cover in more detail.\nMoving now to Page 7 for an update on our expanding customer growth opportunities. On the first quarter call, we touched on economic development opportunities in our service territory. Since then, collectively, across Ameren Missouri and Illinois, we have seen a significant increase in the number of data center inquiries and formal engineering reviews underway, which combined would represent thousands of megawatts of additional demand. Our teams, along with a variety of stakeholders are working aggressively to attract these and manufacturing and other economic development opportunities to our service stores. Of course, Ameren has a strong track record of reliable infrastructure development, and we have the people, resources, expertise and partnerships needed to go after these opportunities. Further, our Missouri and Illinois territories offer an attractive value proposition for commercial and industrial customers. This includes sites with transmission, fiber and water access, coupled with competitive rates and tax incentives. In Missouri, we also have reliable generation with a growing portfolio of clean and dispatchable assets and the ability to expand in order to serve these economic development opportunities. So far this year, a construction agreement has been executed for a 250-megawatt data center, which would represent an approximate 40% and 5% annualized increase to Ameren Missouri's industrial megawatt hour sales and total megawatt hour sales, respectively, upon completion and full ramp up. Our construction to extend transmission and distribution services to support this data center is expected to be completed in December of 2025, with the customer ramping up operations from 2026 through 2028. In addition, we've received expansion commitments or executed new contracts for over 85 megawatts of additional load for manufacturing, smaller data centers and other industries across both states. We would expect these new and expanding customers to be fully ramped up by 2028 with sufficient generation to serve them, creating value for all customers over time.\nWe're excited about these opportunities, which will be in jobs and additional tax base to benefit our state and local communities. Importantly, the new data center and other customer commitments were not reflected in the weather-normalized sales expectations included in our 5-year earnings per share growth guidance issued in February. Of course, the ultimate net impact of any incremental load will be dependent upon a variety of factors, including customer ramp-up time, additional generation investment needs, timing of rate reviews and tariff structures. To that end, we currently expect to update our Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, by February 2025, following a careful evaluation of potential load growth and our planned generation portfolio. And we will work with all stakeholders to bring the economic benefits of these customer expansion opportunities to all customers, our communities and shareholders.\nTurning to Page 8. We continue to execute our Missouri IRP, which focuses on maintaining and building a diverse generation portfolio to ensure a reliable, low-cost and cleaner mix of energy resources to serve our customer needs. We had two key developments this quarter. First, in June, the Missouri PSC approved the CCN for the 150-megawatt Cast County Solar facility which is expected to begin serving customers in the fourth quarter of this year. This facility will serve business customers who subscribe through our renewable energy solutions program to receive all or part of their energy needs from renewables. The Missouri PSC approval followed a successful auction held in May where customers across Missouri signed up to take part in the renewable energy solutions program expansion. Demand remains strong for programs that bring businesses ready-made solutions to help them reach their sustainability goals. Second, in June, we also filed a CCN with the Missouri PSC for our Castle Bluff Energy Center, an on-demand 800-megawatt natural gas simple-cycle facility to serve as a reliable backup source of energy ready to operate on the most extreme winter nights and summer days. Castle Bluff, subject to commission approval represents an approximately $900 million investment and is expected to be in service by the end of 2027.\nMoving now to Page 9 for an update on the MISO long-range transmission projects. MISO and its transmission owners continue to engage in economic analysis of the tranche 2 proposed set of projects. In June, an initial set of tranche 2 projects now referred to as Tranche 2.1 were proposed with a cost estimate of $23 billion to $27 billion. The portfolio identifies a need for a mix of brownfield and greenfield transmission lines of varying voltage levels and new or improved substations in both our Missouri and Illinois service territories. Ultimately, we won 100% of the Tranche 1 projects in our service territories, reflecting our ability to deliver timely, cost-effective, high-value products to our communities. We expect we'll be able to compete for Tranche 2 greenfield projects in a similarly competitive manner to better serve our customer. MISO expects to approve the Tranche 2.1 projects by the end of the year. Once approved, MISO plans to propose a second set of tranche projects or tranche 2.2 2025 to address further transmission needs in the North and Midwest regions.\nTurning to Page 10. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of well over $55 billion that will deliver significant value to our stakeholders and create thousands of jobs for our local economies. In addition, we see several tailwinds forming across our business segments. Specifically, we are seeing significant sales growth potential, which I discussed a few moments ago, and this may require us to reassess our Ameren Missouri IRP and and further expand our generation investment pipeline. We're seeing a growing focus amongst Missouri stakeholders on generation planning and reliability, and we see a strong need to embrace enhanced reliability-focused policies in legislative sessions to come. Further, MISO's analysis of transmission needs in the Midwest region will likely identify additional opportunities to improve the ability to move electricity across the region. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and to maintain reliability while transitioning to a cleaner energy future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's growing energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nMoving to Page 11. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2024 through 2028. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong compound annual rate base growth of 8.2% and supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our business segments based on their regulatory frameworks. Investment in Ameren presents an attractive opportunity for those seeking a high-quality utility growth story. Combined, our strong long-term 6% to 8% earnings growth plan and an attractive and growing dividend, which today yields 3.4%, result in a compelling total return story. We have a strong track record of execution, a strong balance sheet and an experienced management team. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all four of our business segments, Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I'll now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin on Page 13 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2024 earnings of $0.97 per share compared to $0.90 per share for the year ago quarter. We delivered strong earnings performance during the quarter, driven primarily by strategic infrastructure investments and disciplined cost management. While earnings saw a strong benefit from favorable weather, we also continue to see encouraging levels of customer growth and energy usage. Further, through disciplined cost controls, operations and maintenance expenses company-wide were flat for the quarter when excluding the impacts from nonrecurring items as part of the 2023 Ameren Missouri rate order. Additional factors that contribute to the overall $0.07 per share increase are highlighted on this page. Year-to-date results are outlined on Page 24 of today's presentation. Notably, year-to-date 2024, we've experienced strong weather-normalized industrial sales growth of 3% as compared to the prior year period. This has been driven primarily by significant growth from our existing large primary service customers in the digital and data analytics industry. We expect to see continued growth as we bring on new customers and support existing customers' expansions in the coming years. Further, we continue to see strong weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales growth across all rate classes in Missouri.\nMoving to Page 14. As we think about the remainder of the year, we remain confident in our 2024 earnings guidance range and continue to expect earnings to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.72 per share. The warmer spring and early summer temperatures experienced this quarter offset the mild first quarter as we are flat year-to-date for weather. In addition, as we outlined in our first quarter call, we expect to see meaningful year-over-year O&M reductions in the second half of the year, reflecting several cost savings initiatives implemented in 2024, the benefits of which continued to build throughout the year. I encourage you to take these and other supplemental earnings drivers noted on the slide into consideration as you develop your expectations for quarterly earning results for the remainder of the year.\nMoving to Page 15, in Ameren Missouri regulatory matters. In June, the Missouri PSC approved a securitization of approximately $470 million of costs associated with the scheduled retirement of our Rush Island Energy Center on October 15. We expect the difference between our original ask of $519 million and the final order to be reflected in future rate proceedings.\nTurning to Page 16. In late June, Ameren Missouri filed for a $446 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri PSC. 90% This request is driven by increased capital investment under Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan to recover investments in major upgrades to the electrical system and investments in generation. The request includes a 10.25% return on equity, a 52% equity ratio a December 31, 2024 estimated rate base of $14 billion. We expect a decision from the Missouri PSC by May 2025 with new rates affected by June of next year.\nTurning to Ameren Illinois on Page 17. Under Illinois formula ratemaking, which expired at the end of 2023, Ameren Ilinois was required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and to true-up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. For the final electric distribution reconciliation of 2023's revenue requirement, in July, the ICC staff recommended a $157 million base rate increase compared to our updated request of $158 million. The full amount would be collected from customers in 2025, replacing the prior reconciliation adjustment of $110 million that is being collected during 2024. This will result in a net customer impact of $48 million or an approximately 1.5% increase in the total average residential customer bill. The ICC will review this matter in the months ahead. With a decision expected by December of this year and new rates effective early next year.\nTurning to Page 18 for an update on the multiyear rate plan covering 2024 through 2027. We are pleased to receive a constructive decision from the ICC in the rehearing of our multiyear rate plan. Recall in January, the ICC upon approving our rehearing request had ordered that we identify a base level of investment needed to adequately operate the grid safely. In June, after extensive stakeholder engagement and additional analysis provided by our team, the ICC approved a $285 million cumulative revenue increase from 2023, representing approximately 94% of our rehearing request and a 1% average residential bill increase for 2024. Excluding OPEB, the order represents approximately 99% of our rehearing rate base request and also 96% of the rate base included in the revised multiyear rate plan, which will be reviewed by the commission later this year. Interim rates for this order were effective in late June and will remain in effect until superseded by a revised NYRP order. The [indiscernible] was a positive first step in getting a base level grid investment approved. However, there is still much work to be done in the State of Illinois to achieve the objectives laid out in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act passed in 2021. Approval of our revised multiyear grid plan and rate plan will allow us to appropriately invest more in the energy grid to preserve safety, reliability and day-to-day operations of our system. And make progress towards an affordable, equitable clean energy transition. In July, the ICC staff recommended a cumulative revenue increase of $302 million versus our July 2024 updated request of $334 million. with the variance driven primarily by the renewal of OPEB and certain capital projects from rate base. Annual revenues will be based on actual recoverable costs year-end rate base and a return on equity adjusted for any performance incentives or penalties provided they do not exceed 105% of the approved revenue requirement. Lastly, with the narrowing of remaining issues, cross examination was weighed for hearings earlier this week, and we expect an ICC decision by December with rates effective January 1, 2021.\nMoving to Page 19. We provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. Our Ameren parent credit ratings of Baa1 and BBB+ at Moody's and S&P, respectively, compare favorably to the peer average, providing us with financial flexibility. To maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund a robust infrastructure plan we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity in 2024. By the end of 2023, we had sold forward approximately $230 million of this $300 million through the at-the-market or ATM program consisting of approximately 2.9 million shares, which we expect to issue by the end of this year. Together with the issuance under our 401(k) and DRIP programs, our ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs in 2024.\nTurning to Page 20. Ameren continuously strives to find ways to work more efficiently to reduce costs for our customers. At the start of the year, we instituted several cost savings initiatives, including a detailed review of all hiring with a focus on spans and layers, reducing some of our contractor and consultant workforce. And deferring or eliminating discretionary spending while we identified further opportunities for sustainable cost reductions. Since then, we have enhanced our continuous improvement in disciplined cost management efforts through numerous customer affordability initiatives that will provide greater collaboration and coordination across our business. Through company-wide automation, standardization and optimization, we are streamlining processes, leveraging shared capabilities and eliminating redundant work to provide sustainable cost savings. Our leadership team is committed to prudently managing costs on behalf of our customers, while providing quality service and reliability.\nTurning to Page 21. We're off to a solid start in the first half of the year and expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2024 as we continue to successfully execute our comprehensive business strategy. We continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. As Marty mentioned, we see several tailwinds forming in the months and years ahead. We have the right strategy, team and opportunities to create value for our customers and our shareholders. We believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Modeling for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk you may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team.\nThis call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers. As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nNow here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2024 earnings results. Our team continues to successfully execute on our strategic plan across all of our business segments, allowing us to deliver for our customers, shareholders and the environment, while laying a strong foundation for the future.\nTurning now to Page 5. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2024 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to earnings of $1 per share in the first quarter of 2023. The key drivers of our first quarter results are outlined on this slide. Overall, our operating performance was strong during the quarter. We had periods of extreme cold weather in January and our natural gas and electric systems and our operating teams performed well. On balance, however, weather was mild during the quarter, marked by unseasonably warm temperatures in February and March.\nDespite the mild temperatures, our retail sales grew driven by encouraging signs of customer growth and usage. While we experienced higher operations and maintenance expenses, that was driven largely by a charge for proposed additional mitigation relief related to the Rush Island Energy Center New Source Review litigation. Despite the year-to-date weather headwinds and the Rush Island charge, our team is taking steps to contain spend, and we remain on track to deliver within our 2024 earnings guidance range of $4.52 per share to $4.72 per share. I'll add an update on our Rush Island Energy Center proceedings, and Michael will cover the first quarter and balance of the year earnings results in a bit more detail later.\nMoving to Page 6. On our call in February, I highlighted some of our top priorities for 2024 as we invest strategically, enhance our operating jurisdictions and optimize our business processes. Our team's unwavering commitment to these objectives has already begun to produce results, as you can see on Page 7. Our investments continue to improve the reliability, resiliency, safety and efficiency of our service to our customers. In the first 3 months of this year, we have invested significant capital for the benefit of our customers. During the quarter, Ameren Missouri installed over 55,000 smart meters, 60 smart switches, [ 15 ] miles of energized underground cable, 8 miles of hardened overhead lines and upgraded 5 substations. In Illinois, our first quarter investments included replacing 550 poles due to standard inspections and storm damage, replacing switchgear at a key substation and installing 30 miles of underground cable for relocations, new customers and aged cable replacement.\nFurther, our transmission business is on track to complete over 15 new or upgraded transmission substations and 45 miles of new or upgraded transmission lines in the first half of the year. The critical investments support our commitment to delivering safe and reliable energy for the benefit of our customers and we are seeing the benefit in 2024 in terms of reduced outages and shorter outage durations as a result of spring storms.\nFor example, during the recent [ storm ], over 7,500 Missouri customer outages were prevented due to rapid detection, rerouting and restoration of power by automated switches across our system in over 2.3 million minutes of customer outages were avoided due to these investments.\nMoving on to first quarter regulatory and legislative outcomes. In March, Ameren Missouri received Missouri PSC approval of our largest-ever solar investment, 3 projects representing a total of 400 megawatts capable of powering [ similarly ] 73,000 homes. The approval of certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCN, for these projects is another constructive step along the pathway to executing our Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP. On the legislative front, the Missouri General Assembly is addressing power quality and reliability by considering bills to enhance and extend the current plant-in-service accounting, or PISA, legislation that would support investment in dispatchable resources and reliability. PISA has supported much needed reliability investments in the state's energy grid over the past 5 years.\nWhile these bills, House bill 1746 and Senate bills 740 and 1422, have strong bipartisan support, time is short [ in the ] general assembly session ends Friday, May 17. While the legislature has many priorities, we will continue to work with key stakeholders towards passage. At Ameren Transmission, progress continues to be made on the long-range transmission regional and beneficial projects, which I will cover in more detail in a moment.\nTurning to Illinois electric delivery. We continue to diligently work for approval from the Illinois Commerce Commission, or the ICC of an electric grid investment plan, revised revenue requirements incorporating ongoing and prospective investments and an overall improved regulatory environment. In January, the commission granted a partial rehearing of our multiyear rate plan to address the base level of investment needed to operate the grid reliably. Subsequently, in February, we filed an updated plan as part of the rehearing proceeding. Then in March, we filed our revised multiyear grid and rate plans to address the commission's findings stated in their December order. The rehearing and revised multiyear grid and rate plan proceedings are operating in parallel and with update rates for 2024 through 2027. We expect a decision from the ICC on the rehearing in June which would provide a 2024 interim rate adjustment by July. We expect an ICC decision on the revised multiyear grid and rate plans by the end of the year, which would revise rates beginning January 2025. We continue to work with all impacted stakeholders to advocate for constructive regulatory frameworks and outcomes that support the state's energy transition goals. Our ability to invest and deliver reliable and affordable energy is essential for our customers and the communities we serve and will support continued growth in our region.\nMoving on to operational matters. We remain committed to maintaining disciplined cost management to hold operations and maintenance expenses flat in 2024 to 2023 levels. I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to our Ameren team members who are working efficiently, collaboratively and safely to serve our customers.\nNow moving to Page 8 for details on the Rush Island securitization case at Ameren Missouri. Our request with the Missouri PSC to securitize the remaining balance of the Rush Island Energy Center and other related costs continues to make progress. In March, the Missouri PSC staff recommended securitization of $497 million as compared to our request of $519 million. Refinancing these investments through the issuance of securitized bonds, versus financing and recovery through traditional ratemaking will save our customers millions of dollars. Hearings were completed in April, and we expect the PSC's decision by June 21.\nNow turning to Page 9 for an update on the new source review proceeding for Rush Island. As previously reported in 2017, the U.S. District Court of Eastern Missouri issued an order requiring the installation of a flue gas desulfurization system or scrubbers on our Rush Island Energy Center for violating new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act and install a dry [ absorbent ] injection system at our Labadie Energy Center, as mitigation for excess emissions at Rush Island. Upon appeal, the A circuit upheld the district court's ruling with respect to the installation of scrubbers at Rush Island, but overturn the decision with respect to Labadie.\nSubsequently, we made the decision to accelerate the planned retirement of our Rush Island Energy Center which was more economic for our customers than installing scrubbers. The District Court approved Ameren's retirement proposal and established a retirement date of no later than October 15, 2024 to allow for the completion of various transmission reliability projects. The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking additional mitigation relief beyond the retirement of the energy center. In March of this year, the District Court ordered both parties to file proposals outlining additional mitigation relief for the court to consider.\nOn [ Wednesday ], Ameren Missouri and the DOJ filed their respective mitigation proposals. Ameren's mitigation proposal consists of 4 essential elements: retirement of Rush Island, which eliminates all emissions through its previously planned 2039 retirement date, a school bus electrification program, including buses and charging stations, an air filter program geared towards underserved residential customers and surrender of sulfur dioxide allowances. Collectively, these programs are estimated to cost approximately $20 million which resulted in a first quarter charge to earnings. The Department of Justice mitigation proposal includes a significantly greater number of buses, charging stations and advanced filters. The DOJ estimates their aggregate program cost to be approximately $120 million. We expect an evidentiary hearing will be scheduled sometime this summer, and we expect the District Court will issue a final ruling during the second half of 2024 that could be subject to further appeals.\nBefore moving on, I'd like to provide an update on the series of new rules issued by the Environmental Protection Agency last week. As you know, Ameren Missouri remain committed to investing in a clean energy transition in a responsible manner, balancing reliability and affordability. The new rules expect generators to rely heavily on carbon capture and storage technologies, which are not ready for full-scale economy-wide deployment. These new rules apply not only to existing coal-fired units, but new gas-fired units with greater than 40 [ per capacity ] factors as well, which would include the gas combined cycle facility called for in our current IRP in the early 2030s to maintain system reliability. In addition, for coal units retiring between 2032 and 2039, the rules will require natural gas co-firing by 2030. And as we noted in our comments to the proposed rules, co-firing with natural gas presents challenges from a permitting and construction standpoint. These requirements would most directly impact our Labadie Energy Center, which has units scheduled to retire in 2036 and 2042.\nWhile we are still assessing the impact of the rules on our integrated resource plan, these new rules are making it more challenging and costly to maintain existing dispatchable generation or build new dispatchable generation. These challenges come at a time when supply and demand is tight, and the industry has seen significant potential load growth, particularly from data centers, the manufacturing industry and through the electrification of transportation. We will continue to closely review the final regulations and as with many environmental regulations, litigation by various stakeholders is likely. These rules, if not modified, would require significant investments beyond what's in our current 10-year pipeline to meet compliance obligations and maintain a reliable system.\nMoving to Page 10. We look ahead to our future renewable generation developments. As I mentioned in March, the Missouri PSC approved CCNs for 3 Ameren Missouri solar projects totaling 400 megawatts. Split Rail, Vandalia and Bowling Green, all located in Missouri. The Missouri PSC in its March order also set terms upon which a fourth solar facility, the 150-megawatt Cass County, Illinois project could be approved if it is fully subscribed under Ameren Missouri's renewable solutions program. The renewable solutions program is a subscription-based program that allows eligible businesses and organizations to manage their carbon footprint by replacing up to 100% of their total energies with renewable sources. The online auction for customers to subscribe to the Cass County Solar project is expected to take place in mid-May with Missouri PSC approval of the Cass County CCN expected following full subscription. Initial nonbinding notices of intent for the subscription auction will receive interested businesses in early April and reflected strong interest.\nInvesting in solar energy is part of Ameren Missouri's plans to affordably meet the long-term energy and reliability needs of our customers. The IRP calls for new dispatchable energy resources, including an on-demand 800-megawatt gas simple-cycle Energy Center by 2027 which could be turned on as needed in a matter of minutes to ensure reliability of the energy grid during periods of peak energy demand. Later this month, we expect to file a request for a CCN for this simple cycle plant, Castle Bluff Energy Center, to be located on the site of our retired Meramec Energy Center.\nMoving to Page 11. The Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, or MISO, continues to advance its long-range transmission planning and project approval processes. For Tranche 1, we were pleased to be selected in April to develop the third and final competitive project in our service territory, which again emphasizes our track record of being able to deliver cost-effective, high-value projects to our communities. Ultimately, Ameren was assigned or awarded approximately 25% of total tranche 1 portfolio projects addressing the MISO Midwest region and 100% of the projects in our service territory. We expect Tranche 1 construction to substantially begin in 2026 with completion dates through 2030.\nLooking ahead to Tranche 2, in March, MISO announced a long-range transmission Tranche 2 proposed project portfolio estimated to cost $17 billion to $23 billion, which included significant investments within our Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois service territories. Since then, we, and other key stakeholders, have been working with MISO to evaluate and comment on the portfolio of projects to assist MISO in ultimately approving the most are path forward. MISO expects to vote on tranche 2 in the third quarter of 2024.\nMoving to Slide 12. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of more than $55 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investments also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's growing energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nTurning to Page 13. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2024 through 2028. The earnings growth is primarily driven by strong compound annual rate base growth of 8.2%, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our business segments based on their regulatory frameworks. Combined, we expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today. I'll now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2024 earnings of $0.98 per share compared to $1 per share for the year ago quarter. The key factors that drove the overall $0.02 per share decrease are highlighted by segment on this page. We delivered solid earnings performance during the quarter as we continue to execute our strategy, including making infrastructure investments for the benefit of our customers. The first quarter included new service in Ameren Natural Gas and Ameren Missouri. In addition, strong customer growth and usage contributed to 3% higher electric weather-normalized retail sales at Ameren Missouri across all customer classes which were partially offset by milder weather impact. In fact, the third one was first quarter in the past 50 years. Earnings were also reduced by an increase in O&M and Ameren Missouri, largely driven by a $0.04 charge for proposed additional mitigation relief related to the Rush Island Energy Center.\nMoving to Page 16. As we think about the remainder of the year, we remain confident in our 2024 guidance range, and we continue to expect earnings to be in the range of $4.52 to $4.72 per share. As we think about the first quarter results versus our expectations, we lost $0.07 compared to normal for weather and $0.04 for the charge related to Rush Island. But experienced $0.02 of favorable weather-normalized sales beyond our expectations. As we look ahead, we expect to see meaningful year-over-year O&M reductions in the second half of the year reflecting several cost savings initiatives instituted in 2024, which are expected to build throughout the year. This includes hiring restrictions, reducing our contractor and consultant workforce, and deferring or eliminating discretionary spend. As we've discussed before, we have been actively managing costs for years and continue to create opportunities for further cost reductions through process redesign and digital technology investment leading to increased productivity and better experiences for our customers.\nIn addition, we expect to benefit from higher earnings in [ Ameren ] transmission over the balance of the year due to timing of financing and project expenditures. I encourage you to take these supplemental earnings drivers into consideration as you develop your expectation for quarterly earnings results for the remainder of the year.\nFinally, late last week, MISO concluded its planning resource auction for the 2024 to 2025 planning year, which assesses seasonal resource adequacy in each zone. As a result of higher load requirements, changes to the accreted capacity of generation available and reduced import capability, Zone 5, Ameren Missouri's territory [ to add a mile ] capacity shortfall and prices went through the cost of [ new injury ] or [ COIN ] the nonpeak load fall and spring seasons.\nClearing prices in all other zones within MISO remained relatively flat. Unlike what Ameren [ Illinois ] experienced a couple of years ago, we do not expect to see material customer bill impact at Ameren Missouri resulting from this auction because our generation resources available to serve customers, nor do we see any issues with providing reliable electric service throughout the year for our customers.\nThe MISO oxygen results do reinforce a couple of things. First, there is a strong need for us to continue to execute the generation plans called for an IRP. And second, the integration of new large electric loads and carbon-free renewable generation to the grid will require significant transmission expansion with some projects needed locally to ensure reliable service. We stand ready to work with stakeholders in our region to address the capacity needs.\nBefore moving on, I'd like to provide an update on economic development. Through mid-April, we have successfully supported 21 new projects that have selected locations in our service territories which are expected to increase electric demand by almost 45 megawatts and natural gas issues by 1.6 million [ firms ] within the next few years. These projects will add an estimated 950 jobs across our service territories. The majority of these projects are existing customer expansions in the manufacturing, aerospace, data center, food processing and mining industries. A Missouri and Ameren Illinois are actively working with state, regional and local partners on more than 150 economic development projects that are considering on location in our service territories including large low data centers and manufacturers in the automotive, aerospace and agricultural industries, among others. We will continue to work on development opportunities to build thriving communities in our service territory.\nMoving to Page 17 on [ Ameren Illinois ] regulatory matters. We have several Ameren Illinois electric distribution regulatory updates to cover with you, including the 2023 annual reconciliation, the 2024 through 2027 multiyear rate plan rehearing as well as a revised grid and rate plan filings.\nStarting with the 2023 annual reconciliation. Under Illinois formula ratemaking, which expired at the end of 2023, Ameren Illinois is required to file annual rate updates to systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service to true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs. In April, we filed our electric distribution annual rate reconciliation requests for $160 million adjustment for the 2023 revenue requirements to reflect actual costs. The full amount that would be collected from customers in 2025, replacing the prior period reconciliation adjustment of $110 million that is being collected during 2024. For a net customer impact of $50 million or an approximately 1.5% increase in the total average residential customer bill. The ICC will review the matter once ahead with a decision expected in December of this year and new rates effective in early next year.\nTurning to the multiyear rate plan '24 through 2027 on Page 18. In January, Ameren Illinois has granted a [ part ] hearing by the ICC to address a base level of grid reliability investment and 2023 rate base additions. We filed our [ by ] request enable for a cumulative annual revenue increase from 2023 rates of $305 million by 2027. Our request, which includes investments and costs related to preventive and corrective maintenance inventory, metering, new business and customer relocations would allow us to appropriately maintain the energy grid to preserve safety, reliability and day-to-day operations of our system. The ICC staff recommends a cumulative increase of $283 million, with the variance driven primarily by the renewal of other post-employment benefits and certain 2023 projects from rate base. the latter of which the staff deemed to be outside the scope of this rehearing. We expect an ICC decision on the rehearing proceeding by June 20, which will allow new 2024 interim rates to be effective by July.\nMoving to Page 19. In March, [ Ameren ] filed its revised electric multiyear grid plan and revised multiyear rate plan. Our request for a $321 million cumulative annual revenue increase from 2023 rates with [ super seed ] revenues granted through rehearing. Request is based on a return on equity of 8.72% and an equity ratio of 50%. The Annual revenues will based on actual recoverable costs, year-end rate base and a return on equity adjusted for any performance incentives or penalties, provided the actual revenue requirement does not exceed the reconciliation [ cap ].\nOur plans as proposed support an affordable full energy transition, which we'll advocate for over the remainder of the year. We expect the ICC staff and intervenor testimony in May and we expect an ICC decision by December with rates effective January 1, 2025. In other regulatory matters, last week, Ameren Missouri filed a 60-day notice with the Missouri PSC for our next electric service rate review.\nMoving to Page 20 to provide a financing fee. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. on January [ 19 ] Ameren Missouri issued $350 million of 5.25% first mortgage bonds due 2054. And on April 4, Ameren Missouri issued $500 million or 5.2% and first mortgage bonds due 2034. Net proceeds from both issuances were used to fund capital expenditures and/or refinance shorten debt. Further, in order for us to maintain our credit ratings and strong balance sheet, while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity in 2024. We sold for approximately $230 million under our at-the-market or ATM program, consisting of approximately 2.9 million shares, which we expect to issue by the end of this year. Together with the issuance under our 401(k) and DRIPlus programs, our ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs in 2024 and beyond.\nFinally, turning to Page 21. We're off to a solid start in 2024 and well positioned to continue executing our plan. We expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2024 as we continue to successfully execute a comprehensive business strategy. Looking to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. We also believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions]. A reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Modeling for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. Now here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Beginning on Page 4. Our strategic plan highlights our steadfast commitment to providing safe and reliable energy in a sustainable manner. We do this by investing in rate regulated infrastructure, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy policies, while optimizing operating performance through ongoing continuous improvement in order to keep rates affordable. Our strong 2023 operating and financial results, which we will cover today reflect execution on our key business objectives for the year, which will continue to create value for our customers, communities, shareholders and the environment in the years ahead. I'd like to express appreciation for my Ameren coworker's unwavering commitment to our strategy.\nTurning to Page 5. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition. Our operations and investments in 2023 made the energy grid safer, smarter, cleaner, more reliable and resilient supporting thousands of jobs in our local communities in Missouri and Illinois and driving a positive impact on the economies of each state. In the process, we helped hundreds of local small and diverse businesses grow, and we gave back to numerous charitable organizations to help our neighbors in need. For example, last year, almost 60% of our total sourceable spend was with suppliers in our Missouri and Illinois communities while 26% was with local small and diverse suppliers, creating jobs and economic growth and contributing to thriving communities in the areas where we operate. The positive impact of our investments was reinforced by our top quartile reliability performance in 2023 as measured by the frequency of outages. At the same time, our Ameren supplied residential customer rates on average were below the Midwest average. Today, we published our updated sustainability investor presentation called leading the way to a sustainable energy future available at amereninvestors.com. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition.\nTurning to Page 6. When I reflect on the business objectives we laid out at the start of 2023, I am pleased to say that we made some great strides in each of our three strategic pillars. That said, we did not achieve the results expected in our Illinois gas and electric regulatory proceedings.\nOn Page 7, we lay out our key strategic accomplishments for 2023 in more detail. This past year, we invested $3.6 billion in infrastructure, spread strategically across our business segments in order to improve service for our customers. These investments are needed to reduce the frequency and duration of outages in the face of volatile weather events such as this past summer when we experienced the most impactful storms in the last 10 years. Ameren Illinois work in restoring power to nearly 200,000 customers in the wake of the June 29, 2023 [ ratio ] was recognized with an emergency response award by the Edison Electric Institute at its recent winter membership meeting. And there's plenty more work to be done to address aging infrastructure and make the grid stronger and smarter while supporting the clean energy transition, making it truly an exciting time to be in the utility industry.\nOf course, every utility's ability to invest must be supported by constructive regulation, which brings me back to our regulatory developments in the fourth quarter. The state of Illinois has ambitious energy transition goals, goals which we continue to work collaboratively with state holders to support. Of course, achieving these goals will require significant sustained investment in the state's energy infrastructure in the coming decades. In 2023, Ameren Illinois filed plans with the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, to incorporate proposed investments in critical electric and natural gas infrastructure into prospective rates. Unfortunately, the ICC decisions in both the electric and natural gas rate reviews late last year were disappointing, reducing cash flows available for investment and delay needed investments in energy infrastructure. We will continue working with stakeholders on a path forward to approval of an electric grid investment plan, revised revenue requirements incorporating ongoing and prospective investments and an improved overall regulatory environment. We must work to build a stronger understanding that consistent, constructive regulatory environments are required to attract investment support energy infrastructure development, economic expansion and jobs. Michael will cover the electric multiyear rate plan and the natural gas orders in more detail in a moment.\nMoving to Ameren Missouri. In November, Ameren Missouri filed a petition with the Missouri PSC seeking approval to securitize the unrecovered investment in and costs associated with the planned fall 2024 retirement of our Rush Island Energy Center. The securitization is expected to result in significant savings for our customers when compared with cost recovery under traditional rate making. We, of course, recognize the importance of keeping our customers' bills as low as possible while investing to improve service, which leads me to the third pillar of our strategy: Optimize the operating performance.\nIn 2023, our operations and maintenance expenses declined by 4% year-over-year. We automated and streamlined many of our finance, supply chain and customer service and workforce processes. And we continue to drive new efficiencies in our field work through deployment of smart meters, work management systems and distribution automation. Notably, our Missouri customer rates have only increased 1.8% compounded annually since the smart energy plan legislation took effect in April 2017, with our Missouri residential customer rates consistently remaining 25% or more below the Midwest average.\nFor our shareholders, yesterday, we announced 2023 earnings of $4.38 per share compared to earnings of $4.14 per share in 2022. The result was above the midpoint of our original earnings per share guidance range of $4.35 per share. On a weather-normalized basis, 2023 earnings results represent a 10% increase year-over-year.\nTurning to Page 8. Here, you can see we have delivered consistent superior value to our shareholders for the past decade. Since 2013, our weather-normalized core earnings per share have risen at an approximate 7.8% compound annual growth rate, while our annual dividends paid per share have increased approximately 58% over the same time period. This drove a strong total return of 173% for our shareholders from 2013 to 2023, which was significantly above our utility peer average. This track record of strong and consistent performance gives me conviction regarding our business strategy. And rest assured, we are not looking back, we are focused on the objectives ahead.\nMoving to Page 9, we turn our focus to the current year. We expect 2024 to be another busy year and have hit the ground running. Notably, we will maintain our focus on strategic infrastructure investment for the benefit of our customers while working hard to reduce operating costs and improve the regulatory environments in which we operate. We expect to invest approximately $4.4 billion in electric, natural gas and transmission infrastructure to bolster safety, security, reliability, resiliency, and further, the clean energy transition in a responsible fashion. This represents an increase of 22% from the prior year. Our plan includes approximately $1 billion of investment in new generation this year with new solar facilities expected to be in service by year-end. The investment plans are aligned with our regulatory outcomes and expectations associated with each of our business segments.\nWe also have several opportunities to enhance our regulatory and legislative environments in the year ahead. Next week, Ameren Illinois will file a [ rehearing ] testimony requesting to update 2024 through 2027 rates for 2023 year-end rate base and a base level of grid reliability investments. Then in March, Ameren Illinois will file its revised multiyear grid plan with the ICC to address the commission's findings stated in their December order. An updated rate plan will also be filed to incorporate revised investment plans. Concurrently, we are evaluating all appropriate options to better align prospective regulatory outcomes with the goal of making progress on a reliable clean energy transition in an affordable fashion. We will work with all impacted stakeholders to advocate for constructive regulatory frameworks across our Illinois businesses, which will better support the state's energy transition goals.\nIn Ameren Missouri, we look to obtain approval to securitize the Rush Island Energy Center and advocate for Certificates of Convenience and Necessity, or CCNs, for future renewable and dispatchable generation consistent with the integrated resource plan filed in September. The plan calls for investment in new dispatchable energy resources, including an on-demand 800-megawatt gas simple-cycle Energy Center by 2027, which could be turned on as needed in a matter of minutes to ensure reliability of the energy grid during periods of peak energy demand. In January, we filed a request for the air permit for this simple cycle plant Castle Bluff Energy Center to be located on the site of our retired Merrimack Energy Center. Utilizing this site will keep construction costs down, bring back jobs and provide additional tax revenue for the surrounding region. We expect to file for CCN approval with the Missouri PSC later this year.\nWe will also continue to support the analysis and approval of potential MISO Tranche 2 transmission projects that will serve the needs of the Midwest region, improving the grid's ability to integrate renewable resources efficiently and effectively. Given the importance of dispatchable generation to reliability, we are advocating for improved Missouri regulatory treatment for generation investments, akin to the treatment afforded other investments in electric infrastructure in the state. Further, on the legislative front, in both Missouri and Illinois, we are advocating for right of first refusal legislation to support the timely construction of transmission resources needed for system reliability and efficiency and to maximize customer benefits.\nShifting our focus to operations. As we identify ways to continuously improve our business, we are focused on maintaining disciplined cost management to hold operations and maintenance expenses flat in 2024 to 2023 levels.\nMoving now to Page 10. Yesterday afternoon, we announced that we expect our 2024 earnings to be in a range of $4.52 to $4.72 per share. Based on the midpoint of this range, this represents 6.2% earnings per share growth compared to the midpoint of our original 2023 guidance range of $4.35 per share. Mike will provide you with more details on our 2024 guidance a bit later. We expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2024 through 2028 and using the midpoint of our 2024 guidance $4.62 per share as the base. At this time, we expect earnings growth to trend below the midpoint of our range until the outlook in Illinois improves or the impacts of other growth opportunities are realized. That being said, we continue to have an outstanding portfolio of investment opportunities across our business segments totaling more than $55 billion over the next 10 years and a strong balance sheet, which provides us potential earnings growth levers that warrant maintaining a guidance range with up to 8% growth.\nOur dividend is another important element of our strong total shareholder return proposition. Earlier this month, Ameren's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of 6.3%, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $2.68 per share. This represents the 11th consecutive year that we have raised the dividend and reflects confidence by Ameren's Board of Directors in our business outlook and management's ability to execute our strategy. Looking ahead, we expect Ameren's future dividend growth to be in line with our long-term earnings per share growth expectations and within a payout ratio range of 55% to 65%. We expect our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio in 2024 to be approximately 58%. Over the last decade, we have gradually lowered our payout ratio, which provides financial flexibility while executing our robust energy infrastructure investment plans.\nTurning to Page 11. The strong long-term earnings growth I just discussed is primarily the result of rate base growth, driven by investment in energy infrastructure, made strategically under constructive regulatory frameworks. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base and an 8.2% compound annual rate for 2023 through 2028. This plan represents an increase of $2.2 billion compared to the $19.7 billion 5-year plan for 2023 through 2027 that we laid out last February. The plan includes investment in renewables and simple cycle gas generation consistent with Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan. And because of the ICC's orders late last year, our capital plan for Ameren Illinois investments has been reduced by approximately $400 million from 2024 through 2027 compared to our prior 5-year plan. We expect that this level of investment, which we expect will provide safe and adequate service as well as meet compliance requirements under the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act will ultimately be approved by the ICC. That said, we continue to believe that a higher level of investment, supported by a more constructive return on capital investment would be in the best interest of our customers and communities, and we will continue our advocacy. Finally, we remain focused on keeping customer bills as low as possible and improving earned returns in all of our businesses.\nMoving to Page 12. As we look to the future, our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2028, but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. The right side of this page shows how our allocation of capital is expected to change over the next five years, incorporating generation investment opportunities from our latest IRP, we expect our 2028 rate base to reflect our diversified approach for maintaining reliability with renewable generation and dispatchable generation representing 12% and 11% of rate base, respectively. Notably, our coal-fired generation is expected to be just 3% of rate base by the end of 2028. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren to provide safe, reliable, affordable and cleaner energy for the long term.\nMoving now to Page 13. Our investment plan released today incorporated our intentions to invest over time in significant renewable and dispatchable resources as laid out in our Ameren Missouri IRP. In 2023, we were pleased the Missouri PSC approved CCNs for the Huck Finn and Boomtown solar projects and in doing so, indicated support for our responsible gradual transition. And I'm happy to announce that we have reached a stipulation and agreement regarding our next four solar projects totaling 550 megawatts. These projects will support our lease cost plan for meeting customers' energy needs as we systematically invest to create a diverse mix of generation resources that preserves reliability as we retire our existing coal fleet over the next 20 years. While the Missouri PSC is under no deadline to issue an order on these four project CCNs, we expect a decision in March with these projects expected to go in service between 2024 and 2026. We expect to file additional CCNs consistent with the IRP later this year.\nMoving to Slide 14. As we've discussed in the past, MISO completed a study outlining the proposed road map of transmission projects through 2039. Detailed project planning, design work and procurement for the Tranche 1 projects signed or awarded to Ameren is underway, and we expect construction to begin in 2026. During 2023, Ameren was awarded the first two competitive Tranche 1 projects totaling approximately $100 million. Ameren submitted the third and final Tranche 1 competitive bid in October and expects the project to be awarded by June 2024. When awarding the competitive projects to Ameren, MISO noted our sound route design, engineering and cost containment plan and innovative approach working with stakeholders as key factors in the winning bids. This is indicative of how we plan and develop all transmission projects. We believe our collaborative customer-centric and community respectful approach to building and maintaining low-cost projects is why we should be directly assigned these projects in the future in both Missouri and Illinois. MISO expects to approve a set of Tranche 2 long-range transmission projects in the first half of 2024, which will again address Midwest region needs.\nTurning now to Page 15. Looking ahead, over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $55 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investment opportunities will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nMoving to Page 16. Disciplined cost management and a focus on customer affordability is nothing new to us here at Ameren. And we expect 2024 to be another year of disciplined cost control and value realization from continuous improvement initiatives which Mike will provide more details on in a few minutes. Through innovation and new efficiencies, we continue to target flat operations and maintenance expenses through 2028.\nMoving to Page 17. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2024 and beyond will continue to deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth from 2024 through 2028, driven by strong rate base growth and supported by a strong balance sheet compares favorably with our regulated utility peers. I'm confident in our ability to execute our strategy and investment plans across all four of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team with a track record of execution. Further, our shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend, and we are positioned well for future dividend growth. Simply put, we believe this results in an attractive total return opportunity for shareholders. Again, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 19 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported 2023 earnings of $4.38 per share compared to earnings of $4.14 per share in 2022, an increase of approximately 6%. This page summarizes key drivers impacting earnings at each segment, which are largely consistent with what we reported throughout 2023. As Marty noted, we normalized temperature variations over the past two years, we estimate that our earnings grew 10%.\nMoving to Page 20. I'll cover a few key developments from the fourth quarter. In November, Ameren Missouri filed for securitization of costs associated with the Rush Island Energy Center as we approach the planned retirement date of October 15, 2024. If approved as requested, Ameren Missouri will be able to refinance and recover approximately $519 million, reflecting the remaining value of the plant and decommissioning cost. Missouri PSC orders expected in June 2024. To mitigate the impact of the loss rate base associated with the Rush Island retirement, we expect our Huck Finn and Boomtown solar facilities with an estimated total investment of approximately $650 million to be placed in service near the end of this year.\nTurning to Page 21. As Marty mentioned, late in 2023, the ICC issued orders in our Ameren Illinois natural gas and electric rate reviews. In November, the ICC approved a $112 million annual base rate increase for natural gas delivery service which included $77 million that would have otherwise been recovered underwriters. The order reflects a 2024 future test year, a 9.44% allowed return on equity, a 50% common equity layer and a rate base of $2.85 billion.\nNew rates were effective in late November. We filed for a rehearing on this order with the ICC and were denied. So on January 3, Ameren Illinois appealed the ICC decision to the Illinois Fifth District Appellate Court, seeking that the ICC modified the return on equity and certain plant disallowances, among other things. The court is under no deadline to address this appeal.\nTurning to Page 22. In December, the ICC issued an order in our Ameren Illinois Electric multiyear rate and grid plan filings. In its order, the ICC established an alternative revenue requirement based on our 2022 rate base and is requiring us to refile and provide additional justification for our grid plan. We're in the process of revising our grid plan and will follow it by the March 13 deadline. We will also revise our multiyear rate plan to incorporate these grid plan revisions. In the meantime, the December order reflects a cumulative increase from 2024 through 2027 of $142 million in revenues. The order approved an allowed return on equity of approximately 8.72% and a 50% equity layer.\nIn January, Ameren Illinois filed for rehearing on the December order with the ICC. On January 31, the ICC ordered a partial rehearing regarding certain operations and maintenance expenses, use of the 2022 rate base for establishing the revenue requirement for 2024 through 2027 and a base level of grid reliability investments. We expect a decision on these items, subject to rehearing by the end of June, with new interim rates expected to be effective at the discretion of the commission. Following any ICC's response to our rehearing quest, Ameren Illinois will also file an appeal to the Illinois Fifth District Appellate Court on January 31 to address the remaining items which were denied for rehearing, including the return on equity. The court is under no deadline to address this appeal. We remain focused on providing safe and adequate service for our Illinois customers.\nMoving to Page 23. Our overall outlook remains bright as we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities. Our Ameren Transmission Missouri business [indiscernible] continue to benefit from meaningful ongoing investments to whereby reliable constructive regulation. Here, we provide an overview of our $21.9 billion of planned capital expenditures for 2024 through 2028 by business segment that supports our consolidated 8.2% compound annual rate base growth expectations.\nAs you can see on the right side of this page, we're allocating capital consistent with the allowed return on equity under each regulatory framework. Our Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan filed today with the Missouri PSC provides more detail on how we strategically invest to replace aging infrastructure with more resilient, reliable equipment to serve our customers. After five years of smart energy plan investments, we are a full year ahead of our initially planned smart meter installation in the state. That said, at our current investment levels, we still have decades of investment needed to address aging distribution substations and overhead and underground lines. You can find additional details on the Smart Energy plan and allocation of our 2024 planned capital investments on Page 32 and 33 in the appendix of this presentation.\nTurning to Page 24. We have outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals, driven primarily by the timing difference between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and the accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. As we sit here today, we do not expect the [ transferability ] of solar and wind tax credits to materially impact capital funding, nor do we expect the corporate minimum tax to apply during our 5-year plan. From a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt to fund a portion of our cash requirements.\nFor us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure and investment plan, we have entered into [ forward ] sales agreements for $230 million of common stock issuances under our at-the-market equity distribution program to address most of our 2024 equity needs. We expect to sell these by the end of the year. The only additional equity we expect to issue in 2024 will be approximately $70 million for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans.\nIncremental equity issuance of approximately $600 million each year are planned for 2025 through 2028, a portion of which we expect to be issued through our DRIP and employee benefit plans. The $600 million per year is unchanged from our previous plan outlined last February. All of these actions are expected to sustain our strong balance sheet and credit ratings.\nMoving to Page 25 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2024 earnings guidance. We expect 2024 diluted earnings per share in the range of $4.52 per share to $4.72 per share. This accommodates a range of outcomes on our ongoing in regulatory proceedings, along with our typical business risk and opportunities. Detailed by segment as compared to the 2023 results can be found on this page and the next. Beginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2024. Earnings are expected to be favorably impacted by the higher investments in infrastructure that are eligible for [ PISA ] and AFUDC treatment as well as new electric service rates effective July 2023. Earnings are also expected to benefit from higher weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers, which are expected to increase by 1% year-over-year in 2024, while sales to industrial customers are expected to increase by 4% year-over-year. These projected increases are driven primarily by customer count growth and [ General Motors ] resuming full production levels after a work stoppage in the third quarter of 2023. We also expect to benefit from lower operations and maintenance expenses. And we expect a return to normal weather in 2024 will increase Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.03 compared to 2023 results. These favorable factors are expected to be partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily due to higher long-term debt balances. Moving on, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and [ ATXI ] projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking.\nTurning to Page 26. For Ameren Illinois electric distribution, the year-over-year earnings comparison will be impacted by the lower allowed ROE approved by the ICC in the multiyear rate plan versus the 2023 allowed ROE, which was driven by the 30-year treasury rates plus 580 basis points. The allowed ROE is applied to year-end rate base, which includes 2023 rate base and 2024 planned capital additions. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings will benefit from higher delivery service rates effective in November 2023, incorporating additional infrastructure investments partially offset by a lower [indiscernible] and common equity issue. Earnings will also benefit from lower operations and maintenance expenses.\nMoving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect increased weighted average common shares outstanding to unfavorably impact earnings per share. We expect higher interest rate expense and Ameren Parent due to increased debt balances. At the end of 2023, we turned out all of the outstanding commercial paper balances at Ameren Parent through two debt offerings. The first issued in November was $600 million, with 5.7% senior unsecured notes due in 2026, and the second in December was $700 million of 5% senior unsecured notes due in 2029. Of course, in 2024, we will seek to manage all of our businesses to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible. With that in mind, that support our expectation for lower operations and maintenance expenses in our Ameren Missouri and Illinois natural gas businesses. We've instituted several cost-saving initiatives in 2024, including a hiring freeze, reducing our contractor and consultant workforce and deferring or eliminating discretionary spend. We'll be strategic about Workforce Management continued investment in digital efficiency to allow us to sustain these cost reductions.\nBefore moving on, I'd like to touch on expected sales growth for our service territory. While we're conservative in our model, and we are optimistic about the opportunity for strong economic development in the years ahead, in the last three years, our economic development teams have helped to bring 65 new projects to our communities in Missouri and over 125 projects in Illinois, bringing with an estimated total of over 14,000 jobs. These projects are generally expected to be completed in the next couple of years. With that, in mind, we expect weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to be in the range of flat to up approximately 0.5% compounded annually over the 5-year plan, excluding the effects of our [ MEA ] energy efficiency plans using 2023 as the base year. We exclude [ MEA effects ] because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.\nTurning to Illinois. We expect our weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to be relatively flat to down 0.5% over our 5-year plan, driven primarily by increases in energy efficiency and solar adoption. Recall that changes in Illinois electric sales no matter the cause, do not affect earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.\nFinally, moving to Page 27. I'll let it slide again that we have a strong team and have a long track record of execution. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2023 and expect to continue to deliver 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth over the next five years, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. We believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nNow here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter, and we're excited to share an update with you on recent developments. But before I begin our quarterly update, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Warner Baxter, who retired as Executive Chairman on November 2. Over his 28-year career with the company, Warner has had a significant positive impact on our industry, company and community. And frankly, each of us here this morning. Under Warner's leadership, Ameren has successfully executed a strategy focused on robust energy infrastructure investments supported by constructive energy policies driving strong value for Ameren's customers, communities and shareholders.\nAnd consistent with his focus on sustainability, he leaves behind a strong team dedicated to maintaining that focus and continuously improving. Congratulations Warner, and I wish you well in your retirement.\nMoving now to Page 5 and our quarterly update. Our dedicated team continues to execute our strategic plan across all of our business segments, which entails investing in energy infrastructure to deliver safe, reliable, clean and affordable electric and natural gas services to our customers.\nTurning to Page 6. Our strategic plan integrates our strong sustainability value proposition balancing the 4 pillars of environmental stewardship, positive social impact, strong governance and sustainable growth. Here, we summarized some of the many things we are doing for our customers, communities, coworkers and shareholders. And today, we published our updated sustainability investor presentation called leading the way to a sustainable energy future available at amereninvestors.com. which more fully details how we have been effectively integrating our sustainability value proposition, balancing the 4 pillars of environmental stewardship, positive social impact, strong governance and sustainable growth.\nHere, we summarize some of the many things we are doing for our customers, communities, co-workers and shareholders. And today, we published our updated sustainability investor presentation called leading the way to a sustainable energy future, available at amereninvestors.com which more fully details how we have been effectively integrating our sustainability value transmission lines. Such legislation would support the timely and cost-effective construction of the MISO long-range transmission planning projects and other need to transmission investments.\nUnfortunately, the legislation was vetoed by the governor in August, it was not ultimately brought to a vote during the detail session. We will continue to work with key stakeholders to support this important piece of legislation in the spring legislative session.\nOn Page 14, we look ahead to the next decade. We have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities totaling more than $48 billion that will deliver significant value to all our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. The $48 billion does not reflect the incremental investment opportunities included in the recently filed Integrated Resource Plan.\nWe will provide an updated number on our call next February, along with the new 5-year capital plan. Of course, our investments create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and to transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nTurning now to Page 15. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2023 through 2027. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong compound annual rate base growth of 8.4%, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our operating segments based on their constructive regulatory frameworks. Combined, we expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return that compares favorably with our regulated utility peers. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. Again, thank you all for joining us today.\nAnd I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 17 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2023 earnings of $1.87 per share, compared to $1.74 per share for the year ago quarter. This page summarizes key drivers impacting earnings at each segment. Under our constructive regulatory frameworks, we experienced earnings growth driven by increased investments in infrastructure in all of our business segments. As you can see, the key quarterly drivers are largely consistent with the guidance considerations laid out in February and the supplemental considerations provided on the first and second quarter earnings calls. We were able to deliver strong earnings performance during the quarter as a result of our diverse business mix and disciplined cost management.\nBefore moving on, I'll touch on sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Year-to-date, weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential, commercial and industrial customers decreased 2%, 0.5% and 2.5%, respectively, compared to last year. The year-to-date decrease in residential sales reflects an anticipated transition back to the office for many people. In addition, energy demand was lower as a result of the impacts from severe weather experienced in our service territory this quarter. That said, our residential sales remain a little over 3% higher than pre-COVID 2019 levels.\nFor Industrial, we expect the year-to-date decline to moderate over the remaining course of the year as the UAW strike ends, coupled with increased demand, including from a General Motors plant expansion and a new graphics processing company. Year-to-date, weather-normalized kilo hour sales to Illinois customers have declined about 3% on average compared to last year. Recall that changes in electric -- Illinois Electric sales, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue to cope in.\nMoving to Page 18. I would now like to briefly touch on our 2023 earnings guidance. We delivered strong earnings in the first 9 months of 2023 and are well positioned to finish the year strong. As Marty stated, we have narrowed our 2023 earnings guidance to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.45 per share. This is in comparison to our original guidance range of $4.25 and to $4.45 per share. On this page, we've highlighted slight considerations impacting our 2023 earnings guidance for the remainder of the year. These are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. I encourage you to take these into consideration as you develop your expectations for the fourth quarter earnings results.\nTurning now to Page 19. In January, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution followed its first multiyear rate plan or MYRP with the ICC, our MYRP is designed around 3 key elements: providing safe and reliable energy to our customers deploying capital in a way that achieves the climate and equitable job to act objectives as included in our performance metrics and fulfilling the clean energy transition by preparing our system to accept more renewables and electric vehicles over time.\nThe MYRP details a grid modernization plan that includes our planned electric distribution investments and supports our annual revenue increase request for the next 4 years. In September, the ICC staff followed a brief recommending a cumulative increase of $322 million in revenue for 2024 through 2027. This includes a return on equity of 8.9%, reflecting the 2022 average 30-year treasury rate plus 580 basis points. It also includes a 50% equity ratio. Also in September, Ameren Illinois updated its request to reflect a cumulative increase of $444 million in revenues, which reflect a return on equity of 10.5% and an equity ratio of 54%. In October, the administrative law judges recommended a cumulative increase of $338 million in revenues, incorporating a 9.24% return on equity and a 50% equity ratio. Our brief on exceptions filed last Thursday, calls for a return on it of 9.85% and an equity ratio of 52%. We expect an ICC decision by mid-December with new rates affected by January 2024.\nTurning to Page 20. In April, we saw that our electric distribution annual rate reconciliation to reconcile the 2022 revenue requirements to actual cost. In August, the ICC staff updated a recommended reconciliation adjustment to $110 million base rate increase compared to our updated request of $117 million base rate increase. The $7 million variance is driven by a difference in the common equity ratio as we have proposed a 52% compared to the ICC staff's recommended [ 52% ]. An ICC decision is required by December 2023, and the full amount would be collected from customers in 2024. Earlier this year, we also filed with the ICC for an annual increase in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution rates using a 2024 future test year.\nIn October, we filed an updated request for a $140 million increase based on a 10.22% ROE and a 52% common equity ratio and a $2.9 billion rate base. In October, the ICC staff recommended a $127 million increase based on the 9.89% return on equity and a 50% common equity ratio, which is consistent with the ALJ proposed order issued in September. We expect an ICC decision by mid-November with rates expected to be effective in early December this year.\nOn Page 21, we provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. We were able to successfully execute 2 debt issuances earlier this year, which you've outlined on this page. Further, in order to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity, consisting of 3.2 million shares by the end of this year. These shares were previously sold forward under an ATM program with an average initial forward sales price of approximately $93 per share.\nAdditionally, on September 30, we've entered into forward sales agreements under an ATM program for approximately $92 million to support our 2024 equity needs with an average initial forward sales price of approximately $86 per share. Together with the issuance under our 401(k) and DRIP plus programs, our ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs in 2024 and beyond. We continue to be strategic and thoughtful about our financing and our robust capital plan.\nTurning to Page 22. I'd like to briefly touch on our natural gas business as we head into the wearer months. Both Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri natural gas commodity prices are approximately 91% price edged based on normal seasonal sales and 100% volumetrically hedged based on maximum seasonal sales. I'm pleased to say, in light of the drop in natural gas prices, residential natural gas customers in Illinois and Missouri are expected to see total bill decreases of approximately 13% and 23%, respectively, compared to the 2022, 2023 winter season.\nTurning to Page 23. We plan to provide 2024 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. Using our 2023 guidance as a reference point, we've listed on this page select items to consider when you think about our earnings outlook for next year. Beginning with Missouri, earnings are expected to be higher in 2024 when compared to 2023 due to new electric service rates effective in July 2023. We also expect increased investments in infrastructure eligible for plant and service accounting, but positively impact earnings. Our return to [indiscernible] weather in 2024 would increase Ameren's earnings by approximately $0.02 compared to 2023 results to date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of the year.\nNext, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2024 compared to 2023 from additional infrastructure investments. The allowed ROE under the new multiyear rate plan effective at the beginning of 2024, will be determined by the ITC as part of the pending rate review compared to the average 2023 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8% -- review compared to the average 2023, 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%, which is currently in place. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas earnings are expected to benefit from higher delivery service rates based on a 2024 future test year.\nMoving now to Ameren wide considerations. We expect increased common shares outstanding and higher interest expense at Ameren to unfavorably impact earnings in 2024 compared to 2023.\nFinally, I would now consistent with past practice, our 2024 earnings guidance will include no expectation of COLI gains or losses. And turning to Page 24. We're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2023 and over the long term, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend and total shareholder return story.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as well as other members of the Ameren management team. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nNow, here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we cover our second quarter earnings results, I would like to discuss a series of major storm events which occurred in late June and July and disrupted power to a significant number of our electric customers across Illinois and Missouri. Collectively, this was the worst month for storm events Ameren has experienced in approximately 15 years. I would like to thank our customers for their patience as we worked to restore their power. I'm also grateful for and proud of the Ameren team. Importantly, our team worked hundreds of thousands of man-hours in challenging conditions with no significant employee injuries.\nThese outages emphasize why we believe continued investment in grid reliability and resiliency remains as important and necessary as ever for our customers, which brings me to Page 4. Our dedicated team will continue to execute our strategic plan across all of our business segments, which entails proactively investing in energy infrastructure to deliver safe, reliable, clean and affordable electric and natural gas services to our customers.\nAnd moving to Page 5. Our strategic plan integrates our strong sustainability value proposition, balancing the 4 pillars of environmental stewardship, positive social impact, strong governance and sustainable growth. Here, we summarize some of the many things we are doing for our customers, communities, coworkers and shareholders. And today, we published our updated sustainability investor presentation called, Leading the Way to a Sustainable Energy Future, available at amereninvestors.com, which more fully details how we have been effectively integrating our sustainability values and practices into our corporate strategy. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition.\nTurning to Page 6. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2023 earnings of $0.90 per share compared to earnings of $0.80 per share in the second quarter of 2022. The key drivers of our second quarter results are outlined on this slide. As a result of our strong execution in the first half of the year, I'm pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver within our 2023 earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share.\nMoving to Page 7. On our call in February, I highlighted some of our key strategic business objectives for 2023. We continue to make great progress as a result of our team's dedication.\nOutlined on Page 8 are a few key accomplishments this quarter. As you can see on the right side of this page, we've invested significant capital in each of our business segments during the first half of this year, increasing spending nearly 20% compared to the year ago period. These investments will continue to improve the reliability, resiliency, safety and efficiency of our system as we make a clean energy transition for the benefit of our customers.\nDuring these first 6 months of the year, Ameren Missouri installed over 175,000 smart meters, 147 smart switches and 32 underground cable miles and energized 8 upgraded substations. Over 75% of our Ameren Missouri Electric customers now have smart meters, allowing for better understanding of energy usage and choice among several time of use rates offered.\nIn Illinois, our customers are benefiting from over 3,700 new or reinforced electric poles and 91 new smart switches on electric distribution circuits year-to-date. And we continue to focus on replacing mechanically coupled gas service pipes. Further, our transmission business completed a total of 117 projects in the first half of the year, including line rebuilds, new transmission circuits, transformer replacements, generator interconnections and other upgrades to aging infrastructure, supporting the economic delivery of renewable energy resources for our customers as well as the overall resiliency of the transmission system.\nThis includes the transmission portion of our Intelligrid program, which was completed this spring. Ameren's Intelligrid network is a safe and secure private telecommunications network which enables the full functionality of smart grid technologies, giving Ameren greater awareness of system conditions, potentially reducing outage frequencies and durations to milliseconds instead of minutes or hours. As a result, it will reduce costs and wait times for customers. I'd like to express my appreciation for the Ameren team's dedication, hard work and collaboration so far this year to deliver value for our customers.\nMoving on to regulatory matters. In June, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved constructive settlement terms of the Ameren Missouri Electric rate review, which called for a $140 million annual revenue increase. New customer rates were effective July 9, representing an increase of approximately 2% compounded annually since April 1, 2017 prior to Ameren Missouri adopting plant and service accounting, or PSA, PSA, which is effective through at least 2028, allows Ameren Missouri to make meaningful and timely infrastructure investments, providing significant benefits to our customers. We also continue to make progress on the clean energy transition through the addition of solar to our generation portfolio.\nMoving to Ameren Illinois. Our team has been working diligently with key stakeholders in our ongoing electric distribution multiyear rate plan, or MYRP, and natural gas rate reviews. We filed rebuttal and [ surrebuttal ] testimony in June and July, respectively and are encouraged by the constructive progress made to date. Michael will discuss these in more detail in a moment. In June, the Ameren Illinois beneficial electrification plan approved by the commission in March was updated to include $65 million through 2025 for programs, incentives and rates encouraging electric vehicle adoption and infrastructure development. In legislative matters, we were supportive of the Transmission Efficiency and Cooperation law or House Bill 3445, which was passed by the Illinois General Assembly in May. This bill would support timely and cost-effective construction of transmission projects, which I will touch on more on the next slide.\nMoving on to operational matters. We remain focused on keeping customer bills as low as possible through disciplined cost management, continuous improvement and optimizing our operating performance as we transform our business through investment to ensure we sustainably provide safe, reliable and cleaner energy for our customers. Finally, in early May, the Callaway Energy Center was brought back online following a brief planned maintenance outage was completed safely and on schedule. The next scheduled Callaway refueling and maintenance outage is planned for this fall.\nTurning to Page 9. As I just mentioned, in May, the Illinois General Assembly passed House Bill 3445 or The Transmission Efficiency and Cooperation Law which, if enacted, would provide incumbent utilities, including Ameren, the right of first refusal to build MISO long-range transmission planning projects approved by year-end 2024. If enacted, HB 3445 will support the clean energy transition, benefiting our Illinois customers and communities and the broader MISO region. As the local utility, we believe we are well positioned to efficiently build, operate and maintain these transmission assets over time. The right of first refusal allows for the construction process to begin sooner and the resulting customer benefits to be realized much quicker.\nImportantly, we competitively bid each component of our projects and utilize local suppliers and contractors who support the local economy. In addition, we have long-term relationships with key stakeholders in the region and work closely with landowners and communities when citing transmission lines. The bill supports the timely and cost-effective construction of the MISO long-range transmission projects, including one Tranche 1 project approved in July 2022 and Tranche 2 projects expected to be approved in the first half of 2024. The legislation was sent to the Governor for signature on June 22, who has until August 21 to sign, veto or abstain from acting on the bill. Should the Governor abstain, the bill will automatically become law.\nTurning to Page 10. As we've discussed in the past, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039. Detailed project planning, design work and procurement for the Tranche 1 projects assigned to Ameren is underway, and we expect construction to begin in 2026. MISO's request for proposal for its estimated $700 million of Tranche 1 competitive projects have been issued. We submitted our first bid related to the Orient Denny Fairport project in May. The remaining 2 bids are due in October and November of this year. The proposal and evaluation process for the competitive projects is expected to take place over the course of 2023 and into mid-2024.\nLooking ahead to Tranche 2, MISO's analysis of potential projects is well underway and will continue for the remainder of the year and into next year. MISO anticipates the Tranche 2 portfolio of projects will be approved in the first half of 2024. Continued investment in transmission is needed to facilitate the transfer capability of energy across the region as more dispatchable generation retires and renewables come online.\nOn another matter related to MISO, an independent review was completed in July at the request of the ICC, which evaluated the benefits of Ameren Illinois' continued participation in MISO compared to the [ PJM ] interconnection regional transmission organization. The study considered reliability, resource adequacy, resiliency, affordability, equity, environmental impact and general health, safety and welfare of Illinois residents. In conclusion, the independent consultant determined that Ameren Illinois remaining in MISO avoids significant economic costs for the customers of Ameren Illinois and Illinois residents more broadly.\nBefore moving on, I'm happy to say that the Illinois Power Agency's procurement events this past May, which set energy and capacity prices from June 1, 2023 through May 31, 2024, resulted in significantly lower prices compared to last year. In fact, we expect a decline of over 25% in Ameren Illinois' basic generation service rate. For customers taking power from Ameren Illinois, assuming normal weather, this could result in double-digit percentage decreases on their overall electric bill, providing welcome relief for customers.\nMoving now to Page 11. As laid out in our June 2022 Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, or IRP, we are taking a thoughtful and measured approach to investing in new generation as our older energy centers near retirement. In support of this transition, we were pleased with the Missouri PSC approvals of certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCNs, for the [ Hucfinn ] solar project in February in the Boomtown solar project in April. Construction of Boomtown began in July, and construction of [ Hucfinn is expected to begin in October.\nIn June, we filed with the Missouri PSC for 4 additional CCNs totaling 550 megawatts of new solar generation across our service territory. These projects support our ongoing generation transformation, which calls for adding 2,800 megawatts of renewable generation by 2030 while maintaining the reliability and affordability our customers expect. These projects will bring over 900 new construction jobs and additional tax revenues and other payments to the area. Subject to approval, these solar projects are expected to go in service between 2024 and 2026. While the Missouri PSC is under no deadline to issue an order on the CCN filings, we expect decisions in the first quarter of 2024.\nAmeren Missouri is in the process of finalizing its next IRP, and we look forward to filing it with the Missouri PSC by the end of September. We believe the plan filed in 2022 includes a balanced and measured approach to adding renewables over time. As we continue the transition to a cleaner, more diverse generation portfolio, we are focused on reliability of the system, in particular in the hot summer and cold winter months. As a result, we are evaluating the need for more dispatchable energy prior to 2030, which is also consistent with MISO's view of future generation capacity needs in our region.\nOn Page 12, we look ahead to the next decade. We have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities totaling more than $48 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investments also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nTurning to Page 13. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2023 through 2027. This earnings growth is primarily driven by our strong compound annual rate base growth of 8.4%, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our operating segments based on their constructive regulatory frameworks. Combined, we expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return that compares favorably with our regulated utility peers. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone.\nTurning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2023 earnings of $0.90 per share compared to $0.80 per share for the year ago quarter. This page summarizes key drivers impacting earnings at each segment. As you can see, under our constructive regulatory frameworks, we experienced earnings growth driven by increased investments in the infrastructure in all of our business segments. Ameren Missouri earnings were negatively impacted by normal temperatures in the quarter compared to warmer-than-normal temperatures in the year-ago period. We were still able to deliver strong earnings performance during the quarter as a result of our diverse business mix and disciplined cost management.\nBefore moving on, I'll touch on sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Year-to-date weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and industrial customers decreased about 1% and 2.5%, respectively. Year-to-date weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri commercial customers increased about 0.5%. The modest decline in residential sales year-over-year were expected as more people return to the office, yet there's been nearly a 4% increase in residential sales as compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nYear-to-date weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois customers have declined about 3.5% compared to last year. Recall that changes in Illinois electric sales, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.\nOn the economic development front, there have been several announcements to build or expand within our territory. In Missouri, Boeing plans for a nearly $2 billion expansion of its aerospace program and will create 500 new jobs. In addition, ICL Group plans to expand their lithium battery material manufacturing plant in St. Louis, which will support the production of EV batteries and be the first large-scale plant of its type in the country, creating an additional 165 jobs. I'm pleased to say that we continue to see a strong labor market in Missouri with an unemployment rate of 2.6%, well below the national average. In Illinois, [ Manor Polymers ] and the [ Prism Group ] announced plans to build facilities manufacturing electric vehicle components and renewable energy cable, which collectively would create nearly 150 jobs in the state.\nMoving to Page 16. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2023 earnings guidance range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. On this page, we've highlighted select considerations impacting our 2023 earnings guidance for the remainder of the year. These are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. I encourage you to take these into consideration as you develop your expectations for quarterly earnings results for the remainder of the year.\nTurning now to Page 17. I'll provide an update on our regulatory rate proceedings. In June, the Missouri PSC approved a stipulation and agreement in our Ameren Missouri Electric rate review for $140 million annual revenue increase. The agreement was a black box settlement and did not specify certain details, including return on equity, capital structure or a rate base. The agreement did provide for the continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause. New electric service rates were effective July 9.\nIn other Missouri regulatory matters, in preparation for the planned retirement of our Rush Island Energy Center, last week, Ameren Missouri filed a 60-day notice with the Missouri PSC for the securitization costs associated with the Rush Island Energy Center. We will seek to finance the costs associated with the retirement, including the remaining net book value of the Rush Island Energy Center through securitization. As of June 30, 2023, the net book value was approximately $550 million. We expect to file our petition seeking commission approval of the securitization as early as the fourth quarter of this year. Once filed, the regulatory proceeding is expected to take up to 7 months to complete.\nMoving to Page 18. In January, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution filed its first multiyear rate plan, or MYRP, with the ICC. Our MYRP is designed around 3 key elements; providing safe and reliable energy to our customers, deploying capital in a way that it achieves the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act objectives as included in our performance metrics; and fulfilling the clean energy transition by preparing our system to accept more renewables and electric vehicles over time. The MYRP details a grid modernization plan that includes our planned electric distribution investments and supports our annual revenue increase request for the next 4 years.\nOn July 13, the ICC staff filed a rebuttal testimony recommending a cumulative increase of $317 million in revenue for 2024 through 2027. This includes a return on equity of 8.9%, reflecting the 2022 average 30-year treasury rate plus 580 basis points. If adopted, staff suggests that the return on equity would be updated annually. It also includes a 50% equity ratio. On July 27, Ameren Illinois updated its request for a cumulative increase of $448 million in revenues. This increase includes a return on equity of 10.5% and an equity ratio of 54%. The variance in Ameren Illinois' cumulative requests and the staff's recommended a cumulative increase is driven primarily by the return on equity and the common equity ratio, which makes up $81 million of the $131 million variance. An ICC decision is required by December 2023, with new rates affected by January 2024.\nTurning to Page 19. In April, we filed our electric distribution annual rate reconciliation filing to reconcile the 2022 revenue requirement to actual cost. In late June, the ICC staff recommended a $109 million base rate increase compared to our updated request of $125 million base rate increase. The $16 million variance is primarily driven by a difference in the common equity ratio as we have proposed 54% compared to the ICC staff's recommended 50%. An ICC decision is required by December 2023 and the full amount will be collected from customers in 2024.\nEarlier this year, we also filed with the ICC for an annual increase in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas distribution rates using a 2024 future test year. In July, we filed [ rebuttal ] testimony requesting a $148 million increase based on a 10.3% ROE, a 54% equity ratio and a $2.9 billion rate base. Staff has recommended a $128 million increase, reflecting a 9.89% return on equity and a 50% equity ratio. Other interveners have recommended an increase of $98 million to $106 million, reflecting a 9.5% return on equity and a 52% equity ratio. An ICC decision is required by late November 2023 with rates expected to be effective in early December of this year.\nOn Page 20, we provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. On May 31, Ameren Illinois issued $500 million of 4.95% first mortgage bonds due in 2033. Proceeds of this offering were used to repay a portion of the short-term debt and to repay $100 million of 0.375% first mortgage bonds that matured June 15. Further, in order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity, consisting of approximately 3.2 million shares by the end of this year. These shares were previously sold forward under our ATM equity program.\nAdditionally, we have begun to enter into forward sales agreements to support our 2024 equity needs. As of June 30, approximately $92 million of the $500 million of equity outlined for 2024 has been sold forward under the program. Together, with the issuance under our 401(k) and [ DRIP ] programs, our ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs in 2024 and beyond.\nAnd turning to Page 21. We're off to a strong start and well positioned to continue executing our plan. We expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2023 and over the long term, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend and total shareholder return story.\nThis concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

Lyons\n\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ameren Corporation | Chairman and President, A, Ameren Corp.\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2023 earnings results.\nOur dedicated team continues to successfully execute on our strategic plan across all of our business segments, allowing us to consistently deliver for our customers, shareholders and the environment while laying a strong foundation for the future.\nAnd as shown on Page 5, our strategic plan integrates our strong sustainability value proposition, [indiscernible] 4 pillars of environmental stewardship, social impact, governance and sustainable growth. These areas of focus incorporate our carbon reduction goals, which are consistent with the objective of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Here, we also highlight a few of the many items we are doing for our customers and communities, including being an industry leader in diversity, equity and inclusion.\nWe are honored that earlier this week, Diversity Inc. named Ameren to its Hall of Fame, the first utility and only 11th company to be added. Diversity Inc. also recognized Ameren as a top company among all industries for ESG, supplier diversity, philanthropy and employee resource groups, or ERGs.\nFor more than 2 decades, our team has made an explicit commitment to fostering diversity, equity and inclusion within our company and in the communities we serve. It is a value that we believe is foundational to our mission to power the quality of life. We look forward to sharing best practices with other companies as we all work together to create vibrant cultures and communities. Further, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on overseeing the execution of our strategic plan in a sustainable manner. Finally, this page summarizes our sustainable growth proposition, which remains among the best in the industry.\nAs mentioned on our call in February, we have a robust pipeline of over $48 billion of investment opportunities to continue to modernize the grid and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. Today, we published our updated sustainability investor presentation called Leading The Way to a Sustainable Energy Future. It's available at amereninvestors.com which demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our sustainability values and practices into our corporate strategy. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition.\nTurning now to Page 6. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2023 earnings of $1 per share compared to earnings of $0.97 per share in the first quarter of 2022. The key drivers of our first quarter results are outlined on this slide. As a result of our strong execution in the first quarter, I'm pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver within our 2023 earnings guidance range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share.\nMoving to Page 7. On our call in February, I highlighted some of the key strategic business objectives for 2023. We have been laser-focused on achieving these objectives.\nOn Page 8, we outlined several of our key accomplishments to date. As you can see on the right side of this page, we have invested significant capital in each of our business segments during the first 3 months of this year. These investments will continue to improve reliability, resiliency, safety and efficiency of service to our customers.\nDuring the quarter, Ameren Missouri installed over 74,000 smart meters, 84 smart switches and 19 underground cable miles and energized 1 upgraded substation. In Illinois, our customers are benefiting from almost 1,600 new or reinforced electric poles and 36 new smart switches on electric distribution circuits as we continue to focus on replacing mechanically coupled gas service pipes. Further, our transmission business is expected to complete 40 new or upgraded transmission substations and 120 miles of new or upgraded transmission lines in the first half of the year.\nI'd like to express my appreciation for the Ameren team's dedication and hard work to start the year. It is worth noting that all of these system improvements were accomplished despite several major and minor storm events, including tornadoes, which our teams responded to safely and rapidly to restore service to impacted customers. I am pleased to say that 97% of customers that lost power as a result of these storms saw service restored within 24 hours. Thank you again for your dedication to our customers and communities.\nMoving on to regulatory matters. We are pleased with the constructive settlement of the Ameren Missouri Electric rate review in April. The stipulation and agreement calls for a $140 million annual revenue increase and is subject to Missouri Public Service Commission approval. If approved, residential customer rates will have increased approximately 2% compounded annually since April 1, 2017, prior to Ameren Missouri opting into plant and service accounting.\nThis constructive regulatory framework, which is effective through at least 2028, continues to allow Ameren Missouri to make meaningful infrastructure investments, providing significant benefits to customers. These investments have contributed to a 12% improvement in reliability for Ameren Missouri customers since 2017.\nWe've achieved additional constructive regulatory outcomes this year in Missouri and Illinois related to our clean energy transition, which I'll touch on more in a moment.\nMoving on to operational matters. To ensure strong operational performance over the coming summer months, last week, we initiated a planned maintenance outage on the generator at the Callaway Energy Center. We expect the energy center to be back online next week.\nFinally, we remain focused on keeping customer bills as low as possible through disciplined cost management, continuous improvement and optimizing our operating performance as we transform our business through investment to ensure we sustainably provide safe, reliable, resilient and cleaner energy for our customers.\nMoving to Page 9. As we've discussed in the past, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039. Deep project planning, design work and procurement for the $1.8 billion of Tranche 1 projects assigned to Ameren is underway. MISO's request for proposal on the remaining $700 million of competitive projects in Missouri and Illinois have begun to be issued, and we are in the process of preparing our proposals. We expect to submit our first bid relating to the Orient Denny Fairport line later this month. The proposal and evaluation process for the 3 competitive projects is expected to take place over the course of 2023 and into mid-2024.\nLooking ahead to tranche 2, MISO's analysis of potential projects is well underway and will continue for the remainder of the year and into early next year. MISO anticipates the tranche 2 portfolio of projects will be approved in the first half of 2024.\nMoving now to Page 10. In February and April, the Missouri PSC approved certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCNs, for 2 Ameren Missouri's solar projects, the Huck Finn Solar Project located in Missouri and the Boomtown Solar Project in Illinois.\nThe Huck Finn project, which will support compliance with the Missouri Renewable Energy Standard, will be our largest solar project to date. Construction of this facility is expected to create approximately 250 jobs. And once in operation, it will produce enough energy to power approximately 40,000 homes.\nIn addition, in April, the Missouri PSC approved Ameren Missouri's Renewable Solutions Program, which will be supported by the 150-megawatt Boomtown project. This subscription-based program is available to midsized and large commercial and industrial customers and municipalities across Missouri. Participating organizations can enroll for up to 100% of their future energy needs to meet their own renewable goals. 10 organizations are the initial participants in this innovative program, which is fully subscribed.\nFurther, I'm excited to say Ameren Missouri has entered into an engineering, supply and construction agreement to construct the 50-megawatt Vandalia Solar Project located in Central Missouri. This project represents the first larger scale renewable energy center that will be fully developed and built by Ameren Missouri. We expect to file for a CCN for this project with the Missouri PSC midyear.\nWe expect to announce additional solar energy projects in the next few months. These renewable projects are consistent with Ameren Missouri's Integrated Resource Plan, which includes a thoughtful and measured approach to transition our generation portfolio.\nTurning to Page 11. I will cover progress being made in both Illinois and Missouri to provide incentive-supporting investment infrastructure that will enable advancement of electric vehicles, or EVs, across our service territory and in our region. We continue to see electric vehicle adoption advanced in our region and expect further growth as a result of our EV programs in both states in addition to increased state and federal funding.\nIn March, the ICC approved Ameren Illinois' beneficial electrification program, which expands on its existing electric vehicle charging program, and provides at least $27 million through 2025 for programs, incentives and rates, encouraging EV adoption and infrastructure development with a focus on equity and low-income customers. Through this plan, we will also support the governor's goal of having 1 million electric vehicles on the road in Illinois by 2030.\nIn Missouri, the PSC approved our Charge Ahead Program in 2020 and extended it in 2022. This $11 million program aims to eliminate barriers and incentivize electric vehicle adoption. This includes the addition of approximately 1,800 public workplace and multi-dwelling charging ports by 2024. Along the Missouri highway corridors, 14 fast-charging stations are already in operation as part of this program.\nIn addition, we are participating in and supporting the Addison Electric Institute's National Corridor Charging initiative. We believe strong adoption of electric vehicles will provide benefits for our customers, including lower rates due to load growth and, importantly, advance the clean energy transition.\nMoving to Page 12. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of $48 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investments also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nTurning to Page 13. In February, we updated our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2023 through 2027. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong compound annual rate base growth of 8.4%, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our operating segments based on their constructive regulatory frameworks. Combined, we expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, resulting in an attractive total return that compares favorably with our regulated utility peers.\nI am confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done. Again, thank you all for joining us today. I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nChairman & President, Ameren Missouri\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 15 of our presentation. Yesterday we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1 per share compared to $0.97 per share for the year ago quarter.\nThis page summarizes key drivers impacting earnings at each segment. As you can see, under our constructive regulatory frameworks, we experienced earnings growth in Ameren Transmission, Illinois Electric Distribution and Illinois Natural Gas, driven by increased infrastructure investment.\nWhile Ameren Missouri earnings declined driven by the warmest combined January and February in 50 years, we were able to deliver strong earnings performance during the quarter as a result of our diverse business mix and disciplined cost management.\nMoving to Page 16. Despite experiencing one of the warmest winters in 50 years, we're off to a strong start. We continue to expect 2023 earnings to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. The $0.05 earnings per share impact due to mild first quarter temperatures is expected to be offset through disciplined cost management.\nOn this page, we've highlighted select considerations impacting our 2023 earnings guidance for the remainder of the year. These are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed in our earnings call in February. I encourage you to take these into consideration as you develop your expectations for quarterly earnings results for the remainder of the year.\nTurning now to Page 17 for details on the Ameren Missouri electric rate review. In April, a non-unanimous agreement was reached in our Ameren Missouri electric rate review for $140 million annual revenue increase. The stipulation agreement was a black box settlement and did not specify certain details, including return on equity, capital structure or rate base. The agreement did provide for the continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause. Pending Missouri PSC approval, new Ameren Missouri electric service rates are expected to be effective by July 1.\nMoving to Page 18. In January, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution filed its first multiyear rate plan, or MYRP with the ICC. The MYRP includes a grid monetization plan that lays out our electric distribution investment and supports our annual revenue increase request for the next 4 years. Our request for $171 million rate increase in 2024 is based on an average rate base of $4.3 billion, a return on equity of 10.5% and an equity ratio of 54%. Our filing includes the phase-in provision and proposal for 50% of the requested 2024 rate increase to be collected from customers in 2026. We expect staff and intervening testimony next Thursday, May 11 and an ICC decision by December with rates effective January 2024. You can find additional key components of our MYRP following on this slide.\nTurning to Page 19 and other Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we filed our electric distribution annual rate reconciliation, requesting an additional $127 million to reconcile the 2022 revenue requirements to the actual cost. An ICC decision is required by December, and the full amount would be collected from customers in 2024.\nIn January, we filed our Ameren Illinois Natural Gas rate review requesting a $160 million increase based on a 10.7% ROE, a 54% equity ratio and a $2.9 billion rate base. We expect staff and intervenor testimony today and an ICC decision by late November, with rates effective in early December.\nOn Page 20, we provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. On March 13, Ameren Missouri issued $500 million of 5.45% first mortgage bonds due 2053. Proceeds of the offering were used to fund capital expenditures and refinance short-term debt.\nFurther, in order for us to maintain our credit ratings and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity, consisting of approximately 3.2 million shares by the end of this year. These shares were previously sold forward under our ATM equity program.\nAdditionally, we have begun to enter into forward sales agreements in support of our 2024 equity needs. Together with the issuance of our 401(k) and our [ DRIP Plus ] programs, our ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs in 2024 and beyond.\nFinally, turning to Page 21. We're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We're off to a strong start, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2023 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy.\nAs we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today's call, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you. Mr. Kirk, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of IR, Ameren Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team.\nThis call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast, and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. We have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com home page that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements about future expectations, plans, projections, financial performance and similar matters, which are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Please refer to the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday as well as our SEC filings for more information about various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nNow here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Andrew, and welcome back. We're thrilled that you're healthy again and here with us for this call and ready to fully engage with our investors and the analysts.\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we reflect on our 2022 performance and look ahead to 2023 and beyond. I'd like to start by expressing appreciation for the Ameren team's dedication and hard work over the last year. In 2022, we continued to successfully execute our long-term strategy, as shown on Page 4, which is delivering strong results today while laying a strong foundation for the future.\nShown on Page 5 are some exciting strategic achievements from the past year for Ameren, our customers, shareholders, the environment and the industry as a whole. Let me touch on a few key accomplishments.\nWe made $3.4 billion of infrastructure investments in 2022 that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid, as well as contributed to strong growth at all of our business segments.\nFor example, as part of our Ameren Missouri Smart Energy Plan, over 400 smart switches were installed to reduce outages from hours to minutes and even seconds, and 34 substations were upgraded or built new to better serve communities. In addition, over 300,000 smart meters were installed for our Missouri customers, enabling better visibility into their energy usage.\nIn Illinois, our customers are benefiting from the replacement of more than 3,000 electric poles, 64 miles of coupled steel distribution pipelines and 24 miles of gas transmission pipelines. Further, our Transmission business placed in service 19 new or upgraded transmission substations and approximately 200 miles of new or upgraded transmission lines.\nThese are just a few of the many projects completed in 2022. As a result of these and similar investments, I'm proud to say that Ameren's most recent System Average Interruption Frequency Reliability scores have ranked in the top quartile of our industry.\nWe also had several achievements on the regulatory and legislative front. In February, new Ameren Missouri electric service rates took effect as a result of our 2021 rate review, which was constructively settled.\nIn June, we filed a change to our Integrated Resource Plan, accelerating our planned clean energy investments, carbon emission reduction goals and our plan to achieve net zero by 2045 while thoughtfully considering customer affordability and energy grid reliability.\nIn July, our pipeline of investments was significantly enhanced when the Mid-Continent Independent System Operator, or MISO, approved a portfolio of Long-Range Transmission Projects, including significant projects in our operating footprint.\nAnd in August, Senate Bill 745 was enacted in Missouri, extending the constructive Smart Energy Plan legislation that became law in 2018 out through 2028, with possible extension to 2033.\nI am pleased to say that a result -- as a result of these developments, in 2022, we were able to increase our 10-year investment opportunity pipeline from $40 billion to $48 billion.\nFurther, in our Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution business, in September, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, approved constructive performance metrics, which paved the way for our Multi-Year Rate Plan filing this January. And finally, at the federal level, passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will support the clean energy transition, reducing the cost of related infrastructure investments for both our customers in both Missouri and Illinois.\nI would like to express appreciation for all the hard work of the entire Ameren team to advance these important achievements.\nAt the same time, across Ameren, we are all working to keep customer bills as low as possible while investing to ensure we provide safe, reliable and cleaner energy for our customers. We remain laser-focused on disciplined cost management, practicing continuous improvement and optimizing our operating performance as we transform our business.\nIn 2022, we continued our transition to a cleaner energy generation portfolio, and as planned in December, we retired our oldest and least-efficient coal-fired plant, the Meramec Energy Center. Thank you to all of our coworkers who have worked at Meramec providing reliable energy over the past several decades.\nWe recognize that our customers depend on us every day to supply the energy that supports their daily lives, and as such, we have kept them at the center of our strategy. We are honored that in 2022 and for the third consecutive year, our residential customers have recognized Ameren with a top-quartile overall customer satisfaction ranking among large electric utility providers in the Midwest. In addition, Ameren Missouri ranked #1 in business customer satisfaction.\nAnd finally, for our shareholders, yesterday, we announced 2022 earnings of $4.14 per share compared to earnings of $3.84 per share in 2021. This result was at the high end of our earnings per share guidance range.\nThe strong execution of our strategy in 2022 reflects strategic alignment across all of our business segments. We are staying focused on optimizing our operations and safely completing billions of dollars of value-adding projects to deliver significant value to our customers, communities, shareholders and the environment.\nTurning now to Page 6. Here, you can see we have delivered consistent superior value to our shareholders for nearly a decade. Since 2013, our weather-normalized core earnings per share have risen 92% at an approximate 7.5% compound annual growth rate, while our annual dividends paid per share have increased approximately 48% over the same time period. This drove a strong total return of nearly 226% for our shareholders from 2013 to 2022, which was significantly above our utility peer average.\nWhile I am very pleased with our track record of strong and consistent performance, rest assured that we are not letting up. Our team will remain focused on enhancing performance in 2023 and in the years ahead so that we can continue to deliver superior value to our customers, communities and shareholders.\nTurning to Page 7. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition and focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainable growth goals and reflects the way we integrate our sustainability values into our normal course of business.\nBeginning with environmental stewardship. Last June, we announced an acceleration of our transformational generation resource plan, now aiming to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions by 2045 and across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois, which is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This plan also advances our interim greenhouse gas emission reduction targets to 60% and 85% below 2005 levels by 2030 and 2040, respectively.\nAs mentioned, in 2022, we were assigned certain projects as part of the Tranche 1 project portfolio to prospectively build and operate significant transmission investments in the MISO territory. These as well as other transmission investments will provide our region access to a diverse mix of energy resources and are an important step forward to support a smooth clean energy transition.\nWe also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. One example is our effort to drive inclusive economic growth at Ameren and in our communities. In 2022, we spent approximately $1.1 billion with diverse suppliers, including minority, women and veteran-owned businesses, a 22% increase over 2021.\nBecause of actions like this, in May, we were honored to be recognized again by DiversityInc. as #1 on the nation's Top Utilities list for diversity, equity and inclusion. This is the 14th consecutive year we have been named to this distinguished list. I am also very pleased to say that Ameren was named a Top Company for ESG for the third consecutive year. In addition, we continue to support many nonprofit organizations in the communities we serve, including programs focused on DE&I, to which, we have made a $10 million contribution commitment by 2025.\nMoving to governance. Our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight of our sustainability efforts. In 2022, we named our first combined Chief Sustainability, Diversity and Philanthropy Officer to further optimize our initiatives. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to diversity, equity, inclusion and progress toward a clean energy future for all.\nFinally, this slide summarizes our very strong sustainable growth proposition, which we believe remains among the best in the industry. Today, we published our updated Sustainability Investor Presentation called Leading the Way to a Sustainable Energy Future, which is available at amereninvestors.com. It demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our sustainability values and practices into our corporate strategy. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition.\nMoving to Page 8, we turn our focus to the current year. We expect 2023 to be another busy year, and we are excited about a number of strategic objectives. Notably, we will maintain our focus on significant infrastructure investment for the benefit of our customers.\nWe expect to invest approximately $3.5 billion in electric, natural gas and transmission infrastructure to bolster safety, security, reliability, resiliency and further the clean energy transition in a responsible fashion. And as the nation's clean energy transition continues, we plan to help develop the needed transmission investment by submitting bids for the MISO Tranche 1 competitive long-range transmission projects as well as support analysis of potential Tranche 2 projects.\nWe have an active regulatory calendar this year. We look to constructively conclude our Ameren Missouri electric rate review Ameren Illinois Electric Multi-Year Rate Plan and Ameren Illinois natural gas rate review.\nWe will also work to successfully advocate for Certificates of Convenience and Necessity for future renewable generation at Ameren Missouri. And our next Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan will be filed in September, which will include a comprehensive update of assumptions, including changes driven by the Inflation Reduction Act enacted last year.\nFinally, we are focused on maintaining disciplined cost management with the expectation of holding operations and maintenance expenses flat in 2023 relative to 2022.\nMoving now to Page 9. Yesterday afternoon, we announced that we expect our 2023 earnings to be in a range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. Based on the midpoint of the range, this represents 7% earnings per share growth compared to the midpoint of our original 2022 guidance range of $4.05 per share. Michael will provide you with more details on our 2023 guidance a bit later.\nBuilding on the strong execution of our strategy and our robust earnings growth over the past several years, we expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2023 through 2027 using the midpoint of our 2023 guidance, $4.35 per share, as the base.\nOur dividend is another important element of our strong total shareholder return proposition. Last week, Ameren's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of approximately 7%, resulting in an annualized dividend rate of $2.52 per share. This represents our third consecutive year of approximately 7% dividend growth, and the increase reflects confidence by Ameren's Board of Directors in our business outlook and management's ability to execute our strategy. Looking ahead, we expect Ameren's future dividend growth to be in line with our long-term earnings per share growth expectations and within a payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. We expect our weather-normalized dividend payout ratio in 2023 to be approximately 58%. I have full confidence in our team as we look ahead.\nTurning to Page 10. The strong long-term earnings growth I just discussed is primarily the result of rate base growth driven by investment in energy infrastructure under constructive regulatory frameworks. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base at an approximate 8% compound annual rate for the 2022 through 2027 period.\nOur robust capital plan of approximately $19.7 billion over the next 5 years will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve. Our plan includes strategically allocating capital to all 4 of our business segments, and importantly, includes investment in assigned MISO long-range transmission planning projects of approximately $800 million and renewable energy projects of approximately $2.5 billion through 2027.\nFinally, we remain focused on disciplined cost management to keep customer bills as low as possible and improve earned returns in all of our businesses.\nMoving to Page 11. As we look to the future, our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2027, but is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. The right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our electric and natural gas energy delivery investments to be 81% of our rate base by the end of 2027. Incorporating renewable investment opportunities from our latest IRP, we expect our rate base from renewable generation to grow to 11%, and for coal-fired generation to decline to just 3% of rate base by the end of 2027.\nIn light of the Rush Island and Sioux Energy Centers approaching retirement by 2025 and 2030, respectively, only approximately 3.5% of the capital expenditures in our 5-year plan are expected to be spent on coal-related projects, focusing on investments needed for safety, reliability and environmental compliance.\nThe bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren to provide safe, reliable, affordable and cleaner energy for the long term.\nTurning now to Page 12. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of $48 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investment opportunities will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs in the future and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nMoving now to Page 13. Our investment plans released today incorporate our intentions to invest in significant renewable resources as we execute the clean energy transition laid out in our Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan. Our IRP lays out the most prudent approach to systematically invest in renewable energy generation to complement existing and planned dispatchable resources, building a diverse, reliable, resilient and affordable system for our customers. We continue to work in earnest with developers to acquire renewable generation projects and expect to announce further agreements over the course of this year.\nWe are pleased to say that last week, the Missouri PSC approved our Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the 200-megawatt Huck Finn Solar Project. Construction of this facility is expected to create approximately 250 jobs, and once in operation, produce enough energy to power approximately 40,000 homes. We expect the Missouri PSC decision on our remaining pending Certificate of Convenience and Necessity for the 150-megawatt Boomtown Solar Project by April, though the Commission is under no deadline to issue a decision.\nWe look forward to continuing to engage with stakeholders regarding our future generation needs and clean energy transition.\nMoving to Slide 14. As we've discussed in the past, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission projects through 2039. In July, MISO approved the first set of projects, which includes $1.8 billion assigned to Ameren. Detailed design work and project planning for the assigned Tranche 1 projects are underway. MISO requests for proposal on the remaining competitive projects have begun to be issued, and we expect the proposal and evaluation process to take place over the course of 2023 and 2024.\nLooking ahead to Tranche 2, analysis of potential projects is underway and will continue for the remainder of the year. MISO anticipates the Tranche 2 portfolio of projects will be approved in the first half of 2024.\nMoving to Page 15. As noted earlier, we remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management. Ongoing initiatives include the automation and optimization of numerous processes leveraging the benefits from significant past and future investments in digital technologies and grid modernization. Additionally, in 2022, we extended most of our collective bargaining unit labor agreements out through mid to late 2026 for nearly all Ameren union represented employees, which will provide predictability in our labor costs in the coming years.\nIn 2023, we expect our operations and maintenance expenses to be flat with 2022, and we are targeting flat operations and maintenance expenses through 2027.\nMoving to Page 16. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2023 and beyond will continue to deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth from 2023 through 2027 driven by strong rate base growth compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers.\nI am confident in our ability to execute our strategy and investment plans across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team with a track record of execution that has positioned us well for future success.\nFurther, our shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend and the strong earnings growth expectations we outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. Simply put, we believe this results in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today, and I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 18 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported 2022 earnings of $4.14 per share compared to earnings of $3.84 per share in 2021, an increase of approximately 8%. This page summarizes key drivers impacting earnings at each segment.\nI would note in the fourth quarter, we benefited from colder-than-normal weather as well as improved market conditions related to the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance investments, which contributed to 2022 earnings results at the top end of the earnings per share guidance range that we outlined on our third quarter call.\nWe've also included on this page the year-over-year weather-normalized sales trends for Ameren Missouri. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential and industrial customers were down approximately 1.5% and 1% year-over-year, respectively. And weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois commercial customers increased by approximately 0.5%. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.\nMoving to Page 19 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of our $19.7 billion of planned capital expenditures for the 2023 through 2027 period by business segment that supports the approximately 8% projected compound annual rate base growth.\nWe've incorporated an incremental $2.4 billion compared to the $17.3 billion 5-year plan for 2022 through 2026 that we laid out last February. The plan includes investments related to assigned MISO long-range transmission projects as well as renewable energy generation investments aligned with our 2022 Missouri Integrated Resource Plan. As you can see on the right side of this page, we are allocating capital consistent with the allowed return on equity under each regulatory framework.\nTurning to Page 20. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. The tax deferrals are driven primarily by the timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes.\nFrom a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt to fund a portion of our cash requirements. We also plan to continue to use newly issued shares from our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually.\nIn order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuances of approximately $300 million in 2023 and $500 million each year from 2024 through 2027. The $300 million of equity needs outlined for 2023 have been fulfilled through forward sales agreements under our at-the-market equity distribution program which we expect to settle by the end of this year. All of these actions are expected to enable us to support a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity.\nAnd lastly, the bottom of Page 20 shows our pension and OPEB obligations were well funded at the end of 2022. Constructive regulatory mechanisms are in place for recovery of associated costs, including a tracker at Ameren Missouri and formulaic rates at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and Ameren Transmission.\nMoving to Page 21 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2023 earnings guidance. We expect 2023 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 per share to $4.45 per share. On this page and next, we have listed key earnings drivers and assumptions behind our 2023 earnings guidance broken down by segment as compared to the 2022 results. I would note, consistent with past practice, our 2023 earnings guidance does not include any expectation of COLI gains or losses.\nBeginning with Ameren Missouri. Earnings are expected to rise in 2023. New electric service rates effective July 1, 2023, are expected to increase earnings. The earnings comparison is also expected to be favorably impacted by higher investments in infrastructure that are eligible for PISA primarily during the first half of 2023 before rates are reset. We expect a return to normal weather in 2023 will decrease Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.14 compared to 2022 results. Further, we expect higher interest expense largely driven by higher long-term debt outstanding. And we expect to recognize earnings related to energy efficiency performance incentives from a single plan year in 2023.\nMoving on. Earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking.\nTurning to Page 22. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2023 compared to 2022 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois performance-based ratemaking. We also expect higher earnings in Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution from a higher allowed return on equity due to the expected higher 30-year treasury rates.\nOur guidance incorporates an ROE of 9.55% using a forecasted 3.75% 2023 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is higher than the allowed ROE of 8.9% in 2022. The allowed ROE is applied to year-end rate base.\nFor Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings will benefit from infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment, which are expected to be partially offset by higher depreciation expense.\nMoving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect increased common shares outstanding to unfavorably impact earnings per share by $0.08. And we expect higher interest expense in the Ameren Parent. Of course, in 2023, we will seek to manage all of our businesses to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible while being mindful of operating and other business needs.\nI'd also like to take a moment to discuss our retail electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to be in the range of flat to up approximately 0.5% compounded annually over a 5-year plan, excluding the effects of MEEIA energy efficiency plans using 2022 as the base year. We exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts.\nTurning to Illinois. We expect our weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales, including energy efficiency, to be relatively flat over our 5-year plan.\nTurning to Page 23, on Missouri regulatory matters. In August, we filed for a $316 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 10.2% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a December 31, 2022, estimated rate base of $11.6 billion.\nIn January, the Missouri Public Service Commission Staff and other intervenors filed rebuttal testimony. Missouri PSC staff recommended a $199 million revenue increase including a return on equity range of 9.34% to 9.84% and an equity ratio of 51.84% based on the Ameren Missouri capital structure at September 30, 2022. The equity ratio will be updated to use the capital structure as of December 31, 2022.\nThe difference between our request and the Missouri PSC Staff's recommendation is primarily driven by return on equity and treatment of the High Prairie and Rush Island Energy Centers. Both of our request and Staff's recommendation will be trued up through December 31, 2022.\nAs always, we will seek to work through these and other differences with intervenors as we work through the proceedings. Evidentiary hearings are scheduled to begin in April, and the decision from the Missouri PSC is expected by June 2023 with rates effective by July 1, 2023.\nTurning to Page 24 for details on Illinois Electric matters. In January, Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution filed its first Multi-Year Rate Plan, or MYRP, with the ICC. The MYRP includes a grid plan that lays out our electric distribution investment plans for Illinois and supports our annual revenue increase request for the next 4 years.\nOur request for $175 million revenue increase in 2024 is based on an average rate base of $4.3 billion, a return on equity of 10.5% and an equity ratio of just under 54%. You can find additional key components of our MYRP on this slide.\nThe base return on equity will be adjusted up or down annually based on 7 performance metrics focused heavily on reliability and peak load reduction. Importantly, our capital expenditure plans for the coming years are expected to drive improvements in many of the areas of focus for these performance metrics. An annual revenue requirement true-up will take place each year with 105% cap on actual costs compared to the revenue requirement approved in the MYRP. However, many variable items, such as changes in purchased power costs, interest rates, changes in taxes and large storm restoration costs, are excluded from this cap. We expect the ICC decision on the MYRP by December '23 with new rates effective in January 2024.\nAdditionally, as part of the Illinois Energy Transition legislation, in June, Ameren Illinois filed a Transportation Beneficial Electrification Plan. The plan proposes to spend $27 million to provide incentives, rates and programs to encourage electric vehicle utilization and infrastructure development across Ameren Illinois' service territory through 2025. This is being done in support of the Governor's goal of 1 million electric vehicles on the road by 2030. We expect an ICC order on the transportation electrification filing by the end of March 2023.\nMoving to Page 25. We recently concluded our formula rate review of Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. In December, the ICC approved a $61 million rate increase as part of its annual performance-based rate update. New rates became effective in January.\nMajor investments included in this request were the installation of outage avoidance and detection technology, integration of storm-hardening equipment and the implementation of new technology to improve communication with our customers. Since implementing the performance-based ratemaking in 2012, reliability has increased by approximately 20%, and the equivalent of over 1,700 jobs have been created. We look forward to the new performance-based ratemaking under the MYRP, which will also allow us the opportunity to improve our returns in exchange for meaningful improvements for the benefit of our customers.\nFinally, in January, Ameren Illinois Natural Gas requested a $160 million revenue increase from the ICC based on a 10.7% return on equity and an approximately 54% equity ratio and a $2.9 billion rate base using our future 2024 test year. This requested increase includes approximately $77 million that would otherwise be recovered in 2024 under QIP and other riders. An ICC decision is required by late November 2023, with rates expected to be effective in early December 2023.\nYou can see we have an active regulatory calendar ahead of us. We've developed strong relationships with our stakeholders and a long track record of constructive results that show our investments are truly making a difference in the lives of our customers.\nOn Page 26, we provide an update regarding the Inflation Reduction Act. As we sit here today, we do not expect the Corporate Minimum Tax, or CMT, to apply in 2023 or 2024. We continue to model the CMT, and it's possible it could impact 2025 and beyond. We await additional guidance from Treasury, which we expect to provide more further clarity. Again, these potential incremental annual cash tax payments are not expected to be material.\nThese estimates are of course subject to the amount and timing of capital expenditures being placed in service or retired, timing of rate reviews and additional guidance that may be issued by the IRS or Department of Treasury, among other items.\nFinally, moving to Page 27. I'll emphasize again that we have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing our plan. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2022, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2023 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy.\nAs we look ahead, we expect 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2023 to 2027, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. We believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our peers. Further, Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Megan McPhail, Manager of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you. Mrs. McPhail, you may begin.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Moehn, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team. Marty and Michael will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.\nBefore we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited.\nTo assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers. As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements.\nSuch statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, strategies, targets, estimates, objectives, events and conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statements section in our news release we issued yesterday and the forward-looking statements in Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC.\nLastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted. Now here's Marty, who will start on Page 4.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we continue to execute on our strategic plan across each of our business segments delivering significant value to our customers and shareholders while remaining focused on safety. At the start of the year, we laid out some key initiatives we were focused on. As I sit here today, I can confidently say that we have been able to deliver on these through strong execution of our plan.\nStarting with Ameren Missouri. In February, our new Ameren Missouri electric service rates took effect as a result of our recent rate review, which was constructively settled at the end of last year.\nIn June, we filed a change to our integrated resource plan, accelerating our planned clean energy investments, carbon emission reduction goals and our plan to achieve net zero by 2045. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator or MISO approved a portfolio of long-range transmission projects including significant projects in our operating footprint.\nAnd in August, Senate Bill 745 was enacted in Missouri, extending the constructive Smart Energy Plan legislation that became law in 2018 and out through 2028 with possible extension to 2033. I am pleased to say, as a result of these developments, in 2022, we were able to increase our 10-year investment opportunity pipeline from $40 billion to $48 billion. Further, in our Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution business, in September, the Illinois Commerce Commission, or ICC, approved constructive performance metrics which keep us on track to file a multiyear rate plan next January.\nAnd finally, at the federal level, passage of the Inflation Reduction Act will support the clean energy transition reducing the cost of related infrastructure investments for our customers in both Missouri and Illinois.\nI would like to express appreciation for all the hard work of the entire Ameren team to advance these important achievements. Additionally, I'd like to recognize our team's strong commitment to the communities we serve. This year, we named our first Chief Sustainability Diversity and Philanthropy Officer to further optimize our ESG impact. In October, she convened more than 1,000 Ameren team members and community leaders in person and virtually for a Diversity and Inclusion Summit featuring many nationally-recognized leaders and speakers.\nBecause of actions like this, in May, Ameren was recognized for the third time as Diversity Inc.'s top-rated utility and made the overall top utilities list for the 14th consecutive year.\nAnother example of our team's commitment to our communities is our recently concluded 2022 company-wide United Way campaign, which raised approximately $1.7 million funds, which will go a long way towards supporting approximately 50 United Way organizations in our service territory. This is in addition to the nearly $2.6 million United Way contribution made by Ameren. Again, thank you for all you do.\nMoving now to quarterly results. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2022 earnings of $1.74 per share compared to earnings of $1.65 per share in the third quarter of 2021. The year-over-year improvement reflected increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. This page highlights the key drivers of our strong performance.\nDue to strong execution of our strategy, we have narrowed our 2022 earnings guidance to a range of $4 to $4.15 per share. This compares to our initial guidance range of $3.95 per share to $4.15 per share. Michael will discuss our third quarter earnings, 2022 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail.\nMoving to Page 5. You will find our strategic plan reiterated. We continue to invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks, enhance regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies and create and capitalize on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment.\nTurning now to Page 6, which highlights our commitment to the first pillar of our strategy, investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. Our strong long-term earnings growth guidance is primarily driven by our infrastructure investment and rate base growth plans, which are supported by constructive regulatory frameworks.\nAs you can see on the right side of this page, consistent with our plans for 2022, we are strategically investing significant capital in each of our business segments in order to maintain safe and reliable operations as we transition to a cleaner energy grid. These investments are the key drivers of our ongoing Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois rate reviews.\nOur energy grid is smarter, stronger, more resilient, safer and more secure because of the investments we've been able to make in all 4 of our business segments. At Ameren Missouri, as a result of the significant investments we have been making under the Smart Energy Plan we estimate over 6.5 million minutes of customer outages have been avoided in 2022. As always, while we invest to build a smarter, stronger, safer and cleaner energy grid for our customers, we continue to work diligently to manage our costs, leverage our investments and optimize our performance.\nMoving now to Page 7 and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. As I mentioned, the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA, was enacted in August, which, among other things, is designed to help reduce the cost of the clean energy transition. We are very pleased with the results as it provides tax credits for wind, solar and nuclear energy centers, energy storage, carbon capture utilization and storage and hydrogen development. The incentives in the IRA aligned well with our Missouri Integrated Resource Plan and our Ameren wide goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2045. Overall, the IRA will enhance affordability of the clean energy transition for our customers in Missouri and Illinois. Michael will discuss the expected impacts of the IRA in more detail in a moment.\nBefore moving on, I would also like to briefly touch on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act or IIJA that was enacted earlier this year. We are actively collaborating with stakeholders in Missouri and Illinois toward accessing benefits of the federal funding provided through this act for our customers.\nIn July, we announced our collaboration with local businesses and community groups, academic institutions and various companies to form the Greater St. Louis and Illinois Regional clean hydrogen hub industrial cluster. This group is collaborating on infrastructure development and innovative technology deployment needed to drive decarbonization goals and collectively achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions for the region by 2035.\nThe IIJA established an $8 billion competitive program with the intent to fund 6 to 8 regional hydrogen hubs across the country and provides for an additional $8.5 billion program for development of carbon capture and storage technologies. By next spring, our regional hydrogen cluster expects to apply for funding through the program to take part in advancing this potential renewable energy source for our region.\nTurning to Page 8. At the state level, our customers are benefiting as a result of Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy Plan, a multiyear effort to strengthen and modernize the energy grid. As I just mentioned, Missouri Senate Bill 745 passed earlier this year and became effective in August, enhancing and extending the sunset date on the current Smart Energy Plan legislation through December 31, 2028, with an extension through December 31, 2033, if the utility requests and the PSC approves. We believe extending Missouri Smart Energy Plan will continue to benefit our customers and communities as we transform the energy grid of today to build a brighter energy future for generations to come while creating significant economic development and jobs in the state.\nMoving now to Page 9 and an update on the Illinois Energy Legislation enacted in 2021. By January 20, 2023, we plan to file a multiyear rate plan with the ICC for electric delivery service rates effective at the beginning of 2024. In late September, the ICC approved 7 performance metrics, which will result in up to 24 symmetrical basis points of potential adjustments to the allowed return on equity under the multiyear rate plan. These performance metrics have been designed to incentivize improvement in areas such as reliability, supplier diversity, affordability and customer service as we continue to make significant investments in the state of Illinois for the benefit of our customers and communities.\nTurning to Page 10 and the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. Here, we provide an update on the MISO long-range transmission planning process. As we have discussed with you in the past, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission investments through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions, among other things.\nIn July, MISO approved Tranche 1, a set of projects located in MISO North, which it estimates to cost approximately $10 billion. Approximately $1.8 billion of these projects are in our service territory and have been assigned to Ameren. Preliminary design work and project planning are already underway. Construction is expected to begin in 2025 with completion dates expected near the end of this decade.\nIn addition to the assigned projects, MISO approved approximately $700 million of competitive projects that cross through our Missouri service territory, which provide additional potential investment opportunities. Request for proposals for the 2 competitive projects in our service territory are expected to be released in December 2022 and March 2023. Once released, we expect the proposal and evaluation process to take approximately 12 months.\nWe are well positioned to compete for and successfully execute these projects, given their location and our expertise constructing, operating and maintaining large regional transmission projects. MISO continues its work on future tranches and has indicated that an initial set of Tranche 2 projects also located in MISO North is expected to be approved in the second half of 2023. Projects included in Tranche 3 are expected to be located in MISO South, with approval scheduled by the end of 2024, while projects identified in Tranche 4 are expected to improve transport capability between MISO North and MISO South and will be studied upon approval of Tranche 3.\nTurning to Page 11. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid smarter, stronger and cleaner. As a result of the long-range transmission projects just discussed, as well as the additional renewables and combined cycle generation included in the change to the IRP filed in June, we increased our pipeline of investment opportunities to $48 billion over the next decade. We expect to update and roll forward our 5-year capital plan on our year-end call in February.\nAnd as always, we will evaluate all of our opportunities across all business segments to ensure we maximize value for our customers and shareholders. When determining the timing of our projects, we remain mindful of portfolio diversification in both technology and geography, workforce and supply chain capacity and the impacts to grid reliability while aggressively managing costs.\nMaintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs in the future and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nMoving now to Page 12. We are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition and focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainable growth goals. The change to the Ameren Missouri IRP filed in June supports a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2040 compared to 2005 levels. And our goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2045 is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nImportantly, our energy policy advocacy and investment plans align with these goals. In terms of governance, in October, the CPA-Zicklin Index once again named Ameren, 1 of the top 3 companies in the utility industry for corporate political disclosures and accountability. We also remain focused on supporting our communities, including utilizing our very robust supplier diversity program to help ensure we execute on an equitable clean energy transition, and we remain committed to helping our customers keep their bills as low as possible through robust energy efficiency programs and energy assistance for those in need.\nLastly, our strong sustainable growth proposition remains among the best in the industry. We have a robust pipeline of future investments that will continue to modernize the grid and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com.\nTurning to Page 13. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2022 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. In February, we issued our current 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual growth rate -- earnings growth rate from 2022 through 2026. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our operating segments based on their constructive regulatory frameworks.\nWe expect Ameren's future dividend growth to be in line with our long-term earnings per share growth expectations and a payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. In February 2022, Ameren's Board of Directors last increased the quarterly dividend by [$0.04 or $0.59 -- to $0.59] per share or approximately 7%. We plan to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, which results in an attractive total return that compares favorably with our regulated utility peers. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plan and strategy across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today, and I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported third quarter 2022 earnings of $1.74 per share compared to $1.65 per share for the year ago quarter. Page 15 summarizes key drivers impacting earnings in each segment.\nI'd like to take a moment to highlight a few key variances for the quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, benefited from higher electric service rates, which became effective on February 28, 2022. The increase in Ameren Missouri was partially offset by higher O&M driven in part by unfavorable market returns in 2022 on company-owned life insurance investments.\nEarnings at our remaining 3 business segments were higher, primarily driven by increased investments in infrastructure, in addition to a higher allowed return on equity at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution.\nBefore moving on, I'll touch on year-to-date sales trends for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri residential customers were comparable versus the prior year, and sales to commercial customers increased about 1%. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Missouri industrial customers decreased about 1%. Weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois residential customers decreased about 1% and sales to commercial and industrial customers increased about 1.5% and 1%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter of the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.\nTurning to Page 16. I would now like to briefly touch on our 2022 earnings guidance. We have delivered strong earnings in the first 9 months of 2022 and are well positioned to finish the year strong. As Marty stated, we have narrowed our 2022 diluted earnings guidance to be in the range of $4 to $4.15 per share. This is a comparison to our original guidance range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share.\nSelect earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. As we reflect on our full year results, the benefits we have seen from weather year-to-date and from higher-than-expected 30-year treasury rates are mostly offset by company on life insurance investment performance as well as higher-than-expected short-term and long-term borrowing rates.\nTurning now to Page 17 for an update on regulatory matters, starting with Ameren Missouri. In August, we filed for a $316 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request, which was driven by increased infrastructure investments under the Smart Energy Plan, includes a 10.2% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a December 31, 2022 estimated rate base of $11.6 billion.\nIn October, we supplemented our filing to request a tracker for the benefits and costs resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act. Missouri PSC staff and other intervenors are expected to file direct testimony in January 2023, with hearings scheduled for early April 2023. We expect a Missouri PSC decision by June 2023 and new rates to be affected by July 1, 2023. We look forward to our continued work with all key stakeholders on this request.\nMoving to Page 18, Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. Earlier this year, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up any prior period over or under recovery of such costs.\nIn August, the ICC staff updated the recommendation to reflect a $61 million base rate increase compared to our updated request of an $84 million base rate increase. The $23 million variance is primarily driven by a difference in the capital structure common equity ratio as we have proposed 54% compared to the ICC staff's recommended 50%. For perspective, the order received from the ICC last December included a common equity ratio of 51%. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates to be effective in January 2023. Finally, we expect to file a new rate review with the ICC for our Ameren Illinois Natural Gas business in early 2023, using a forward test year ending December 31, 2024.\nTurning now to Page 19. As Marty mentioned, we're pleased with the Inflation Reduction Act, which enhances affordability of the clean energy transition for our customers in both Missouri and Illinois. We currently estimate based on the clean energy investments outlined in the preferred plan included in the change to Ameren's Missouri's IRP that the production tax credits provided for in the legislation will yield more than $1 billion in net benefits by 2032, saving our Ameren Missouri customers at an average of more than 4% per year over that period of time as compared to what they would have paid.\nWe expect our Illinois customers to see the benefit from the legislation over time to reduce power purchased cost. Further, as we sit here today, we do not expect the corporate minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income to apply in 2023. Incremental annual cash payments due to the corporate minimum tax beyond 2023 are not expected to be material. And finally, we are assessing our ability to utilize the 10% of production or investment tax credit for siting projects at existing energy communities, including retired coal-fired energy centers.\nMoving to Page 20. We provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. We were able to successfully execute on several debt issuances earlier this year, which are outlined on this page. In order to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan consistent with the guidance in February, we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity in both 2022 and 2023.\nWe're very pleased to say that through our at-the-market equity program, we have now fulfilled these equity needs to execute through the forward sales agreements with an average initial forward sales price of approximately $90 and we expect to issue approximately 3.4 million and 3.2 million in common shares upon settlement by year-end 2022 and 2023, respectively. Having substantially utilized the $750 million of capacity under our existing ATM program, we expect to increase the existing program by approximately $1 billion to address equity needs in 2024 and beyond.\nMoving to Page 21. In light of the recent rising interest rate environment, we have provided our long-term debt maturities remaining through 2026. We have just $47 million of long-term debt maturing later this year in Ameren Missouri and $100 million of long-term debt at Ameren Illinois maturing in 2023.\nAll of our long-term debt is at fixed rates and variable rate debt is limited to commercial paper borrowings. It's also important to note that a portion of the interest cost is also capitalized in the normal course as related to debt supports construction work in progress. I'd also like to note we received recovery of any changes in interest expense in our Illinois -- Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and Ameren Transmission businesses through the reconciliation process.\nFurther, we have some favorable exposure with the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution return on equity as it's tied to the 30-year treasury rate through 2023. Changes in the long-term and short-term debt costs at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas will be incorporated into rate reviews for recovery over time, which includes a true-up of the cost of capital as of December 31, 2022, in the current Ameren Missouri electric rate review. We're mindful of the changes in interest rates and remain focused on managing costs for our customers.\nTurning to Page 22. I'd like to briefly touch on our natural gas business as we head into the winter months. We recognized the (inaudible) inflationary environment customers are facing. We are working to keep bills as low as possible and provide energy savings programs for our customers. We're actively working with customers in both Missouri and Illinois to help them gain access to funds available through Low Income Home Energy Assistance, grant and other energy assistance funds in addition to our energy efficiency programs.\nDetails on these customer assistance programs and the energy efficiency programs can be found on our website at ameren.com. Both Ameren Illinois and Ameren Missouri natural gas commodity prices are approximately 85% hedged based on normal seasonal sales and 100% of the Ameren Illinois natural gas is volumetrically hedged based on maximum seasonal sales. From a customer bill perspective, residential natural gas customers in Illinois and Missouri are expected to see bill increases of approximately 4% and 14%, respectively, compared to the 2021, 2022 winter season.\nTurning to Page 23. We plan to provide 2023 earnings guidance when we release fourth quarter results in February next year. Using our 2022 guidance as a reference point, we have listed on this page select items to consider as you think about our earnings outlook for next year.\nBeginning with Missouri, earnings are expected to be higher in 2023 when compared to 2022 due to new electric service rates effective in late February 2022. And a new electric service rates expected to be effective by July 2023 as a result of the pending rate review. We also expect increased investments in infrastructure eligible for plant and service accounting to positively impact earnings.\nFurther, we expect energy efficiency performance incentives to be approximately $0.03 per share lower in 2023 compared to 2022. A return to normal weather in 2023 would decrease the Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.11 compared to 2022 results date, assuming normal weather in the last quarter of the year.\nNext, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking.\nFor Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2023 compared to 2022 from additional infrastructure investments made on Ameren Illinois performance-based ratemaking. The allowed ROE under the formula will be the average 2023 30-year treasury yield plus 5.8%. Ameren Illinois Natural Gas earnings are expected to benefit from an increase in infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment that will earn the current allowed ROE of 9.67%.\nAnd finally, I will note, consistent with past practices, our 2023 earnings guidance will include no expectation of COLI gains or losses.\nTurning to Page 24 to summarize. We continue to expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2022 as we successfully execute our strategy. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. The bottom line is that we are well positioned to continue executing our plan and Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to your host, Megan McPhail, Manager of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. .\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Marty Lyons, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team joining us remotely. Marty and Michael will discuss our earnings results and guidance as well as provide a business update. Then we will open the call for questions.\nBefore we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers. As noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements.\nSuch statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, strategies, targets, estimates, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. For additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statements section in our news release we issued yesterday and the forward-looking statements in Risk Factors section in our filings with the SEC.\nLastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis unless otherwise noted. Now here's Marty, who will start on Page 4\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Megan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We had a solid quarter, and we're excited to share an update today on a number of recent developments. As always, our team continues to work hard to execute our strategic plan across all of our business segments, allowing us to deliver significant value to our customers and shareholders. Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2022 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to earnings of $0.80 per share in the second quarter of 2021.\nThe year-over-year results reflected increased infrastructure investments across all our business segments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. The key drivers of our second quarter results are outlined on this slide. I am pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver solid earnings growth in 2022 and are reaffirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.95 per share to $4.15 per share. Michael will discuss our second quarter earnings, 2022 earnings guidance and other related items in more detail later.\nMoving to Slide 5, you will find our strategic plan reiterated. We continue to invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks, enhance regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies and create and capitalize on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment.\nTurning now to Page 6, which highlights our commitment to the first pillar of our strategy, investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. Our strong long-term earnings growth guidance is primarily driven by our infrastructure investment and rate base growth plans, which are supported by constructive regulatory frameworks. You can see on the right side of this page, we continue to strategically invest significant capital in each of our business segments in order to maintain safe and reliable operations as we transition to a cleaner energy grid.\nRegarding regulatory matters, earlier this week, Ameren Missouri filed an electric rate review with the Missouri Public Service Commission requesting a $316 million annual revenue increase. This request reflects significant modernization upgrades to the electric grid for system reliability, resiliency and safety as well as investments to support the transition to cleaner energy for the benefit of our customers and local communities.\nIn our Illinois Electric business, we recently requested an $84 million revenue increase in our required annual electric distribution rate filing. Again, key drivers for this rate increase includes significant investments to enhance the grid for our customers and communities, which will deliver long-term benefits. Michael will cover these in more detail a bit later, and we will provide updates on these proceedings as they develop later this year.\nAs we invest to build a safer, stronger, smarter and cleaner energy grid for our customers, we also continue to work diligently to manage our costs, leverage our investments and optimize our performance. Moving now to Page 7, and the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Without question, energy policy at the federal and state levels and constructive regulatory frameworks that incentivize meaningful and needed infrastructure investments have never been more important as we look to reliably and securely transition to a cleaner energy future as affordably as possible.\nAs you know, late last week, it was announced that Senators Schumer and Manchin reached agreement on proposed legislation that would, among other things, extend significant incentives for clean energy development and deployment. Given the clean energy transition underway in Illinois and Missouri, as highlighted by our recent change to the Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan filed with the Missouri PSC in June and our goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2045, we are very excited about the potential benefits of this legislation.\nSpecifically, the credits proposed for wind, solar, storage, nuclear, carbon capture utilization and storage, or CCUS, and hydrogen will align very well with the significant investments proposed in the Missouri IRP. Importantly, the benefits of these tax incentives will ultimately lower the cost of the clean energy transition for our customers in Missouri and Illinois over time. These potential tax credits, when coupled with the significant clean energy funding made available through the infrastructure investment and JOBS Act passed earlier this year, will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers, communities and the country.\nI will also note that the proposed legislation includes a minimum corporate income tax for public companies with pretax book earnings above $1 billion. At the state level, as part of Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy Plan, a multiyear effort to strengthen the grid, our customers are benefiting from stronger poles, more resilient power lines, smart equipment including modern substations, and upgraded circuits to better withstand severe weather events and restore power more quickly. As we mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, Missouri Senate Bill 745, which enhances and extends the Smart Energy Plan, passed earlier this year with strong majority support in the general assembly.\nThe bill was later signed by Governor Parson. We believe extending Missouri's Smart Energy Plan will continue to benefit our customers and communities as we transform the energy grid of today to build a brighter energy future for generations to come and while creating significant economic development and jobs in the state. Moving to Page 8 for Illinois legislative matters. We continue to make progress working towards the implementation of the Illinois Energy Transition legislation enacted last year, including the performance metrics required by the legislation.\nAmeren Illinois has proposed 8 performance metrics, each worth 3 basis points of incentives for a total of 24 basis points of symmetric, equity return, upside or downside potential. The ICC staff is mostly aligned with Ameren Illinois on the performance metrics and has proposed a range of 20 to 24 total basis points of increased or decreased return opportunities. We expect a final order from the ICC by late September in the performance metrics docket. We look forward to the ICC's order and filing our first multiyear rate plan next year as we believe this legislation will support important energy grid investments and deliver value to customers.\nTurning to Page 9 for an update on our plan to accelerate the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center. Last month, in response to our notification to MISO of our intention to retire the energy center, MISO issued its final attachment Y report designating the generating units at the Rush Island Energy Center as system support resources. MISO also concluded that certain mitigation measures, including transmission upgrades, should occur to ensure reliability before the energy center is retired.\nThose transmission upgrade projects have been approved by the MISO, and we have started the design and procurement process associated with the upgrades which we expect to complete by late 2025. In the interim, until Rush Island can be retired, Ameren Missouri has proposed limiting operations at the energy center. The District Court is under no obligation or deadline to issue a rule modifying its remedy order to reflect the MISO SSR designation or proposed interim operating parameters. The original March 31, 2024, compliance date remains in effect unless extended by the court. We expect a decision in the near term.\nTurning now to Page 10 for an update on changes to our 2020 Ameren Missouri Integrated Resource Plan, which we filed in June. Our IRP is a 20-year energy plan created to ensure reliability for our customers for years to come. I'm excited to share with you that these changes to the plan accelerate our clean energy additions, reduce carbon emissions even further in the short term and accelerate the company's net-zero carbon emissions goal by 5 years.\nSpecifically, the plan targets a 60% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2040. And by 2045, our goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across all of Ameren. The new goals include both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, including other greenhouse gas emissions of methane, nitrous oxide and sulfur hexafluoride. We plan to achieve these goals by making significant investments in renewable energy, including 2,800 megawatts of renewable energy by 2030, representing an investment opportunity of $4.3 billion.\nThis is an increase of $1 billion from our 2022 -- or excuse me, our 2020 IRP. By 2040, in total, the plan includes 4,700 megawatts of renewable generation for a total investment opportunity of $7.5 billion. The plan also includes 1,200 megawatts of gas combined cycle generation by 2031, an investment opportunity of $1.7 billion, which will allow us to safely and reliably advance the net retirement time line of our fossil generation, including the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center.\nFurther, the plan includes 800 megawatts of battery storage by 2040, representing an investment opportunity of $650 million. We expect to add 1,200 megawatts of a clean dispatchable resource by 2042 and to also seek an extension of the operating license of our carbon-free Callaway Nuclear Energy Center beyond the current expiration date of 2044. These changes to the 2020 IRP will drive our ability to meet customers' rising needs and expectations for reliable, affordable and clean energy sources.\nAchieving these goals is dependent upon a variety of factors, including cost-effective advancements in innovative clean energy technologies and constructive federal and state energy and economic policies. We have issued a request for proposal to solicit solar and wind projects that will allow us to take the next steps and deliver the best value for our customers.\nOne thing is clear. Our IRP includes significant incremental investment opportunities, and we're very excited as we continue to execute our clean energy transition plan. Turning now to Page 11. Speaking of executing our clean energy transition plan, in July, we filed certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCN, with the Missouri Public Service Commission for 2 solar project acquisitions. Boomtown, a 150-megawatt solar energy center located in Southern Illinois, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2024. Huck Finn, a 200-megawatt solar energy center located in Eastern Missouri, would be Ameren's largest solar project to date, generating more than 25x the amount of energy of Missouri's largest existing solar facility.\nThis solar project is also expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2024. While the Missouri PSC is under no deadline to issue an order on the CCN filings, we expect decisions by March and April 2023 for the 200-megawatt and the 150-megawatt facilities, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect to announce further agreements for the acquisition of renewables between now and the first half of 2023.\nTurning to Page 12, and the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. This page provides an update on the MISO long-range transmission planning process. As we have discussed with you in the past, MISO completed a study outlining a potential road map of transmission investments through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions as well as electrification of the transportation sector, among other things.\nIn July, MISO approved Tranche 1, a set of projects located in MISO North, which is estimated to cost more than $10 billion. Of these projects, approximately $1.8 billion represent projects in our service territory that have been assigned to Ameren. We expect to refine the scope, cost estimates and time line for these projects over the remainder of this year. In addition to the assigned projects, MISO approved approximately $700 million of competitive projects that cross through our Missouri service territory, which provide additional potential investment opportunities. We are well positioned to compete for and successfully execute on these projects, given the location of the projects and our expertise constructing large regional transmission projects.\nLater this month, MISO is expected to post a schedule outlining the RFP process for competitive bidding with the first RFP expected to be issued by late September. The competitive bidding process is expected to take 12 to 24 months. For the projects assigned to Ameren, we expect the capital expenditures to begin in 2025 with the completion dates expected near the end of this decade. MISO has also begun work on 3 additional tranches and has indicated that an initial set of Tranche 2 projects, also located in MISO North, is expected to be approved in the second half of 2023.\nProjects included in Tranche 3 are expected to be located in MISO South, with approval scheduled by the end of 2024, while projects identified in Tranche 4 are expected to improve transfer capability between MISO North and MISO South and will be studied upon approval of Tranche 3. Turning then to Page 13. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. We have updated the investment opportunities to reflect the additional renewable and combined cycle generation included in the change to the IRP filed in June.\nWe now expect over $48 billion of investment opportunities over the next decade. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs in the future and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nMoving now to Page 14. We are focused on delivering a sustainable energy features for our customers, communities and our country. This slide summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition and focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainable growth goals. The change to the Ameren Missouri IRP filed in June supports our goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2045 and is also consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nWe also remain focused on supporting our communities, including our very robust supplier diversity program. Our strong sustainable growth proposition remains among the best in the industry. We have a robust pipeline of future investments that will continue to modernize the grid and enable a transition to a cleaner energy future. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com.\nTurning to Page 15. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2022 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. In February, we issued our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of a 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2022 through 2026. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment to each of our operating segments based on their constructive regulatory frameworks.\nWe expect Ameren's future dividend growth to be in line with our long-term earnings per share growth expectations and within a payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. We expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, which resulted in an attractive total return that compares favorably with our regulated utility peers. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.\nFinally, turning to Page 16. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Richard Mark on his retirement and extend my gratitude for his many contributions made to Ameren and our communities. Richard served in several leadership positions during his 20-year career at Ameren and was influential in the advancement of the electric and natural gas distribution grids throughout Southern and Central Illinois, including installing advanced technologies, improving reliability and creating thousands of jobs in addition to his strong community engagement.\nThank you, Richard, and I wish you well in your retirement. I would also like to introduce to you Ameren Illinois' new President, Lenny Singh. Lenny brings more than 30 years of utility experience serving in both electric and natural gas operations most recently as Senior Vice President of Consolidated Edison Company of New York. Over the course of his career, Lenny is focused on operational excellence and value creation, prioritizing safety, customer satisfaction, continuous improvement, action and accountability.\nI look forward to working with Lenny as he builds on Ameren Illinois success as we work to safely, reliably and securely drive the clean energy transition in the state of Illinois. Again, thank you all for joining us today, and I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported second quarter 2022 earnings of $0.80 per share compared to $0.80 per share for the year ago quarter. Slide 18 summarizes key drivers impacting earnings at each segment. I'd like to take a moment to highlight a few key variances for the quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, benefited from higher electric retail sales, driven by warmer early summer temperatures during the quarter compared to near-normal temperatures in the year ago period and higher electric rates.\nThe positive factors impacting earnings in Ameren Missouri were more than offset by, among other things, higher operations and maintenance expenses. The higher O&M reflected unfavorable market returns in 2022 on company-owned life insurance investments compared to favorable market returns in the year ago period. In addition, the higher O&M expenses were driven by the absence of refined coal credits in 2022, which had been a benefit to our coal-fired energy centers in 2021 and prior years and the increased transmission and distribution expenses, including storm costs.\nThe reduction in refined coal credits was anticipated and reflected in the new electric service rates effective earlier this year. In fact, year-to-date on M costs, excluding COLI, are largely in line with what we expected when we provide guidance in February. We remain focused on disciplined cost management for the second half of the year.\nBefore moving on, I'll touch on sales transfer in Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution year-to-date. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri residential and commercial customers increased about 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively, while weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Missouri industrial customers decreased about 0.5%. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential and commercial customers increased about 1.5% each year-to-date and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to Illinois industrial customers increased about 0.5%.\nRecall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling. Turning to Page 19. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2022 earnings guidance. We delivered solid earnings in the first half of 2022 and are well positioned to finish the year strong.\nAs Marty stated, we continue to expect 2022 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. As we reflect on our earnings for the full year results, the benefits we've seen from weather during the first half of the year and from the higher expected 30-year treasury rates are offset in part by unfavorable market returns on company-owned life insurance as well as higher-than-expected short-term and long-term borrowing rates.\nI encourage you to take these into consideration as you develop your expectations for the third quarter and full year earnings results. Turning now to Page 20 for an update on regulatory matters, starting with Ameren Missouri. Earlier this week, we filed for a $316 million electric revenue increase with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The request includes a 10.2% return on equity, a 51.9% equity ratio and a December 31, 2022, estimated rate base of $11.6 billion.\nDrivers of the requested increase our investments are the Smart Energy Plan, including increased cost of capital and depreciation expense as well as increased net fuel expense due to reduced off-system sales driven by expected reduced operations at Rush Island. As Marty noted earlier, customers are benefiting from investments made under the Smart Energy Plan to strengthen the grid, including infrastructure upgrades bolstering reliability and resiliency, installation of smart meters and an improvement in reliability of up to 40% on circuits with new smart technology upgrades.\nWe expect the Missouri PSC decision by June 2023 and new rates to be affected by July 1, 2023. We look forward to working with all key stakeholders on this request. Moving to Page 21 and Ameren Illinois regulatory matters. In April, we made our required annual electric distribution rate update filing. Under Illinois performance-based ratemaking, these annual rate updates systematically adjust cash flows over time for changes in cost of service and true up of any prior period over or under recovery of such costs.\nIn late June, the ICC staff recommended a $60 million base rate increase compared to our updated request of an $84 million base rate increase. The $24 million variance is primarily driven by a difference in the common equity ratio as we propose 54% compared to the ICC staff's recommended 50%. For perspective, the order received from the ICC last December included a common equity ratio of 51%. An ICC decision is expected in December with new rates expected to be effective in January 2023.\nOn Page 22, we provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. On April 1, Ameren Missouri issued $525 million, a 3.9% green first mortgage bonds due 2052. Proceeds of the offering are used to fund capital expenditures and refinance short-term debt. In order to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan consistent with the guidance in February, this year, we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity under our aftermarket equity program.\nWe have fulfilled all of our '22 equity needs through the Ford sales agreement entered into as April 1, and we expect to issue 3.4 million common shares by the end of this year upon settlement. Further, as of July 12, approximately $225 million of the $300 million of equity outlined in 2023 has been sold forward under that program.\nFinally, turning to Page 23. We have had a solid first half, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2022 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. Today, we've outlined significant and exciting investment opportunities over the back half of our current capital plan and beyond that are not reflected in our 2022 to 2026 capital plan.\nConsistent with our approach in the past, we will step back and take a comprehensive look at our investment opportunities and provide our 5-year capital plan for 2023 through 2027 during our year-end conference call in February. As we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers.\nThe bottom line is that we are well positioned to continue executing our current plan. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder returns to where that converts very favorably to our peers. That concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk. You may now begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of IR, Ameren Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning.

Lyons\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We've had a solid start to the year, and our team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our business segments, allowing us to deliver consistently strong results for our customers and shareholders.\nYesterday, we announced first quarter 2022 earnings of $0.97 per share compared to earnings of $0.91 per share in the first quarter of 2021. The year-over-year increase of $0.06 per share reflected increased infrastructure investments across all of our business segments that will drive significant long-term benefits for our customers. The key drivers of our first quarter results are outlined on this slide.\nI'm pleased to report that we remain on track to deliver within our 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.95 per share to $4.15 per share. Michael will discuss our first quarter earnings, 2022 earnings guidance, and other related items in more detail later.\nMoving to Slide 5, you will find our strategic plan reiterated. We continue to invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks; enhance regulatory frameworks and advocate for responsible energy and economic policies; and create and capitalize on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment.\nTurning now to Page 6, which highlights our commitment to the first pillar of our strategy, investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. Our strong long-term earnings growth guidance is primarily driven by our infrastructure investment and rate base growth plans, which are supported by constructive regulatory frameworks. Our plan includes strategically allocating capital to all 4 of our business segments. You can see on the right side of this page, we have invested significant capital in each of our business segments during the first 3 months of this year in order to maintain safe and more reliable operations, all while facilitating and driving a clean energy transition.\nRegarding regulatory matters, in late February, new Ameren Missouri electric and natural gas service rates went into effect, reflecting significant investment in grid modernization, reliability, resiliency, security and renewable energy generation. In addition, in April, Ameren Illinois filed its required annual electric distribution rate update reflecting similar infrastructure investments and service improvements in that jurisdiction and requesting an $83 million increase. Ongoing investment across all 4 business segments is building a safer, stronger, smarter and cleaner energy grid for our customers now and in the future. At the same time, we are maintaining discipline with regard to costs, leveraging our investments, and focusing on continuous improvement to optimize our performance and drive greater value for our customers.\nMoving to Page 7, in the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Over the last several years, we have worked hard to enhance the regulatory frameworks in both Missouri and Illinois to enable meaningful and needed infrastructure investments to support reliability, resiliency and safety. In order to consistently deliver strong value for our customers, communities and shareholders, while practicing responsible environmental stewardship, we continue to work towards enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies.\nWorkshops related to the implementation of the Illinois Energy Transition Legislation enacted last year are ongoing and performance metrics related to the multiyear rate plan are expected to be approved by the ICC by late September. We believe this legislation will support important energy grid investments and will deliver value to customers, such as the utility-owned solar and optional battery storage pilot projects in 2 communities, Peoria and East St. Louis. We are excited to announce that we began construction of an approximate $10 million 2.5-megawatt solar energy facility in East St. Louis in early March. This energy center will strengthen the energy grid, while building a cleaner energy future for this Illinois community.\nBefore moving on, I'd like to briefly discuss recent energy and capacity purchases made by the Illinois Power Agency on behalf of our Ameren Illinois customers the upcoming June 2022 through May 2023 planning year. As you know, global events have been impacting the cost of energy commodities and power prices in the Midwest have been elevated. Further, a combination of factors, including higher energy usage, a reduction of dispatchable generation and the construct of MISO's capacity market are all being cited as causes of a spike in regional capacity prices. Unfortunately, as a result of these factors, some of our Illinois customers will be seeing a meaningful increase to the energy supply component of their bills beginning in June.\nIt is important to note that energy and capacity costs are passed on to our Ameren Illinois customers through a rider with no markup. While factors leading to these increases and potential prospective mitigation will undoubtedly be discussed among stakeholders, our approach remains the same. We will continue to focus on supporting our customers and communities by connecting them with bill assistance where needed, and continuing to invest strategically to support a responsible clean energy transition in Illinois.\nMoving now to Page 8 in Missouri legislative matters. As part of Ameren Missouri's Smart Energy Plan, a multiyear effort to strengthen the grid, our customers are benefiting from stronger poles, more resilient power lines, smart equipment, including modern substations, and upgraded circuits to better withstand severe weather events and restore power more quickly. I am pleased to report that yesterday afternoon, Senate Bill 745 passed by strong majority support in the general assembly. This bill enhances the Smart Energy Plan Legislation enacted in 2018.\nMore specifically, the bill extends the sunset date on the current Smart Energy Plan Legislation through December 31, 2028, with an extension through December 31, 2033, if the utility requests and the PSC approves. The bill also modifies the rate cap beginning in 2024, from the current 2.85% compound annual all-in cap on growth in customer rates to a 2.5% average annual cap on rate impacts of PISA deferrals. In addition, the bill expands and extends economic development incentives and provides for a property tax tracker. The bill will now be sent to the governor for Signature.\nWe believe extending Missouri's Smart Energy Plan will continue to benefit our customers and communities as we transform the energy grid of today to build a brighter energy future for generations to come, all while creating significant economic development and jobs in the state.\nTurning to Page 9, we will now provide an update on developments related to our plan to accelerate the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center. As discussed on our year-end earnings call in late February, Ameren Missouri filed an attachment Y with MISO notifying it of our intention to close the energy center. As a result of that filing, MISO is now studying the grid reliability implications of Rush Island's planned closure in order to determine any investments and interim operating parameters required prior to closure in order to mitigate system reliability risks.\nI would note, MISO's preliminary study completed in January 2022 recommended transmission upgrades and indicated additional voltage support will be needed on the transmission system to ensure reliability. While MISO is under no deadline to issue a final report, we expect a draft report will be issued this month. The District Court, which is awaiting MISO's analysis is also under no deadline to issue a final order regarding the accelerated retirement date. Ameren Missouri expects to file an update to its 2020 Integrated Resource Plan with the Missouri PSC in June, which will reflect the expected accelerated retirement date of the Rush Island Energy Center. Such filing will also include a discussion of the expected use of securitization in order to recover the remaining investment in Rush Island. We continue to work with all parties involved to move forward with the accelerated retirement in the most responsible fashion.\nOn Page 10, we turn our focus to the third pillar of our strategy, creating and capitalizing on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. This page provides an update on the MISO long-range transmission planning process. As we have discussed with you in the past, MISO completed a study, outlining the potential road map of transmission investments through 2039, taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation, based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates, and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions as well as electrification of the transportation sector, among other things.\nUnder MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emission reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment would be necessary in the MISO footprint. Under its Future 3 scenario, which resulted in an approximate 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed. As part of Tranche 1, MISO working with key stakeholders, including transmission owners, has identified projects located in MISO North estimated to total more than $10 billion.\nThe projects crossing through our Missouri and Illinois service territories provide significant investment opportunities. We believe we are well positioned to execute on these projects, given the location of the projects and our expertise constructing large regional transmission projects. MISO's approval of Tranche 1 is expected in late July.\nWork on 3 additional tranches has begun and MISO has indicated that an initial set of Tranche 2 projects, also located at MISO North, is scheduled to be approved in the first quarter of 2023. Projects included in Tranche 3 are expected to be located in MISO South with approval scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2024, while projects identified in Tranche 4 are expected to improve transfer capability between MISO North and MISO South with approval scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nMoving now to Page 11. We are focused on delivering a sustainable energy future for our customers, communities and our country. This slide summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition and focus on environmental, social, governance, and sustainable growth goals. Our preferred plan included in Ameren Missouri's 2020 IRP supports our goal of net zero carbon emission by 2050 as well as interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels by 2030 and 2040, respectively, which is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nAs previously noted, the IRP will be updated in June to reflect, among other things, MISO's long-range transmission planning, legislative and regulatory developments, and the early retirement of Rush Island. We continue to work diligently to optimize our sustainability value proposition, including our clean energy transition. And just last month, we announced completion of our newest clean energy resource, a 6-megawatt solar facility. The Montgomery County Solar Center is part of our Missouri Community Solar Program, which began in 2018, offering customers the opportunity to invest in solar energy generation in their community through a shared system.\nThe energy center is now up and running and supporting more than 2,000 customers who want to take part in clean energy generation without having to pay high upfront cost to install solar equipment on their own roofs or property. The program is fully subscribed, and we are evaluating expansion opportunities at additional sites. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. I'm excited to say that this week, DiversityInc announced, once again, that they have named Ameren #1 on their top utilities list for diversity and inclusion, a list we have proudly been part of since 2009. DiversityInc also recognized Ameren as a top company for veterans, black executives as well as a top company for ESG among all industries.\nThis slide highlights a few of the many things we are doing for our customers and communities, including being an industry leader in diversity, equity and inclusion. Further, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. We recently named our first Chief Sustainability and Diversity Officer to further optimize our ESG impact by aligning these interconnected areas.\nFinally, this slide summarizes our very strong sustainable growth proposition, which remains among the best in the industry. As mentioned on our call in February, we have a robust pipeline of future investments that will continue to modernize the grid and enable the transition to a cleaner energy future. This pipeline includes over $45 billion of investment opportunities over the next decade that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making their energy grids stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create stronger economies and thousands of jobs for the communities we serve.\nI encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition. You can find all of our ESG-related reports at amereninvestors.com.\nTurning to Page 12. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2022 and beyond will deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. In February, we issued our 5-year growth plan, which included our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth rate from 2022 through 2026. This earnings growth is primarily driven by strong rate base growth, supported by strategic allocation of infrastructure investment, to each of our operating segments based on their constructive regulatory frameworks. I will note renewable generation and regionally beneficial transmission projects represent additional investment opportunities.\nWe expect to announce further agreements for the acquisition of renewables over the course of this year and to file certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCNs, with the Missouri PSC after the updates to the 2020 IRP have been filed in June. We expect to deliver strong long-term earnings and dividend growth, which results in an attractive total return that compares favorably with our regulated utility peers. I'm confident in our ability to execute our investment plans and strategies across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team to get it done.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today, and I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 14 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported first quarter 2022 earnings of $0.97 per share compared to $0.91 per share for the year ago quarter. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.01 per share due to several factors. Earnings increased by approximately $0.03 per share from higher electric retail sales driven by colder-than-normal winter temperatures in the first quarter of 2022 compared to near normal winter temperatures in the year ago period. We've included on this page, the year-over-year weather normalized sales variances for the quarter that showed the total sales to be up 0.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nThe earnings comparison also reflected investments in infrastructure and wind generation eligible for PISA and RESRAM, which benefited earnings in January and February by $0.03 until rates were reset. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings $0.05 per share. This was driven in part by the unfavorable market returns in 2022 that occurred during the first quarter on the cash surrender value of our company-owned life insurance.\nMoving to other segments. Ameren Transmission earnings increased $0.03 year-over-year, which reflected the absence of the March 2021 FERC order addressing material and supplies inventories, and increased infrastructure investments.\nEarnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.01, reflecting increased infrastructure investments and higher delivery service rates that were effective in late January 2021 partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution earnings also increased $0.01 year-over-year, which reflected increased infrastructure investments and a higher allowed ROE under performance-based ratemaking of approximately 8.5% compared to approximately 8.2% for the year ago quarter.\nAnd finally, Ameren Parent and other results were comparable to the first quarter of 2021.\nBefore moving on, I'll touch on the sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in the quarter. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers decreased about 1.5%. And weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased about 0.5% and 1.5%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.\nTurning to Page 15. I would now like to briefly touch on key drivers impacting our 2022 earnings guidance. We're off to a strong start in 2022. And as Marty stated, we continue to expect 2022 diluted earnings to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share. Select earnings considerations for the balance of the year are listed on this page and are supplemental to the key drivers and assumptions discussed on our earnings call in February. I encourage you to take these into consideration as you develop your expectations for our second quarter earnings results.\nTurning now to Page 16. For details during the Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution rate increase request. In April, Ameren Illinois submitted a request for an $83 million revenue increase to the ICC in its annual performance-based rate update. Our Illinois customers are continuing to realize the benefits of our significant investments in energy infrastructure. Since performance-based ratemaking began in 2012, reliability has improved over 20% and over 1,400 jobs have been created. J.D. Power ranked Ameren Illinois #1 in residential customer satisfaction in the Midwest, among large electric utility providers for 2021.\nMajor investments included in this request are the installation of outage avoidance and detection technology, integration of storm-hardening equipment and implementation of new technology to optimize interaction with customers. We expect the ICC's decision by December 2022 with rates effective in January 2023.\nOn Page 17, we provide a financing update. We continue to feel very good about our financial position. On April 1, Ameren Missouri issued $525 million of 3.9% green first mortgage bonds due 2052. We intend to use these proceeds of the offering to fund capital expenditures and refinance short-term debt. Subsequently, we plan to allocate an amount equal to the proceeds to sustainable projects meeting certain eligibility criteria, including investments in transmission and distribution infrastructure designed to make the system more resilient and improve customer reliability and investments in energy efficiency.\nAdditionally, in order for us to maintain our credit rating and a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, consistent with the guidance in February, this year we expect to issue approximately $300 million of common equity under our at-the-market equity program. We're well positioned to fulfill our 2022 equity needs through forward sales agreements entered in as of April 1 and expect to issue 3.4 million common shares by the end of this year upon settlement. Together with the issuance under our 401(k) and DRPlus programs, our $750 million ATM equity program is expected to support our equity needs through 2023.\nOn Page 18, we summarize our green bond issuance over the last few years. Our sustainability financing framework, one of the first of its kind for a utility in the nation, supports Ameren's sustainability goals and the current target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 as well as other social initiatives. The financing proceeds from the issuance of the framework will be allocated to eligible environmental and social projects, including renewable generation, climate change adaptation, clean transportation, socioeconomic advancement and the employment creation, to name just a few.\nFinally, turning to Page 19. We're well positioned to continue executing our plan. We're off to a solid start and expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2022 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy.\nAs we look to the longer term, we continue to expect strong earnings per share growth driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andrew Kirk, Director of Investor Relations for Ameren Corporation. Thank you, Mr. Kirk, you may begin.\n\nAndrew Kirk\n\nDirector of IR, Ameren Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning. On the call with me today are Warner Baxter, our Executive Chairman; Marty Lyons, our President, Chief Executive Officer; and Michael Moehn, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; as well as other members of the Ameren management team joining us remotely.\nWarner will begin with a business overview. He will be followed by Marty, who will provide a strategic and business update for 2022 and beyond. And Michael will wrap up our prepared remarks with a discussion of key financial matters, including our earnings guidance. Then we will open the call for questions.\nBefore we begin, let me cover a few administrative details. This call contains time-sensitive data that is accurate only as of the date of today's live broadcast and redistribution of this broadcast is prohibited. To assist with our call this morning, we have posted a presentation on the amereninvestors.com homepage that will be referenced by our speakers.\nAs noted on Page 2 of the presentation, comments made during this conference call may contain statements that are commonly referred to as forward-looking statements. Such statements include those about future expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, strategies, targets, estimates, objectives, events, conditions and financial performance. We caution you that various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.\nFor additional information concerning these factors, please read the forward-looking statements section in the news release we issued yesterday and the forward-looking statements and Risk Factors sections in our filings with the SEC. Lastly, all per share earnings amounts discussed during today's presentation, including earnings guidance, are presented on a diluted basis, unless otherwise noted.\nNow here's Warner, who will start on Page 4.\n\nWarner L. Baxter\n\nExecutive Chairman, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. To begin, I'd like to remind everyone that effective January 1 of this year, I became Executive Chairman of Ameren, Marty Lyons became President and CEO. Our transition to this new forward-thinking leadership structure is going very well. In light of the significant activities taking place in our industry, this new structure is enabling me to focus on key energy and economic policy matters and working with Marty on key strategic initiatives. At the same time, Marty has hit the ground running, leading the Ameren team in overall strategy development and execution, as well as managing the significant day-to-day operational and other responsibilities of the CEO.\nOur industry is transforming and millions of customers in Missouri and Illinois are depending on us to achieve our vision, leading the way to a sustainable energy future and our mission to power the quality of life. Each year provides a new set of opportunities and challenges, but one thing that remains constant in Ameren is our strong commitment to safely deliver reliable, cleaner and affordable electric and natural gas service.\nOur team continues to effectively execute our strategic plan across all of our businesses. including safely and successfully completing billions of dollars of value-adding projects for our customers; advocating for constructive federal and state energy policies and regulatory outcomes; leaning further forward on our digital transformation; and pursuing a wide range of sustainability goals. Simply put, continued strong execution of our strategic plan is delivering significant value to our customers, communities, shareholders and the environment, which brings me to a discussion of our 2021 performance.\nYesterday, we announced 2021 earnings of $3.84 per share compared to earnings of $3.50 per share in 2020 or an increase of nearly 10%. Excluding the impact from weather, 2021 normalized earnings were $3.82 per share or an increase of approximately 8% from 2020's weather-normalized earnings of $3.54 per share. We made significant investments in energy infrastructure in 2021 and that resulted in a more reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid as well as contributed to strong rate base growth at all of our business segments.\nAs outlined on this page, we also achieved several constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes that will facilitate additional infrastructure investments while keeping our customers' rates affordable. This strong execution of our strategy in 2021 will continue to drive significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nTurning to Page 5. As you can see on this page, our laser focus on keeping our customers at the center of our strategy has delivered strong results for our customers. Our investments in infrastructure have resulted in top quartile reliability, affordability and customer satisfaction. The frequency of outages on our system continues to trend downward, resulting from our infrastructure investments, coupled with a focus on innovation and continuous improvement. Our disciplined cost management has helped drive our electric rates approximately 25% below Midwest and national averages. And I'm extremely proud to say that J.D. Power recently ranked Ameren Illinois #1 residential customer satisfaction in the Midwest, among large electric utility providers, with Ameren Missouri ranking third.\nFurther, we have continued to deliver superior value to our shareholders, as you can see on Page 6. Our weather-normalized core earnings per share have risen 84% and an approximate 8% compound annual growth rate since we exited our unregulated generation business in 2013, while our dividends paid per share have increased approximately 38% over the same time period. This has driven a strong total return of nearly 220% for our shareholders from 2013 to 2021, which was significantly above our utility peer average.\nI'm very pleased with our past performance. You can rest assured that our team will remain focused on enhancing performance in 2022 and in the years ahead so that we can continue to deliver superior value to our customers, communities and shareholders.\nTurning to Page 7. This page summarizes our strong sustainability value proposition and focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainable growth goals. Beginning with environmental stewardship, in September 2020, Ameren announced its transformational plan to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 across all of our operations in Missouri and Illinois. This plan includes interim carbon emission reduction targets of 50% and 85% below 2005 levels by 2030 and 2040, respectively, which is consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement and limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We plan to file an update to the 2020 integrated resource plan in the first half of this year, which Marty will discuss a bit later.\nIn 2021, we acquired the 300-megawatt Atchison Renewable Energy Center located in Northwest Missouri, our second wind generation investment. This acquisition is a significant step forward, along the path to meeting our clean energy goals. We also have a strong long-term commitment to our customers and communities to be socially responsible and economically impactful. This slide highlights a few of the many things we are doing for our customers and communities, including being an industry leader in diversity, equity and inclusion.\nWe were honored to be recognized again by Diversity Inc. as one of the top utilities in 2021, in addition to a top company for ESG. And we continue to help drive inclusive economic growth by spending approximately $900 million with diverse suppliers in 2021, an 11% increase over 2020. Further, our strong corporate governance is led by a diverse Board of Directors focused on strong oversight that's aligned with ESG matters. And our executive compensation practices include performance metrics that are tied to diversity, equity and inclusion and progress towards a cleaner energy future.\nFinally, this slide summarizes our very strong sustainable growth proposition, which remains among the best in the industry. Today, we published our updated ESG investor presentation called Leading the Way to a Sustainable Energy Future, available at amereninvestors.com. This presentation demonstrates how we have been effectively integrating our focus on environmental, social, governance and sustainability matters into our corporate strategy. I encourage you to take some time to read more about our strong sustainability value proposition.\nAs noted previously, as part of my new role of Executive Chairman, I will focus on key energy and economic policy matters, including through my leadership roles at the Edison Electric Institute and the Electric Power Research Institute as well as engaging with key stakeholders. Speaking of key energy and economic policy matters, we continue to strongly support and advocate for a robust federal clean energy tax package. In particular, we support clean energy transition tax incentives, including wind, solar and nuclear production tax credits, electric vehicle tax credits, transmission and storage investment tax credits as well as direct pay and normalization outbound provisions.\nWe strongly believe these forward-thinking policies to address climate change will advance the clean energy transition in a safe, reliable and affordable fashion and will deliver significant long-term benefits for our customers, communities and country. We will continue to work with key stakeholders, along with our industry colleagues to advance constructive federal energy and economic policies.\nIn closing, our team has accomplished a great deal over the last several years. Their relentless commitment to our vision, mission and strategy has delivered strong value to our customers, communities and shareholders. Looking ahead, I'm even more excited about our future because I believe these efforts have positioned Ameren very well to deliver superior value over many years to come.\nNow here is Marty to tell you how our team will keep delivering under this strategy in the future.\n\nMartin J. Lyons\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Warner. Before I jump into the details, I would like to extend my appreciation to all of my coworkers for their dedication in 2021. Our accomplishments during the year are a result of their hard work and focus on executing our strategy, which has been delivering significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders.\nGoing forward, our strategy remains the same, which is to invest in and operate our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks, enhance regulatory frameworks, advocate for responsible energy and economic policies, and create and capitalize on opportunities for investment for the benefit of our customers, shareholders and the environment. As Chief Executive Officer, my focus is to drive continuous improvement as we execute our strategy and take Ameren to higher heights.\nMoving now to Page 9. Yesterday afternoon, we announced that we expect our 2022 earnings to be in a range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share. Based on the midpoint of the range, this represents 8% earnings per share growth compared to the midpoint of our initial 2021 guidance range. Michael will provide you with more details on our 2022 guidance a bit later.\nBuilding on the strong execution of our strategy and our robust earnings growth over the past several years, we continue to expect to deliver long-term earnings growth that is among the best in the industry. We expect to deliver 6% to 8% compound annual earnings per share growth from 2022 through 2026 using the midpoint of our 2022 guidance, $4.05 per share as the base. Our long-term earnings growth will be driven by continued execution of our strategy, including investing in infrastructure for the benefit of our customers while keeping rates affordable.\nOur dividend is another important element of our strong total shareholder return. I am pleased to report that last week, Ameren's Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase of 7.3%, resulting in an annualized dividend rate of $2.36 per share. This increase reflects confidence by Ameren's Board of Directors in the outlook for our businesses and management's ability to execute its strategy for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders. Looking ahead, we expect Ameren's future dividend growth to be in line with our long-term earnings per share growth expectations and within a payout ratio range of 55% to 70%. And while I'm very pleased with our past performance, we are not sitting back and taking a breath.\nTurning to Page 10. The first pillar of our strategy stresses investing in and operating our utilities in a manner consistent with existing regulatory frameworks. The strong long-term earnings growth I just discussed is primarily driven by our rate base growth plan. Today, we are rolling forward our 5-year investment plan. And as you can see, we expect to grow our rate base at an approximate 7% compound annual rate for the 2021 through 2026 period. This growth is driven by our robust capital plan of approximately $17 billion over the next 5 years that will deliver significant value to our customers and the communities we serve.\nOur plan includes strategically allocating capital to all 4 of our business segments. Importantly, renewable generation and regionally beneficial transmission represent additional investment opportunities. We expect to file an update to our 2020 Missouri Integrated Resource Plan in the first half of this year, in light of the accelerated retirement of our Rush Island energy center. This filing will include a comprehensive set of updated assumptions, taking into account MISO's long-range transmission planning process and potential legislative and regulatory developments at the federal level among other things. This updated planning process is underway, and we fully expect it to underscore the need for expansion of our renewable generation portfolio and transmission investment.\nWe continue to work in earnest with developers to acquire renewable generation projects to be completed in 2024 through 2026, as evidenced by the announcement earlier this week of an agreement to acquire a 150-megawatt solar energy project. We expect to announce further agreements over the course of this year and to file certificates of convenience and necessity, or CCN, with the Missouri PSC after the updates to the 2020 IRP have been filed. Finally, we remain focused on disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable and improve earned returns in all of our businesses.\nMoving to Page 11. As we look to the future, our 5-year plan is not only focused on delivering strong results through 2026, but it is also designed to position Ameren for success over the next decade and beyond. We believe that a safe, reliable, resilient, secure and cleaner energy grid will be increasingly important and bring even greater value to our customers, our communities and shareholders. With this long-term view in mind, we are making investments that will position Ameren to provide safe and reliable electric and natural gas service but also to meet our customers' future energy needs and rising expectations and support our transition to a cleaner energy future.\nThe right side of this page shows that our allocation of capital is expected to grow our electric and natural gas energy delivery investments to be 84% of our rate base and coal-fired generation to decline to just 6% of rate base by the end of 2026. Only 4% of the capital expenditures in our 5-year plan are expected to be spent on coal-related projects. Importantly, our 5-year plan does not reflect the expected early retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center or investment opportunities associated with renewable generation and regionally beneficial transmission projects. The bottom line is that we are taking steps today across the board to position Ameren for success in 2022 and beyond.\nTurning now to Page 12. Looking ahead over the next decade, we have a robust pipeline of investment opportunities of over $45 billion that will deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders by making our energy grid stronger, smarter and cleaner. Of course, our investment opportunities will not only create a stronger, smarter and cleaner energy grid to meet our customers' needs and exceed their expectations, but they will also create thousands of jobs for our local economies. Maintaining constructive energy policies that support robust investment in energy infrastructure and a transition to a cleaner future in a responsible fashion will be critical to meeting our country's energy needs in the future and delivering on our customers' expectations.\nMoving now to Page 13. As we have discussed with you in the past, MISO completed a study outlining the potential road map of transmission projects through 2039. Taking into consideration the rapidly evolving generation mix that includes significant additions of renewable generation, based on announced utility integrated resource plans, state mandates and goals for clean energy or carbon emission reductions, among other things. Under MISO's Future 1 scenario, which is the scenario that resulted in an approximate 60% carbon emissions reduction below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $30 billion of future transmission investment would be necessary in the MISO footprint. Under its Future 3 scenario, which resulted in an 80% reduction in carbon emissions below 2005 levels by 2039, MISO estimates approximately $100 billion of transmission investment in the MISO footprint would be needed. It is clear that investment in transmission is going to play a critical role in the energy transition. And we are well positioned to plan and execute potential projects in the future for the benefit of our customers and country.\nI am pleased to report that in January, MISO transmission owners and MISO reached an agreement on a revision to the cost allocation for certain of these important regional transmission projects. The cost allocation tariff revisions were submitted to FERC for approval on February 4. The revisions allow for allocation of project costs within the subregion where the benefits are recognized. Previous regional benefit project costs have been spread broadly across the MISO region, which was prior to the addition of the MISO South subregion. Comments are due by March 7. MISO and MISO transmission owners have requested an effective date of May 19, 2022. We continue to work with MISO and other key stakeholders and believe certain projects outlined in Future 1 are likely to be included in this year's MISO transmission planning process, which is expected to be completed in mid-2022.\nTurning now to Page 14 and an update on our Rush Island Energy Center. As you may recall, in 2011, the Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri, alleging that in performing certain projects at the Rush Island Energy Center, it violated the new source review provisions of the Clean Air Act. In 2017, the District Court issued a liability ruling and in September 2019, ordered the installation of pollution control equipment at the Rush Island Energy Center. In November, the U.S. Court of Appeals denied Ameren Missouri's request for reconsideration of its decision affirming the District Court's order that requires installation of a scrubber at Rush Island Energy Center in order to continue operations. Subsequently, Ameren Missouri announced its intention to retire the energy center in lieu of installing a scrubber and requested a modification from the District Court of its previous order to allow for plant closure, along with time to address any reliability issues.\nAmeren Missouri expects to make an Attachment Y filing soon, formally notifying MISO of its intention to retire the Rush Island Energy Center. MISO will then conduct a reliability assessment. A preliminary study completed by MISO in January of 2022, indicated that in advance of retirement, transmission upgrades and additional voltage support are needed on the transmission system to ensure reliability. The preliminary MISO reliability study was filed with the District Court, which is under no deadline to issue an order regarding our request to modify the September 2019 remedy order. As stated earlier, in light of these developments, Ameren Missouri expects to file an update to the Integrated Resource Plan with the Missouri PSC in the first half of 2022, which will reflect the expected accelerated retirement date of the Rush Island Energy Center. Such filing will also reflect the expected use of securitization in order to recover the remaining investment in Rush Island.\nLastly, this week at the Missouri PSC staff's request, the commission directed them to review various matters associated with our plans to retire Rush Island. Overall, we understand the desire of the commission and staff to develop a deeper understanding of our decision to accelerate closure of Rush Island and related system reliability considerations. We welcome the review and believe it will be good for the commission and staff as well as all stakeholders to have a deeper understanding of this matter. From our standpoint, it should also help to inform future rate review, IRP and securitization proceedings.\nBefore leaving this slide, I would also like to provide some insight on recent findings proposed by the EPA related to our Sioux and Meramec Energy Center impoundments. Last month, Ameren Missouri received notice of an interim decision by the EPA that has rejected Ameren Missouri's request to extend the time line for operating certain impoundments located at the Sioux and Meramec energy centers until a replacement pound could be built at Sioux and in the case of Meramec, the energy center retires, which is expected later this year. We are pursuing options to address the EPA decision and at this time, do not expect any significant impacts on operations. Meramec will close as planned by the end of 2022.\nMoving to Page 15 to the second pillar of our strategy, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible energy and economic policies. Over the years, we have been successful in executing this element of our strategy by focusing on delivering value to our customers through investments in energy infrastructure and extensive collaboration with key stakeholders in all of our regulatory jurisdictions. I am very pleased to report progress continued last year when the Illinois energy transition legislation was enacted. This is a constructive law that addresses the key objectives, and we felt were important for our customers and the communities we serve. The law established a new forward-thinking regulatory framework that will enable us to continue to make important infrastructure investments to enhance the reliability and resiliency of the energy grid as well as enable us to invest in 2 solar or solar plus battery storage pilot projects. It will also give us the ability to earn fair returns on these investments.\nThe Illinois energy law allows for an electric utility to opt in to a multiyear rate plan effective for 4 years beginning in 2024. We are currently working with key stakeholders through various workshops, which will continue over the course of 2022 to establish specific procedures, including performance metrics to implement this legislation. We expect performance metrics to be approved by the ICC by late September. Subject to finalizing key aspects of this rate-making framework, we anticipate filing a multiyear rate plan by January 20, 2023.\nMoving to Missouri legislative matters, a key piece of legislation was filed for consideration in this year's session. Bills have been introduced in both the House and the Senate to enhance the Smart Energy Plan legislation enacted in 2018. As part of Missouri's Smart Energy Plan, a multiyear effort to strengthen the grid, our customers are benefiting from stronger poles, more resilient power lines, smart equipment and upgraded circuits to better withstand severe weather events and restore power more quickly. The proposed legislation would enhance and extend the existing regulatory framework. It would modify the rate cap from the current 2.85% compound annual all-in cap on growth in customer rates, to a 2.5% average annual cap on rates on rate impacts of PISA deferrals. In addition, the proposed legislation would expand and extend economic development incentives as well as remove the sunset date. With all of this in mind, we are focused on working with key stakeholders to get this important legislation passed this year.\nMoving to Page 16. Over the last several years, we have worked hard to enhance the regulatory frameworks in both Missouri and Illinois to help drive additional infrastructure investments that will benefit customers and shareholders. At the same time, we have been very focused on disciplined cost management to keep rates affordable. Since opting into constructive regulatory frameworks, significant investments have been made, reliability has improved, rates have remained relatively flat, customer satisfaction has increased and thousands of jobs have been created. While these are great wins for our customers and communities, we are not done.\nTurning to Page 17. As you can see from this chart, our total fuel and purchase power and operations and maintenance expenses have decreased 3% compared to 2016 levels. And we will remain relentlessly focused on continuous improvement and disciplined cost management as we look forward to the next 5 years. This will not only include continuing the robust cost management initiatives implemented over the past 2 years due to COVID-19, but also several other customer affordability initiatives. These initiatives include the automation and optimization of our processes, including leveraging the benefits from significant past and future investments in digital technologies and grid modernization.\nMoving to Page 18. To sum up our value proposition, we remain firmly convinced that the execution of our strategy in 2022 and beyond will continue to deliver superior value to our customers, shareholders and the environment. We believe our expectation of 6% to 8% compound annual earnings growth from 2022 through 2026, driven by strong rate base growth, compares very favorably with our regulated utility peers. I am confident in our ability to execute our customer-focused strategy and investment plans across all 4 of our business segments as we have an experienced and dedicated team with a track record of execution that has positioned us well for future success.\nFurther, our shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. And the strong earnings growth expectations we outlined today position us well for future dividend growth. Simply put, we believe our strong earnings and dividend growth outlook result in a very attractive total return opportunity for shareholders.\nFinally, turning to Page 19. I would like to take the opportunity to introduce to you Ameren Missouri's new Chairman and President, Mark Birk. Over the last 2 years, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to lead the Ameren Missouri organization and work closely with Mark. Mark has been an invaluable part of the Ameren team over the last 35 years. Prior to his new role, Mark served as Ameren Missouri's Senior Vice President of Customer and Power Operations. And over the course of his career, he has held numerous corporate and operations roles, including oversight of strategy and planning, business risk management, safety, nuclear operations as well as a host of electric and natural gas operational areas. I look forward to working with Mark in the future in our new roles.\nAgain, thank you all for joining us today. And I will now turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael L. Moehn\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Chairman of Ameren Missouri & President of Ameren Services, Ameren Corporation\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning, everyone. Turning now to Page 21 of our presentation. Yesterday, we reported 2021 earnings of $3.84 per share compared to earnings of $3.50 per share in 2020, an increase of 9.7%. Earnings in Ameren Missouri, our largest segment, increased $0.25 per share from $1.77 per share in 2020 to $2.02 per share in 2021. Increased investments in infrastructure and wind generation, eligible for plant and service accounting and the Renewable Energy Standard Rate Adjustment Mechanism, or RESRAM, positively impacted earnings by $0.21 per share. Higher electric retail sales also increased earnings by approximately $0.16 per share, largely due to continued economic recovery in 2021 compared to unfavorable impacts of COVID-19 in the year ago period.\nWe've included on this page, the year-over-year weather-normalized sales variances. Total weather-normalized sales in 2021 were largely consistent with our expectations outlined on our call last February. New electric service rates effective April 1, 2020, also increased earnings during 2021 by approximately $0.10 per share compared to the year ago period. Finally, these favorable factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, which decreased earnings $0.12 per share, primarily due to the amortization of deferred expenses related to the fall 2020 Callaway Energy Center scheduled refueling and maintenance outage.\nMoving to Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings increased $0.06 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure and energy efficiency investments and a higher allotted return on equity underperformance based ratemaking. The formula base return on equity was 7.85% in 2021 compared to 7.4% in 2020 as it was applied to -- and was applied to a year-end rate base. The 2021 ROE was based on the 2021 average 30-year treasury yield of 2.05%, up from the 2020 average of approximately 1.6%. Ameren Transmission earnings were up $0.02 per share, which reflected increased infrastructure investments that were mostly offset by the absence of the benefit from the May 2020 FERC order addressing the MISO allowed base return on equity and the impact of the March 2021 FERC quarter addressing the historical recovery of materials and supplies inventories.\nEarnings for Ameren Illinois Natural Gas were up $0.02 per share, which reflected new delivery service rates effective in late January 2021 and increased infrastructure investments, partially offset by higher other operations and maintenance expenses. Ameren Parent and other results were down $0.01 per share, which reflected increased interest expense, primarily from higher long-term debt balances. And finally, earnings per share and earnings per share drivers on this page are computed using 2020 weighted average shares outstanding. The higher shares outstanding in 2021 reduced overall earnings by $0.15 per share.\nBefore moving on, I'll touch on 2021 sales trends for Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution. Weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois residential customers were flat year-over-year and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales to Illinois commercial and industrial customers increased 3% and 3.5%, respectively. Recall that changes in electric sales in Illinois, no matter the cause, do not affect our earnings since we have full revenue decoupling.\nMoving to Page 22 of the presentation. Here, we provide an overview of the $17.3 billion of strategically allocated planned expenditures for the 2022 through 2026 period by business segment that underlies the approximately 7% projected rate base growth Marty discussed earlier. This plan includes an incremental $200 million compared to the $17.1 billion 5-year plan for 2021 through 2025 that was laid out last February, which included the $500 million wind investment completed in 2021. As you can see on the right side of this page, we are allocating capital consistent with the allowed return on equity under each regulatory framework. Importantly, as Marty mentioned earlier, renewable generation and regionally beneficial transmission represent additional investment opportunities.\nTurning to Page 23. We outlined here the expected funding sources for the infrastructure investments noted on the prior page. We expect continued growth in cash from operations as investments are reflected in customer rates. We also expect to generate significant tax deferrals. These tax deferrals are driven primarily by the timing differences between financial statement depreciation reflected in customer rates and accelerated depreciation for tax purposes. From a financing perspective, we expect to continue to issue long-term debt in Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to fund a portion of our cash requirements.\nPursuant to a November 2021 note purchase agreement, we will issue $95 million of ATXI debt in August 2022. We also plan to continue to use newly-issued shares for our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans over the 5-year guidance period. We expect this to provide equity funding of approximately $100 million annually.\nIn order for us to maintain a strong balance sheet while we fund our robust infrastructure plan, we expect incremental equity issuances of approximately $300 million each year starting in 2022 through 2026. Approximately $95 million of equity outlined for 2022 was sold on a forward basis under our at-the-market equity distribution program, leaving approximately $200 million to be sold for the remainder of 2022. Together, issuance of our 401(k), DRPlus and ATM equity programs are expected to support our equity needs through 2023. All of these actions are expected to enable us to support a consolidated capitalization target of approximately 45% equity over the 5-year plan.\nMoving to Page 24 of our presentation. I would now like to discuss key drivers impacting our 2022 earnings guidance. As Marty stated, we expect 2022 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share. On this page and the next, we have listed key earnings drivers and assumptions behind our 2022 earnings guidance, broken down by segment as compared to the 2021 results.\nBeginning with Ameren Missouri, earnings are expected to rise in 2022. New electric service rates will be effective February 28, the 2022 earnings comparison is also expected to be favorably impacted by higher investments in infrastructure and wind generation that's eligible for PISA and RESRAM, which benefits earnings in January and February until rates are reset. We also expect to recognize earnings related to energy efficiency performance incentives from both 2021 and 2022 planned years in 2022. As a result, we expect energy efficiency performance incentives to be approximately $0.04 per share higher than 2021. These favorable factors are expected to be partially offset by higher operations and maintenance and interest expenses.\nFurther, we expect a return to normal weather in 2022 will be decreasing Ameren Missouri earnings by approximately $0.02 compared to 2021 results. We also expect higher total weather-normalized electric sales of approximately 1% in 2022 compared to 2021, as residential sales decline and commercial sales continued to increase. We expect total weather-normalized sales to return to 2019 levels by mid-2022, with this year's growth expected to be primarily over the second half of the year. Moving on, earnings from our FERC-regulated electric transmission activities are expected to benefit from additional investments in Ameren Illinois and ATXI projects made under forward-looking formula ratemaking. The absence of the March 2021 FERC order on historical recovery of materials and supplies is also expected to increase earnings $0.03 per share.\nTurning to Page 25. For Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, earnings are expected to benefit in 2022 compared to 2021 from additional infrastructure investments made under Illinois performance-based rate making. Our guidance incorporates a performance-based ROE of 8.05% using a forecasted 2.25% 2022 average yield for the 30-year treasury bond, which is higher than the allowed ROE of 7.85% in 2021. The allowed ROE has applied to year-end rate base. For Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, earnings will benefit from higher delivery service rates that were effective late January 2021 as well as from infrastructure investments qualifying for rider treatment. These favorable factors are expected to be partially offset by higher operations and maintenance and depreciation and amortization expenses.\nMoving now to Ameren-wide drivers and assumptions. We expect the increased common shares outstanding to unfavorably impact earnings per share by $0.04 and higher interest expense, primarily from higher long-term debt balances. Of course, in 2022, we will seek to manage all of our businesses to earn as close to our allowed returns as possible while being mindful of operating and other business needs.\nI'd also like to take a moment to discuss our retail electric sales outlook. We expect weather-normalized Missouri kilowatt-hour sales to be in the range of flat to up approximately 0.5% compounded annually over the 5-year plan, excluding the effects of our MEEIA energy efficiency plan using 2022 as the base year. We exclude MEEIA effects because the plan provides rate recovery to ensure that earnings are not affected by reduced electric sales resulting from our energy efficiency efforts. Turning to Illinois. We expect our weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales, including energy efficiency, to be relatively flat over the 5-year plan.\nTurning to Page 26 and regulatory matters. In December, the PSC approved a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement that resolved both the electric and natural gas rate reviews for Ameren Missouri. The agreements were black box settlements, which did not provide for certain specific details of the final orders. And both rate reviews and an allowed ROE was not specified, but did provide for approximately 52% equity ratio for use in calculating PISA and RESRAM. The electric revenue requirement increased by $220 million annually, reflecting a rate base of $10.2 billion.\nThe approved agreement also provided for the continuation of key trackers and riders, including the fuel adjustment clause. The natural gas revenue requirement was increased by $5 million annually, reflecting a $313 million rate base. Both electric and natural gas rate changes are effective at the end of this month. Looking ahead, we will continue to assess the timing of our next rate review.\nIn making this decision, we will take into account several considerations, including our capital expenditures and other cost of service considerations as well as updates to the Integrated Resource Plan expected to be filed in the first half of this year, reflecting the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center and timing of our expected securitization filing. Regarding Ameren Illinois regulatory matters, in December, the ICC approved a $58 million base electric distribution rate increase in the annual rate update proceeding with new rates that were effective at the beginning of this year.\nFinally, turning to Page 27. We have a strong team and are well positioned to continue executing our plan. We delivered strong earnings growth in 2021, and we expect to deliver strong earnings growth in 2022 as we continue to successfully execute our strategy. And as we look ahead, we expect 6% to 8% compound earnings per share growth from 2022 to 2026, driven by robust rate base growth and disciplined cost management. Further, we believe this growth will compare favorably with the growth of our regulated utility peers. And Ameren shares continue to offer investors an attractive dividend. In total, we have an attractive total shareholder return story that compares very favorably to our peers.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We now invite your questions."

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer; Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions]\nMr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nGeneral Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nSenior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2025.\nBefore I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results. A reconciliation between GAAP and our as adjusted results has been included in the tables attached to today's press release, I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.\nAt BlackRock, we always challenge ourselves to raise the bar and our results consistently reflect that mindset. We've been focused on building capabilities that we anticipate our clients will need in the future while also implementing some of the largest and most multifaceted mandates in our history. This combination of forward-looking investment and consistent execution has fueled strong results across our business. The momentum we saw in the first half of the year accelerated in the third quarter. Our builds across ETFs private markets, whole portfolio and cash management drove 8% organic base fee growth over the last 12 months. That's our highest level in over 4 years, but even more importantly, it's broadly diversified. We have great momentum across both our foundational businesses and categories that we've developed in just the last few years. That strength and diversification is resonating in meaningful opportunities across regions, client channels, prototypes and asset classes. We're entering what's typically our seasonally strongest quarter and coming off significant milestones in just the last 90 days.\nSince July 1, we've closed our acquisitions of HPS and Elm Tree, announced an $80 billion SMA solution with City Wealth and onboarded a $30 billion pension mandate. These represent just the start of what our newly integrated platform can unlock. We've expanded our capabilities across private markets, digital assets, data and technology. That strategy now moves forward with greater strength and scale. The opportunity in front of us far exceeds what we've ever seen before.\nWe finished the third quarter with record AUM, record units of trust of $13.5 trillion. Over the last 12 months, clients entrusted BlackRock with nearly $640 billion of net new assets powering 8% organic base fee growth. We generated $205 billion of net inflows in the third quarter, reflecting 10% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest quarter since 2021. This organic base fee growth was driven by broad-based client demand for iShares, private markets, systematic outsourcing and cash strategies. These are all capabilities we've invested in over recent years and demonstrate the success of our structural growth strategy.\nMoving to financial results. Third quarter revenue of $6.5 billion was 25% higher year-over-year, driven by the acquisitions of GIP, Preqin and HPS, organic base fee growth over the trailing 12-month period and the positive impact of market movements on average AUM.\nOperating income of $2.6 billion was up 23% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $11.55 increased 1%, reflecting higher operating income, offset by lower nonoperating income and a higher diluted share count in the current quarter compared to a year ago.\nThe higher share count included 6.9 million shares issued at the close of the GIP transaction on October 1, 2024, and 8.5 million BlackRock Subco units issued at the close of the HPS transaction on July 1. The SubCo units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis with BlackRock common stock and included as if converted in the company's fully diluted shares outstanding.\nNonoperating results for the quarter included $84 million of net investment losses, primarily due to a mark-to-market noncash loss linked to our minority investment in circle.\nOur as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 24% and benefited from discrete items. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2025. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nThird quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $5 billion increased 25% year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, higher securities lending revenue and approximately $215 million and $225 million in base fees from GIP and HPS, respectively.\nOn an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately 50 basis points higher compared to the second quarter. This increase was primarily due to the onboarding of higher fee alternative credit assets of HPS, which was partially offset by $48 million of lower private markets catch-up base fees compared to the second quarter.\nPerformance fees of $516 million increased 33% from a year ago, primarily reflecting approximately $270 million of performance fees from HPS.\nQuarterly technology services and subscription revenue was up 28% compared to a year ago, reflecting sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings and the closing of the Preqin transaction, which added approximately $65 million of revenue in the third quarter of this year. Excluding Preqin, Technology Services revenue would have increased approximately 12% year-over-year.\nAnnual contract value, or ACV, increased 29% year-over-year, including the impact of Preqin. ACV increased 13% organically.\nTotal expense was 26% higher year-over-year, primarily driven by higher compensation, sales asset and account expense and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 33% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation associated with performance fees as well as higher operating income. The year-over-year increase also reflects the impact of the onboarding of GIP, Preqin and HPS employees. G&A expense was up 18% year-over-year, primarily due to M&A transactions and higher technology investment spend.\nSales, asset and account expense increased 21% compared to a year ago driven by higher direct fund expense and distribution costs. Direct fund expense increased 22% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM.\nOur as-adjusted operating margin of 44.6% was down 120 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher performance fees and related compensation. We continue to deliver margin expansion on recurring fee-related earnings.\nExcluding the impact of all performance fees and related compensation, our adjusted operating margin for the third quarter would have been 46.3% and up 110 basis points year-over-year. We provided additional disclosure in our earnings supplement on the contribution of performance fee related compensation to total expense.\nIn line with our guidance in July, we continue to expect a low teens percentage increase in 2025 core G&A expense. This year-over-year core G&A increase is mainly driven by the onboarding of GIP, Preqin and HPS.\nOur capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first in our business either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency and then return cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In the third quarter, we repurchased $375 million worth of shares. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year, and subject to market and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous guidance.\nBlackRock's third quarter net inflows of $205 billion reflected deepening client engagement and were led by a new record flows quarters for iShares ETFs. We iShares ETFs generating $153 billion of net inflows in the third quarter. Core equity and index fixed income led the way with $53 billion and $41 billion of net inflows, respectively. Our digital assets ETPs raised another $17 billion in the third quarter. Our flagship offerings in IBIT and Eta were among the top 5 inflowing products in the ETP industry. We're also seeing demand for our high-value higher fee active ETFs, which gathered $21 billion of net inflows.\nOur institutional active franchise saw $22 billion of net inflows, driven by the onboarding of a $30 billion Dutch pension outsourcing mandate. This inflow was partially offset by a $15 billion single client transfer from quantitative to index equity with an immaterial revenue impact.\nInstitutional index net outflows were $14 billion, inclusive of this transfer. Retail net inflows of $10 billion were led by demand for active fixed income, liquid alternatives and Aperio. Across private market strategies, we saw $13 billion of net inflows driven by strength in private credit, multi-alternatives and infrastructure.\nOur work with clients spans their entire portfolios from long-dated private market exposures to more near-term liquidity needs. Our cash management platform recently crossed $1 trillion in AUM, with $34 billion of net inflows in the quarter. The platform has grown 45% in just the last 3 years. We're seeing demand across scaled money market funds, customized and tokenized liquidity products and money market ETFs. And our partnership with Circle as the primary manager of their cash reserves is driving meaningful growth. Our mandate surpassed $64 billion this quarter.\nBlackRock delivered some of the strongest organic base fee growth in recent history, and we entered the fourth quarter in an excellent position. The fourth quarter has traditionally been our strongest for organic growth.\nIn my nearly 20 years at BlackRock, I've never been part of deeper, more far-reaching client engagements than in recent months. We believe our strategy will continue to deliver for both our clients and shareholders, resulting in market-leading organic growth differentiated operating leverage and earnings in multiple expansion over time.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining the call.\nOur third quarter results reflect the strength of our global relationships and the deepening trust we've earned with clients. All of the high conviction growth themes we anticipated and invested ahead of are now leading in client conversations.\nBlackRock is always thinking out to the future towards what our clients will need and want. ETFs, private markets, tech and data, digital assets are just a few examples. We were ahead of the game in recognizing their importance for clients, and we took leading positions. The accelerating activity we're seeing is the validation of the BlackRock business model. We nurture enduring and local client relationships, and we invest boldly. Total net inflows of $205 billion were positive across all asset classes and client types and powered 10% organic base fee growth in the quarter. That growth is even more notable than its diversification.\nJust looking across our top 5 organic base fee contributors, it's our systematic franchise. It's our private credit franchise. It's a digital asset franchise, our cash franchise. And the whole business of outsourcing portfolios and general accounts to BlackRock. BlackRock's multiple source of growth differentiates us and makes us really optimistic for the future.\nIn April, tariff announcement shocked global markets. At the time, I traveled to several of our international offices to reinforce BlackRock's strong local mandates with each of our country managers. We bring our global expertise and tailored local insights to clients room and on the ground presence. That presence has strengthened our position as a trusted partner and adviser over many years, and it continues to further strengthen in 2025.\nOver the last 12 months, we generated 8% organic base fee growth, excluding our target -- exceeding our target each quarter. Revenues grew [indiscernible] new AUM records. Clients have entrusted BlackRock with $1.4 trillion of net inflows over the last 3 years and $2.3 trillion over the last 5 years.\nWhen BlackRock acquired BGI and iShares, we gave investors the ability to blend active and index strategy seamlessly, something they hadn't been able to do before. Today, convergence of public and private markets is increasing. Clients are focused on strategies and solutions that work across the whole portfolio. Investors are seeking deeper, more dynamic partnerships across public and private asset classes. They're coming to BlackRock for a partner in portfolio management and in technology across a full range of capital markets.\nAs I meet with clients around the world, they've been excited about opportunity to do much more with BlackRock, and it's expanding the growth potential for GIP HPS and frequent. Our history of integrations is very different, and it has set us apart.\nBlackRock's acquisition philosophy has always been about growth. What makes our acquisitions so successful is our belief in full integration. Our culture strengthens and evolves as we welcome new teams and new capabilities. But we continue to operate as One BlackRock, not a collection of boutiques. We do the work to make sure we are seamlessly connected to our clients with 1 platform, shared goals and a common Aladdin technology. We're organized so the clients have access to all of BlackRock at a comprehensive, consistent way. We intentionally structured the GIP HBS transaction so that the consideration was largely in BlackRock equity with long-dated performance milestones. We all have the same interest as significant shareholders alongside our broader shareholder base. Our acquired firms are becoming a part of the fabric of BlackRock, and I'm proud of the successes we see in just these early days.\nOur closing of HBS just 3 months ago brought more than 800 colleagues to the BlackRock family. Our combined platform is becoming a first call for clients and borrowers around the world. Client engagement is even stronger than we expected, especially in the insurance and wealth channels. We're positioned to be a preferred capital partner with insurers while maintaining our balance sheet light approach.\nIn wealth, we brought together highly complementary capabilities that position us to be a leading player. On the investment side, our scaled franchises range from our nontraded senior bank BDC Acelend to credit solutions across the capital stack. Acelend continues to generate around $1 billion of net inflows a quarter, and from a distribution perspective, HBS has had strong connectivity to private banks and high net worth practices, that now that is now augmented by BlackRock's successive network across wirehouses, independents and RIAs.\nOur $370 billion private financing solution platform alongside of our over $3 trillion public fixed sign franchise positions us to be our clients' strategic partner across public and private debt markets. And just a year into our closing of the GIP acquisition, we made significant progress in both fundraising and deployment. GIP closed above its $25 billion target in July, and it represents the largest ever client capital raise in a private infrastructure fund. Our AI partnership continues to attract significant capital interest. Market-leading global technology, energy and financial organizations are considering are consolidating around AIP as a partner of choice. AIP includes MGX of Abu Dhabi, Microsoft, KIA of Kuwait and Temasek of Singapore and technology and energy advisers in Navidea, XAI, Cisco, GE, Renova, NextEra Energy. Our combined relationships and expertise are coming together to advance key discussions on fantastic investment opportunity for our clients. GIP's track market in 1 of the largest data centers in the United States has been instrumental. There are significant opportunities for us ahead in the data center space, an estimated $1.5 trillion of capital is going to be needed in the next 5 years in just the core and shell of data centers. And that's not including the chips. The growth of cloud computing and AI propelling this capital demand and BlackRock with GIP is well positioned to expand our leadership.\nCaves across BlackRock are exploring how AI can play a bigger role in making markets more accessible and more efficient. We see a future commercial opportunities in using tokenization to further bridge the gap between traditional capital markets and the growing digital asset space. This is 1 of the most exciting areas of growth in financial markets. There's over $4.5 trillion in value sitting in digital wallets across crypto assets, stable coin and tokenized assets. We see this market growing significantly over the next few years. Today, there is no access to high-quality traditional investment products in digital wallets. BlackRock plans to change that. BlackRock is a foundational player in the ecosystem. We manage the largest crypto asset ETP with over $100 billion in AUM. We're the largest reserve fund manager for stable coin with over $60 billion in Circle's reserve fund. And we built a tokenized liquidity fund for digital assets native investors, which is available across multiple public blockchains. Bitla has grown to nearly $3 billion in AUM. Now we're exploring tokenizing long-term investment products like iShares. We envision a future where investors never need to leave a digital wallet to allocate efficiently across crypto, stable coin and exposures to long-term stocks and bonds.\nThe U.S. economy has been propelled in many parts by its leading market infrastructure. I believe the U.S. needs to accelerate regulatory clarity and investments in digital assets innovation. We need to be a leader in market infrastructure for much of the larger part of the world of digital assets. BlackRock brings technological and operational scale, client trust and a global footprint across 100 countries. We believe all these factors put us in a prime position to be a part of a global conversation around tokenization and digital assets. We've seen through AGS how innovation and financial technology can unlock growth by making it easier for more investors to access the capital markets.\nOur iShares franchise today has crossed over $5 trillion in assets during the third quarter with record net inflows of $153 billion. Double-digit organic base fee growth was once again led by digital assets, bond ETFs and active ETFs. Our digital assets and active iShares franchise as an example, of how BlackRock operates as an innovation and scale engine. We build these businesses from the ground up to be a category leader in just a few years. Our digital assets, ETPs and active ETFs have grown from practically 0 in 2023 to over $100 billion in digital assets and over $80 billion in active ETFs. The rapid growth of these premium categories is another proof point of our success in scaling distribution and quickly adapting to new offerings and in new markets.\nIn Europe, the growth of the ETF market is at an inflection point. Our 2025 net inflows of $103 billion have already surpassed last year's record full year flows. We're bringing learnings from our U.S. offerings to help grow the ETF market in Europe and better serve our clients in this region. And we're planting seeds for the future through our local investments as we facilitate the growth of capital markets and investing around the world.\nIn India, our GEO BlackRock joint venture recently launched its first systematic active equity offering, building on our already high-performing global systematic franchise. The Indian market remains largely untapped and is today a country of savers rather investors. Through GEO BlackRock, we're enabling individuals to more easily invest in their local economies and their local financial assets, and we're helping them build towards a more secure financial future. Many of our clients are investing on behalf of retirement savers and they're turning to BlackRock to scale and modernize the retirement plans options.\nBlackRock continues to lead with innovation for retirement. With LifePath Paycheck, we're embedding lifetime income into plan options, and we're working to enable access to growth-oriented private market strategies in 401(k). Defined benefit pension funds, pension plans have been investing in private markets for decades, and we believe this opportunity should also be available for U.S. defined contribution plans. Even if a past clears for private markets in 401(k)s, the fiduciary standard rule still holds. Plan fiduciaries will need to carefully diligence all investments. just as they are required to do today. I think that could create an acceleration in demand for all the Aladdin products, including Prequin. Plans would need better data, better analytics on private markets to substantiate and justify their inclusion in 401(k) offerings, representing a large potential unlock for Aladdin and frequent. We're already helping clients better manage private markets investments with eFront, alongside Preqin performance and investment data.\nWe recently signed our first whole portfolio technology mandate encompassing Aladdin front and frequent as a seamless public private workflow and data solution. And we're continuing to engage with clients on opportunities to integrate these capabilities to drive greater efficiency and growth for each and every 1 of our clients' portfolios. I'm immensely proud of the connectivity we've seen from employees and clients alike as we fully integrate GIP, HPS and Preqin. As we've grown our firm, we've also evolved our leadership structure to help us meet client needs and develop our talent. We recently expanded our executive team to include a group exceptional enterprise leaders to better serve clients and advance our long-term strategy. Together, we're both defining and fulfilling the future of asset management through a truly differentiated platform, 1 that is anchored by public private investment models backed by Aladdin technology united by a shared culture of performance and client service.\nI have never been more excited about the future of BlackRock, our firm and the opportunities ahead for the entire worldwide position for BlackRock in the future.\nOperator, let's open it up for questions.",

Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the Q2 of 2025. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. At our Investor Day last month, we communicated our ambitions for BlackRock in 2030. Our leadership team and our employees have seen and contributed to that vision over the last two years. We anticipated where our clients and markets were going. We've established strength at the foundation of our platform in ETFs, Aladdin, whole portfolio, fixed income, cash management. They're the strong foundations to serve clients and deliver on our organic growth objectives. We executed on organic business builds in structural growth categories, including digital assets, active ETFs, model portfolios, and systematic equities, and we've executed on three major acquisitions.\nWe've built a premier investment and technology platform across public and private markets, one that's only at the beginning of a durable long-term runway for growth. Building on our record results in 2024, we continue to see the proof points of the success of our strategy into 2025. We generated 7% organic base fee growth and over $650 billion of net inflows over the last 12 months. This success has been built on multi-year sustained growth in iShares, fixed income, systematic tax management strategies in Aladdin, and now expansions in private markets. We believe these engines will enable us to more consistently rise above 5% organic base fee growth. We posted 6% organic base fee growth in Q2 for our fourth consecutive quarter of 5% or higher organic base fee growth. We finished Q2 with record AUM, record units of trust of $12.5 trillion.\nWe once again delivered double-digit year-over-year growth in revenue, operating income, and earnings per share. GIP 5 closed above its $25 billion target, making it the largest private markets fundraise in the histories of both BlackRock and GIP. We took early commercial steps to bring a first-of-its-kind public-private target date solution to retirees with Great Gray, a leading collective investment trust platform. Earlier this month, we closed our acquisition of HPS Investment Partners, a major milestone as we evolve towards our ambitions of 30% revenue contribution from private markets and technology by 2030. Q2 net inflows of $68 billion were impacted by low-fee institutional index redemptions, which saw $48 billion of net outflows. Excluding that activity, BlackRock delivered approximately $116 billion of net inflows in the quarter.\nTurning to financial results, Q2 revenue of $5.4 billion was 13% higher year-over-year, driven by the impact of organic growth in higher markets on average AUM, base fees consolidated in the GIP transaction, and higher technology services and subscription revenue, which includes the onboarding of Preqin. Operating income of $2.1 billion was up 12%, and earnings per share of $12.05 was 16% higher versus a year ago. EPS also reflected higher non-operating income, a higher tax rate, and a higher share count in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter included $433 million of net investment gains, driven by mark-to-market non-cash gains on minority investments, including Circle and in our co-invest portfolio. We own approximately 2.3 million shares of Circle Common Stock, which will continue to be marked through investment income going forward.\nOur as-adjusted tax rate for the Q2 was approximately 25%, and we continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2025. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items, or potential changes in tax legislation. Q2 base fee and securities lending revenue of $4.5 billion was up 15% year-over-year, driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and approximately $240 million in base fees from GIP. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was down four tenths of a basis point compared to the Q1. This was partially due to the impact of catch-up base fees associated with private markets fundraising, which were $36 million lower relative to the Q1.\nSignificant interim month equity market declines in April were also a contributing factor. As a result of market and FX movements into the end of the quarter, we entered the Q3 with an estimated base fee run rate approximately 5% higher than our total base fees for the Q2. That's excluding the impact of HPS. The closing of HPS added $165 billion of client AUM and $118 billion of fee-paying AUM on 1 July. We expect HPS to add approximately $450 million of revenue, including $225 million in management fees in the Q3 of 2025. We expect HPS to positively impact BlackRock's overall effective fee rate by approximately six tenths of a basis point. Performance fees of $94 million decreased from a year ago, reflecting lower performance revenue from private markets, liquid alternatives, and long-only products.\nQuarterly technology services revenue and subscription revenue was up 26% compared to a year ago. Growth reflects sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings and the impact of the Preqin transaction, which closed on 03 March. Preqin added approximately $60 million to Q2 revenue. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 32% year-over-year, including the Preqin acquisition. ACV growth increased 16% organically, also including the impact of currency exchange tailwinds. Total expense increased 14% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation, sales, asset, and account expense, and higher G&A. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 12%, reflecting higher headcount associated with the onboarding of GIP and Preqin employees and higher incentive compensation linked to higher operating income. G&A expense increased 16%, primarily driven by the GIP and Preqin acquisitions and higher technology spend.\nSales asset and account expense increased 14% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher direct fund expense and distribution costs. Direct fund expense was up 23% year-over-year, mainly due to higher average ETF AUM and net inflows. Our Q2 as-adjusted operating margin of 43.3% was down 80 basis points from a year ago, partially due to the impact of lower performance fees. We'll continue to execute on our financial framework of aligning organic growth with controllable expenses. This approach has yielded profitable growth and operating leverage in good markets, and we believe it adds more resilience to our operating margin when markets contract. We welcomed approximately 800 new colleagues to BlackRock following the close of the HPS transaction.\nInclusive of the HPS acquisition impact at present, we would expect a low-teens percentage increase in 2025 core G&A expense with the onboarding of GIP, Preqin, and HPS as the main driver of the year-over-year core G&A increase. In addition, we'd expect our adjusted compensation to net revenue ratio to be modestly higher due to compensation associated with performance-related revenues from HPS. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. At the closing of the HPS transaction, we issued and delivered approximately 8.5 million BlackRock SubCo units, subject to two- to three-year lockup periods.\nSubCo units are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis with BlackRock common stock. We also issued approximately 1 million BlackRock restricted stock units, primarily for retention of HPS employees. Additional SubCo units may be issued in approximately five years, subject to achievement of certain post-closing conditions and financial performance milestones. If all contingent consideration is achieved, all SubCo units are exchanged for shares of common stock, and all RSUs vest and are settled as common stock. We do not expect to issue more than approximately 13.8 million additional shares of common stock in aggregate. SubCo units issued will be included in our as-adjusted diluted shares outstanding and will be captured in our as-adjusted results going forward. We repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the Q2.\nAt present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market, and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our January guidance. In May, we made a minority investment and established a strategic alliance with Generation Life, with the goal of developing investment solutions for Australian retirees. Last week, we announced our agreement to acquire ElmTree Funds, a real estate investment firm with $7.3 billion in client AUM, of which $3.1 billion is fee-paying. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. In Q2, BlackRock generated total net inflows of $68 billion. Excluding low-fee institutional index outflows, BlackRock's net inflows were $116 billion.\nETF net inflows of $85 billion were diversified by channel, and over 1/3 were driven by our clients in Europe using local ranges. Fixed income ETFs led inflows with $44 billion, and active ETFs and digital asset ETPs added $11 billion and $14 billion, respectively. Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected continued strength in Aperio and our systematic liquid alternatives funds. Institutional active net inflows of $7 billion were driven by insurance client fixed income mandates and strength in infrastructure, private credit, and liquid alternatives. Institutional index net outflows of $48 billion were impacted by a single client redemption of $52 billion, primarily from fixed income. Our institutional channel delivered 3% long-term organic base fee growth in the quarter, benefiting from client demand for active and alternatives. Finally, our scale and our active approach with clients around liquidity management are driving sustained growth in our cash platform.\nCash AUM is up 25% over the last year, and we generated $22 billion of net inflows in Q2. The BlackRock platform is powered by foundational growth businesses linked to long-term growth in capital markets and fast-growing client and product channels. By combining BlackRock's capabilities with GIP, Preqin, and HPS, we've laid the groundwork for an exciting future. We're already steadily delivering above 5% organic base fee growth, and our new colleagues from HPS are only going to help us build from here. There's a bright future ahead to grow with clients, build great careers for our employees, and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Over many years, BlackRock has worked to serve the ambitions of each and every client around the world, from the largest asset owners to individuals just getting started with investing. We design and deliver strategies and products that fit their unique long-term needs and aspirations. We deliver in a way that best serves each client, whether it's through whole portfolio solutions, opportunistic investments, or customized models and SMAs. Throughout BlackRock's history, we've been relentless in anticipating the future needs of our clients and taking strategic actions to evolve for them. Our sustained multi-year growth has been powered by our whole portfolio approach. We were the first provider to blend active and index at scale through our acquisition of BGI and iShares. Our integration of active and index investing propelled the next 15 years of success for our clients and shareholders.\niShares AUM was about 300 billion when we announced our acquisition, and today it's approaching $5 trillion. And now we're building on our foundational platform to redefine the whole portfolio again by bringing together public and private markets across both asset management and technology. That foundational platform has powered performance for clients and sustained organic base fee growth through cycles. We believe our expansions can drive even higher growth. Our trust and comprehensive relationships we have with clients across our core businesses, like Aladdin, ETFs, fixed income, and retirement, are now driving at an even broader opportunity set. We're seeing secular demand for capabilities we developed in recent years, like digital assets, active ETFs, systematic strategies, and customized SMAs through Aperio and SpiderRock. The strength of BlackRock's platform is also expanding the growth potential of GIP and HPS.\nThey're both premier firms in their own right, but they recognize how our client relationships and the completeness of our platform could help us all achieve new heights together. BlackRock's ethos of change, the integration of firms, and the best parts of their culture, that's what allows us to be more adaptive with our clients. Our history of integrations is very different, and it sets us apart from any other public or private markets firm in the industry. BlackRock's breadth and scale has differentiated us with our clients of all sizes worldwide. We're delivering an integrated approach to help our clients across all aspects of public and private markets investing. We enable a seamless view into investment management, into technology, and data on one single platform.\nWe remain steadfast in our one BlackRock culture, making sure clients have access to all of BlackRock in a comprehensive, consistent way in every region with every client. Our long-standing relationships and history of reinvention are resulting in a higher, more diversified organic base fee growth. We're now generating 6% organic base fee growth for Q2 and H1 2025, and 7% over the last 12 months. Revenues, operating income, and earnings per share each grew double-digit. Total inflows were $116 billion, excluding the index activity Martin mentioned. Growth is being powered by both our largest core businesses and newer initiatives. iShares ETFs have had a record first half in flows. Our technology ACV growth reached a fresh high of 16%.\nThe strong fundamentals, alongside client demand for private markets, digital assets, Aperio, and systematic strategies propel another consecutive quarter above target organic growth and a record AUM of $12.5 trillion. Our global reach delivers diversification upside to our platform, with gains in international currencies lifting AUM by over $170 billion in the quarter. We manage $4.5 trillion in AUM for clients outside the United States. Many of our largest growth opportunities are outside our home market, including our work in India and the Middle East, alongside our established presence in Europe and Asia. BlackRock is executing on a deepening set of opportunities across technology and data and public and private markets. Momentum is only accelerating, and many of our recent milestones have not yet reflected in our results. Two weeks ago, we closed our acquisition of HPS Investment Partners.\nWe're excited to welcome Scott, Scott, and Mike, and the entire HPS team to BlackRock. We see immense growth ahead for our combined franchise. Together, we'll be able to serve investors and borrowers across all of the private financing needs. Client feedback has been extremely positive as we integrate GIP, HPS, and Preqin. For many companies, periods of M&A contribute to a pause in client engagement. We're seeing the opposite. Clients are eager to put more capital to work with BlackRock. They appreciate our reputation as long-term investors and partners. We're not transactional. We're helping them invest in compelling long-term growth themes like the global needs of new infrastructure investments and the fast-evolving debt financing landscape. These are creating differentiated private markets opportunities for our clients. At the end of June, we marked the major milestone with a final close of GIP's fifth flagship infrastructure strategy.\nIt surpassed its target, raising $25.2 billion. That's a validation of how clients are embracing the logic of the BlackRock GIP combination. Many would expect a change in ownership to dampen fundraising. In our case, it ultimately ended up driving an even higher fundraising ability. GIP 5 represents the largest ever client capital raise in a private infrastructure fund, and our Aladdin partnership continues to attract significant capital interest, including the recent additions of Kuwait Investment Authority and Temasek. The diversification benefits and potential for higher returns offered by private markets also make them an attractive investment for retirement accounts, a space where BlackRock has been a leader. We were recently selected by the Great Gray Trust Company to provide a custom target date fund, Glidepath, that strategically allocates across public and private markets.\nWe have a wealth of expertise in the defined contribution space, and we're looking to expand across to private markets across a variety of retirement solutions. Retirement is core to BlackRock. In the United States and internationally, we are a trusted expert in advising clients, advising governments, and policymakers on how they can help their constituents achieve more secure futures and retire with dignity. Demographic shifts and financial pressures are driving governments and corporations to rethink their retirement plans and their retirement systems, putting significant money in motion. In the Netherlands, for example, a transition from defined benefits to a hybrid form of defined contribution is well underway. BlackRock is working with clients to manage this transition and improve investment outcomes for plan members. We had a related $30 billion outsourcing mandate with a Dutch client fund in early July.\nWe take a blended approach of being deeply local and powered by our global platform. We deploy capital in public and private markets in every country in which we operate and beyond. We are consistently studying what's driving capital flows both within each country and within each region. Our ability to execute at scale at the local levels differentiates our international business. We're bringing a global framework to India through our JioBlackRock offering in partnership with JFS and Reliance, who already serve hundreds of millions of individuals across India. There are huge advancements taking place through the digitization of currency and identification, but India remains a country of savers, not investors. Our joint venture, JioBlackRock, recently launched its first funds, raising over $2 billion with over 67,000 customers.\nWe look forward to helping more and more people participate in the growth of local and global capital markets and global connections. Our acquisition of Preqin will be a key to enabling more transparency and clarity in private markets. In just the first few months since our closing of the Preqin acquisition, we've seen strong early demand from both GPs and LPs as they are looking to better analyze and benchmark their private market allocations. It's through better analytics, standardized benchmarks, and more widely available performance data, we can close the information gap and enable even more future growth in private markets investing. In the public markets, our iShares business continues to be a powerful growth engine and a key driver of industry innovation. After nearly 30 years and approaching $5 trillion in assets, innovation remains at the heart of our franchise.\nOur newest investments and product launches from just the last few years are driving outsized growth, contributing to record flows in H1 2025, and 12% organic base fee growth in ETFs this quarter. Our active ETFs delivered $11 billion of net inflows, and our digital asset products continue to set new records. IBIT at quarter-end crossed over $75 billion in AUM, with another $12 billion in net inflows. As of this morning, it crossed over $80 billion. iShares ETPs are bridging the traditional capital markets with fast-growing cryptocurrency markets. They're also bringing new investors to the iShares brand. Nearly 1/3 of the investors who first came to BlackRock for IBIT have gone on to purchase other iShares products. It's this type of capability expansion that drives durable growth and new client opportunities for our business.\nFrom category innovation in iShares to new ventures across the world, the investments we made across our platform are paying off. Many of the categories that are leading our growth barely existed two years ago. Categories like active ETFs, digital assets, and our scaled private markets franchise. Just as importantly, BlackRock's core businesses like ETFs, Aladdin, and cash management continue to be a growth engine for the firm and are cornerstones of many client relationships. A lot of firms got out of the cash business after the financial crisis when fee waivers were in place during a sustained period of low rates. But we recognize a simple thing: every client needs to hold cash. Cash management has been the first entry point for many of our clients who have gone on to build large mandates with BlackRock.\nOur cash AUM is nearly $1 trillion, and I think it's remarkable considering we're not a direct retail business or a DTC bank. At BlackRock, we think of cash as another avenue for innovation. We see a great untapped opportunity for cash and liquidity, where people want to use the technologies of digital assets to access traditional instruments like treasuries. Our tokenized liquidity fund now has $3 billion in AUM, and what started as a small corporate investment in asset management relationship with Circle in 2022 has grown meaningfully. We delivered a significant gain to shareholders this quarter in connection with the IPO and subsequent trading activity, and we now manage more than $50 billion for Circle's stablecoin cash reserves. We're entering our seasonally strongest back half of the year with considerable momentum and a robust pipeline. Our recent closing of HPS will help us offer even more to clients.\nWe believe our clients and shareholders will be beneficiaries as GIP, HPS, and Preqin are now all coming together in a shared BlackRock story. We are intentionally organizing to bring clients under one unified firm, not a collection of enterprises, and we have aligned our cultures and aligned each and everybody's interests. The opportunity to deliver the full reach of BlackRock's capabilities to more individuals, to more companies, governments, and regions is greater today than ever before. Our comprehensive platform is deeply connected to our clients, to the capital markets, and to the future trends that are driving portfolios. These are just the early days in our next phase of growth at BlackRock. Operator let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you do ask a question, please take your phone off its speaker setting and use your handset to avoid any potential feedback. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-enter the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. We'll take our first question from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nHey, good morning, Michael.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. With a number of acquisitions closed over the last year now under your belt, I was hoping you could talk about the progress that you're making here, bringing HPS in particular and GIP together with BlackRock, how the conversation is progressing, in particular with insurance clients, to what extent you're seeing new mandate wins or expanded relationships there.\nThen can you just update us on the traction and the wealth and retirement channels as it relates to private market and multi-liquid strategies and talk about some of the steps you're looking to take over the next 12 months? Thank you.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nGreat question. Thank you, Michael. Well, I think as we showed in the closing of Q2, the client feedback has been extremely strong. I actually was in Asia this past week, and the opportunities we have with insurance companies, with wealth management across Asia and every other region is stronger than we ever imagined. As we said, GIP 5 closed above our target at 25.2. Our AIP fund will have a lot of positive announcements in the coming quarters.\nWe announced in the past quarter that we added Temasek and Kuwait Investment Authority as a part of our investment team, and we are confident that we'll be able to raise the full $30 billion that we announced in equity. Once we then begin those projects, we'll have to raise another $100 billion in associated debt to finance those types of projects. We're working with the hyperscalers as we speak right now on this, and we have some really great opportunities ahead of us in that. Those are just two examples of the opportunities we see with GIP. There's no question in my mind that with rising deficits, with more and more governments, the conversations we're having, whether it's in Europe, the United States, or Japan, that the role of public-private financing and the role of infrastructure financing is going to grow dramatically.\nAnd so we see some huge, huge opportunities. Another big opportunity that GIP just closed was purchasing all the Malaysian airports as just another example of the opportunity. We are still progressing with the proposed announcement of our ports transaction with Hutchison. So all of that is just a good example of some of the growth opportunities we see. But the resiliency and the conversations have never been greater. Related to private credit and HPS, we're just at the beginning, but we can say we'll have a lot to discuss in Q3. But the flow opportunities of HPS during the period of time of announcement and closing did not abate at all. So we are seeing across the board a very large acceptance of the industrial logic of the combination of HPS, GIP, and BlackRock.\nI would say that was quite a big difference than when we did the BGI transaction in 2009. Today, clients are looking at the merits of what BlackRock can do, our history of integration, our history of bringing one culture together, bringing the best of all the acquired organizations to be part of us to build a new foundational structure around BlackRock. On insurance, with having $700 billion of AUM with insurance companies, and that is continuing to grow, we are continuing to see more and more opportunities where we can be driving private markets with the insurance companies that we already manage. In wealth, very, very exciting. If there is a change in the opportunity related to defined contributions, it is only going to accelerate the opportunities we have in the private market space with retirement. 50% of our assets that we manage is in retirement.\nAnd so the relationships we have with plans is enormous. If you look at our success in LifePath, if you look at our success in our target date products, if you look at our success in what we're trying to do now, a LifePath Paycheck, where now we have over $500 billion in that alone, our relationships with these defined contribution plans is as strong as ever. We're innovating. We're creating opportunity. Now, if you overlay the opportunity for wealth worldwide, whether it's wealth in Japan, wealth in the United States, wealth in any region, the need, especially here in the United States, because you have a much higher threshold related to fiduciary responsibility, is going to be analytics and data.\nIf that moves forward, if there's that opportunity, the need for analytics and data will more than ever create huge opportunities for Preqin and the future opportunity of growth with Preqin eFront. And so we believe all these changes, the integration and blending of both public markets and private markets, is going to all be centered around having a base of great analytics and data. And I am more certain than ever the acquisition of Preqin alongside eFront is going to be generating much more opportunity for BlackRock.\nAnd I believe we are well positioned, whether it's well positioned because of the product profile we have with HPS and GIP, but with a foundational position we're in in the retirement space, in the defined contribution space, overlaying all the analytics data that we have under Aladdin now puts us in a position that we could have broader, deeper conversations with our clients. And I'm very much looking forward to having those deep conversations with each and every client.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nHey, Craig.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, Larry. Martin, hope everyone's doing well. I think we are on a hot, humid summer day. So I actually want to continue with that retirement commentary to Mike's question. So our question is on the potential migration of privates into target date funds and the US 401(k) channel.\nWe did see the Great Gray win news in late June. That was a positive sign. But I think BlackRock may be getting ready to launch its own target date fund with private allocation. So I was hoping you could update us on your strategy timeline and also what are you waiting to see from the Department of Labor, the SEC, or Congress before you launch your own target date fund with private allocations?\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nThank you. Martin?\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nThanks, Craig. How are you today? Thanks so much for the question. As Larry mentioned, Craig, more than half the $12 trillion of assets plus that we manage at BlackRock are related to retirement. And so building better portfolios for retirees is at the heart of what we do. I think we have real ambitions also to bring the same tried-and-true portfolio construction characteristics that built the DB market.\nSo defined benefit has long been allocating to both public and private markets. If you think of the largest public plans across corporate and across the public sector, they've always been private markets investors. That opportunity should be there for individuals and their long-term tax-advantaged accounts as well. We're the number one DCIO, the defined contribution investment-only firm. We're a top five private markets manager following our recent acquisition. So we think we have all the building blocks here. As I said on the last call, and I think Larry alluded to, for the opportunity, I think, to be most tangible in larger plans, we'll likely need to see litigation reform or at least some advice reform in the US to add private markets exposure into DC plans.\nWhat I would say relative to the call last quarter is we're really encouraged by the recent dialogue with policymakers on these topics and some of the activity by trade associations that I think has been helpful in really building a fact base and consensus around this. There's still significant work to do, but we feel positive momentum is certainly building. We're really proud of our recent announcement with Great Gray to build and power the glide path for their public-private target date solution. As I mentioned on the call, I think the real advantage that BlackRock brings here is that we've been doing glide path technology across target date funds for 30+ years. We feel that this is a place that we have particular strength and can add a lot of value rather than just rote allocations of X% to public markets and Y% to private markets.\nThat glide path is so important as you go from the accumulation to the end of the target date and ultimately to a decumulation phase. With Great Gray, we're going to provide the underlying index equity as well as fixed income exposures, as well as our private equity exposures through our product, BlackRock Private Investment Fund, BPIF. We're ultimately working on other products, and we would expect to launch a proprietary LifePath with privates' target date fund, I believe, sometime in 2026. We're excited about that as a way of continuing to bring public-private whole portfolio investing to the retirement market.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nLet me just add one thing, just the industrial logic and why this is so imperative. If through broadening the investment profile of what can be included in a defined contribution plan, if you believe over a 30-year horizon, you could add 50 basis points, which is not an unrealistic target, it adds 18% to the corpus 30 years later. That should be compelling enough. Now, the reality is, though, there is a lot of litigation risk. There's a lot of issues related to the defined contribution business. And this is why the analytics and data are going to be so imperative, way beyond just the inclusion. And so this is one thing that we are very certain on. As this moves forward, the need for analytics and data and the role of Preqin, eFront, Aladdin is only going to be a larger set of opportunities for BlackRock in this space.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, Larry. Hi, Martin. Good morning, everybody. Hello. Wanted to ask you guys around profitability. You've made a number of acquisitions, obviously, and now they're kind of coming into the runway. As you think about the adjusted operating margin for the back half, curious to get your thoughts. But also, as you pointed out at the investor day, the 45%+ adjusted operating margin, obviously, is quite healthy. So maybe help us sort of think through the cadence and scaling of the business as these two acquisitions kind of come into the full runway and you continue to grow some of your faster-growing areas of the business.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Alex, for the question. I'll take that one. So we talked about the strategy at investor day in terms of growing the business. BlackRock continues to deliver industry-leading margin. The margin in the Q2 of 43.3% was about 80 basis points lower year-over-year. That's really partially due to the impact of lower performance fees. Over the cycle, we see a very clear path to continue to target a 45% or greater margin profile. About 75% of that Q2 margin decline is really due to lower performance fees as well as the lower performance-related compensation in the quarter.\nJust as a reminder, we defer a portion of compensation that's linked to performance fees for talent retention. So in years where we see higher performance fees, we also see higher deferrals, which impact comp expense in future years. The remainder is really just margin impact from higher expense offset by acquisitions. So what I'd say is with the HPS acquisition now closed on 1 July 2024, as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect a low teens percentage increase in our 2025 core G&A. That's primarily driven by the onboarding of our three acquisitions.\nEx-HPS, G&A would remain in our mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase range. At investor day, I talked a lot about how we've executed on our financial framework by keeping controllable expenses within organic growth since 2023. That's really driven profitable growth and margin expansion. We aim to continue to align organic revenue growth and controllable expenses. That's compensation across base salaries, and benefits, as well as G&A. We think of controllable expenses traveling together, comp, base salaries, and benefits, as well as G&A. For Q2, our controllable expenses, excluding acquisitions, are in line with our last 12 months of organic revenue growth of 7%. On a go-forward basis, I'd say we're in a period now where expense consolidation from recent acquisitions is coloring, obviously, the comparisons. Next year will really be a full year where we get the impact of HPS and Preqin.\nThose acquisitions are essentially self-funding. GIP, HPS, and Preqin, they've all been double-digit FRE and ACV growers. Once we're through this period of consolidation in the back half of the year, we expect you'll continue to see controllable expense in line with organic base fee growth. That's what we've delivered since we introduced this framework in 2023 and over the last 12 months. As we start to see that really strong FRE and ACV growth, overall organic growth, I think you can expect us to continue to be able to drive towards our 45% or greater margin profile. Last thing I'd say is just we have a really strong entry rate, as I mentioned, into Q3. Our entry rate's 5% higher going into Q3. That's pre-HPS. With HPS, it's more like 10% higher in terms of the base fee jumping-off point.\nSo I think we have a really sound entry point into the back half of the year, even though we get some more consolidated expenses from bringing these acquisitions together. It's really important to bring people together. We've got a lot of energy about co-locating people on real estate. We know we need to do events where we bring people together. We have to go see our clients. All of those things in the long term are both growth and revenue accretive for BlackRock.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nHi, Dan.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nHello. I was hoping just on HPS now closed, Larry, you mentioned the growth there has been strong. I was hoping you could put some numbers around recent flow trends there. And as we think about the second half of the year, what products are in market and how we should think about organic growth or fundraising for that part of the business for the remainder of the year?\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nGood. I'm going to turn that to Martin.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nSo thanks for the question. Definitely an exciting time at BlackRock and for our clients in private markets. I think we talked a fair amount about this at investor day, but I'll give a little bit more color. We're obviously looking to scale private markets fundraising through a systematic approach to our clients. Now integrating GIP and HPS, we have a really robust and I think exciting roadmap for 2025 as well as the out years, which includes the next vintage of several strategies and thematic products.\nLet me just give you sort of a list of the things that are out in the marketplace today. We have fundraising going on across mid-cap and emerging markets infrastructure equity. We have investment-grade, high-yield, and credit-sensitive infrastructure debt, direct lending, and junior capital, private equity secondaries, real estate debt, and some more targeted strategies in Europe and Asia on real estate equity. As Larry and I both mentioned on the call, we successfully closed GIP 5, surpassing its $25 billion fundraising target. We also closed our secondary and liquidity strategies to SLS2, the next vintage of our secondaries fund at over $2.5 billion. At investor day, we talked about targeting $400 billion in gross private markets fundraising from 2025 through 2030. We believe that'll be led again by our infrastructure and private financing solutions platforms. We're really building on very strong absolute and relative performance.\nI think very strong DPIs on the platform relative to the peer group, this power of vintage, LP re-ups, and track record. We really feel we're in the best position that we've ever been in there to get closer to clients. I wouldn't expect that $400 billion to be a straight-line average for five years. So don't just take this last six months and average it. We'd expect more of a ramp-up to higher fundraising levels in the later years. Call that 2028 through 2030. And again, as Scott Kapnick said, as Bio said, as Larry said, as Raja said, consistent investment performance is the license to grow. All of our teams are going to be blisteringly focused on delivering for clients as the key input to our fundraising goals. I think between now and the end of the year, we'll continue to execute on those targets, bringing us towards our $400 billion in gross fundraising out to 2030.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Ben Budish with Barclays.\n\nBen Budish\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning, and thank you for taking the good morning. Thank you. Maybe just another follow-up on the private markets strategy. So you announced the acquisition of ElmTree, a smaller tuck-in. But just curious, how are you thinking about inorganic opportunities? Is this sort of an acquisition that had been on your radar? Is it something that sort of that you had been seeking or came across your desk? How does it kind of fit in? And should this be indicative of maybe future M&A, or do you feel pretty good about the assets that you have today as they are? Thank you.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nThanks so much for the question. So our main focus right now is fully integrating our acquisitions and realizing the planned synergies. It's about delivering great integration experiences for all of our clients that are seamless and our employees. I think as we've shown in our results, we don't need M&A to meet or exceed our organic growth targets. We were doing that before M&A. And now we're running on the trailing 12 months at 7% organic base fee growth. So these capabilities are helping us lift through our targets. We're going to continue, I think, to be very prudent, selective, tactical with our capital and financial position, and in how we look at M&A. We've made several smaller tactical acquisitions to bolster certain areas of the business.\nThe planned acquisition of ElmTree, which we're very excited about, which brings triple-net lease, the intersection of real estate and credit, which we think is very germane to our insurance clients and our wealth clients. Also previous acquisitions like Kreos in growth-oriented lending and SpiderRock, which helps extend our capabilities in SMAs. We also announced a minority investment in Viridium earlier this year, which also, I think, is accretive to private credit and alternatives. These acquisitions, alongside with our minority investments, they bring incremental capabilities to better serve clients and generate attractive shareholder returns. As I said at investor day, I think kind of large-scale M&A in the near to intermediate term, we've rounded out that agenda. We're going to continue to look at things that we think are complementary in terms of capabilities across private markets and technology.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nI would just add a few other things that we've been building a bit organically and the opportunities we see. We believe fundamentally that every country in the world is going to be attempting to build out their own capital markets. They see the success of the United States. One of the great reasons of the US position in the world today is having a strong banking system and a strong capital market system. We talked about this at investor day. But what we saw in India and what we're trying to do and bring out and expand its retirement system platform there is a good example of the expansion of the global capital markets. Yesterday, we had a conversation with another very big organization in a strong position in a growing, developing country with huge opportunity to do the same thing we're doing with Reliance and JioBlackRock.\nWe've already announced what we are trying to do in the Middle East and Saudi Arabia related to expansion of a mortgage-backed securities market. So we are not just looking at tuck-in acquisitions, but the opportunity we have to expand our position as more and more countries are expanding their capital markets and playing a bigger role in that. And I think India is just the beginning where we believe we're going to build out a very large-scale asset management platform in India itself. These are the seeds that we are doing that are probably being obscured by all the inorganic things we are doing. But I want to just give you that color that we see the expansion of global capital markets as a primary driver of future success for BlackRock over the next five years.\nHaving our global footprint, being in 100 different countries, just gives us a unique opportunity to be working with more and more governments worldwide and helping them think about how they expand their capital market and how do they expand their own pillar-three retirement system as a leader in retirement. This is a conversation we're having with everybody. I mentioned in one of the prior questions related to what's going on in the Netherlands, moving from DB to a hybrid DC.\nThese are all big changes, but they present huge and unique opportunities for BlackRock. Inorganic opportunities are still going to be, if they're compelling, we will still be doing those types of transactions, especially tuck-in areas in private markets or tuck-in in technology. But the opportunity to grow organically as the capital markets grows worldwide is something that we are very excited about over the next five years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\n\nBill Katz\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thank you very much. Thank you for the question. Good morning, everybody. So maybe switching gears a little bit, just thinking through, excuse me, from here, in a world of consolidating the recent transactions and being, quote-unquote, more prudent going forward, how do you think about capital returns? It seems like you're going to be generating a ton of free cash flow over the next several years. Just trying to think through the interplay between dividend and buyback, and maybe the total payout ratio. Thank you.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nThat's a question Martin should be taking.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock Inc.",
    "content2": "Hi, Bill. Thanks so much. I appreciate the question. Hope you're having a great summer. As I mentioned at investor day and again a little bit today, our capital management strategy continues to be to invest first in the business and then return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the Q2 and expect to purchase at least $1.5 billion worth of shares for full year 2025, subject to market and other conditions. Our share repurchases, again, they're an output of rather than an input to our capital management strategy. We invest first, and whatever falls out is the shareholder return. I'd say on dividends, we recognize very much that dividend income and growth is an important part of many of our investors' portfolios. We continue to target a dividend payout ratio between 40% and 50%.\nOver the last five years, we paid an average of 50% of our GAAP net income in dividends. We've steadily increased the dividends since we started in 2003. Over this time, our dividend per share has grown at a CAGR of over 15%. Over the last five years, we've paid on average 50% of our GAAP net income in dividends. Our dividend payout ratio is intended to ensure that the growth in operating and net income under our 2030 strategy that we talked about at investor day will translate into commensurate dividend growth at high single- to low double-digit rates. As I mentioned at investor day, and I'll say it here again, to avoid the payout ratio impact from the non-cash amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, we'll adjust this amortization when calibrating our dividend to the payout ratio. But again, we think that the 2030 strategy that we discussed at investor day should translate into dividend growth at high single to low double-digit rates.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nAll right. Thanks. Hey, hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just if I can maybe switch gears a little bit to iShares and Europe and fixed income in particular, if you can just talk about how you're continuing to see strong organic growth in the fixed income iShares franchise. Maybe if you can talk about where you see yourselves on the long-term development of substitution of fixed income securities for iShares ETP. And then especially in Europe, I think you talked about this at investor day. You see pretty strong growth potential as Europe sort of democratizes their retail investor base. How do you see that progressing here coming into the second half? And do you see that more just on the equity side or the alternative iShares or also on the fixed income iShares side?\n\nRobert S. Kapito\n\nPresident, BlackRock Inc.\n\nSo thanks for the question. More growth, more people using iShares ETFs along the active side of the world, alongside of active, using the wrapper for hedging purposes, just more and more and more use cases that we're seeing. And it has really caught on in Europe now as a primary wrapper and market to be involved in. So we continue to show industry-leading results. We have the number one share of global ETF flows year to date as the iShares and ETF become the vehicle of choice and we're the industry leader and probably have the most diversified offering of anyone.\nThat diversification is reflected in our organic revenue, which is nearly three times the next largest issuer and in flows where 38 iShares products had over $1 billion of net inflows this quarter. So that diversification is working for us. We're seeing outsized strength from our highest conviction growth areas like fixed income, active, now digital assets, and European listed ETFs. And Martin mentioned before, bond ETFs led the way at $44 billion, followed by digital assets, $14 billion, active ETFs, $1.1 billion, and precision and other at $1.8 billion. Europe, as you highlighted, saw $29 billion of net inflows. So we will continue to evolve our ETF business and increase access to all kinds of markets more efficiently, more transparently, and conveniently.\nSo this is a business that we continue to capture the flag globally, and also help our clients expand the use of that product to areas that we didn't think of that were responding with solutions to our clients with this wrapper.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nLet me just add a few more things. As the European markets evolve and change, and as regulation really focused on remunerations, the beginnings of access to ETFs in Europe is only just beginning. Europe is five, six years behind the United States in terms of access. It's just all evolving now. iShares is about $1 trillion in Europe, 40% market share. We are in a position now, especially in countries, as we said, changing away from defined benefits and defined contributions in Europe. You're going to see more and more of the financial advisory organizations of Europe.\nYou're going to see more and more of the digital organizations in Europe adapting more and more ETF-based strategies, similarly to what we've seen in the United States. So we believe Europe is just starting to launch the same type of growth rates that we saw in the United States in terms of the adaptation of ETFs. And if you now intersect the role of digital ETFs, to me, that is creating more and more enthusiasm, more access to ETFs, more interest in ETFs. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're seeing more and more clients who first started using ETFs for IBIT are now looking at ETFs and iShares as a vehicle to expand way beyond their first entry into a digital platform. So we're very well positioned. I look at the opportunities in Europe similarly to the type of growth rates we saw in the US over the last five years.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nHi, Patrick.\n\nPatrick Davitt\n\nPartner, Autonomous Research\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks. You touched on this briefly, but stablecoins, obviously, top of mind for many investors on the back of Circle's IPO, and your managing that money has been a strong boost to those flows for you. So through that lens, could you speak to how you see what looks like a fairly significant emerging opportunity for asset managers to manage these reserves? Is there a pipeline of other potential mandates like the Circle one? And then finally, within that, maybe some color on why these platforms can't or don't want to just invest in treasuries directly versus using your money funds or other people's money funds. Thank you.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nYeah. In my world tour working with central banks and regulators, conversation about stablecoin is vibrant right now. And so what we are going to see is more competitive type of stablecoins. They may have some role in diversifying away from dollar as we digitize more and more currency. But the opportunity for BlackRock in our role in both stablecoin or the entire role of tokenization of financial assets, tokenization of real assets like real estate is going to be the future. And we believe more than ever before that we are as well positioned as any organization in the world to be part of the conversations as stablecoins are going to be growing and developing. Related to buying money market funds or having a role, playing a role as the manager, those conversations are broad.\nBut if you're going to show that a stablecoin truly is a substitute for a currency, it must be invested in those currencies, bonds. And so I would hope that that will remain as a consistent feature of each and every stablecoin. And I believe that is going to be one of the big issues. There are questions remaining with some other stablecoins as to what is the collateral backing some of that. And if we're going to put our name associated with it, we believe each and every stablecoin should be invested in short-term government bonds that back that stablecoin. We want to make sure it's legitimized, but it's also safe, and it's a great digital substitution for each and every country's cash as a cash substitute. And I think that is going to be moving very rapidly.\nBut it is surprising even to me the dialogues that we're having with central banks and how they are looking to now use their own digitized currency or using stablecoins to digitize their currency. And so we believe this is just the beginning, and we will be playing a significant role as stablecoins are developed in each and every country. They believe it will fit the needs of their own monetary policy and their policies related to their capital markets.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock Inc.\n\nYes. Thank you, Operator. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our Q2 results demonstrated the strength of our global relationships and how our platform is powering the portfolios of the future. We're so excited to welcome our new colleagues from HPS to our global offices in the coming months, and we're working closely together to better serve our clients across all their investment needs, which in turn should drive stronger, more durable results as we did in this quarter for you, our shareholders. Everyone, thank you. Have a good summer. Enjoy the quarter. Bye-bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."

My name is Kayte, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Q1 2025 earnings teleconference. Our host for today's call will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer Martin S. Small, President Rob Kapito, and General Counsel Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answers period. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press Star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star two. Thank you, Mr. Meade. You may begin your conference.\n\nChris Meade\n\nChief Legal Officer, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for Q1 2025. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results.\nI'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.\nWe've built BlackRock's platform to help clients in all market environments, even against a sharp change in markets and uncertainty in fiscal and monetary policy. Our strategy to anchor our business and structural growth engines like private markets, ETFs, digital assets, whole portfolio solutions, systematic and tax managed strategies, and technology. That strategy helped again deliver above target 6% organic base fee growth. That's alongside double digit growth across the board in revenue, operating income, and earnings per share and with 100 basis points of margin expansion in Q1 2025. Q1 demonstrates the benefits of our investments to make the BlackRock platform more all weather across asset management and technology integrating public and private for clients and shareholders. Our platform is showing its ability to be more resilient and deliver higher and more consistent organic growth through market cycles.\nWe're a partner with both long term perspective and ability to move quickly in times of stress. We've been through times of economic and market disruption before, during the financial crisis, COVID, and in 2022. So more than ever it's important that we continue our successful track record of being strongly connected to our clients, policymakers, and employees locally in all the markets in which we operate. We don't think of ourselves as a U.S. firm with international offices. We're a European firm, we're a Canadian firm, we're a Middle Eastern firm. We aspire to be the best partner to our clients. We work to help governments and clients understand markets and and complex questions at the intersection of investor portfolios and geopolitics. We lead with empathy and trusted advice. These periods of uncertainty with major market resets, they're often catalysts for client changes to asset allocation and portfolio construction.\nBenefiting from our breadth, BlackRock has a track record of share gains when there's money in motion. We historically did that as a public markets focused firm. Now with money in motion again, BlackRock is better positioned to serve our clients and grow with leading capabilities that integrate public and private markets. We finished the record quarter with record AUM, record units of trust of $11.6 trillion. Over the last 12 months, clients trusted BlackRock with $670 billion of new assets, making more than 60% of our year-over-year AUM growth. Organic first-quarter net inflows continued our growth with $84 billion. As a management team, we look at core flow trends away from episodic large low-fee institutional index redemptions, of which we had $55 billion in the quarter. Excluding that activity, BlackRock delivered approximately $140 billion of net inflows in the quarter.\nOrganic asset and base fee growth were driven by client demand for private markets, strategic, and precision categories within ETFs, as well as top-performing systematic strategies. These are all capabilities we've invested in over recent years and demonstrate the success of our structural growth strategy. Turning to our financial results, Q1 revenue of $5.3 billion increased 12% year-over-year driven by the impact of organic growth and higher markets. On average, AUM, base fees consolidated in the GIP transaction, and higher technology services and subscription revenue. Operating income of $2 billion was up 14% and earnings per share of $11.30 was 15% higher versus a year ago. EPS also reflected lower non-operating income, a lower tax rate, and higher share count in the current quarter.\nThe higher year over year share count included shares issued and delivered at the closing of the GIP transaction on 1 October 2024.\nNon-operating results for the quarter included $68 million of net investment gains driven primarily by mark-to-market, non-cash gains on our co-investment portfolio, and a gain on a minority investment. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 16% and reflected $195 million of discrete tax benefits. A portion was related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2025. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nQ1 base fee and securities lending revenue of $4.4 billion was up 16% year over year, driven by positive impact of market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and approximately $285 million in base fees from GIP.\nOn an equivalent day count basis. Our annualized effective fee rate was a tenth of a basis point higher compared to the fourth quarter. This was mainly due to the impact of approximately 60 million higher catch up base fees associated with private markets fundraising, excluding first quarter catch up fees and including the impact of market and foreign exchange movements towards the second half of the first quarter. We entered the second quarter with base fees approximately 1% lower than the first quarter.\nPerformance fees of $60 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower performance revenue from private markets and liquid alternatives. Quarterly technology services and subscription revenue was up 16% compared to a year ago. Growth reflects sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings and the closing of the Preqin transaction on 3 March. Preqin added approximately $20 million to Q1 revenue. Annual contract value or ACV increased 30% year over year, including the Preqin acquisition, and increased 14% organically. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term. Total expense increased 10% year over year, reflecting higher sales, asset and account G&A, and compensation expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 7%, reflecting higher headcount associated with the onboarding of the GIP and Preqin employees and higher incentive compensation linked to higher operating income.\nG&A expense increased 12% primarily driven by the GIP and Preqin acquisitions and continued technology investments. Excluding the impact of the GIP and Preqin acquisitions, G&A would have increased 6% from a year ago. Sales, asset, and account expense increased 14% compared to a year ago primarily driven by higher direct fund expense and distribution costs. Direct fund expense was up 16% year over year mainly due to higher average index AUM. Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.2% was up 100 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue and organic base fee growth. We continue to execute on our financial rubric. This approach has yielded profitable growth and operating leverage in good markets, and we believe will add more resilience to our operating margin when markets are less supportive.\nIn line with our January guidance, which excludes the impact of HPS and related transaction costs, at present, we continue to expect a mid- to high-single-digit percentage increase in 2025 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first in our business either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then return cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends, and share repurchases.\nWe repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in Q1. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year. Consistent with our January guidance, we continue to target mid-2025 for the closing of the HPS transaction, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Last month, an investor consortium including BlackRock announced the acquisition of Viridium Group. Viridium is Germany's leading closed block life insurance consolidator and fourth largest life insurance company. Upon the close of the transaction, BlackRock will have a non-controlling, non-consolidated minority equity investment in Viridium and help the company access a broader range of private markets investment opportunities in support of policyholders and the company.\nWe expect that growth to be in private credit strategies including infrastructure, corporate debt, and asset-based finance. The transaction is expected to close in H2 2025 subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Also, in March we issued EUR 1 billion of euro-denominated 10-year debt at a coupon of 3.75% to refinance our euro-denominated notes maturing in May 2025. The euro debt aligns our capital structure with our global business. Beginning in Q1, we refined our AUM presentation to further highlight growth areas within BlackRock. The updates primarily focus on our private markets and ETF platforms. We believe these changes provide investors with further transparency into channels powering BlackRock's organic growth strategy. In Q1, BlackRock generated total net inflows of $84 billion, excluding low fee institutional index outflows driven by rebalancing.\nBlackRock's net inflows were $140 billion. ETF net inflows of $107 billion were positive across all channels, led by core equity and fixed income ETFs with net inflows of $46 billion and $34 billion respectively. Our innovative product launches across ETFs continue to see widespread adoption, as clients use our latest offerings to access a range of investment exposures. Our active ETFs contributed $9 billion of net inflows, and our digital asset ETPs generated another $3 billion inflows into these higher fee ETF categories, contributed to 7% annualized organic base fee growth for ETFs in the first quarter. Retail net inflows of $13 billion were led by record quarterly flows in Aperio, sustained demand for fixed income offerings, and our systematic liquid alternatives funds. Institutional active net inflows were $8 billion, driven by demand for infrastructure, private markets, our LifePath target date franchise, and systematic active equity offerings.\nThese inflows were partially offset by a handful of client-specific redemptions from active fixed income primarily due to reinsurance activity. Institutional index net outflows of $46 billion were concentrated in low-fee index equities, partially offset by inflows into index fixed income. Our institutional channel delivered 7% long-term organic base fee growth in the quarter, benefiting from client demand for private markets and systematic strategies in private markets. We saw an aggregate $7 billion of net inflows led by infrastructure and private credit. Liquid alternatives added $2 billion of net inflows primarily into global equity, market neutral, and multi-strategy funds run by our systematic teams. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $1 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. Cash management results reflected growth in the Circle Reserve Fund partially offset by seasonal redemptions from U.S. government funds.\nWe've built our business around structural growers, ETFs, private markets, tax-managed and systematic data-driven investing, and whole portfolio solutions. It's not just that they're less market sensitive; it's that they are secular shifts in the way clients are doing business. That's what gives those categories tailwinds. When markets are strong, they'll grow faster. When markets are weaker, they may grow slower, but they still grow. Our Q1 results show our strategy in action. We surpassed our 5% organic base fee growth target even with more stressed and uncertain markets. Markets may take some time to sort out saber rattling around trade and tariffs, but BlackRock and our clients see growth and opportunity. Clients may look to preserve capital in the near term, but ultimately will continue investing.\nIt'll be a market where clients are looking for advice and where BlackRock shines as an integrated whole portfolio provider. Looking ahead, we believe our strategy will continue to deliver for both our clients and shareholders, resulting in market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage, and earnings and multiple expansion over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nThank you Martin. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's positioning and connectivity with clients are stronger than ever, and it's clear in our results. Our structural growth strategy resonated in Q1 with secular growth across our businesses, even with a volatile market backdrop. We delivered above target 6% organic base fee growth, which represented our best start of the year since 2021. That's in a quarter where the S&P 500 ended 9% off its February peak. It's proof of BlackRock's enhanced structural strength where we can power organic revenue growth that's undeterred by market movement. Revenues grew double-digit, and our as adjusted operating margin expanded by over 100 basis points. Q1 total net inflows were approximately $140 billion, excluding the episodic institutional index equity activity that Martin mentioned.\nImportantly, net inflows and organic base fee growth were well diversified across the entire BlackRock platform.\nWe invested ahead of our secular growth opportunities and ahead of where our clients are going. This quarter, the largest organic base drivers were strategies that we developed in just the last few years, including GIP, our digital asset offerings, Aperio, active ETFs, as well as our tech- and data-driven systematic equities franchise.\nStrength in our foundational businesses also underpinned results with a record start of the year for iShares ETFs and a 14% technology ACV growth.\nUncertainty and anxiety about the future of the markets and the economy are dominating each and every client conversation. I was traveling in Europe last week when the sweeping U.S. tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance.\nI wrote in my Chairman's Letter last week that no system has done more to generate wealth for more people than the capital markets. As the capital markets have grown, more people than ever before are investing in the stock market. A little more than 60% of Americans own stock in one way or another, in mutual funds, in ETFs, in individual shares, and especially in their own retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs. So this isn't Wall Street versus Main Street. The market downturn impacts millions of ordinary people's retirement savings, their investments for a child's college education and tuition, or steps they're taking to have more financial stability.\nWe're in a period of geopolitical and economic activity, but we have seen this before when there are big pivots in the world, big structural changes in the market like the financial crisis, like the European debt crisis, or Covid, or the surging inflation. In 2022, BlackRock stayed in front of our clients and made some of our greatest leaps forward.\nAt BlackRock, we really challenge ourselves not to get mired down in all the negativity, but to navigate, to mitigate, to move forward, to work with each and every client, to help each and every client. In recent weeks, we've connected with thousands of clients, providing them with real-time information and our views on unfolding events.\nBlackRock's expertise is built and delivered through our nearly 23,000 employees located in 30-plus countries. Together they serve clients in more than 100 countries. The majority of our workforce is actually based outside the United States. Our international workforce includes people in our global platform centers in Europe, in India, and our international commercial offices all across the world.\nThis enables us to bring the global insight and investment strategies locally and to bring local insights globally.\nWe need to be an American in the United States or German in Germany or Japanese in Japan or Canadian in Canada, and Mexicans in Mexico. It's also to bring opportunities we see in each and every country to our global client base. It's contributing locally to build a country's capital market and retirement system and working for each and every client in each and every country. Probably 80% of what we bring to our clients. Our clients are looking for a global global strength, global expertise. They're looking for scale, operating efficiencies, and investment talent. But it's the last 20% of the magic where it occurs. It's where you show the best of BlackRock in a local setting anywhere in the world. Doesn't matter whether the client is large or small or where they are.\nBut to know that BlackRock is working for them, and we show that we are working for each and every one of them. We're intentionally shaping our platform around the needs of our clients, and we talk about this in every quarter. Result. It's about the clients building a premier global public private market, investment, and technology firm. We've assembled a leading franchise across active strategies, ETFs, private markets, technology to serve the complete range of our clients' needs and to help them in each and every one of their own ambitions. Whether seeking capital preservation in cash and short duration, or capitalizing on opportunities and equities, or looking for income and uncorrelated returns in private markets, BlackRock's comprehensive offering is leading to clients consolidating more of their portfolio with them. I look at our cash business as one example of how we help clients manage asset allocation and liquidity.\nOur cash AUM is up at an all-time high as of April. Now it's at $950 billion.\nAt BlackRock, we're always listening and deeply listening to each and every client and looking ahead to what their future needs will be. We're working with them on long term issues, not the ups and downs of the market or the next tweet or the next issue. We're constantly testing ourselves to see where we need to do more, to be more different, to be faster, to be working on behalf of our clients. I said last quarter that it is just the beginning. The successful arcs of BlackRock, of GIP, Preqin, and soon HPS are all coming together in a shared story. GIP and Preqin employees moved into our BlackRock headquarters earlier this year and we expect HPS to join shortly after the closing. It's one BlackRock physically and definitely one BlackRock spiritually.\nWe're seeing how sensitive public markets are to uncertainty and how quickly they can move in reaction to policy proposals. These dynamics could drive even more capital flows into private markets as investors look to insulate portfolios from tariff impacts and seek attractive income and growth. Last year we invested in enriching our private markets information investments data platform to serve our clients more. We are seeing the results today and are positioned for this type of secular growth as economic uncertainty plays out in infrastructure. Our combination with GIP just six months ago has already unlocked differentiated opportunities for our clients. Last month we announced the largest infrastructure investment in our history. We have an agreement in principle to acquire a significant portfolio of 43 ports in more than 20 countries.\nWe had a strong existing relationship with a seller of these assets and, as a long-term shareholder. Our partners in this consortium include Mediterranean Shipping Company, one of the world's leading leaders in shipping and logistics, and Terminal Investment Ltd., which is one of the world's largest global container terminal operators. Upon closing on this deal, our consortium's investors will have a portfolio of approximately 100 ports around the world. Together we know how to invest in them, own them, improve on them, and operate them.\nWe have recently expanded our AI Infrastructure partnership and we're excited to welcome xAI and NVIDIA as partners alongside Microsoft and MGX. Since its announcement, AIP has attracted significant capital interest and advanced key discussions on AI infrastructure projects. The partnership.\nWill meet the expected target of $30 billion in capital from investors, asset owners, and corporations, and over time we believe this can unlock over $100 billion in investment potential, including debt financing of these infrastructure projects.\nBoth AIP and the landmark PORTS announcement are early confirmations of the power and value of GIP pairing with BlackRock. It's unlikely either of us on our own would have been part of these transactions. At the heart of the GIP acquisition was our conviction in how our combined relationships, our combined expertise would come together and deliver fantastic investment opportunities for each and every client worldwide.\nWe expect to scale our private credit AUM to approximately $220 billion following our planned acquisition of HPS.\nThe opportunity set for private credit is expanding as a variety of borrowers from startups to large corporate partners seek more flexible execution as they evaluate their financing needs, and the longer duration lower risk returns of investment grade private debt are driving increased allocations from insurance companies. BlackRock already manages approximately $700 billion for the insurance industry, primarily in index public credit strategies, and our Aladdin technology powers over 100 different insurance companies.\nAs Martin mentioned, our investment in Viridium is the latest example of our commitment to supporting partners through broad solution sets including investments, capital, and insurance expertise. BlackRock has a meaningful role in helping manage Viridium's private market investments going forward, including in infrastructure investments and private credit. The upcoming addition of HPS represents even more opportunities to extend our insurance relationships across all private credit markets.\nWe also expect HPS to advance our positioning in the quickly growing ALTS to wealth space, including through their approximately $20 billion wealth-focused BDC offerings. We've had recent success with our own non-traded BDCs, including placements with RIAs and with a large traditional distribution platforms, and we're looking forward to leveraging our shared expertise and expanded network to grow our combined franchises even further. After closing, our acquisition of Preqin brings leading capabilities in private market data to our technology platform and now triples our desktop reach to more than 300.\nWe believe this acquisition enriches growth potential not only for BlackRock private markets and technology franchises, but for the entire private market industry as a whole.\nGrowth is diversified across our Aladdin franchise as clients are increasingly choosing to leverage the integrated capabilities of our public private market workflow and data offerings. It's more important than ever for our clients to have a clear, unified view of their portfolio from the building blocks of asset allocation to the minutia of trade execution and accounting. Aladdin recently went live with our first client in Korea, adding to our scaled relationships with leading institutions around the world, and looking ahead, we see more opportunity to expand our relationships with Preqin's more than 4,400 clients.\nBlackRock is a global firm, but one that operates hyper locally. We connect our clients across regions to both local and global capital markets. The U.S. investment opportunity set is still going to be very relevant. We see our role outside the United States to both help our clients understand dynamics of the United States markets and enabling them to channel investments into their own capital markets. Strong local capital markets underpin the development of each and every country's robust retirement system. BlackRock is partnering with governments and sovereign wealth funds in these efforts. In India, we expect our joint venture with Jio BlackRock to launch later this year, subject to regulatory approvals. We believe we can transform access to investing for Indians, ultimately contributing to the development of a retirement system and a better financial future for each and every of our clients in India.\nIn Saudi Arabia, we launched an investment management platform to partner with the Public Investment Fund to drive capital into the local markets. It's managed by a dedicated BlackRock team in Riyadh. We're also working in the Kingdom to help develop a mortgage-backed securities market and establishment of a secondary market for mortgage loans which should help banks lower the cost of home mortgages and home mortgages becoming more accessible for citizens in the Kingdom.\nIn Europe, we are making it easier for more and more people to shift from savings to investing through ETFs and digital-first offerings. Our European ETF platform crossed over $1 trillion for the first time this quarter and is well positioned for the future with approximately 40% market share by AUM, and the European ETF market has opened in 2025 with record demand. iShares European net inflows have more than doubled compared to the flows at this time last year.\nBlackRock iShares is well positioned to capture significant upside in the coming years with our leading platform and diversified offering. We continue to innovate new products and new uses and recently brought our Bitcoin ETF to Europe. This builds on the success of our Bitcoin ETF launched in the United States last year, and Canada in January. They continue to gain adoption with another $3 billion in net inflows in Q1.\nWe see large opportunities for growth in digital assets and more broadly for blockchain and tokenization technology. Digital assets drove cash management net inflows this quarter as we continue to manage cash-based reserves through a relationship with Circle and BlackRock. Tokenized digital liquidity fund, available on a public blockchain, became the first Wall Street issued fund to cross over $1 billion in AUM and just recently surpassed $2 billion. BlackRock will continue to look for ways to push on-chain finance forward as part of our leadership financial technology and innovation and in data.\nBlackRock's global scale, our relationships worldwide and locally, and our industry-leading technology has made us the first call for more clients and more partnerships than any other time. They are seeking BlackRock to have conversations not about the tick-tock of any one single day of the market. They're looking to us to talk to them on long-term trends, working with them to help them design a portfolio that can be leading them for better futures. We're not a transactional organization. BlackRock has always remained to be focused on the long-term with consistency, always there with capital.\nWith corporations, we often have relationships that go back decades as long-term investors in their debt and their equity and through a financial markets advisory practice where the advisor of choice that governments, central banks, and other public and private capital market participants turn to when they need frameworks to support their economy and their capital liquidity. Since the financial crisis, FMA has been the most trusted to counsel the Fed, governments of Greece and Ireland, Bank of Canada, and so many others. We have a long history of providing guidance on practical targeted monetary and fiscal solutions in support of the global economy. We will continue to work with clients; we will continue to work with governments around the world to help them navigate developments in the economies and help them build out the global capital markets.\nI'd note that the market downturn this year is different from what we've seen in other shocks since the financial crisis. We do not see systemic risks. There is not a pandemic. The financial system has shown it's safe and sound, and the resiliency of the markets, of trading more volume with liquidity than any other time. With all this volatility, the markets have proven to be quite successful and work quite well.\nObviously there's near-term uncertainty, but the big macro trends that were in place 80 days ago actually are still around. I know it's hard to believe only 80 days ago, but the mega forces like artificial intelligence, surging demand for global infrastructure, and an ongoing evolution of debt financing presents transformative investment opportunities. Build outs of data centers and energy, the need for power grids, and semiconductor plants and other infrastructure are beginning and are going to be growing dramatically over the coming years. Obviously more policy clarity will help this uncertainty, but I remain very optimistic about the capital coming into the markets over the long term. I want to end by saying that I believe that we are in a better position, better prepared today to meet our clients' demand at BlackRock than ever before.\nThis is reflective of our depth.\nThe.\nQuality of our dialogue, the deepness of our relationships, and the length of our relationships with our clients worldwide. We are having the highest quality of conversations with our clients worldwide here in the United States than ever before.\nActually, in markets like today, clients are putting even a greater premium on BlackRock and the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer them. We have remained, in good times and bad times, their trusted partner.\nI'd like to thank our employees for their steadfast focus on delivering for our clients and driving value for our shareholders. Once again we're very proud that BlackRock generated 6% organic base fee growth against this very complex market backdrop driven by categories that we only invested in recent years like the structural long term growers, like infrastructure, like ETFs, and like systematic equities.\nWe lead with a growth mindset. We lead with optimism.\nLong-term winners don't get bogged down in the pessimism. They break down barriers to find solutions to help build that optimism with each and every client. Over the long run we try to see through the pessimism of the short run, and that is exactly what we are doing, and we're excited for the opportunity to do great work beyond today and tomorrow, throughout 2025, and going forward in the coming years ahead. I want to thank everybody. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you do ask a question, please take your phone off of its speaker setting and use your handset. To avoid any potential feedback, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-enter the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.\nYour first question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Michael Martin. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe just given so much going on around the world, maybe just starting off with the current backdrop, curious in your conversations with clients, are you getting any sort of sense of how retail and institutional allocations may shift as we look forward from here? And how are clients approaching their decision making in this current backdrop?\nThank you.\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nMichael, I mean, we have not seen any capitulation with any clients at all.\nObviously we're spending a lot of time with our retail investors.\nWe've seen an elevated increase in April, which is an unusual time to see elevated increases in cash. We had $20 billion in inflows this month alone in cash. But let's be clear, there's over $12 trillion in money market funds. So there is this huge reserve of money that will be put to work in the future.\nWe're having a lot of conversations related to fixed income. You think about, as the yield curve steepens and we are a big believer the yield curve is going to continue to steepen, you know, in the coming months, as the yield curve continues to steepen, we probably are going to see more people extend out.\nIt represents more opportunities. If you now go out the yield curve and then look at where private credit is trading, that you're going to be able to earn, you know, 8-ish% or even more today. And so with all this market uncertainty, these are not bad places to put.\nFor an intermediate period of time where you would be putting your money. That being said, we have not seen one true capitulation with one client in equities. Actually, in most cases, more and more our clients are saying, should we be when do we come in and buy more equities? Obviously a lot of people think at this time you don't buy the dip.\nBut I would say the one thing of caution.\nIs.\nOver the last 15 years we've seen a broadening of interest in the U.S. capital markets. We saw the U.S. capital markets grow to represent 75% of the total value of the world capital markets.\nAs Europe is now finally focused on growing instead of controlling, could Europe become a better destination for capital? Are there other areas where you could see reallocations? We as a country benefited by the huge reallocation and overallocation in U.S. markets. Are we going to see a systematic reallocation into other parts of the world? We have not seen that yet, but that's a good question to be raising as people are starting to believe that Europe might for the first time in many years focusing on growth, not containment. And so more questions are being asked. But I think the dominant area where we're seeing conversations are.\nIs this a time to go out the curve and fixed income? This is the time. When is this time to add more equity exposure? Then I would also say very clearly there has been no change in client demand for infrastructure. If anything, the demand for infrastructure strategies that can throw off mid-teen returns that can be a great protector of inflationary pressures over the long run, the opportunity in infrastructure probably is as great as any other time that we've seen. The one thing that we are seeing that I think is differentiated with most other asset managers, our systematic equity team that has had great performance. Even now.\nWe continue to see.\nLarge interest and consistent inflows. We saw inflows in systematic equities in Q1, and, in our conversations, that in some cases moving out of fundamental equities into systematic equities is certainly the conversations to be had. But I would say it's too early to see any major wholesale changes by any major client base.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, Larry, Martin.\nHope everyone's doing well.\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning. How are you, Craig?\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nI'm good.\nSo there's a lot to talk about.\nThese days, but I wanted to come back to some comments that you made in your annual letter around private markets entering the retail channel. So given that BlackRock is one of the largest 401(k) managers and is the largest DCIO manager, where are you in the build out of adding privates into either existing target date funds or launching new target date funds that have a significant allocation of privates? And are you really just waiting on guidance or actual rulemaking from the Department of Labor before you move forward?\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nLet me just talk on one thing. This is one of the main reason why we bought Preqin and why I believe Preqin will become a major component for the whole ecosystem. And I said that in my prepared remarks.\nTo properly add, especially in retirement products, more private, private investments, I believe better data analytics that will create better transparency, better price discovery is going to be necessary. And this is why we believe in what we are doing in the Aladdin space with eFront is gonna be a major component of this, the changing ecosystem in retirement. And I'll let Martin get into the specifics of what we're doing at BlackRock related to those type of products.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nYeah, thanks. So Craig, you've got it. You know BlackRock's the number one DC investment only firm, the number one DCIO firm, and we're a top five private markets and alts manager following our recent acquisitions. So we have the investment content, we have the franchise. We have a $500 billion AUM target date business, and Larry talked about it in his letter. But we see real potential benefits to retirees, and in greater diversification and better retirement outcomes through the blending of public and private markets. We have a real strong presence in both retirement channels and private markets. Relationships, distribution, investment opportunities. So a couple of things. One, we have developed the glide path technology to create a target date style product in terms of allocations and moving allocations across public and private markets to think about growth potential and liquidity in target date style.\nSo we have the Glide Path technology in order to implement those portfolios. We are launching and have plans to launch in the middle of the year a target date style offering with private markets on a retirement platform, one of the larger trust companies in the United States. So we look forward to being able to update you about that later in the year. So we see target date, really, Craig, is the most efficient way to deliver private markets into retirement accounts, particularly defined contribution because this approach would embed these exposures in allocations already made by target funds. So it's got to be target funds, balanced funds, or managed accounts. We see that as the most efficient way of doing it.\nThose are the types of vehicles that serve as the qualified default investment alternative or the QDIA, and they capture the bulk of 401(k) flows and participant-directed individual accounts. We do think for the opportunity to be really broad, really scalable, and the most tangible, we'd likely need to see litigation reform or at least some advice reform in the U.S. to add private markets disclosure into DC plans. We have innovated. We've advocated on behalf of workers for improved retirement solutions and national initiatives to modernize retirement. Just this past quarter, we hosted a large group of policymakers and members of Congress to discuss retirement at a BlackRock retirement summit in Washington, DC, that was very successful. This was one of the topics that we discussed.\nSo if there's an opportunity to make private markets more accessible in the retirement channel, our plan is to be at the forefront.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll take our next question from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Alex.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey Larry.\nGood morning everybody. Question for you guys. A little bit more strategically when I sort of think about periods of prior major market dislocations, BlackRock met some real kind of monumental changes to the business.\nGFC obviously comes to mind with iShares acquisition. While I know you made a big bet on private markets today, as I sort of think about ahead and any other major changes that are yet to come from markets, and it sounds like U.S. decoupling from the rest of the world in terms of cap markets is top of mind for you guys. Does that mean BlackRock might need to get even larger outside the U.S.? Does that mean that BlackRock might need to pursue larger acquisitions outside the U.S., or how are you thinking about this sort of period of disruption relative to your longer term strategy versus other periods?\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGreat question, Alex. So let me just say that the answer is no. It doesn't relate to any acquisitions outside the world. Our relationship with governments across the world is giving us a real opportunity. You know, I talked about what we're doing in India and building out that market. We're very excited about that opportunity in India. We have a couple of announcements of partnerships with other organizations in Latam that we're working on. So it's strategically partnering with our long-term clients. In addition, if you just looked at our position in Europe with ETFs with 40% market share in iShares.\nAnd then as I said in my prepared remarks, I was in Europe last week. The conversation we're having, let's say in Netherlands as they move away from defined benefit to defined contribution, the opportunities we have there in working with all these different plan sponsors and the major pension plans there. But across the board, our being part of the consortium of Viridium really gives us a unique opportunity in the insurance space and managing insurance assets in Germany and other parts of Europe, working in Australia where I was earlier this year, the opportunity we have with GIP and the opportunities we have in infrastructure across the board. I think as you know, GIP acquired all the airports in Malaysia, and so if anything our footprint continues to grow.\nWe are now in 30 different countries with offices, and I would say by year-end we may be as large as 30, 35 different countries. We will be shortly announcing three new countries where we're opening our offices. We actually manage money in 100 different countries for our clients worldwide. So if anything, by helping countries navigate changes in their retirement system like DB to DC, by helping countries begin a retirement system like India or beginning a mortgage-backed security system like in Saudi Arabia, and then continue to have the footprint, no firm is in the position to have.\nThis footprint in so many different parts of the world. If anything, this has been one of our great features, which I think in many cases has been totally underappreciated, how deeply engaged we are and how deeply local we are within so many countries. And the one thing that we talk about across the board, as one of the largest shareholders of companies worldwide, our relationships are not transactional. We are working with the pension fund communities, we're working with all the major corporations, and all the different countries. And it gives us a differentiated position with.\nOne of the big reasons I said in the prepared remarks related to the port transaction, our long-term relationship with CK Hutchison, it just gives us the ability to understand the client better.\nAnd so I actually believe.\nThat, with this type of uncertainty, with this type of volatility, with this type of sometimes chaos that we're seeing, if anything, the degree of black box consistency that we could bring to each and every client has allowed us to have a broadening conversation. Mark, do you want to add to anything good? I guess that was it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Mike Brown with Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Mike.\n\nMike Brown\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHi, good morning.\nThanks for taking my question.\nLots of good color here on the international footprint and key strengths of the franchise there. I just wanted to ask about the growing frictions between the U.S. and other countries. Are you worried about the risk of some assets potentially moving away from the U.S. in general, and is there any risk you think of any backlash to BlackRock specifically as a U.S.-headquartered manager?\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGreat question. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are Mexican in Mexico, Canadian in.\nCanada.\nDutch in Netherlands, British in the U.K., Irish in Ireland, Japanese in Japan. This is not something new. This is something that we started this type of emphasis 37 years ago. The whole foundation of BlackRock, our first client worldwide was a Japanese client, was not a U.S. client. We have systematically made sure that we remain local, vibrant, and a part of each and every economy. That's what we're trying to do. That's why we're going to be opening a few more offices that we're going to announce shortly to be even more local in these different areas where we have large client relationships.\nAnd so there is no question, as I also said in my prepared remarks, that when you think about the growth of the U.S. capital markets, representing 75% of the totality of the global capital markets, and it used to be around 50, 55. Could we see.\nCould what the European leaders are doing that are now unlocking growth instead of containing growth, could this be a time where people should be reallocating back or at least be in a market? Most clients underweight in Europe. Is this a time to at least have a market weight in Europe or is this a time to have a market overweight? And you could say this about many other areas.\nSo we're not. Our job is to be working with each and every client. A lot of it is going to be on relative evaluation. But as I said in my prepared remarks 80 days ago, everyone talked about U.S. supremacy, vitality of the United States. That was the major conversations even in Davos 80 days ago about.\nThe strength of the U.S., that is not a conversation being had now. But as I said in my prepared remarks, the macro forces of AI, of infrastructure.\nIs just as strong today as it was 80 days ago, and all the other macro trends. I do believe.\nWhen the Trump administration works on their growth initiatives that they've talked about, the deregulation, the simplification of permits, and I hope the same thing happens in Europe that is going to unlock an amazing amount of private capital. This is why we put such an emphasis on infrastructure and private credit. We will be prepared when there is an unlocking of more private capital to invest in infrastructure, in data centers, in airports, in grids.\nIn power. And so all of this remains. I know it's been obscured by the conversations with tariffs being obscured about all the other issues going around, but the macro megatrends have not changed. And as I said, if Europe is focused on growth, that is a great added opportunity that we didn't see 80 days ago. If other parts of the world are focusing on their own growth in addition to the growth that we see in the United States, this will be fine. In the short run, yes, we do have inflationary pressures. Yes, in the short run we have an economy that is at risk. But my long-term views have not changed at all, despite all the short-term fears.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nI want to expand on just one point that Larry's made that I think might go to your question, but also maybe a little bit to Alex's prior question, which is if you were to take the page five of our supplement and look at the revenue weighted composite indexes for BlackRock AUM. You'd see BlackRock has a lot of positive leverage to growing stock markets outside of the United States. That generally tends to be good for our business. It tends to be fee rate accretive to our business. And so we believe in helping countries grow their capital markets. And we see those opportunities of improved capital markets performance outside of the United States as being very much aligned with our financial growth.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nHi Patrick.\n\nPatrick Davitt\n\nPartner, Autonomous Research\n\nHey, good morning everyone. Just a follow-up on the alts.\n401(k) discussion on the demand side of things.\nCould you expand on what you're actually hearing from the plans in terms of demand for these products?\nSo if we do get that legal safe harbor, could there be a quick uptake or do you think it will be a slower build once you get that green light?\n\nMartin Small",
    "content2": "CFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Patrick, for the question. So I would segment the market basically into, I'll say, three main categories, the first of which would be large plan sponsors. Large plan sponsors move very slowly. They have consultants, they're very prudent, and take time. That's not where we're seeing rapid growth or rapid interest at this point. I would say mid-tier plan sponsors are more interested, and the smaller plan sponsors are most interested in building these types of portfolios. In addition, what I'd say is platforms, right? The platforms that are trust companies, retirement platforms, and registered investment advisors that do advisor sold, 401(k) business, they all have high degrees of interest in being able to offer these types of products to their clients.\nSo I would expect among the largest 401(k) plan sponsors that are consultant intermediated that carry heavy amounts of fiduciary scrutiny, they're going to be the slowest to move, and as you move down into advisor sold, they'll be the fastest to move. So we're seeing a great amount of velocity down in that bottom part. And I mentioned earlier that the trust company that we'd be working with, this would be one of the places we'd see as a first mover. Of course you'll still need to see how pricing comes through, how operations come through. But I think those things can be done in a shorter period than we did LifePath Paycheck, which took multiple years. This I think can be done faster than that because it can be done largely through allocations to funds inside of target-date funds that are already themselves asset allocation vehicles.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Dan. Morning.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah, good morning.\nSo Martin, several moving parts on the exit fee rate.\nI was hoping you could discuss the outlook for your fee rate based on client demand trends and some of the growth. Also this quarter Vanguard made some.\nSplashy news with cutting of fees.\nCan you talk about the competitive backdrop?\nWithin the ETF market today and how.\nYou may or may not respond to those changes?\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks Dan. On the fee rate, I'd start by saying, you know, we generated 6% annualized base fee growth in the quarter, and organic base fee growth is above target over the last 12 months. This is our third consecutive quarter at or above our through the cycle. Organic base fee target is 6%. So we are continuing a very solid trend of growing revenues, operating income, and expanding margin. As I mentioned in my remarks, on a day count equivalent basis, the annualized effective fee rate was approximately 1/10 of a basis point higher sequentially. That's due to continued growth in fundraising within private markets. We had about $84 million in catch up fees in Q1, which increased $60 million kind of quarter on quarter.\nWe've now seen two successive quarters with sequential fee rate increases, and our fee rate is 5% higher than it was six months ago, and that's even against market and FX headwinds. Later in 2025, we expect to add the fee rate accretive assets of HPS. So I expect you'll see much of the same effect you saw post the GIP transaction, excluding the catch up fees and including the impact of markets and FX towards the second half of the year. You'll note we ended with spot assets lower than average assets. We enter the second quarter with base fees approximately 1% lower other than the first quarter. As I've always said, you know BlackRock's AUM-based fee rate. It's a backward-looking output of the mix of the stock of assets on the platform and the net new flows.\nIt's primarily affected by beta and FX but also by organic growth. As I mentioned, we'd expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue, average fee rates, and organic growth over time as we grow our private markets business. And we see really excellent velocity in private markets fundraising. And again.\nWe expect to add HPS in the latter half of the year just on iShares pricing. Our pricing strategy is the same and hasn't changed. We make targeted price investments in high growth categories where clients are price sensitive and we can expect to.\nEarn back foregone revenue through volumes. Our historical levels of pricing investment have been about 1.5% to 2.5% of global iShares revenue. We've definitely been well below that in recent years. We made no ETF price changes in the first quarter. We've always discussed the ETF business having multiple different segments where clients evaluate price relative to many different objectives and see a different value proposition in superior indexes, or liquidity, capital markets expertise. And again in the first quarter we had $107 billion of ETF flows. That's running. That's following a $390 billion flow year which was a record in 2024. So we're annualizing at a 10% higher rate already on ETFs. So we feel very comfortable with our positioning there.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for our questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?\n\nLarry Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nYes. Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. Our first quarter results are possible thanks to the growth of our strategic investments that we made over the past years powering our integrated asset management and technology platform. We welcome our new colleagues from Preqin this quarter, and we look forward to our planned closing HPS later this year. More than ever, we're closer to our clients than ever before with each and every client and wherever they are located. We believe BlackRock today has a stronger upside for our shareholders than any other time. I want to just thank everybody and have a great second quarter. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."

You too.\n\nJenifer\n\nPlease stand by. We're about to begin. Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Inc. Fourth Quarter 2024 earnings teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink, Chief Financial Officer Martin Small, President Rob Kapito, and General Counsel Christopher Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer period. If you'd like to ask a question during this time, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you'd like to withdraw your question, please press the pound key. Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChris Meade\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. With that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Small\n\nThanks, Chris. Good morning and happy New Year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results.Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. With over $600 billion in net new assets entrusted to BlackRock, 2024 was a milestone year of programmatic, organic, and inorganic actions rooted in client needs, investment capability expansion, technology, and scale.\nWe executed breakthrough investment offerings and industry-leading partnerships. 2024 marked a quantum leap forward for BlackRock against our long-term value creation objectives and an invigoration of the future of asset management and technology services for our clients. We've spoken all year about how organic growth momentum and overall client sentiment has been improving. BlackRock saw record net inflows in 2024, powered by two back-to-back record flows quarters in the second half. Our annual revenue, operating income, and earnings per share each grew double digits.\nWe made disciplined investments for profitable growth, delivering 280 basis points of margin expansion as our AUM grew to a new high of nearly $11.6 trillion. We entered 2025 from a position of strength, having generated 7% annualized organic base fee growth in Q4, our highest in three years. Our record client activity and the accelerating organic revenue growth we saw in 2024, they're independent of the lift that we believe will come from GIP, HPS, and Preqin. Our structural growth businesses, ETFs, Aladdin, outsourcing, fixed income, they're the strong foundations to serve clients and deliver on our through-the-cycle 5% organic growth objectives.\nWe didn't need M&A to achieve and rise above our organic base fee growth target. Our expansions are about more deeply serving clients in high-growth segments that can exceed our 5% goals. We enter 2025 on a new trajectory with record AUM and operating income and having increased our effective fee rate by 7/10 of a basis point. Over the course of 2025, we'll be integrating and adding the high growth and earnings power of GIP, HPS, and Preqin. Clients have embraced our strategy. Our track record of successful acquisitions and integrations is bringing clients into deeper relationships with BlackRock.\nWe finished 2024 with sequential quarters of at or above target organic growth. More importantly, that organic growth is broad-based across institutional, wealth, and technology and across regions. Clients want to consolidate more of their portfolios with a partner that's with them for the long term. They want portfolios that are seamlessly integrated across public and private markets, that are dynamic, and that are underpinned by data, risk management, and technology. BlackRock's now truly in a category of one.\nWe've built a unique asset management and fintech platform that's integrated across public and private markets. With the close of the GIP transaction this past October and our planned acquisition of HPS, BlackRock's private markets and alternatives platform is expected to be $600 billion in client assets, a top five provider, and over $3 billion in revenues, or about 15% of 2024 revenues.\nBlackRock houses whole portfolio solutions for clients, the world's number one ETF franchise by assets, flows, and breadth of exposures, a $3 trillion fixed income platform across active and index, $700 billion managed for insurance companies, over $350 billion in models, direct indexing, and SMAs for wealth managers, over $900 billion in cash management AUM, leading advisory services, and our proven Aladdin technology with $1.6 billion in revenues.Aladdin's powering a whole portfolio ecosystem across public and private markets with eFront and our planned acquisition of Preqin.\nOn a pro forma basis for HPS and Preqin, private markets and technology are expected to make up over 20% of BlackRock's overall revenue. That's an ecosystem we feel wins with client needs and results in over 20% of our revenue base in long-dated, less market-sensitive products and services. Our mix continues to evolve towards higher secular growth areas with clients. We believe this will translate to higher and more durable organic growth, greater resilience through market cycles, and multiple expansion. In 2024, BlackRock generated a record $641 billion of total net inflows and delivered 4% organic base fee growth.\nWe finished the year strong in the fourth quarter with $281 billion of total net inflows and 7% annualized organic base fee growth. Full year revenue of $20.4 billion was up 14% year over year. Operating income of $8.1 billion was up 23%, and earnings per share of $43.61 increased 15%. Fourth quarter revenue of $5.7 billion was 23% higher year over year, driven by the impact of higher markets on average AUM and higher performance fees. Quarterly operating income of $2.3 billion was up 36%, while earnings per share of $11.93 was 23% higher versus a year ago.\nEPS also reflected a lower tax rate, partially offset by lower non-operating income, and a higher share count in the current quarter. The higher share count included 6.9 million shares issued and delivered at the closing of the GIP transaction. Non-operating results for the quarter included $7 million of net investment losses, primarily due to changes in co-investment valuations. Lower interest income in the current quarter reflected the delivery of cash at the closing of the GIP transaction, which was raised through our debt offering in March 2024. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 21% and benefited from discrete items.\nWe currently estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2025. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items, or potential changes in tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $4.4 billion was up 23% year over year and up 10% sequentially, driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM, organic base fee growth, and approximately $230 million of base fees from GIP. Our annualized effective fee rate was approximately 7/10 of a basis point higher compared to the third quarter.\nOver time and with continued growth in infrastructure strategies and the successful closing of the HPS acquisition, we would expect to see positive leverage to base fee revenue, average fee rates, and organic growth as we grow private markets with clients. This is evidenced by this quarter's fee rate increase, primarily reflecting the onboarding of higher fee rate private markets assets following the GIP closing. Fourth quarter and full year performance fees of $451 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, increased from a year ago, led by higher revenue from alternatives. We saw strong broad-based performance across hedge funds.\nQuarterly technology services revenue increased 13% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8%, reflecting the successful onboarding of a number of new clients and expanding relationships with existing clients. Full-year technology services revenue growth also reflects the prior year revenue impact of several clients' renewals of eFront on-premises licenses. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 12% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 13% from a year ago. The need for integrated risk analytics and whole portfolio views across public and private markets is driving strong demand for Aladdin.\nWe signed some of our largest clients ever in 2024. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term. Total expense increased 9% in 2024, primarily due to higher incentive compensation, G&A, and sales asset and account expense. Full-year employee compensation and benefit expense was up 11%, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher performance fees and operating income. Recall that year over year and sequential comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we finalized full year compensation in the fourth quarter.\nFull year G&A expense was up 5%, primarily from planned technology investment spend, higher professional fees, and GIP's G&A expense. During the year, we made disciplined investments in business to drive operating leverage and profitable growth. Our fourth quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.5% increased 390 basis points year over year, and our full year as-adjusted operating margin of 44.5% was up 280 basis points. Looking ahead, we aim to maintain our systematic approach to investing for profitable growth on the budgeting principles we've consistently articulated for the last 12-8 months.\nWe'll continue to be disciplined in prioritizing our hiring and overall investments with the ambition of delivering market-leading organic growth and operating margin. At present, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, we expect our planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS to close in Q1 2025 and in mid-2025, respectively. Based on these closing timelines, we'd expect BlackRock's headcount to be higher in 2025. Our planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS are expected to bring approximately 2,300 new colleagues to BlackRock.\nAdditionally, excluding HPS, we would expect a mid to high single-digit percentage increase in 2025 core G&A expense. Most of the core G&A expense growth should come from consolidating the G&A expense of GIP and Preqin, and continued investment in technology as we look to operate more efficiently and better serve our clients. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first, both organically and inorganically, either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency.\nWe then return cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. After investing for growth, we returned over $4.7 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in 2024. This includes open market repurchases of approximately $375 million and $1.6 billion for fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Share repurchases have been a consistent element of our capital management strategy. In the last 10 years, we've repurchased 28 million shares at an average price of $510 per share. Today, we're trading at almost double that.\nThis represents a more than 15% annualized return for our shareholders. For both the GIP and HPS transactions, BlackRock Equity proved a valuable currency in consummating these transactions and structuring them for alignment with our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market and other conditions, we're targeting the purchase of $1.5 billion of shares during 2025. In addition, and also subject to market and other conditions, we expect to seek board approval later this month for an increase to our Q1 2025 dividend, consistent with our track record of continued dividend growth.\nRecord full year total net inflows of $641 billion were diversified across active, index, and cash, as well as by region, led by $385 billion of net inflows from clients in the United States. BlackRock generated industry-leading ETF net inflows of $390 billion in 2024, representing 11% organic asset and 7% organic base fee growth. Record annual net inflows into our ETFs included $41 billion into our digital assets ETPs that were just launched in 2024. Fourth quarter ETF net inflows of $143 billion reflected significant momentum into year-end, helped by seasonal portfolio reallocations.\nAs US equity indices and spot Bitcoin prices reached new highs in the quarter, clients used iShares products to re-risk and add these investment exposures to their portfolios. BlackRock's institutional platform generated net inflows of $74 billion in 2024, led by active net inflows of $64 billion, including the funding of several large outsourcing mandates from a variety of client types. Index net inflows of $9 billion were driven by $43 billion into fixed income. This was partially offset by $31 billion of net redemptions from low-fee index equity strategies.\nSeveral large clients, mostly outside the United States, rebalanced their portfolios amid record equity market levels. Full year retail net inflows of $24 billion were led by continued strength in Aperio and inflows into active fixed income mutual funds. Aperio had another record year in 2024 with net inflows of $14 billion, and active fixed income added $12 billion of net inflows. Demand for private markets remained strong, with $9 billion of net inflows during the year driven by infrastructure and private credit. BlackRock's full year net inflows also included the impact of successful realizations of $13 billion, primarily from private equity, private credit, and infrastructure strategies.\nDistributions are a key metric for measuring performance in the private markets. GIP has a strong track record of operating portfolio companies and ultimately returning capital to investors through exits with strong uplift. At present, we expect to recognize approximately $5 billion of realizations in Q1 from older GIP fund vintages executing on successful exits. Starting this quarter, we've updated our earnings supplement to provide additional transparency into organic growth drivers and realizations activity for our private markets assets.\nWe expect to make disclosure enhancements, particularly around private markets, beginning in Q1 2025. Finally, BlackRock Cash Management saw $81 billion of net inflows in Q4 and $153 billion in 2024. Flows were driven by both US government and international prime funds and included multiple large new client mandates. We continue to see strong growth in our cash and liquidity platform built on our scale and integrated offerings, with AUM up 20% year-over-year. BlackRock's platform delivered record results in 2024, and the consistency of our results stands out even more over the long term, with over $2 trillion of client net inflows over the last five years.\nWhile 2024 was a watershed year for BlackRock, it's just the start of our next growth story. We're better positioned than ever to build with clients and create value for our shareholders. BlackRock's a meaningful outperformer when assets are in motion and investors are re-risking. We're optimistic about market opportunities for our clients into 2025. I'm going to pass to Larry in a minute, but for those of you keeping score at home, this is Larry's 100th earnings call. We did a little research and counted only 15 current CEOs in the S&P 500 that have celebrated 100 earnings calls as the CEO. Larry, congratulations on a century of earnings calls. How's it feel?\n\nLarry\n\nI can't say I feel any older. I can't complain at all. It's been a fun journey, and I think the journey going forward is going to be better. There's a lot of change in the world in the last 25 years, and there's a lot that stays the same. My meal the night before earnings remains the same, and a bowl of cereal last night with blueberries. Everything is the same. But thank you, Martin. Also, happy New Year to everybody. Thank you for joining the call. Yes, it is our 100th. We haven't done it alone. We have a number of shareholders that have been with us since the IPO 25 years ago.\nI remember that original roadshow when we tried to convince many of our shareholders that remain today about the opportunities to invest in BlackRock. We're also grateful for the analyst community in helping the markets understand our business. I think two of our equity analysts on the line were with us for the IPO. I want to thank Bill Katz and Brian Bedell for your coverage over all these years.\nThe best is still in front of us. When we IPOed, we were a company of 650 employees, and we managed $165 billion in assets. That same year, we began selling our Aladdin technology to our clients for the first time. Today, clients trust us with nearly $11.6 trillion of AUM, and Aladdin has more than 130,000 users. Since our IPO, we've delivered an annualized total return for our shareholders of about 21%, compared to about 8% for the S&P 500. As I said, this is just the beginning. As Martin said, 2024 was a milestone year for BlackRock. Clients entrusted us with a record $641 billion of net inflows, including $281 billion in the fourth quarter.\nWe now have had two consecutive record flow quarters. We entered 2025 at our strongest inflection point. We added $1.5 trillion of AUM, delivered record revenues and record operating income, and increased our effective fee rate by 5%. Historic client activity took place as we executed on the most significant acquisitions we've done since BGI over 15 years ago. It's not uncommon for companies to see clients pausing as they wait out the M&A results, as they determine whether BlackRock is focusing on their needs. At BlackRock, clients are instead embracing and rewarding our strategy.\nClients' activity accelerated into the fourth quarter, resulting in a 7% organic base fee growth and 12% technology services ACV growth. Our operating model delivered exceptional performance in a year of meaningful change. We posted $20 billion of annual revenues, up 14% from 2022. Adjusted operating income grew by 23%. Our operating margin of 44.5% was up 280 basis points. We always raise the bar for ourselves and know our clients and shareholders do the same. Our results consistently beat even our high expectations, and we surpassed street estimates for flows, fee rate, base rate, in addition to total revenues, margins, and EPS.\nOur record organic growth and financial results do not yet reflect the full integration or pending acquisitions of GIP, HPS, and Preqin. All three of these businesses have a track record of delivering strong revenue growth, profitability, and margin expansion. We're steadily making organic investments ahead of the structural trends that we believe will drive outsized growth in the years ahead. We've had strong momentum across our entire franchise, including our newly enhanced private market platform. We positioned ahead of market opportunities that we believe will drive outsized growth for BlackRock in the years to come.\nWe invested in our talent, which is fundamentally the most important thing that we invest in each and every year. Our key driver of BlackRock's success has been our focus on developing leaders with a broad range of experiences and connectivity across all of BlackRock, what I've called horizontal leadership. We look to identify people ready for the next challenge and then move them into roles that both advance their professional journeys and drive our business forward. Today, we are excited to announce that many leaders across the firm are taking on new and expanded roles and responsibilities that will help drive our next phase of growth.\nPart of the leadership changes reflect on Mark Wiedman's desire to pursue his next chapter after nearly 20 years with BlackRock. We've discussed his transition over a number of months, and he will be with us through spring. I want to take a moment to recognize and thank Mark. Mark is a great friend of mine, a great friend of the firm, and has helped drive strong growth for BlackRock, for our clients, and for our shareholders. He's also built a powerful team of leaders prepared to take on new responsibilities and drive our business forward. This includes a number of the senior leaders taking on expanded roles.\nMark will work with our leadership team over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition. We thank him for his many contributions, his partnership, and his vision in shaping the successful evolution of BlackRock. Rob and I are proud of the deep leadership team at BlackRock. It reflects a breadth of experience and sustained excellence. Strategic acquisitions have also historically strengthened our firm, strengthened our culture, and brought top talent, new skills, and experience into our organization.\nOur culture has consistently evolved as we welcome new teams and colleagues to BlackRock. Today, it represents a blending of the best parts of the cultures that have come together across the years, across all the firms that became part of BlackRock. A few months ago, we welcomed the influx of talent with the close of GIP. We've already enjoyed great connectivity, and our teams are energized. BlackRock's world-class leadership alongside the top talent from GIP, from HPS, and Preqin positioned us to serve our clients with excellence and seizing the opportunities ahead for us.\nIn my conversations with clients around the world, they're eager to put capital to work, and they want to do it through BlackRock. Public Markets entered the year from a position of strength. Clients holding cash on the sidelines missed out on a 25% total return in equities last year. We expect 2025 to be a dynamic investing environment. As policies and economic questions play out, the most important factor will be the growth backdrop. Mega forces like AI, ongoing evolution in the debt financing, and the low-carbon transition are transforming economies with their long-term growth trajectories.\nCapital markets will play a key role in this transformation. Private market assets are an increasingly vital part of capital markets, and blending both public and private markets will be critical to fully capturing growth opportunities. Long-held investing principles need to evolve, including the traditional 60/40 portfolio mix as stocks and bonds. The diversifying nature of the stock and bond relationship is under increasingly strong pressure, making resilient portfolio construction more critical than ever. Clients are coming to BlackRock for advice on how to build portfolios, how to broaden out where they invest.\nFor many, they will increasingly include private markets, especially private credit and infrastructure. We also think active strategies can provide an advantage in an environment that requires a more dynamic approach. BlackRock is well-positioned to capitalize on structural growth opportunities against a backdrop of economic and capital market evolution. We've made coordinated investments to build the premier long-term capital partner and technology provider across public and private markets. 2025 is a new launch point for significant growth for BlackRock, our clients, and our shareholders.\nOur recent acquisition of GIP, the planned acquisitions of Preqin and HPS, each position our platform ahead of evolving our client needs and structural industry trends. Fifteen years ago, we acquired BGI, and we're the first scale provider to integrate both active and index investments. In 2024, we made bold moves to connect public and private markets through portfolio management and technology.\nYour reaction to our recent announcement to acquire HPS has been extremely positive, and we see great opportunities to partner more closely with clients and borrowers. The capabilities we're adding through these transactions allow us to serve clients even more comprehensively and position us to raise significant private capital. For our shareholders, we believe the increased contribution from private markets and technology will drive higher and more resilient organic growth, differentiating financial performance and multiple re-rating. In addition to private markets, we are executing on the strongest opportunities that we've seen across multiple growth engines.\nThese include technology, ETFs, multi-asset solutions like outsourcing, and models. We invested for years to develop leading franchises and capabilities that our clients need most, and that are our long-term growth channels. Importantly, they're scaled and integrated onto one platform with a culture that is client-led, not product-led. We're able to serve our clients in a way that no other asset manager can. Aladdin has always been the operating system uniting all of BlackRock. It's grown and evolved as BlackRock has. It's the industry's most comprehensive operating system, supporting scale and commercial priorities for clients.\nWe're growing our capability set in Aladdin, all with the aim of serving our clients through sophisticated risk management, scaled portfolio analytics across both public and private markets, and soon, private market data through Preqin. Q4 ACV growth of 12% reflects several significant mandates with large financial and corporate partners. The Aladdin technology stack is resonating with over half the Aladdin sales involving multiple products. This includes clients using Aladdin whole portfolio view, which grew out of our acquisition of eFront to seamlessly manage portfolios across public and private asset classes on one platform.\nIt includes clients leveraging enterprise Aladdin alongside Aladdin Accounting or the Aladdin Data Cloud. Technology is at the foundation of BlackRock. ETFs are another example. We view ETFs as a technology that facilitates investments. Since our acquisition of iShares, BlackRock has led in expanding the market for ETFs by making them more accessible and by delivering new asset classes like bonds or crypto, and investment strategies like active.\nApproximately 1/4 of our $390 billion of ETF net inflows were into products launched in the last five years. Our active ETFs delivered $22 billion in net inflows in 2024, while our Bitcoin ETP was the largest ETF launched in history, growing to over $50 billion of AUM in less than a year. It was the third highest asset-gathering ETF in the entire ETF industry, behind only the S&P 500 index funds.\n\nChris Meade\n\nWe're innovating at the product and portfolio level and accelerating our distribution capabilities to deliver a differentiated investment solution. In Europe, we scaled our ETF offering significantly, and the market is still much more nascent than it is in the US. We have seen double-digit organic growth in each of the last two years, including over $90 billion in growth in net inflows in 2024. Our European ETF platform is nearing $1 trillion of assets, which is larger than the next five issuers combined. Much of this growth is powered by individual investors as online banking platforms, digital-first offerings, and ETF saving plans are enabling more first-time investors to invest in their savings, to start and begin their retirement savings, and to build a better and more robust future for themselves.\nFrom first-time individual investors to the most sophisticated institutions, ETFs are connecting investors to the growth of the capital markets around the world. Clients' needs are driving industry consolidation, and investors increasingly prefer to work with BlackRock as a scaled multi-asset provider. We see this in the wealth channels, where managed model portfolios are the main way in which wealth managers are looking to scale their practices and better serve their clients. BlackRock has a leading models business backed by our multi-asset, multi-product capabilities across both ETFs and active strategies.\nWe see this in our relationship with the largest asset owners, our pension funds, and corporates, as these clients seek to deepen their ties with BlackRock. Many of these corporate partners see positive network effects to their core business and to their own shareholders by extending their relationship with BlackRock. This year, our clients entrusted us with more than $120 billion of scaled outsourcing mandates. Many of these outsourced portfolios are from pension plans and retirement schemes that we're investing on behalf of millions of workers to help them save for their future.\nOur LifePath Target Date franchise now manages more than a half a trillion dollars of assets, and we're extending our work in this important area to help more and more people save for retirement. In 2024, we launched our LifePath Paycheck offering, which pairs a traditional 401(k) plan with the option to purchase an annuity-based income stream as a worker approaches retirement. The solution is the fastest-growing lifetime income target date strategy in the defined contribution market, with $16 billion invested at year-end. We also adopted LifePath Paycheck as part of our US retirement saving plan for employees here at BlackRock.\nWe think this will become the default defined contribution offering for the entire industry, and we're exploring opportunities to expand LifePath Paycheck to more partners and workers throughout the world. We have built our platform around a core strategy of connecting investors to the long-term growth of the capital markets. In my conversations with clients and government leaders around the world, there's been great focus on the strong capital markets we have in the United States.\nCountries want to further develop their own robust capital markets, and this drives investment in their own local economies, which in turn provides opportunity for job growth, wealth creation for their own citizens. Over the last few years, BlackRock has partnered with governments and sovereign wealth funds to help deepen their local capital markets. We see tremendous opportunities in India, where digital infrastructure efforts are facilitating widespread access to digital payments and financial products.\nOur joint venture, Jio BlackRock, is expected to launch later this year, subject to regulatory approvals. We're combining our investment expertise with a local market knowledge of our partner, Jio Financial Services, to launch digital-first assets with wealth management businesses. In Saudi Arabia, we're launching an investment management platform to partner with a public investment fund to drive investments and future growth in the local economy. We're investing and layering the foundation today for opportunities that we believe will result in significant AUM over the next five to 10 years.\nWe've had great success with our large asset owners in collaborations already, including our joint venture, Decarbonization Partners, with Temasek. Our recent AI partnership with Microsoft and MGX, which aims to mobilize data centers and infrastructure investments. These global partnerships are only available to BlackRock because of the deep relationships we built over many years with local partners, heads of state, and sophisticated asset owners. I have spent a lot of time on the road last year, as has Rob and other members of our leadership team. Rob and I have also traveled to see clients together in recent months.\nWe're spending time with our institutional clients, our wealth clients, and increasingly with our largest asset owners in the world. Clients, corporates, and sovereigns are looking to assemble deeply intertwined partnerships, not just the set-it-and-forget-it investments that yield a good return. BlackRock is in a class of its own in being able to partner with clients comprehensively and in an integrated, scaled way. We can build with clients across their entire portfolio and across the investment life cycle, from ETFs to high-performing active and private markets to technology and data through Aladdin, eFront, and eventually Preqin.\nThe strength of our platform and the commitment of our employees in serving our clients powered record results for our shareholders in 2024. That was before significant growth unlocked from our strategic acquisitions and organic investments in high-growth markets around the world. 2024 was just the beginning. BlackRock enters 2025 with more growth and upside potential than ever. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad.If you do ask a question, please take your phone off its speaker setting and use your handset to avoid any potential feedback. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-enter the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\n\nAlexander Blostein\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning, everybody. Happy New Year. I wanted to start with the discussion on money in motion. That's something we talked about last year as well. As you think about 2025 and take into account maybe the rates move we had recently, to what extent does that change the backdrop you're seeing in the marketplace today? And when it comes to more money in motion, what asset classes do you guys expect to benefit most in 2025? Thanks.\n\nChris Meade\n\nThanks, Alex. Happy New Year. Listen, it all starts with clients. We had back-to-back quarters of above or at-target organic base fee growth, 5% in Q3, now 7% in Q4. It's definitely putting the lift we want in the trailing 12-month trend for our long-term through-the-cycle target. Full-year organic base fee growth was 4%. We're really entering 2025 with continued momentum and a real position of strength. Larry talked a bit about continued ETF exceptionalism, very strong contribution to the 7% organic base fee growth in Q4, rounded out by private markets and alternatives, fixed income, and cash.\nEven in ETFs, like higher fee rate segments, like active ETFs gathered over $20 billion in new assets, digital assets ETFs are driving higher organic base fee growth. We see those trends continuing into 2025. I would note that GIP's organic growth contributed to about one-half of a percentage point to the overall 7% organic base fee growth. So it didn't have an outsized impact on this quarter's above-target outcome. I do think it's a good indication that a growing infrastructure business, a growing private markets business can support, obviously, above-trend, above-target, long-term targets.\nLooking into 2025, we've built the business around structural growers, ETFs, models, Aladdin, fixed income, target date funds. They all drive sustainable organic base fee growth through market cycles. In positive markets, our lived experience has been that these areas capture substantial upside, generate substantial earnings, just like they did here in 2024, where we hit records. Looking into 2025, we continue to see strength in structural growers, a bigger private markets business, and BlackRock as a meaningful outperforming performer in re-risking periods.\nGoing back to previous election cycles, periods of central bank action, Alex, we had outsized upside capture. Look at 2017, 2018, 2021. We were well above 5% in those cycle targets. And I'd offer that I think we're even better diversified now. Even with higher-for-longer rates, we see short-duration active fixed income yield strategies like our active ETF managed by Rick Rieder, BINC is the ticker, and our cash management platform as growth engines. I think that recent macro events are also going to lead to some interesting opportunities in secondaries and private credit in a more supportive market.\nWe've achieved our organic base fee growth target of 5% on average over the last five years. We hit 5% in Q3, 7% in Q4. We did it without the benefit of M&A. We believe that HPS, Preqin, GIP can help lift our business beyond those targets. It gives us a lot of conviction about our 5% or better goal going forward, Alex. We look forward to updating everybody on progress.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nAlex, let me just talk about the rate market. We've been living in a world of an inverted yield curve. You had the ability to earn the highest return keeping your money in cash. Now, you missed out on some great equity market movements. As you notice, the yield curve is steepening. And so over the time, you're going to be benefiting by going up the curve. That being said, there's close to $10 trillion of money in money market funds, and that money will be put to work. As I said, with the steepening of the yield curve and with higher rates, it's going to lead to some great opportunities in the fixed income area.\n\nAlexander Blostein\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\nAs Martin just said, I think more and more income-oriented products like private credit and infrastructure are going to play a larger role with investors over the course of the next 5-10 years. We can't underestimate the role of the capital markets as that is going to be developed more robustly, even in Europe and other parts of the world, where there's going to present even better opportunities. There's no place like the United States, with the US exceptionalism, that you have, if you're a small startup, a medium company, that you have access to so much capital. That is one of the principal drivers of the US economy. I do believe that is hoped to be replicated in other economies right now. That development, having a strong banking system with a strong capital market system, really plays well into our future growth.\n\nJenifer\n\nYour next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nBank of America.\n\nHi, Larry, Martin. Happy New Year, Larry. Hope everyone's doing well. My question's on retirement. BlackRock is the largest DCIO manager and one of the largest managers of AUM, 401(k) plans, and target date funds. Currently, these strategies have a 0% allocation to alts. The red wave in November has many of us debating if alts will break in the retirement channel. Especially given your recent acquisitions of GIP and HPS, I don't know if any firm's better positioned for this theme. We wanted to get your updated prospects on alts finally breaking into the US retirement channel.\n\nChris Meade\n\nThanks, Craig. Happy New Year. I'll give it a go and then see if Larry has anything to add. Listen, we think of ourselves as a retirement company. More than half of the 11.6 trillion of assets that BlackRock manages are related to retirement. We've been at the forefront, I think, of product innovation. We've been at the forefront of advocacy for retirement solutions through our whole history. It was, in fact, Barclays Global Investors that pioneered the first target date fund back in 1993. It was a revolutionary concept, eliminating, I think, some of the guesswork for retirement savers by automatically adjusting their investment mix over time.\nWe now today, as you mentioned, have over a half a trillion of assets in LifePath and target date funds. We're the number one DCIO provider. As Larry went through in detail, we've been innovating the target date structure to include guaranteed income with LifePath Paycheck. We see real potential benefits that retirees could have with greater diversification, better retirement outcomes by blending public and private. I mean, people have won Nobel Prizes talking about the market portfolio. It wasn't just about public markets.\nIt's also about private markets. We've been doing work. We've been doing work. We're always doing work on product innovation. And we've been thinking about how to bring private markets potentially into target date structures. We think the same innovations that powered LifePath Paycheck could ultimately power a target date structure with private markets and alternatives as part of the glide path. We'd also think about things like managed accounts and models, where we've been working on including public-private models, as we announced with the Partners Group model portfolios, which we think can make their way into retirement accounts as well.\nWe do think this is a real opportunity. With our leading presence in these channels, we've got the relationships, the distribution, the investment expertise to capitalize on these opportunities to create better retirement outcomes. We do think we're watching the space closely. For more tangible opportunities, we do think there'll have to be some reforms, potentially safe harbors, litigation, or advice reform in the US to add private markets to DC plans. We're watching the space closely, keeping in touch with the trade associations. We're doing a lot of work in keeping connected with Washington.\nFor years, we've tried to innovate. We've advocated on behalf of workers to improve retirement solutions. We think there's a real opportunity here. And if there is an opportunity to bring private markets to the retirement channel, we'll aim to be at the forefront, Craig.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nCraig, let me add one more point that I think is essential. That is having better analytics and data. That will be fueling, I think, regulatory opportunities to expand offerings in this space. As the retirement system is heavily laden with a lot of regulation. Fiduciary standard is very high. As a result of that, the need for better market analytics and data are essential. This is one of the primary reasons why we sought out and acquired Preqin. Having the analytics that we have with eFront and Aladdin and the data that we will have will allow the entire market to have access to better information.\nWe believe more and more asset managers will then take on Aladdin with Preqin data and eFront to help them navigate this. To me, dovetailing relaxed regulatory oversight can only happen if we have better systematic analytics and data to work with the investors under ERISA laws. I think this is essential. This is one of the key reasons why we made the acquisition of Preqin.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\n\nRachael Smith\n\nHey, good morning. Happy New Year.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nBank of America.\n\nIt's been a little bit over a year.\n\nRachael Smith\n\nGood morning. It's been a little bit over a month since you announced the HPS acquisition. Just curious here, in terms of the conversations you're having with clients, how that dialogue has evolved given the expanded private credit capabilities that you have. I believe insurance and private wealth were some of the areas that you were most excited about. Just curious what steps you might take to best maximize that opportunity here as you're thinking about 2025. What growth might this translate into? And which of the opportunities do you see as more near-term versus more medium to longer term?\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nWell, obviously, we need to close, and we expect to close sometime in Q2. That would be our objective. We're very excited about the client feedback related to HPS. It has been extraordinarily positive across all the channels. HPS has incredible relationships with clients worldwide. That dovetails with our relationships across all the insurance companies. I do believe insurance will be one of the primary areas of growth for us. As we were talking about earlier, if we could really expand in the wealth channels, HPS right now has about $20 billion in wealth channels already.\nWe believe with the BlackRock connectivity with all the wealth management organizations that we have an opportunity to really increase that size by a dramatic amount. Our conversations that we've had globally, worldwide, from Japan to the Middle East, and throughout Europe, probably one of the great surprises to me was the conversations we're having about expanding private credit as a part of these portfolios. As I said earlier, when we did not do the HPS acquisition as a singular expansion, you have to overlay the design around buying Preqin, having eFront, and bringing that together and having the ability to provide better data and analytics to these markets.\nThat will then provide much more expansion of the market. We've seen that over the last 40-odd years we've been in business and throughout my career. When you have better data and analytics as you're expanding new and frontier markets, they become large-scale markets through data and analytics. We believe we will be the best-suited organization to take advantage of that expansion of the private credit markets in the future.\n\nJenifer\n\nYour next question comes from Mike Brown with Wells Fargo.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nCraig, Mike, Happy New Year.\n\nMike Brown\n\nWells Fargo\n\nHappy New Year. I wanted to follow up on the expense guidance for the year. Thank you for the core G&A guide. I guess as we think about the contribution from HPS, assuming that mid-2025 close, how should we think about kind of the guide including that? Then as we think about the margin, I appreciate that markets and effects are really going to impact the outcome. Could you just give us some thoughts on maybe the puts and takes that we should consider for the margin in 2025 relative to 2024?\n\nChris Meade\n\nSure. Thanks for the question. Let me just put some context around it. I think our approach to shareholder value creation is to generate consistently market-leading organic growth. It's to drive operating leverage, and industry-leading margins, and to execute on a consistent capital management strategy. We have a strong track record of investing in our business for growth and scale while expanding capability. It's not just about growth. It's about profitable growth over the long term. Our growth comes from being disciplined in making and managing continued investments in the business.\nWe're keeping the rules-based budgeting principles that I've outlined over the last 12 to 18 months. That's sizing our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. It's aiming to put flexibility in our cost base and variabilizing more expenses where we can. Most importantly, it's looking to generate fixed cost scale, especially through investments in technology. We've got a, I think, consistent track record in delivering industry-leading margins and improving them. I think you see in 2024, those scale indicators came through in the results.\nWe grew operating income by over 20%, generated close to 3 percentage points of margin improvement versus 2023. We improved margin by 390 basis points year on year in Q4 while operating income was up 30%. Since the end of 2022, a more rote metric is BlackRock AUMs up $3 trillion, while headcount's up by a more modest 1,300 employees, about 7% headcount growth. We really see ourselves as continuing on that strategy of driving scale and productivity, which shows up in margin expansion. On the outlook for 2025, the guidance is mid to high single digits, excluding HPS, as I mentioned.\nIn terms of the major influences, we think our budgeting approach in a positive market environment should drop more profitability into operating income. Market movements are our highest margin item, Mike, both on the way up and on the way down. We see the conditions for reasonably positive growth in markets over the near to intermediate term. We believe we can continue to invest to accelerate growth and deliver margin expansion through this rules-based budgeting that I've outlined. And we expect that the impact of positive markets on AUM and revenue through this budgeting approach would drive further margin expansion into 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nBank of America.\n\nHappy New Year, Ken.\n\nKen Worthington\n\nJPMorgan",
    "content2": "Good morning. Happy New Year. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to piggyback a little bit on Alex's question. What are your thoughts on the outlook for fixed income flows as we look out to the next 12 months? I guess maybe starting, where do you see investors positioned in fixed income as we begin 2025? And do you get the sense generally that investors are under or overallocated to fixed income broadly? How do you see those allocations evolving this year? I think you've successfully made the case that the allocations to ALT will be increasing. You've made the case for a while that the allocations to cash are probably too high. How do we think about this flowing into fixed income allocations for the next 12 months?\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nI'll take that one. Last time I mentioned, I thought it would reign fixed income. I'm going to continue that for 2025, but I won't go as far as a Nobel Prize, Martin, in fixed income. A more balanced term structure of interest rates is an indicator that we're going to watch to indicate the potential demand for intermediate and longer duration fixed income. This has been negative for years. Now the US term premium has reached its highest level in a decade. Now we see that people are underallocated to fixed income. We see that through our models business. We see that they're looking to increase their weightings in longer duration fixed income.\nWhether there's a bull market steepener or a bear market steepener, I do believe some of that large allocation to cash that Larry mentioned, being around $10 trillion, is going to look for opportunities to increase their income. With countries around the globe at deficits, there is going to be a lot of issuance. You'll see the premium over Treasuries be significant enough to move that money from cash into intermediate and longer-term duration fixed income. Last year, we saw strong demand. Our fixed income flows were $164 billion in 2024. That's driven 6% organic asset growth. That included $24 billion in the fourth quarter alone.\nOne of the other reasons for this demand is better wrappers to express your interest in fixed income. We saw demand across iShares, non-ETF index, and active fixed income. Active fixed income continued to include scaled institutional assignments as well, not just retail. This came primarily from insurance partners. I think spread income presents a great opportunity, even if duration is not as reliable a diversifier as it used to be. We see a lot of clients that want to clip solid yields at the front end of the curve. Now we expect that to continue into the longer end of the curve. The other part is the run-up in equities last year actually made them overallocated to equities, so they need to catch up in fixed income. I think it continues to roll into cash. Then cash, as rates change, move into intermediate and longer duration fixed income paper.\nThat will not only be in the public markets, but it will be in the private markets as well, which describes part of the acquisition you were asking Larry and Martin about.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDeutsche Bank\n\nNo, thanks. I was just thinking, I certainly couldn't imagine you've become what you've become sitting back in 1999 as a leading fixed-income manager at the time. I always knew the strategy was great. The firm has certainly evolved, I think, well beyond anyone's expectations. Congrats on that journey.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nHave you turned 35 yet?\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDeutsche Bank\n\nYeah, exactly. It's been a long time for sure. Maybe just thinking about this evolution of the strategy in alternatives and particularly the retail end of that. Maybe just talk a little bit about your confidence. Clearly, you have a lot of ways to go into retail on the ALT side. Your confidence on that building up, because it's obviously there's still a lot of roadblocks into growth in those channels. I know you talked about the 401(k) channel earlier. Maybe within that answer, you can comment on your view of the likelihood of safe harbor provisioning in the 401(k) market and the demand from 401(k) plan sponsors to actually adopt ALTs within their portfolios.\nClearly, it would obviously benefit the plan participants substantially. Just, I guess, overall, just your confidence on the retail market for ALTs building even in 2025 and into 2026 for you, inclusive of potentially 401(k).\n\nChris Meade\n\nThanks so much. This is one of the businesses I'm most fond of here at BlackRock. We have strong relationships in wealth and retail markets across the globe. As Larry mentioned in his remarks, our aim is to help wealth managers build long-term portfolios that blend public and private markets exposures. The market's still early, as you said. Wealth manager and retail allocations to private markets still in the low single digits on most of the Cerulli data. We are focused on innovating to provide better access to private markets for wealth managers and retail investors. That's across taxable and non-taxable accounts, retirement accounts.\nLet me tell you about a couple of things we're working on and what I think are some of the bigger opportunities. As we had previously announced, we're working on a first-of-its-kind managed model solution with the Partners Group. We think this will simplify wealth access, offering a single subscription model product with varied allocations based on risk tolerance, but moving the private markets into a model portfolio with different risk tolerances that blends public-private, that manages the cash flows, that's on a single subscription document.\nWe think that's a huge unlock. One of the barriers to adoption with wealth managers is just the operational burden and tax of managing multiple subscription documents, cash flows, and distributions for private markets products. We think a managed account can do that better and increase access. In Europe and Asia, those markets are in a different place in the United States when it comes to private markets in retirement accounts. We recently launched our new evergreen fund offerings under the LTIF 2.0 structure.\nThose initial offerings are in private equity solutions and multi-alternatives. Those evergreen funds, we're planning to also have infrastructure and private credit offerings into the future. We're looking at bringing similar structures in terms of evergreen products for the United States as well. The planned acquisition of HPS is going to bring real scale and expertise in the wealth channel for us, including more than $20 billion of wealth-focused assets in HLEND, one of the high-performing BDCs in the market.\nWe think there's a great opportunity to continue to scale that in the channels where HPS is, but also bring that to the RIA market where BlackRock has a particularly large footprint. We have really excellent momentum in many of the strategies that we have in BDEBT. Our non-traded BDC has about $600-plus million and growing. Our credit interval fund, CREDX, same deal, has had a lot of growing. I do think that the biggest opportunity ahead of us is to integrate semi-liquid products and to integrate private markets into our over $300 billion managed models and SMA franchise.\nThat would be the biggest unlock. And I really do think it's our competitive advantage. It's at the heart of the models venture we have with Partners Group. It's at the heart of many of the previously announced partnerships we have with Envestnet, GeoWealth, iCapital, CAIS, and Vestmark. We think the two best execution channels for us here to help clients are target date funds and retirement accounts, assuming that we can have favorable conditions to do so, and managed models in wealth and retail channels and the LTIF structures in the UK and Europe.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\n\nBill Katz\n\nTD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you very much. Good morning, guys. Thank you very much. Yes, indeed. It goes quick. It goes quick. Remember that IPO conversation. Anyway, thank you for the shout-out. It's been a pleasure. Just maybe either one, gentlemen, just think about the evolution of the platform, then your guidance around buyback. As your earnings power continues to scale and become more diversified and more durable, how are you thinking about maybe the payout relative to the earnings power? Then how about the allocation underneath that between dividend growth and repurchase? Thank you.\n\nChris Meade\n\nThanks a lot, Bill. Our capital allocation strategy is consistent. As I had mentioned earlier, first to invest in the business, that's our main focus, is investing the business to drive organic growth. We preference the dividend. And then the size of our share repurchases, they're an output after those allocations of capital. We don't manage the company to hoard excess cash on BlackRock's balance sheet. We have a very strong track record of returning that excess cash through share repurchases that are systematic.\nI think the size of future repurchases would result from a whole variety of factors: the levels of cash flow generation in organic growth, market beta, and FX, the sizing of organic and inorganic investments, the leverage ratio of the company, the reasonableness of debt financing versus equity financing. All of these things would influence ultimately the sizing of the share repurchase program.\nThe share repurchase is an output, not an input into our capital management strategy. This year, we had $4.7 billion returned to shareholders. We know that BlackRock has become an attractive compounder between dividends and buybacks. We want to keep that track record up for our clients and shareholders.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nYes, I do. Thank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in our firm, BlackRock. Our record results in 2024 are just the beginning of our next phase of growth. We invested ahead of the structural growth trends and drivers that we believe will define the future of the capital markets and asset management. We have a lot of exciting work ahead of us, including the planned addition and integration of Preqin and HPS. We enter 2025 better positioned than ever to deliver differentiated performance to our clients and value creation for our shareholders. Everyone have a really wonderful quarter. Enjoy. Talk to you in next quarter. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Q2 2024 earnings teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence Fink, Chief Financial Officer Martin S. Small, President Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel Christopher J. Meade.

Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher J. Meade\n\nGeneral Counsel, BlackRock\n\nThank you, Operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nThank you, Chris. I'd like to begin by addressing what occurred over the weekend. The assassination attempt on former President Trump is abhorrent. I was very relieved he wasn't seriously injured. I'm thinking about the victims of this shooting, especially the innocent person who was killed. As I wrote to my BlackRock colleagues in the hours immediately following the horrific events Saturday evening, we must condemn political violence of any kind, period. As Americans, we must stand united to do our part to promote civility and unity for our country and provide hope for all Americans. I'll turn it over to Martin now.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Larry, and good morning, everyone. Before I turn it back to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results for the second quarter of 2024. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. The first half and second quarter of 2024 saw some of BlackRock's strongest performance and highest growth rates of the post-pandemic period. We're growing faster than last year. We delivered double-digit operating income growth and expanded our margin by 160 basis points year over year. Clients entrusted us with over $80 billion of net new assets. It was $150 billion of flows excluding episodic client activity. We generated 3% annualized organic base fee growth, our highest second quarter in three years. We ended the second quarter with record AUM of over $10.6 trillion.\nOur business tends to be seasonally stronger in the back half of the year, and we have line of sight into a broad global opportunity set of new asset management and technology mandates that should fuel premium organic growth. We're executing on the strongest opportunities we've ever seen in our core business and building for the future, removing swiftly and aggressively to position our firm to achieve or exceed our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term. At the same time, we're putting the future building blocks of accelerated all-weather organic growth, that's private markets and technology, we're putting them into place with our planned acquisitions of Global Infrastructure Partners and Preqin. We're building our mix towards higher secular growth areas like private markets, technology, whole portfolio mandates, and model portfolios powered by both ETFs and active.\nWe believe this will deliver greater diversification and resilience in revenue and earnings through market cycles. Through strong organic growth and scaling of our private markets and technology platforms, we believe we can drive compelling earnings growth and multiple expansion for our shareholders. We continue to build with our clients. At more than $10.6 trillion in assets under management, $10.6 trillion units of trust, BlackRock's platform is becoming the premier long-term capital partner across public and private markets. We're connecting investors, corporates, and the public sector to the power of the capital markets. Through our iShares and indexing platforms, we've developed long-standing relationships, highly aligned shareholder relationships with global corporates. Through our advisory and technology capabilities, we're a trusted partner to governments and the public sector.\nThese relationships are creating a wealth of opportunities for unique transactions, especially in infrastructure and private markets, and they benefit our clients' portfolios. They fuel organic growth. In Q2, we saw equity markets power to another record high and more clients starting to re-risk. Investors waiting in cash have missed out on significant equity market returns over the last year, and more investors are stepping back into risk assets. BlackRock's a share winner when there's assets in motion. Periods when investors are eager to deploy capital are historically when BlackRock's platform sees its most outsized growth. Clients are coming to BlackRock as a thought leader, as a partner, as they rethink their portfolios and investment technology. We continue to execute on a strong set of large opportunities that are contracted near funding or in late-stage contracting.\nOver the past few months, the slate of client mandates we've been chosen for is the most broad and diversified it's been in years across active equity and fixed income, customized liquidity accounts, private markets, and multi-product Aladdin assignments. BlackRock generated total net inflows of $82 billion in Q2, representing 3% annualized organic asset and 3% annualized organic base fee growth. Flows were impacted by an approximately $20 billion active fixed income redemption from a large insurance client linked to M&A activity. Excluding this single client-specific item and low-fee institutional index equity flows, we saw nearly $150 billion of total net inflows in the quarter. Q2 revenue of $4.8 billion was 8% higher year over year, driven by positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market movements on average AUM over the last 12 months.\nHigher performance fees and technology services revenue also contributed to revenue growth. Operating income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $10.36 were each up 12% year over year. Non-operating results for the quarter included $113 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by non-cash mark-to-market gains on our unhedged seed capital investments and minority investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items, or potential changes in tax legislation. Second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.9 billion was up 7% year over year and reflected positive organic base fee growth and the impact of market appreciation on our average AUM, partially offset by lower securities lending revenue.\nSequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 3%, reflecting higher average AUM and 3% annualized organic base fee growth in the current quarter. Our annualized effective fee rate was flat compared to the first quarter. Ending spot AUM was 2% higher than quarterly average AUM as markets sharply recovered after April declines. Performance fees of $164 million increased 39% from a year ago, driven by both liquid alternatives and long-only products. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 10% compared to a year ago and up 5% sequentially, reflecting successful client go-lives. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 10% year over year, reflecting sustained demand for our full range of Aladdin technology offerings. 80% of new logo sales this year have come from opportunities, including multiple products. We have a strong multi-product pipeline and remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term.\nPreqin is expected to accelerate planned technology services ACV growth within our target range. Total expense increased 5% year over year, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation, G&A, and sales, asset, and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 4% year over year, reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher operating income and performance fees. G&A expense was up 7% year over year, primarily due to the timing of technology spend in the prior year and higher professional services expense. Sales, asset, and account expense increased 4% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher direct fund expense. Direct fund expense increased 4% year over year and 6% sequentially, primarily as a result of higher average ETF AUM.\nOur as-adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 160 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the positive impact of markets on revenue and organic growth this quarter. As markets improve, we expect execution on our financial rubric to drive profitable growth and operating leverage. In line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners, Preqin, and related transaction costs, at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024, and we would also expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains first to invest in our business, to either scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nAt times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. We repurchased $500 million worth of common shares in Q2, which exceeded our planned run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our previous guidance in January. At present, we'd expect our planned acquisition of GIP to close in Q3 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Just a few weeks ago, we announced our planned acquisition of Preqin, marking both an extension of our private markets capabilities and a launching point into the adjacent fast-growing private markets data segment.\nWe expect it will accelerate the growth and revenue contribution of technology services. The bigger longer-term opportunity is leveraging our engines in Aladdin and indexing with our capital markets expertise to build the machine for the indexing of private markets. What the creation of public benchmarks did to drive stock markets, especially visible through iShares, we believe the combination of BlackRock and Preqin can do for private markets. The momentum we spoke to last quarter is visible in our flows, with $82 billion of total net inflows in Q2, which included the previously mentioned large outflow from one client. Excluding that single client outflow, flows were positive across product types, active, and index. BlackRock led the ETF industry in flows for H1 2024 and Q2. Our flows are more diversified by product type, channel, and region than any other issuer.\nSecond quarter BlackRock ETF net inflows of $83 billion were led by fixed income and core equity ETFs, which saw $34 billion, and $32 billion of net inflows, respectively. Precision ETFs added net inflows of $14 billion in the quarter as clients reassessed their tactical portfolio allocations, adding exposures to growth equity. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF continues to lead, gathering another $4 billion in the second quarter for $18 billion of net inflows in its first six months. Retail net inflows of $6 billion reflected continued strength in Aperio, and broad-based net inflows into active fixed income. Aperio recently crossed the $100 billion AUM milestone, logging over 20% organic growth since we acquired the business a little over three years ago.\nAs fee-based fiduciary wealth advisors grow across the world, managed model portfolios are the main way in which wealth managers are looking to scale their practices and better serve their clients. BlackRock has the leading models business, and we grow through distribution of our own models as well as through distribution of third-party models that typically include strong allocations to iShares. Our partnership with Envestnet continues to help Envestnet advisors grow and to drive assets into BlackRock products through models. In the second quarter, we saw our best net sales month on the platform in nearly three years and have generated 20% annualized organic growth in 2024. Last month, Envestnet and BlackRock announced new programs to expand personalized investment strategies on the Envestnet platform across direct indexing, models, and portfolio consulting.\nAlso in June, we announced a partnership with GeoWealth to expand our custom models offerings, which represents the fastest-growing models segment. The custom models offered through GeoWealth's platform will provide advisors with a streamlined and scalable approach that combines public and private markets in one portfolio solution. Institutional active net outflows of $2 billion were impacted by the previously mentioned single client redemption. We saw the funding of several whole portfolio assignments and strengthened private markets as clients seek out and leverage our comprehensive multi-alternatives platform. Institutional index net outflows of $35 billion were concentrated in low-fee index equities. Several large clients, mostly outside the United States, rebalanced their portfolios amid record levels for equity markets. Private markets generated net inflows of $2 billion. Continued demand for our infrastructure and private equity solutions were partially offset by successful realizations of about $4 billion, primarily from private equity strategies.\nFinally, cash management net inflows of $30 billion were driven by government and international prime funds. Flows benefited in part from clients reinvesting in cash strategies in early April after redeeming balances during the last week of March. Net inflows included multiple large new client mandates as connectivity between our cash and capital markets teams allows us to deliver clients' holistic advice and market insight. Our scale and active approach for clients around their liquidity management are driving sustained growth in our cash platform. BlackRock's strategy and platform evolution, they're rooted in our convictions about future client needs, about required investment capabilities, about technology, about scale generation. Teams across BlackRock are connected and delivering on significant client opportunities, driving product innovation and operating more nimbly and efficiently. Momentum continues to build across our platform.\nWe're better positioned than ever to grow our share with clients and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nThank you, Martin. BlackRock's core business growth is the strongest we've seen in nearly three years, with a significant upward shift ever since our last earnings call in April. Q2 core net inflows were approximately $150 billion, excluding lower-fee episodic M&A and institutional index activities. Our structural growers, areas like ETFs, models, Aladdin, and private markets, are powering steadily higher organic base fee growth. Organic base fee growth represented the best Q2 since 2021. 2024 has been our ETF's strongest start in a year on record with $150 billion of net inflows. iShares' June flows were the strongest month in our history and for any other issuer.\nWe are executing on landmark mandates across our platform and on closing our planned acquisitions of GIP and Preqin. Client and stakeholder feedback on both GIP and Preqin has been increasingly enthusiastic. We are on a differentiated path to transform our capabilities and infrastructure and to meet the growing need for private market technology, data, and benchmarking. We believe this will deepen our relationships with our clients and deliver value to you, our shareholders. Our growth in private markets provides a whole new engine for premium, diversified organic growth and less beta-sensitive revenues, both of which should drive future earnings and multiple expansion. We have strong conviction we are on pace to reach our 5% organic base fee growth target.\nAnd the expected Q3 closing on GIP will add on to our organic base fee growth potential, doubling our private markets base fees and adding approximately $100 billion of AUM focused on infrastructure. At BlackRock, we always intensely push ourselves to anticipate where markets are going, what clients will need, and how we can deliver better outcomes in better ways to each and every client. We set the standard for buy-side risk management technology by launching Aladdin on the desktops of investors over 20 years ago. We acquired BGI and iShares to redefine whole portfolio investing by blending both active and indexing to build better outcome-oriented portfolios. iShares' AUM was about $300 billion when we announced our acquisition in 2009. Today, iShares is approaching $4 trillion of client money.\nWe recently celebrated the five-year anniversary of the eFront acquisition, where ACV has now more than doubled since becoming part of BlackRock. We have never been shy about taking big, bold, strategic moves to transform ourselves and, most importantly, to transform our industry. Our successful business transformations are delivering our strong performance today and opening up meaningful new growth markets for our clients and for our shareholders. We continue on our mission to transform private markets. BlackRock is unique in delivering an integrated approach to help our clients across all aspects of private market investing, enabling a seamless view into investment management, into technology and data onto one single platform. With a strong common culture of serving clients with excellence, together with GIP, we will deliver for our clients a holistic global infrastructure manager across equities, debt, and solutions.\nWe'll provide the full range of infrastructure sector exposures, and we'll offer our unique origination across developed and emerging world markets. Our recently announced agreement to acquire Preqin is another step in the transformation of our private markets and technology platform. As private markets grow, data and analytics will become increasingly more important. We believe our planned acquisition of Preqin will help to complete the whole portfolio by delivering high-quality data integrated with workflows. Ultimately, this should drive increased accessibility and efficiencies in private markets. And the combination of Preqin with Aladdin and eFront presents an opportunity to find a common language for private markets, powering the next generation of whole portfolios. We envision we could bring the principles of indexing to the private markets through standardization of data, through benchmarking, and through better performance tools.\nBlackRock has developed a broad network of global corporate relationships through our many years of long-term investments in both their debt and equity. For companies where we're investors, they appreciate that we are long-term, consistent, always their capital. We're not transactional. We invest early, and we stay invested through cycles. Whether it's debt or equities, pre-IPO, post-IPOs, companies recognize the uniqueness of our global relationship, our brand, and our expertise across markets and industries. This makes us a valuable partner, and in turn unlocks the opportunity and performance we can provide for clients. Unique deal flow and track record of successful exits create a flywheel effect, enabling future fundraising and more scaled funds. Corporates and clients increasingly want to work with BlackRock, and we are executing on the best opportunity sets we've seen in years across iShares, private markets, whole portfolio solutions, and Aladdin.\nImportantly, our business has great breadth with organic growth diversified across our platform. In H1 2024, flows were positive and active in index and across all asset classes. Our active platform, including alternatives, contributed $11 billion. ETF remains a secular growth driver, crossing $150 billion of net inflows and already representing more than 70% of our total flows of last year. Our technology services revenue grew double-digit in H1 2024. Importantly, we have notified fundings for a number of scaled institutional wealth management that we expect to fund over the coming quarters. For example, in Q2, we were selected to manage a $10 billion US corporate plan, a multi-billion fixed-income portfolio for a large defined benefit scheme, and scientific active equity strategies for several global financial clients.\nThese add to the global mandates which we've seen that we've been chosen over the last six months, including a large US RIA, a UK pension fund, and a European captive asset management, are just a few examples. As we look to onboard these mandates and more in future quarters and delivering the outcomes of our clients and their constituents and what they need, growing business momentum across our scaled asset management and technology platform is driving strong financial results. BlackRock's operating income was up 12% year over year for 160 basis points of margin expansion. Earnings per share was up 12%, and we remain committed to delivering differentiated organic growth at a premium margin to our investors. We continue to generate leading organic growth, and our operating margin of 44.1 is over 10 points above the traditional peer average.\nPrincipally safe 5% yields in cash have kept many investors overweight in cash, and nearly $9 trillion still sits in money market funds. Those waiting in cash would have missed out on the broad stock market returns of over 26% over the last year, including 17% so far in 2024. Long-term outcomes and future liability matching need more than a 5% return. Investors will have to re-risk, which should improve flows into equities and credit markets. BlackRock is always a sure winner when assets are in motion and a meaningful outperformer in periods of investors re-risking. BlackRock operates from a position of strength. We have a clear path to our 5% organic base fee growth target, and we're transforming ourselves to build a firm that can exceed that target.\nClients increasingly see the value in the BlackRock model, a single unified platform designed for clients, unmatched in breadth, powered by BlackRock, and totally built on trust. It goes beyond clients simply wanting to do more with BlackRock. They're looking for a partner that innovates and helps them grow. The world's largest asset owners want deep strategic partnerships, increased customization, and innovation approaching that what might include creative co-investment opportunities, and co-development of strategies. BlackRock's Decarbonization Partners, joint venture with Temasek, is one example of this type of relationship. In Q2, we announced that its inaugural fund had a final close above its fundraising target, raising $1.4 billion. The first-time fund attracted over 30 institutional clients representing 18 countries. The diversity and depth of the investor base is a testament to our long-standing client relationships and the strength of our team.\nInsurers represent some of our most long-standing relationships and clients, and we're leveraging our insurance expertise and diversified global platform to deliver fixed income technology and increasingly private market solutions. BlackRock manages nearly $700 billion in long-term AUM for insurance clients, and we are an industry leader in managing core fixed income for insurance companies' general accounts. Insurance CIOs are expanding their mandate with BlackRock to include private markets and structured assets. Just a few weeks ago, we awarded our first large-scale general account allocation for a private structured credit mandate. We also had success with insurers and dedicated SMAs for infrastructure debt, where we have differentiated capabilities. We have deep, long-standing relationships across our insurance client channel with a dedicated insurance portfolio management team.\nWe see significant opportunities to work more closely with our insurance clients and to leverage our GA business as a potential durable source of long-term capital for our private debt franchises. The industrial logic that informed our planned acquisition of GIP has only become even clearer in the last six months. There's a generational demand for capital and infrastructure, including the financing of data centers for AI and for energy transition. Private capital will be critical in meeting these infrastructure needs, both standalone and through public-private partnerships. Clients' reception to GIP has been overwhelmingly positive, with strong reverse inquiry from clients excited to partner with a newly scaled infrastructure platform. We see particularly strong demand for opportunities in the AI data centers and energy transition spaces. Through BlackRock's relationships with corporates and sovereigns, BlackRock is at the center of the investment opportunity being shaped by the demand for generative AI.\nAI cannot truly happen without investments in infrastructure. These technologies require a new generation of upgrade data centers, which will need enormous amounts of energy to power them. With the AI-fueled need to build data centers, we see great potential to monetize the 4.3GW of power production capacity of generational assets currently owned by BlackRock's infrastructure funds. When we talk to leaders in industry and governments, they express their desire to build out data centers, AI technology, at the same time to decarbonize. Our diversified infrastructure fund recently invested in Mainova WebHouse, a first-of-its-kind partnership to invest in a hyperscale data center platform in Frankfurt, run entirely on renewable energy. Our planned acquisition of GIP will add a number of global data centers assets in our portfolio.\nWe plan to be a leader in the space, leveraging our expertise to drive capital formation, and unique deal flow to generate return for our clients. For decades now, BlackRock has helped investors benefit from the growth of the capital markets, supporting their path to financial security and long-term objectives like retirement. Early in the second quarter, we successfully launched LifePath Paycheck with a subset of committed clients. We expect additional commitment plan sponsors to fund over future quarters, and we have a very strong late-stage pipeline. More than 1/2 of the assets we manage are related to retirement. Our growth investments to enhance our capabilities, and strategies like active target date, and infrastructure underpin our commitment to improving retirement outcomes. BlackRock continues to create more access and connections between long-term investors and capital markets, both in the United States, and throughout the world.\nEarly this quarter, we announced an agreement with the Public Investment Fund, the PIF, to launch an investment management platform in Riyadh, which aims to accelerate the development of our local capital markets and enable foreign investments into the region. We expanded our Jio BlackRock joint venture in India beyond asset management to brokerage and wealth management. And just last month, we joined a new coalition to mobilize infrastructure investments in the Indo-Pacific region alongside GIP and other global investors. In the US, we announced a new opportunity for BlackRock to help expand domestic capital markets by investing in the creation of the Texas Stock Exchange. The exchange aims to facilitate greater access and increase liquidity in US equity capital markets for investors. Our investment builds on a history of investing in similar market structure opportunities for the benefit of BlackRock clients.\nETFs will continue to grow as a technology that provides simple, efficient access to capital markets, making investments easier for clients of all sizes. Our investments over time are driving accelerated momentum across our ETF platform. Q2 ETF flows of $83 billion were positive across our core equity, strategic, and precision categories. ETF flows of $150 billion in H1 2024 represents a best start to the year in iShares history and are more than double what they were in H1 2023. BlackRock leads the ETF industry in flows, and we are also facilitating market expansion. Our Bitcoin ETF reached nearly $20 billion in its first six months and is the third highest grossing exchange-traded product in the industry this year.\nThree of the five top asset-gathering bond ETFs are iShares, and our active ETFs are growing contributors with $12 billion in net inflows in 2024. We remain focused on innovating our product offerings, particularly with active ETFs, growing bond ETFs, with extending distribution partnerships to make iShares a provider of choice across all wealth platforms. In June, we expanded access to our alpha-seeking expertise through the launch of active US equities and high-yield ETFs managed by some of our leading investors. We're partnering with a number of international banks and brokerage platforms to expand distribution and access to our products. Examples include our relationship with ETF savings plan providers and our recent selection as a premier partner to invest in. For winning our first client to serving millions of investors today, Aladdin has been the technological foundation for how we deliver our clients across our platform.\nAladdin isn't just the key technology that powers BlackRock. It also powers many of our clients. We see clients increasingly using the technology investments across the fintech and data ecosystems. We're partnering with clients who are increasingly looking for comprehensive technology solutions across their entire portfolio, from risk analytics, investment management, and to accounting capabilities. The need for integrated investment and risk technology, as well as whole portfolio views across public and private markets, is driving durable ACV growth. Years ago, we anticipated that clients would benefit when alternative investments were evaluated inside a portfolio-level risk management framework. As allocation to private markets increased, we knew the ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform would be critical.\nBlackRock invested ahead of these clients' needs, acquired eFront in 2019, and going on to integrate it with Aladdin to deliver a whole portfolio view. Our planned acquisition of Preqin will expand our capabilities beyond private markets, investment management, and technology to data. We see a significant runway ahead as private market allocations from our clients will continue to grow alongside their need for an integrated enterprise-level investment technology, data, and analytics. Much of BlackRock's success and our momentum today has come from anticipating and making calls on what our clients will need as they pursue long-term outcomes like retirement and financial security. We constantly innovate, we constantly evolve, we transform ourselves, and we make sure we deliver for each and every one of our clients. We have spent decades building our global network of relationships, of data and analytics, integrating technology.\nAnd these are the key differentiations to deepening our relationship with clients and accessing unique investment opportunities and partnerships. With our planned acquisition of GIP, Preqin, and core business strength, BlackRock's capability has never been stronger. We have the most comprehensive platform in the asset management industry, integrating across public markets, private markets, and our Aladdin technology. And we are creating a differentiating private markets approach. We're building what our clients need for success: a skilled private market platform encompassing investment, workflow through eFront, and data and risk analytics through Preqin. By bringing together investments, tech, data across public and private markets, we have the opportunity to drive better portfolio outcomes for investors and open up a diversified, higher multiple earnings stream for our shareholders. We look forward to delivering strong performance for our clients along differentiated growth, which will be an opportunity for you, our shareholders.\nOperator, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you do ask a question, please take your phone off its speaker setting and use your handset to avoid any potential feedback. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-enter the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Alex.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning, Larry. Hello, everybody. So lots of optimism on the firm's trajectory for organic growth. And I heard you guys obviously echoing maybe some of the comments from last quarter around strong pipeline and Martin's comments around premium organic growth. So maybe help contextualize this a little bit more.\nWhat do the pipelines look like today? What kind of the timing of some of these conversions that you anticipate? What asset classes? And ultimately, what that means for the firm's organic base fee growth for the back half of 2024? Thanks.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Alex. I'll start, and I think Larry will add some color. But Q2 organic base fee growth, as I mentioned, was 3%. We had that typically seasonally slow start of the year in Q1. So 3%, it's just about at our target for where we thought we'd be in May and June. We really see excellent momentum, and I think you got that in Larry's comments. But I'd say on the measures we look at for fee growth velocity, sort of last three months, last six months, last 12 months, organic base fee growth, Alex, keeps grinding up by a percentage point.\nIt's 1% to 2%, and now 3%. We really feel that markets are on this precipice of a reset. Rate cuts should normalize bond markets. They should normalize fixed income allocations. They should fuel equities. They should really drive flows. We've been a really meaningful outperformer in these risking periods. If I look at sort of previous election cycles, rate reductions, BlackRock had huge upside capture in 2017, 2018, 2021. We were well above our through-the-cycle targets for organic growth in those periods. When we look at growth, it's going to come from these strong structural growers. Those things grow even faster in supportive markets. ETFs, models, Aladdin, our expanding private markets business. We're closing in and growing our EUM by over $100 billion in private markets with our planned GIP acquisition. We see that as a huge growth opportunity.\nSo we'd expect those engines to really capture additional growth that hits our targets. Even on the most modest growth assumptions, I think for beta and markets to really drive significant differentiated durable earnings and multiple expansion. We look at this all the time as a team. We've achieved our premium organic base fee growth target of 5% on average over the last five years. BlackRock has a lot of positive leverage to risking periods in the market. That gives us a great deal of conviction about the path to 5% in the back half of 2024. Also our longer-term ambition, I think, to be at 5% or better as we grow private markets and technology. Alex, let me just add a little more holistic texture. We have never had more dynamic conversations than we've ever had now across the world, across products.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nI truly believe our positioning in iShares today has never been more robust. Our delivery now of active ETFs, our innovation in crypto, having more precision-type products when there's, I would say, more fragmentation going on in the world allows us to have more conversations with differentiated products for our clients. But the feedback now, over six months of feedback of our planned acquisition of GIP and the conversations we're having with some of the most sophisticated investors worldwide has never been more robust about how we could partner, how we could be trying to develop more things. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the confluence of power and AI and data centers.\nAnd I believe this is going to be one of the world's biggest growth engines as we start trying to develop AI for everyone, AI, not just for the big powerful organizations, but AI utilization for everybody, for every country in the world. It is going to require just, we're talking trillions of dollars of investments. Our conversations with the hyperscalers, our conversations with governments, our conversations with the chiller suppliers, the cogeneration suppliers, the opportunities we have in infrastructure is way beyond I've ever imagined even just seven months ago when we were contemplating the transaction and formalizing it. Our conversations with investors from the most sophisticated sovereign wealth funds to our conversations with the RIA channels, the need for data and analytics across the private sector is only going to be growing.\nNo firm right now has the position that we have with Aladdin, eFront, and now with Preqin that we could assist more and more investors. So we're taking a differentiated approach that obviously we've done that in the past. I would just like to just say that, and I said in my prepared remarks, we do these things pretty boldly. When we bought eFront, everybody thought that was a big price, and yet we've doubled ACV. Martin talked about a period where we crossed over $100 billion in AUM. I do believe we've talked about AI at BlackRock AI for investments. One of the big opportunities I see is going to be in systematic equities where we've had now a 10-year track record of approximately 90% outperformance. I do believe that we saw now close to about $5 billion of flows.\nI believe this is only going to be accelerating now as more and more investors are looking at how can you use AI for investments. We have one of the finest platforms utilizing AI, utilizing big data. So I'm very excited about the high growth potential we have in more and more high-fee products. But I'm just as excited about how we can provide better products across the board utilizing our ETF platform.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Craig.\n\nCraig Seigenthaler\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, Larry. So our question is on the outlook for technology services revenue growth. With tech ACV growth at 10%, which is the low end of your long-term target range, we want to see if you have visibility into the future trajectory given the timing of larger contract wins within your existing pipeline and conversations with clients.\nAnd now that you have Preqin, how will that also impact the 10% to 15% target in 2025 after the deal closes?\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Craig. I'll start, and I know Larry will add. Technology, it's just the main engine for investment performance, right? It's the main engine to drive operating leverage. It's what great firms, I think, are using to have great client experiences and fuel growth. We see a very consistent growth rate in how clients are investing in more technology. I can tell you as a CFO, if I could invest in tech spend, I would. Generally, in the marketplace, there's just an acceleration in tech spend across the board. But I think importantly, clients are trying to retire this kind of spaghetti patchwork of legacy systems they have. They want to leverage fewer providers. They want to do deep integrations across the fintech and data ecosystems.\nThey want to have a whole portfolio view across public and private markets. That's always been the thesis of the Aladdin platform. It's how we use it at BlackRock and with our external clients. It was what drove the integration of eFront and Aladdin. And now with Aladdin, eFront, and Preqin, we think we have even more opportunities to benefit new clients, and the pipeline is very strong. Tech services revenue was up 10% year on year, 5% sequentially. As we continue to get the big assignments and new sales from the prior years going live, we expect those revenue numbers to stay strong. Our ACV target, Craig, it's over the long term. We've achieved it on average since we first started disclosing ACV in 2020.\nWe think we have a real opportunity to apply and drive indexing principles using Preqin, Aladdin, and eFront together across tech, data, and investments. Preqin is expected to accelerate our planned technology services ACV within our target range. It's going to increase current ACV dollars by about 15%. So we'll continue to target low to mid-teens growth in tech services ACV. We'd expect bringing together Aladdin, eFront, and Preqin to be the way that we can get there over the next few years.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nCraig, but our line of sight, we are in conversations right now with probably the broadest, largest potential Aladdin assignments we've ever had. So the conversations we're having are broader, deeper conversations than we've ever had. And much of it has to do.\nThe serious big giant conversation we're having right now are based on the ability that Aladdin can provide both public and private data analytics. And two, we deliver. There are many examples where people have made big, broad promises, and they were years, I want to underline, years delayed in the implementation. We have a deep history of delivering on time. That doesn't mean it doesn't take a long time to do it, but we have a huge reputation because of our expertise in delivering the technology platform on time. These are very big and complex, and we do it very well. And now with a combination of Preqin alongside eFront and Aladdin, we have probably the biggest opportunity we've had in 10 years or more in delivering even a more differentiated technology and analytical platform.\nAnd by doing so, it could really then expand our entire platform in terms of benchmarking and indexing. As you know, that's been a province of other organizations historically, asset managers who were precluded by the SEC to be into this business. This is why we were never in this business. Asset management firms can now be in it, as you know, and we create some type of customized index. But we look at this as a unique opportunity now for BlackRock with our position, with our role. We are going to do this with the same, I would say, industrial fortitude as we did in the early years when we were just an asset manager needing risk analytics. So we did it ourselves. And then we are so proud of what we did ourselves. We offered it in the '90s to our clients.\nWe are going to do this in the private markets. And we're going to. This is going to take time. But I think we have a real ability to provide a very differentiated platform in this. And this is something of sheer excitement. And if we succeed, this will add a whole new revenue line on BlackRock's revenue side. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning, Larry.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nHi, Mike.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nJust a question. Hey, just a question on the alts business and GIP with the deal expected to close in Q3. Can you just talk about your expectations for flows there in the infrastructure space? What strategies are you in the market raising or could be in the market raising over the next 12 months?\nAnd maybe talk about some of the steps that you may be able to take to bring some new products to the marketplace, including extending into the private wealth channel.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGreat question. Thank you. Well, obviously, we are doing whatever we legally can in terms of making sure that there are two operating entities until we get legal approvals and we close. But that being said, BlackRock is having incredible conversations. GIP is having incredible conversations. We have business integration meetings, which we're allowed to do. And the enthusiasm between our team and their teams are way beyond our imagination. This feels so fantastic right now between our organizations and the opportunity we have. As we said, we expect this to be announced in Q3.\nHopefully, later in Q3, we have other announcements of things that we could be talking about. But I'm not really permitted to talk about what are the deals, what are the things you're doing. What I need to be just showing you is our incredible enthusiasm that what we have and the opportunities we have. And I do believe we will have post-closing some amazing opportunities and then therefore some amazing announcements.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\n\nBill Katz\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you for taking the question. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for your opening comments. Just coming back to the opportunity for Preqin and you sort of think through the evolution of the private markets. How do you sort of see the product evolution? And is there a pathway here for ETFs given the underlying liquid nature of the investments? Thank you.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock",
    "content2": "Thanks, Bill.\nSo we're extremely excited about this Preqin transaction. We think it really unlocks a whole new segment of growth for our clients. And we think it unlocks a whole new data services segment for BlackRock. And we see really the opportunity to grow Preqin by connecting it with our complementary Aladdin and eFront capabilities, as well as obviously we have a lot of client relationships and significant distribution reach. We'll continue to offer Preqin Pro and the data products as standalones. I think there's really three things that we're focused on here in driving a successful Preqin transaction. The first is simply driving more sales, building out comprehensive fund deal-level databases, and really integrating data and workflow into a unified platform that better serves clients. The second is by innovating and launching new data products. I think it's fairly remarkable when you think about the public markets.\nYou think about this symbiotic relationship that risk models, indexes, and data have done to create public market indexing, benchmarking, asset allocation. All of those opportunities are ahead of us in the private markets by bringing together risk models, benchmarks, and investable indices. We think this opportunity to index the private markets is really one of the most attractive that we've had in the history of BlackRock. And last, we have the ability to drive a lot of scale. We have data factories. Preqin has data factories. It's not the primary rationale for the transaction, but we really think that we can drive profitable growth, increase scale, and efficiency by making this a seamless operating organization. We've had a really good reaction to the transaction from GPs, from LPs, from service providers, all of which who are strong, enthusiastic Preqin clients.\nThey're excited about the opportunity to bring together the eFront and Preqin data sets. And so we think there's a lot of great opportunities here to continue to grow. And we're looking forward to closing the Preqin transaction before the end of the year.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nI would just add one more point to that. The inquiries that we've had from big vendors, from exchanges, from different organizations about how can we take what Aladdin, Preqin, and eFront has? How can we make that? How are we going to be able to distribute that and utilize that? It is a great sign that the ecosystem sees the opportunity that we have. And I think it was very clear that because we have eFront and Aladdin, we were just in a very unique position to take this and add it to it.\nAnd I think this is one of the real strengths of BlackRock. And now we got to, obviously, we got to close it, and we got to execute upon it. But as I said earlier, this is something that we can really be transformational and really change the whole foundation of public and private markets. And if we do what we did for public markets with Aladdin and data, what we did for public markets with ETFs and iShares, if we do that and transform more and more private products into more retail products using our data and analytics, it will transform the capital markets. And that's something that BlackRock has been proud of, how we've moved the capital markets. And this is just another step for us, how we could be additive to the global capital markets.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Dan.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Good morning. Wanted to follow up. You talked a lot about a lot of momentum across the business. Fixed income has been a topic for some time. Flows have been a bit more mixed here year to date. I guess in the conversations you're having, do you still see that as one of the big areas of incremental growth as the interest rate environment evolves?\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nWell, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, sitting in 5% yield makes a lot of sense unless you put in the, if your liabilities are long-dated, you lost money, actually, because with equity markets up 24 and 17 this year alone. But that being said, we are beginning to see other clients starting to re-risk. They're re-risking other. Let's be clear. If you look at iShares fixed income flows, the market was basically flat.\nIf you look at the so all the AUM growth in iShares fixed income was really re-risking. I think this is a good statement saying one, we're going to see more and more ownership in fixed income through ETFs. That's the evolution that's going on. Obviously, you're seeing growth in private markets and private credit that continues on. We are wildly bullish as more and more clients are going to be using infrastructure debt. So I think you're going to start seeing, as all this plays out, like we've seen in equities, we used to talk about equities more of a barbelling effect. I think we're starting to see that here in the bond market where more and more people are in their core fixed income portfolios. They may continue to just use ETFs as a foundation.\nOur growth in bond ETFs this year in a flat market is a great example that more and more people are getting fixed income exposure as a core element. They're using ETFs more and more. And if they're starting to try to get more beta, excuse me, more alpha in their fixed income side, excuse me, they're going to do it in, they're going to do that in more of the illiquid space of private credit. They're going to do that in mortgage-backed securities. And they're going to do that in, they're going to do that in infrastructure debt. So I believe we're very well positioned for that moment when people are recalibrating out of cash. And it's going to be heavily into fixed income bond funds. And it's going to be in also more of the alternative ETF, alternative income-oriented products.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Ken.\n\nKen Worthington\n\nStock Analyst, JP Morgan\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Cash management had a strong quarter. To what extent are you seeing or still seeing different and additional institutional clients migrating out of banks to money market funds to get higher yield? And where would you say the global markets are in terms of this transition to higher yielding forms of cash management? And then to the last question, you called out re-risking a couple of times. Are you seeing re-risking coming out of cash, or is re-risking really a migration within other asset classes, either extending duration or going out the risk curve in equities? What are you sort of seeing in terms of that re-risking?\n\nMartin S. Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Ken. It's Martin. So cash flows, $30 billion, as I mentioned, largely driven by government and international prime funds.\nWe had that dynamic at the end of March and the Good Friday dynamic where clients had come out. Then we saw a significant kind of return and an increase in balances in early April. We had multiple large new client mandates. I flagged that the cash platform today is about $780 billion. It's grown more than 50% over the last five years. And investors, they are earning a real return in cash. We expected investors will re-risk. But I'd say a couple of dynamics we've definitely seen in the platform. Post-Silicon Valley Bank, we saw through sort of cash matrix. We saw in our institutional business, I think clients just being more mindful, tactical, and kind of operationally flexible in how they manage cash.\nWe think that largely for an institutional manager like BlackRock, that's been a good trend of being able to put together technology and customized liquidity accounts in a way that we can grow. And then ultimately, we have seen this business grow. But I'd also flag that bond ETFs have been a real surrogate, I think, for kind of how clients are managing cash. And as Larry mentioned, over the last year, we've seen $100 billion basically of organic growth in bond ETFs, which I think have been used as cash or cash proxies along the way as clients manage their liquidity dynamically across money funds, separate accounts, and untraded instruments like ETFs. But let me add a little more towards the asset allocation into more re-risking. I think it's a mixed bag, Ken, as we said in our prepared remarks.\n\nLaurence Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nWe're seeing a lot of pension funds who are saying, \"I'm at my liability. My assets reached my liability level. I don't need to own as much equities.\" That's going to be persistent if we continue to have rising equity markets. And on top of that, with rates staying higher longer, that gave those pension funds the liability rate that's set. But obviously, if interest rates go back down, the liabilities will grow a little bit. And so we're seeing some clients actually de-risking because they can't. But where are they de-risking? A lot of clients are not just de-risking going from out of equities into cash. They're going from equities into other fixed income instruments. This is where I believe you're going to see more and more investments into infrastructure where you have less volatility in the investments, higher probable returns, high fixed coupon.\nSo we're seeing clients around the world recalibrate their risk. There are some clients who are sitting way excess too much cash, and they're obviously paying for that. And we'll see how they re-risk. But overall, I think probably if I had to say the headline for the first six months, the clients that are overweighted in illiquid strategies like private equity where they had liquidity issues, you saw them keeping more cash balances. If and when the private equity markets unlock itself and there's a little more distribution, maybe you could see some of that cash going out and re-risking. So you're seeing a whole mixed bag. But I do believe the macro trend towards more bond allocation because of the extensive equity rally over the last 10 years, deeper allocation towards privates, especially private credit and infrastructure, is going to continue.\nI do believe the tools of using ETFs as a core component of portfolios is going to become a larger and larger component of how investors invest. They're going to use more core fixed income ETFs, more equity ETFs, and then barbell against using more, I would say, more diversified, maybe more illiquid strategies across the board. I do believe BlackRock is as well positioned for that as any firm in the world.\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?\nI do, operator. Thank you. And thank you for all joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our Q2 results are possible because of our deep partnerships with our clients around the world and our one BlackRock approach in everything we do.\nWe are well positioned to execute on our landmark mandates across our platform, and we're closing in on our planned acquisitions of GIP and Preqin. We see unbelievable growth opportunities for our clients and our shareholders for the rest of 2024 and beyond. Everyone, please stay safe, stay cool. Have a lovely summer as best you can. Enjoy our political conversations over the next few weeks. Be active and have a great quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to Welcome everyone to the BlackRock Inc. Q1 2024 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small, President, Rob Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question and answer period.

Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher J. Meade\n\nGeneral Counsel and Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the Q1 of 2024. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. BlackRock's Q1 results reflect sustained momentum across our entire platform. We ended the quarter with record AUM of nearly $10.5 trillion and one of the strongest opportunity sets ahead across multiple growth engines, including technology, outsource solutions, and private markets. Momentum's accelerating, and we have line of sight into a breadth of significant mandates in investment management and technology, spanning client channels and geographies.\nTeams across BlackRock are energized and organized to execute on these opportunities and deliver BlackRock's platform to clients through world-class client service. We've built BlackRock to be a structural grower with industry leadership in secular growth areas like ETFs, private markets, model portfolios, and technology. With supportive markets and more optimistic sentiment from clients, we're confident in our ability to both grow assets on behalf of clients and drive profitable growth for our shareholders.\nQ1 long-term net inflows of $76 billion continue to lead the industry, driving positive organic base fee growth alongside double-digit growth year- over- year in revenue and earnings, as well as 180 basis points of margin expansion. Excluding low-fee institutional index equity flows, we saw $100 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. As equity markets powered to record highs in the Q1, investors who were waiting in cash missed out on significant returns across broader markets. With long-term investing, time in the markets is often more important than market timing. Although cash remains an attractive safe haven with the prospect of fewer rate cuts for 2024, the nearly 30% increase in equities over the last year continues to propel clients towards re-risking into stocks and bonds. Clients choose BlackRock for performance. They continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with us, which is driving our growth premium.\nWith more clarity on interest rates and a supportive market backdrop, the assets we manage on behalf of our clients, our units of trust, ended the quarter up $1.4 trillion from a year ago, an increase of 15%. Organic asset and base fee growth again accelerated into the end of the quarter, and we see broad-based momentum growing across client channels and regions. In Q1, BlackRock generated long-term net inflows of $76 billion, partially offset by seasonal outflows from institutional money market funds. Total annualized organic base fee growth of 1% reflected seasonally softer flows earlier in the quarter before coming back to target in March. Q1 revenue of $4.7 billion increased 11% year- over- year, driven by the impact of market appreciation over the last 12 months on average AUM and higher performance fees, and technology services revenue.\nOperating income of $1.8 billion was up 17%, and earnings per share of $9.81 was 24% higher versus a year ago, also reflecting higher non-operating income. Non-operating results for the quarter included $90 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by mark-to-market non-cash gains on our unhedged seed capital investments and minority investment in Envestnet. Our as-adjusted tax rate for Q1 was approximately 23% and included discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in Q1 of each year. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2024, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nQ1 base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion was up 8% year- over- year and up 5% sequentially, driven by the positive impact of market beta on average AUM and positive organic base fee growth. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was 3/10 of a basis point lower compared to Q4. This was mainly due to the relative outperformance of lower-fee US equity markets, client preferences for lower-fee US exposures, and lower securities lending revenue. Performance fees of $204 million increased from a year ago, primarily reflecting higher revenue from alternatives. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 11% compared to a year ago, reflecting sustained demand for our Latin technology offerings. Annual contract value or ACV increased 9% year- over- year.\nBeginning in Q1 of 2024, earnings recognized from minority investments accounted for under equity method will be presented as part of our non-operating results. Advisory and other revenue increased from a year ago, primarily reflecting this change. In addition, as many of you know, we updated the presentation of expense line items by including a new sales, asset, and account income statement caption. This category includes distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, and sub-advisory and other sales, asset, and account-based expense. Sub-advisory and other expense, which are variable non-compensation expenses associated with asset and revenue growth, was previously reported within general and administration expense. We believe this change provides investors a clearer view of both BlackRock's variable non-compensation expense and G&A, which represents more fixed costs.\nIt represents how we'll execute on our financial rubric of aligning investment spend with our highest conviction growth areas, variabilizing more of our expense base, and generating fixed cost scale. Total expense increased 8% year- over- year, reflecting higher compensation, G&A, and sales, asset, and account expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 11%, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation as a result of higher operating income and performance fees. G&A expense increased 6% due to the timing of technology investment spend in the prior year. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased 12%, reflecting timing of technology investment spend and seasonally higher marketing and promotional expense in Q4. While Q1's results can be impacted by timing of spend, we expect technology to be one of our primary areas of investment within G&A. Sales, asset, and account expense increased 5% compared to a year ago, primarily driven by higher direct fund expense.\nDirect fund expense was up 7% year- over- year, mainly due to higher average index AUM. Sequentially, direct fund expense increased due to higher average index AUM in the current quarter and higher rebates that seasonally occur in Q4. Our Q1 as-adjusted operating margin of 42.2% was up 180 basis points from a year ago. As markets improve, we remain committed to driving operating leverage and profitable growth. BlackRock's industry-leading organic growth is a direct result of the disciplined investments we've made consistently through market cycles. Looking forward, we'll continue to prioritize investments with differentiated organic growth potential or that will expand operating leverage through enhanced scale.\nIn line with our guidance in January and excluding the impact of Global Infrastructure Partners and related transaction costs, at present, we would expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024, and we would also expect a low to mid-single-digit percentage increase in 2024 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first, either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. At times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate organic growth and support our strategic initiatives. Last month, we announced our agreement to acquire the remaining equity interest in SpiderRock Advisors, a leading provider of customized option overlay strategies in the US wealth market.\nThis transaction expands on BlackRock's minority investment in SpiderRock Advisors made in 2021 and builds on BlackRock's strong growth in personalized separately managed accounts via Aperio and ETF model portfolios. At present, we expect the transaction to close in Q2 this year, subject to customary closing conditions. In March, we issued $3 billion of debt to fund a portion of the cash consideration for our planned acquisition of GIP. Our offering consisted of three tranches of senior unsecured notes across 5, 10, and 30-year maturities. The offering was well received by fixed-income investors, especially our inaugural 30-year bond. We currently have invested the proceeds of the offering at substantially the same rate as the cost of borrowing, effectively eliminating incremental cost of carrying additional debt prior to the close of the GIP transaction.\nWe continue to target Q3 of 2024 for the closing of the GIP transaction, which remains subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in Q1. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our January guidance. More positive sentiment from clients and in markets persisted into Q1. Clients increasingly turned to BlackRock to reposition and redeploy across their portfolios. Q1 long-term net inflows of $76 billion were positive across active and index strategies, as well as each of our client and product types. ETF net inflows of $67 billion were led by core equity and fixed-income ETFs, with net inflows of $37 billion and $18 billion, respectively.\nThese inflows were partially offset by seasonal tax trading-related outflows from our US style box exposure and precision ETFs. As you'll hear from Larry, our Bitcoin ETC saw surging demand after launching in January, gathering $14 billion of net inflows in Q4. This is just the latest example of BlackRock innovating to provide better access and transparency to a wider range of investment exposures. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were led by continued growth in Aperio, as well as renewed demand for active fixed income. Financial advisors are increasingly looking to customize whole portfolios at scale, driving growth across our SMA and managed model platforms. Our partnership with Envestnet is one channel powering flows through model portfolios. We saw our best gross sales month ever on the platform, and year-to-date organic asset and revenue growth has more than doubled compared to this time last year.\nSales on the platform aren't just accelerating. They're diversifying. We similarly saw record gross flows in custom models and record AUM in our global allocation models, both of which have larger active components. Within SMAs, our previously mentioned acquisition of SpiderRock Advisors will further enhance our product offerings and provide even greater personalization across our wealth segments. Institutional active net inflows of $15 billion were driven by our LifePath target date franchise and outsourcing mandates. We see significant momentum across our whole portfolio capabilities. Our pipeline remains strong as more and more clients turn to BlackRock for outsourcing solutions. Institutional index and alpha flows of $13 billion were concentrated in low-fee index equities as several large clients rebalanced their portfolios amid significant equity market appreciation in the last six months. Our private markets franchise saw $1 billion of net inflows.\nContinued demand for our liquid offerings was offset by alpha generation for our clients, reflected in over $3 billion of fund monetization, LP distributions, or change in fee basis, primarily for more seasoned private equity solutions programs. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $19 billion of net outflows in Q1, in line with institutional money market industry trends. Our cash business can experience seasonal rotations in Q1 as many institutional clients withdraw these liquid assets for operational purposes, including tax and bonus payments. Cash management flows were impacted by approximately $14 billion of net redemptions during the last week of March ahead of the Good Friday holiday. Outflows were driven by clients redeeming balances to have cash on hand during a time when many businesses are open but the financial markets are closed. This phenomenon is not uncommon or unique to BlackRock.\nBalances largely returned with approximately $20 billion of money market net inflows in Q1 of April. BlackRock's differentiated business model has enabled us to continue to grow with our clients, driving industry-leading organic growth and margins. Looking ahead as markets trend to be more supportive and clients re-risk, we see significant opportunity to expand our market share and consolidate our position with clients. We've set ourselves up to be a structural grower with the diversified platform that we've built. Enthusiasm's growing, momentum's building across the platform. All of us at BlackRock are excited about our future and the growing opportunities for BlackRock, for our clients, for our employees, and of course, for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nThank you, Martin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call.BlackRock is partnering with clients to navigate structural and secular changes in business models, technology, monetary, and fiscal policies, all while staying focused on each and every client goal. Through this connectivity, we are having richer conversations with clients than ever before about their whole portfolio, and in many cases, deepening our relationships with them. This is driving accelerating momentum with a strong pipeline that has some of the best breadth of opportunities across all our client channels and regions that we've ever seen. BlackRock's integrated investment technology advisory platform and durable performance are resonating. In my conversations with clients around the world, I'm hearing about how they want to put their money to work, but they want to do it differently than they did in the past. They want their portfolios to be more holistically blending public and private markets, active and in index.\nThey want their portfolios to be nimble, customized, tech-enabled. They want to work with fewer providers or maybe just with one provider. BlackRock is the only asset manager that can partner in this way, having the most diverse integrated investment and technology platform in the industry. Clients around the world are choosing to do more with BlackRock, and this is resonating in our results. But I'm actually more excited about the building momentum we're seeing across our entire platform. BlackRock's AUM ended Q1 at a new record of nearly $10.5 trillion, up $1.4 trillion or 15% over the last 12 months. Also, at that time, clients have entrusted BlackRock with more than $236 billion of net new assets. BlackRock generated positive net flows across active, index, and across all client types.\nWe grew our technology service revenues and ACV as clients leveraged Aladdin to support investment processes and their entire platform. We've had a number of real large marquee wins in Aladdin and are working on a number of significant new opportunities. Momentum remains strong as we grow with new and existing clients. We continue to deliver sustained asset and technology services growth at scale. BlackRock's operating income was up 17% year over year, and we increased our margins by 180 basis points. Earnings per share were up 24%. Activity is notably accelerating. As Martin said, we generated $76 billion of long-term net flows in Q1, which represents nearly 40% of last year's long-term flows in just the first three months of this year. Long-term net inflows across retail, ETFs, and institutional active was actually $100 billion, which excludes the episodic institutional equity activity Martin mentioned.\nSome of these are public, some aren't. But over the last few months, we've been chosen for a breadth of mandates from both wealth and institutional clients across regions that will fund over future quarters, and we were in active conversations on a number of unique broad-based opportunities, including several large mandates for Aladdin. There is still a record amount of cash on the sidelines, and money market fund balances are now approaching $9 trillion. I think this stems from fear and uncertainty, but it's hard to achieve retirement or long-dated objectives by holding cash. Clients worldwide are coming to BlackRock for advice on where and how to deploy their capital and, in many ways, how to help them reduce that fear and put that money to work. Being a growth company requires continued innovation, lots of investments, and intense client focus.\nBlackRock has invested ahead of these themes we believe will define the next decade of asset management. I see the greatest opportunities I've ever seen for BlackRock, for our clients, and for our shareholders, and I'm very optimistic about the momentum into the rest of 2024 and beyond. The uncertain backdrop does not mean a lack of opportunities. Instead, we see great opportunities for investors across a number of structural trends with near-term catalysts. These include rapid advancements in technology and AI, the rewiring of globalization, accelerated economic growth in certain emerging markets, and an unprecedented need for new infrastructure. BlackRock is connecting with clients to these opportunities and providing them the confidence to continue investing in the long run. In a world where clients are looking for more certainty, the higher coupon, longer duration returns of infrastructure private markets are increasingly becoming more attractive.\nDemand for all forms of infrastructure is surging around the world, from telecom networks to power generation to transport hubs for data centers and new ways of securing energy. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock's infrastructure platform has delivered 19% organic asset growth. BlackRock's infrastructure franchise and our private markets business more broadly benefited from the firm's global footprint, our deep network of clients and distribution relationships, and access to high-quality deal flow. As we spoke in January, we believe the planned combination of BlackRock's infrastructure platform with GIP will provide clients with access to market-leading investments and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. We have a deep conviction that this planned combination will be another transformational moment for BlackRock. It will be another example in our long-term history of staying ahead of client needs, positioning ourselves against accelerated macro trends.\nI believe infrastructure private markets are approaching the upward trajectory of their J-curve, just as ETFs did when we announced our acquisition of BGI and iShares nearly 15 years ago. We always viewed ETFs as a technology that facilitated investing. Since our acquisition of iShares, BlackRock has led in expanding the market of ETFs by making them more accessible, by delivering new asset classes like bonds, investment strategies like actives. As a result of that success, the ETFs evolved beyond what started as an indexing concept. It is recognized as an efficient structure for a range of all investment solutions. Q1 ETF net inflows of $67 billion reflected sustained client demand across our client categories, led by core equity and bond ETFs. ETF flows demonstrated accelerating activity, with March accounting for more than half of the quarterly net inflows.\nOur flows in the month were 80% higher than the next largest issuer. We continue to innovate across our ETF platform to give our clients better access to the most diverse range of exposures in the industry. Our Bitcoin fund, which was launched in January, was the fastest-growing ETF in history and already has nearly $20 billion in AUM. Our active ETF drove $9 billion in net inflows in Q1, led by our equity factor rotation and flexible income ETFs. These products offer alpha generation with some of our leading investors at BlackRock in a more efficient, more transparent ETF wrapper. Across BlackRock, we continue to scale our product offerings to democratize access to new strategies, increase transparency, and drive cost efficiency. To that end, last month, we announced the launch of our first tokenized fund, as well as our minority investment in Securitize, a blockchain-based tokenization platform.\nThis builds on our existing digital asset strategy, and we'll continue to innovate in new products and wrappers, all with the aim of providing greater access and customization to each and every one of our clients. We continue to see demand for customization with our own wealth business, as financial advisors and their clients they serve increasingly turn to SMAs to personalize their portfolios. We acquired Aperio three years ago in anticipation of this trend, and organic growth in that business has been over 20% since our acquisition. To further boost our SMA capabilities, we announced our planned acquisition of the remaining equity interests of SpiderRock, as Martin discussed. Among wealth clients, we are also seeking to renew demand for our high-performing active fixed income strategies, with particular strength in high-yield and unconstrained bond funds.\nIn the post-QE market, we see more opportunities ahead for active management, with greater potential for selective risk-taking to generate superior returns. Quarterly active net inflows of $15 billion reflect strength in systematic equities and fundamental fixed income, including the funding of several institutional outsourcing mandates. Across our active franchise, BlackRock has delivered durable investment performance with 82%, 90%, and 93% of our fundamental equity, systematic equity, and taxable fixed income AUM above benchmarks or peer medium for the last five years. Our active investment insights, our strong investment performance, our integrated Aladdin technology differentiates BlackRock and ultimately drives better outcomes for our clients. We first built Aladdin as a risk management enabler, empowering investors to better understand their portfolios through technology. Today, Aladdin is much more than that.\nOur clients are leveraging Aladdin as a whole enterprise operating system, connecting multiple asset classes, data, technology partners, and a single platform. Aladdin's integrated offering continues to resonate with the majority of our sales this quarter, spanning multiple Aladdin products. We are in the late-stage conversation with several large potential Aladdin clients, and we look forward to executing on more opportunities ahead to be bringing the benefits of Aladdin to new clients and by expanding relationships with our existing clients. From the early days of developing Aladdin to now managing nearly $10.5 trillion across our platform, our ambition has always been to help investors benefit from the growth of the capital markets and achieve financial futures that they seek. More than half of the assets we manage are related to retirement, making this an outcome central to many of our client conversations.\nBlackRock has been at the forefront of innovation and advocacy for retirement solutions for years. In fact, we pioneered the first target-date fund called LifePath back in 1993 when we introduced the concept. It was revolutionary, eliminating some of the guesswork for retirement savings by automatically adjusting their investment mix over their timeframe. Fast forward 30 years, target-date funds have become the most common default investment option in defined contribution plans in the United States, where we're entrusted to manage the retirement assets of 35 million Americans. We continue to evolve LifePath to help deliver the retirement outcome participants need. That has meant introducing LifePath options in new countries and in new wrappers, such as LifePath target-date ETFs we launched last year. Our LifePath target-date franchise now has nearly $470 billion in assets and has risen over $115 billion in assets just over the last five years.\nIn addition to helping people save for retirement, we also work to expand the LifePath solution to help people spend throughout their increasingly longer retirement. Society focuses a tremendous amount on helping people live longer and healthier lives, but spends just a fraction of that time and effort on helping them afford those extra wonderful years. The shift from pension to defined contribution models has put the large burden on individual savers. They have to first build up their retirement estate, which in itself is a formidable challenge. Then, even as they have the sizable savings at retirement, there's not much guidance about how to spend and how not to overspend these savings. We've been working for years to address this de-accumulation challenge, and we believe this will help increase hope in America. In 2020, we announced the LifePath Paycheck, the next generation of target-date solutions.\nIt will include an option to purchase a lifetime income stream from insurers selected by BlackRock and is expected to go live towards the end of the month. We are partnering on implementing LifePath Paycheck right now with 14 planned sponsors representing over $25 billion in target-date AUM and now have a half a million participants. It will pair the flexibility of a 401(k) investment with the potential for a predictable paycheck life income stream similar to a pension. I believe it will be, in one day, the most used investment strategy in defined contribution plans. This pioneering structure can help address global gaps in funding retirement security, improve the quality of life and retirement for millions of Americans, and bring back hope for those who are retiring. It's been four years since the start of the pandemic and the subsequent geopolitical upheavals.\nLeaders of countries, leaders of companies need to create hope for the future for all of their stakeholders. That's certainly what we're doing at BlackRock. I've spoken before about the fear we see today, some of it stoked by increasingly political polarization in the world. Our industry and BlackRock have been a subject of political dialogue, mostly in the United States. We recognize some of this with being the industry leader. We have done a better job now of telling our story so that people can make decisions based on facts, not on lies, and not on misinformation or politicization by others. Unfortunately, there are still others out there who put short-term politics, who continuously lie about these issues. They are putting those issues above the long-term fiduciary responsibilities. As a fiduciary, politics should never outweigh performance.\nI do believe that with a vast majority of our clients, our long-term fiduciary approach and performance are resonating. We hear it in our dialogue with them, and we see it in our flows. I know all of you as shareholders see it in our flows. Over the past five years, clients have entrusted BlackRock with an aggregate of $1.9 trillion of total net inflows, $1 trillion over the last three years, and nearly $300 billion last year. It has been in the United States where client-led inflows in every one of these periods. It is true also in Q1 of this year. This all is in the environment where the industry was experiencing flat or negative flows. BlackRock saw inflows. Our sustained growth, our accelerating momentum are made possible by the trust of our clients and shareholders and the dedication of all the BlackRock people.\nAcross our firm, we're delivering BlackRock to meet all our clients' individual needs. We're helping each and every client unlock their new opportunities. The power of BlackRock's integrated platform has enabled us to drive better outcomes for each and every client and providing them a differentiating growth for them, which then entails providing differentiating growth for you, our shareholders. I believe at this time, our momentum has never been stronger. The opportunity we have in front of us has never been stronger. I look forward at BlackRock to be delivering on a significant broad base of opportunities across the world, across our platform, across all of our products, and delivering the responsible fiduciary responsibilities that we provide to each and every client. Operator, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you do ask a question, please take your phone off of its speaker setting and use your handset to avoid any potential feedback. Please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-enter the queue. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the rest Q&A roster. We'll go first to Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning, Larry.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nHey, Craig, good morning.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nmy question is on your commentary around building momentum and line of sight into significant fundings. If we exclude fee rate issues like divergent beta, when do you think BlackRock can get back to 5% base fee organic growth? With the law of large numbers as a factor, what is your confidence that this objective is still achievable at your current $10 trillion AUM size?\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Craig. How are you? It's Martin. Listen, I'd start by Q1 net flows were solid at $76 billion. On a more granular look, we just see durable growth in that flows mix. We had about $100 billion across ETFs, retail, institutional active, and institutional fixed income. Of course, we saw some of these $19 billion redemptions from cash with the Good Friday quarter-end dynamic and the $26 billion rebalanced away in institutional index equities. You know those institutional index equities happen from time to time. They're not meaningful revenue impacts or fee rate detractors, but they weigh on kind of the long-term flow totals. When we look at this core momentum on flows, excluding the episodic index redemptions, Q1 flows were $100 billion. It's a healthy trajectory. It's an affirmation for us that we're focused on the right things to grow with clients.\nOn base fees, the management team here, we really feel like we've turned a corner. Over the last two quarters, we see really solid trends in organic fee growth. They're really some of the best since the end of 2021. We saw excellent momentum to finish the fourth quarter, which we talked about on the last call. We closed out November and December higher than target. This quarter, March new base fees annualized at target after we had a slower start. So over the last six months, we see organic base fee growth ticking up and trending more halfway or halfway plus to our long-term targets. It's not a straight line, but we're moving to target. I say this because we see key positive trends in these sort of critical base fee growers for us.\nRetail posted $7 billion of flows in that 40 to 50 basis point bucket. Money's going back to work. Redemption rates are moderating. We see really excellent momentum in active overall with $15 billion of flows and good velocity in institutional, retail active fixed income in particular at $9 billion. And I think it's what Larry's getting at, we've been selected for a breadth of mandates across investment management and technology that we see supporting 5% organic growth and will run over future quarters. Our planned acquisition of GIP will help us build and ramp from there. So we look forward to closing that transaction, executing on these mandates, and keeping you guys posted on our progress.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nI would just add the breadth of conversations we're having with clients worldwide. Rob Kapito right now is in Asia, the type of conversations we have there. The opportunities we see in Europe, in the UK, Middle East, these are just very large opportunities, large mandates, big opportunities. If you then overlay the opportunities, if you overlay what infrastructure can do related to the build-out of power with all the AI promise, the need for data centers, and the need for power is going to be extraordinary. All of this is going to lead to much bigger opportunities. Then, more importantly, more and more clients are going to be seeking those organizations who deliver the proprietary differentiated products.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nHi, Michael.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning. Thanks. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about balancing investment spend with margin expansion. In the past, we've heard BlackRock talk about being margin-aware. So just curious how the thinking on that has evolved. What does that mean in today's environment? And how might you quantify the opportunity for margin expansion over time? And how do you see some of the levers to achieve that?\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Mike. Our approach to shareholder value creation is obviously to generate differentiated organic growth. It's to drive operating leverage and a premium margin, and it's to execute on a consistent capital management strategy. We have a strong track record of investing in our business for growth, scale, and expanding profitability. I want to emphasize it's not just about growth. It's about profitable growth over the long term. That growth comes from making continued investments in our business. I've talked a lot about, on the last several calls and obviously some of the other meetings we've had. We're looking to size our operating investments in line with a prudent lens on organic growth potential. We're aiming to put more flexibility in our cost base and variabilize expenses where we can. Most importantly, we're looking to generate fixed cost scale, especially through investments in technology.\nWe're consistently delivering industry-leading margins, which is a goal. We've expanded our margin in six out of the last 10 years. I think those scale indicators are coming through in our results. We're delivering profitable growth. We generated 180 basis points of margin expansion year on year, while revenue, operating income, and EPS all rose double digits. We delivered 60 basis points of sequential margin improvement. Over the last 18 months, AUM's up $2.5 trillion, while headcounts actually flat or slightly lower. I feel like we're delivering benefits of scale and productivity, which is showing in margin expansion. As I mentioned, we're planning for full-year low- to mid-single-digits core G&A growth, flat headcount, both excluding the GIP transaction. You've heard on our last few calls, and I hope today in some of Larry's color, we're looking to drive more fixed-cost scale.\nThat comes from technology. It comes from automation. It can come from AI. It comes from organizational design, global footprinting using some of our innovation hubs around the world. We see those as our major levers to drive margin expansion. And in the end, we're just looking to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible, deliver growth for clients and shareholders, and ultimately expand our margin over time.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nMichael, I would just add, as we continue to be investing in AI, our most recent experience of having $2.5 trillion more assets with the same headcount is a real good indication of how we are trying to drive more efficiencies, more productivity. I think this is critical. We're going to bring down inflation in America. This is how it's going to have to be done, driven through technology, which will increase more productivity. And overall, actually, through that process, if we continue to drive more productivity, what it also means is rising wages. So people do more, and the whole organization is doing more with less people as a percent of the overall organization. That is really our ambition.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\n\n[Analyst](JPMorgan)\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Fixed income flows have picked up for the US mutual fund industry so far this year, but the same data services that track the industry don't show a proportionate pickup for BlackRock. Your fixed income ETF sales, while solid at $18 billion, are below levels seen last year. Can you talk about the competitive landscape for fixed income retail and fixed income ETFs, both inside and outside the US, and to what extent you think investor appetite may have changed in 2024?\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nRob here. The conversations that we're having across all of the distribution systems are about a new allocation into fixed income. It's being very much clouded by all the noise around inflation and the Fed. So the yield curve remains inverted, and investors are currently getting paid to wait. And a more balanced term structure of interest rates is going to be the indicator to watch. And that's where we'll start to see demand for intermediate and longer-term fixed income. So Q1 for us flows of $42 billion, which I think is considerable. We saw the strength in the bond ETFs from immunization activity and institutional, and about 25% of the flows were into active strategies. So we're seeing renewed demand for active fixed income, and that's led to flows into the high yield, the unconstrained, and the total return strategies.\nThe fact that our longer-term performance has about 93% of our taxable active fixed income AUM above the benchmark or peer median in the last five years are really setting us up to capture this. But I do think the noise that's out there focused on inflation and the fact that you can still earn 5%, which is very attractive right now, is causing the delay in more allocations to fixed income. The other part of why I'm more encouraged is we are finding a growing interest in high-performing active fixed income strategies alongside private market strategies. So I think that we stand to benefit very well once you see some changes in the yield curve.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go to Alex.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nSo I would just add one last point.\n\nOperator\n\nGo ahead.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nLet me just add, operator, to Ken's question. Ken, I do believe as an industry, the large pension funds that have an overallocation of private equity and the rotation of money in the private equity area has slowed down precipitously. We are also seeing evidence that more and more clients are keeping a higher balance of cash to meet their liability discharges. And so without the momentum and the velocity of money in private equity, they actually have to keep higher cash balances too. So I think that is something to be watched too. If there was an unlock in the movement of private equity, I do believe you would see a faster allocation for the industry in fixed income and other income-producing products.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nHi, Alex.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, Larry. Good morning, everybody. My question is related to private markets and GIP. Larry, you referred to it again this morning as a transformational deal for BlackRock, maybe similar to some of the other large ones you've done. Does this give you enough in terms of what you're trying to accomplish in private markets broadly, or do you expect to pursue more acquisitions that are related in this area? And I guess somewhat related to that, growth in private markets, retail products has been quite significant and still early days. Maybe just remind us on how BlackRock is pursuing that opportunity.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nHey, Alex, how are you? It's Martin. I'll offer a few thoughts, and then Larry will jump in. I'd say, look, all of our clients continue to increase their allocations to private markets. That's what drove our acquisition of eFront. It's what drove our planned acquisition of GIP. And it's also a great focus of the organic investments we've made to build in a liquid alternatives business of size. There are sort of a liquid alternatives business. We've reached $167 billion of assets, roughly $140 billion fee-paying. We had a good quarter there. Infrastructure and private credit deployment added a billion of inflows, offset by return of capital that I talked about. We're getting close on our final closes for our BlackRock Infrastructure IV Fund for Decarbonization Partners, which has been a great first-time fund advantage. We've got $30 billion committed, but uninvested capital.\nSo there's good dry powder in the system. As Larry mentioned, we're originating really strong, unique transactions there. we think our capabilities are expanding in a way that's going to plan. Just yesterday, we announced an infrastructure debt deal with Santander, where we're going to be financing about $600 million of infrastructure loans in a structured transaction. And we just see good fundraising momentum, which we think we can kick into next year with GIP. Since 2021, we've had $140 billion of gross capital across the platform. Continue to see good momentum with clients. And to the topic you mentioned, we've been building out our semi-liquid products for retail with credit strategies. Our credit strategies interval fund and our non-traded credit BDC BCRED have a combined billion-plus of AUM. We received a really important placement for BCRED at a national wirehouse.\nSo we think that'll be a strong accelerant for organic growth. And then finally, that planned acquisition with GIP is going to really extend our capabilities. We think the business can be a much stronger platform for capital formation at scale and build on this velocity we have in the liquid alternatives. We also think there's a great opportunity to bring GIP's capabilities to private wealth globally, retail retirement platforms in the UK and Europe with the LTIF and LTAF structures. And obviously, we'll keep you updated on our progress.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nI would just add that the feedback we're having from clients, including a dinner I had with a major energy company last night, the opportunity we have for driving more unique proprietary origination is going to be driving accelerated growth for us in the private markets, especially in infrastructure. I do believe the combination of our two organizations is going to open up so many more avenues, avenues where companies, but also avenues where countries. And that being said, look, we're always in the market of looking for different opportunities, and we're not slowing down looking at different opportunities. We're not here to suggest we're doing anything that is forthcoming because the number one through five thing to do is to close GIP. But the doors are knocking at BlackRock to see if there's other opportunities we want to pursue. If it makes sense one day, we will continue to be open-minded to pursue more private market opportunities.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. It's Martin.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nFor your comments. Thank you. Martin, for your comments on improving trends throughout the quarter for flows, can you put into the context what that means for maybe the exit fee rate and also on this pipeline of activity that's building? Can you talk about the mix of fees and products more specifically and how that might inform your base fee outlook going forward?\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nYeah. So thanks, Dan. As I mentioned, we see good base fee momentum. At the end of Q4, we were running at hotter than target. At the end of this quarter, we're at target. And as I mentioned, when we look at the trends over months, not days, we feel like we're half or halfway plus to our target growth. So we've got good base fee momentum. First quarter base fees, excluding securities lending, were $3.6 billion, which is up 9% year on year, which is largely due to the impact of market movements on AUM, and organic growth. And the Q2 entry fee rate, ex securities lending, is pretty much flat compared to the Q1 fee rate on a day-count equivalent basis.\nBut overall, I think as we see good flows into active with the $15 billion we've had, as I mentioned, retail flows of $7 billion coming in, we see good fee rate trends, which we think are mostly about mix. We focus really on driving organic base fee growth in the most efficient way possible, focusing on the clients, focusing on the investments they want to make. We don't focus on a specific fee rate or product. We focus on the clients, and the fee rate's more of an output. But the trends in terms of where we're raising assets on the fee rate, we think are good. But as I mentioned, Q2 ending fee rate ex securities lending is flat compared to the Q1 fee rate on the same day count.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Bill Katz with TD Cowen.\n\nBill Katz\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you for taking the question. Good morning, everybody, and thank you so much for taking the question. Appreciate the update. Maybe a different vein. Performance fees continue to run pretty high. And just sort of wondering, are we reaching a new level of normalized performance fees, and how might that translate into sort of the comp ratio as we look ahead, particularly as you continue to migrate to a bigger pool of private markets post-GIP? Thank you.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Bill, for the question. We appreciate it. So on the performance fees of $204 million in the quarter, obviously, they're up about four times year on year. If you could put yourself in a time machine and think back to that Q1 2023, it was a really difficult market. We had SVB. We had some vol in the rate markets, etc. So I think it was a tough time. This quarter, we've really seen good performance coming through on our teams, which has been very, very strong, and I think reflected in those performance fees. Rough justice, about half of that performance fee is coming from kind of our private equity funds and private equity programs where we had some very successful realizations that Larry talked about last year, which was BCRED and some of the distributions associated with that.\nAnd the other half is more in liquid hedge funds, in our strategic equity hedge funds, and some of our systematic strategies as well. Ultimately, our goal is to deliver long-term performance to clients, and where we see performance fee revenues ticking up, obviously, there's healthy alignment there. In more supportive markets and stronger markets and strong performance, we'd expect a lot of that leverage to drop to a lower comp-to-revenue ratio. But ultimately, talent is one of our key investments, and we'd expect it to be on a go-forward basis.",
    "content2": "Operator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, Larry\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to focus on the multi-asset category and a couple of areas within that. I think, Martin, you were talking about, obviously, the build of the organic growth pipeline and also in conjunction, Larry, with your comments about the conversation pipeline. Can you talk about two areas in particular as they develop throughout the year? That would be OCIO deals, and then also as we start up LifePath Paycheck, how you anticipate that contributing to organic growth, I guess, as the year unfolds, obviously, very early, but even over the next couple of years.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nSure. Thanks so much for the question. Appreciate it. I guess maybe I can start with a little color on the multi-asset flows, and then Larry can comment on LifePath Paycheck. So multi-asset strategy saw inflows in the quarter of about $5 billion after we had a really strong 2023 with $83 billion. Those strong inflows were driven by the continued demand for our LifePath target-date offerings. And obviously, we see significant growth ahead in that core business, but also in the upcoming launch of LifePath Paycheck. Our LifePath target-date franchise has about $470 billion in assets, generated $9 billion of flows in the first quarter, thanks to the funding of several large mandates. We have about an organic growth rate of 8%. So we're leading the market there in terms of growth, and we continue to outperform relative to the industry.\nAgain, we're building on a strong core business there. We had $25 billion of flows in 2023, which was about 7% growth. We're the number one DC investment-only DCIO firm. We have 70,000 DC plans, and we're the only provider, I think, that's really global. Most of the assets at BlackRock are investing to finance retirement, and we've been at the forefront of innovation and advocacy for retirement solutions throughout our history. It's a key part of our growth, and the innovation that we're doing in LifePath Paycheck, we think, is exciting and a significant area of our future organic growth.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nAs I said in my prepared remarks, we have 14 corporations that are preparing to transform their defined contribution plan to LifePath Paycheck. But the conversation we're having with so many other plans is enormous. Many clients wanted to see the actual implementation of these plans. As we have said in prepared remarks, the first implementation of the first plan is going to be in the next few weeks. We'll have many announcements about that, and we plan to really make that a big issue for us going forward. We believe, as I said before, this is going to change retirement. The movement away from defined benefits to defined contributions has left many, many individuals stranded in making the decisions of their own retirement by themselves. And this eliminates some of the uncertainty for retirement.\nThe target date has eliminated a lot of the variability of retirement, but there has been no transformation in terms of bringing, once you are retired, how do you know what you have? And through this innovation of integrating investment strategies around insurance wrappers can really narrow the outcome that the individual can have a very narrow corridor of what the dollar amount that they're going to be earning each month. And, as I said in my letter, with growing longevity, retirement is going to become a bigger and bigger issue, and having this type of certainty really will alleviate some of the fear. As I said, our conversations are broad, and let me be clear, the conversations are also now beginning in Europe and other places too. So we look at this as a major component of our future growth rates over the next three to five years.\nObviously, it's not the highest fee-based product. It is like a target date product, but it can generate more connectivity with more clients, deeper relationships with all our clients. And so this is something that I'm very proud of when the firm is created, and I do believe it's going to transform BlackRock as a leader in retirement benefits.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We'll go next to Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nGood morning, Patrick.\n\nPatrick Davitt\n\nAnalyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks. My question's on Europe ETFs. Obviously, the active to passive equity flow mix continues to track more like the US and Europe so far this year. So firstly, could you update us on the defensibility of your positioning around that theme? To what extent and to what extent you're seeing more aggressive price competition? And finally, higher level, to what extent you're seeing a real change in how ETFs are bought and sold in Europe that could portend this so-called catch-up trend continuing more indefinitely? Thank you.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock\n\nThanks, Patrick. Really appreciate the question. As you mentioned, we had about $67 billion of iShares inflows in Q1 led by core fixed income, IBIT. The business is running in a very strong way. High single-digit asset growth, mid-single-digit base fee growth. All the trends globally are very strong. But we have been stressing, and I'm glad for the question, just the real strength and competitive positioning of the iShares business in Europe. The European iShares continues to lead the market with about 30% market share of inflows. That's two times the inflows of the number two player, and our inflows exceed the two and three players combined. Our iShares franchise in Europe is $850 billion of AUM. That's bigger than the next five players combined. So we think we have a real outsized opportunity to grow ETFs in the UK and Europe.\nObviously, the competitive dynamics there, I think, are very, very different than they are here in the United States in terms of the buying units, how buying units are sold. This is largely a private banking market that uses exchange-traded funds through discretionary private management programs, and iShares is really a very strong and preferred provider. I want you to think about it this way. The United States built a trillions and trillions of dollars ETF business with a national best bid, best offer system, a unified securities regulator, national exchange. Europe has more fragmented markets and has been growing, growing, and growing. So we really see, obviously, regulation is trending favorable in Europe. The buying dynamics are very favorable. And iShares is in a great market leadership position there, we think, to post outsized growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?\n\nLaurence D. Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock\n\nYes, I've got one last comment. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in BlackRock. Our performance is a direct result of our steadfast commitment to serving our clients and each and every client and evolving for the long-term trends ahead of their needs. We started 2024 with great momentum, and I strongly believe that there are more opportunities ahead for BlackRock more than any other time before. Thank you, everyone, and have a great quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."

All of us at GIP share in the vision of delivering better outcomes for clients and leading critical global investments that drive economic growth.Thank you. Thank you Bayo. This is another truly transformational moment for BlackRock. Our firm is what it is today because we've taken a long term view on what market forces will drive outsized growth for our clients and for our firm. We're doing that again today, guiding us always by the needs of our clients.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGrowing public deficits, a modernizing digital world, advancing energy independence, and the energy transition are driving the mobilization of private capital to fund critical infrastructure. Infrastructure investment is a fast growing market in a higher rate environment. The ability to drive operational enhancements will be critical to investment performance.\nToday we are announcing two transformational changes in anticipation of the evolution we see ahead for the asset management industry, and for the entire global capital markets. Our strategic rearchitecture of our organization will simplify and improve how we work and deliver for our clients, and the acquisition of GIP will propel our leadership in a fast-growing market for hard-asset infrastructure. These transformations in total are the largest at BlackRock since we acquired BGI nearly 15 years ago.\nThe planned combination of BlackRock's infrastructure platform and GIP will provide clients access to market leading investments and operating expertise across infrastructure private markets. The integrated platform will deliver clients substantial scale as a second largest private markets infrastructure manager in the world with over $150 billion in client assets.\nIn addition, GIP will bring dedicated investment and operational improvement teams with track records of delivering deep value enhancements which have led to impressive returns throughout its existence.\nWith a strong common culture of serving clients with excellence. Together we will deliver for our clients a holistic global infrastructure manager across equity, debt, and solutions. We will provide the full range of infrastructure sector exposures and will offer unique originations across developed and the emerging markets.\nBlackRock has developed a broad network of global corporate relationships through many years of long term investments in both debt and equity. These long term relationships will help us lead critical investments in infrastructure that will improve outcomes for communities around the globe and generate long term investment benefits for our clients.\nI know I speak for the entire BlackRock board of directors, BlackRock's leadership team, and all of our employees when I say we could not be more excited about the prospects of a BlackRock family with our colleagues from GIP, and we similarly look forward to welcoming our new clients and deepening our relationships with those clients who already work with both of us.\nBlackRock's industry leadership comes from delivering sustained performance, innovating, and staying ahead of the needs of our clients. Today we announced several organizational changes to simplify and improve how we work and how we deliver for clients in anticipation of the major calls we are making on the future of the capital markets and the entire asset management industry.\nThe strong senior leaders taking on new and expanded roles will keep us more tightly connected, stimulate fresh thinking, and help us better deliver for all our clients.\nLet me now turn over to Martin to cover our 2023 results and take you through the specifics of the transaction this quarter before I offer further context.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Larry. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. Before I pass it back to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results and provide more detail on the GIP transaction. We plan for a longer call today so that we have plenty of time for questions. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.\nThe last two years have been a character building and awe inspiring time for investors, for clients, and certainly for us. At BlackRock, the monetary policy shock of a rapid rate rising campaign upended 10 years of asset allocation practices and spurred repositioning of portfolios into cash and money market funds at the expense of risk assets. At BlackRock, our business is to serve clients with excellence and help them design portfolios for the future. We built BlackRock to be a structural grower by having a platform of investment technology and product capabilities that go beyond investment outcomes. They deliver clients scale. They deliver clients business efficiency. Whether clients are making wholesale portfolio allocation changes or just executing on tactical adjustments, they're doing it all within the BlackRock platform. We've spoken throughout the year about what conditions we'd expect to bring investors out of cash and into risk assets.\nIt's generally unfolding as we described with greater clarity on terminal rates. In the fourth quarter, we saw evidence of portfolio re-risking and we expect this trend to accelerate in 2024. BlackRock's a share winner when there's assets in motion and clients continue to consolidate more of their portfolios with us. In 2023, BlackRock generated $289 billion of total net inflows and delivered 1% organic base fee growth. Importantly, we finished the year with significant momentum in the fourth quarter, generating approximately $96 billion of total net inflows. In November and December, we saw a surge in flows resulting in 6% annualized organic base fee growth for the last two full months of the year. Full year revenue of $17.9 billion was relatively flat year over year. Operating income of $6.6 billion declined 2% from 2022, while earnings per share of $37.77 increased by 7% for the fourth quarter.\nRevenue of $4.6 billion was 7% higher year over year, driven by the impact of higher markets on average AUM and higher performance fees. Quarterly operating income of $1.7 billion was up 9%, while earnings per share of $9.66 was 8% higher versus a year ago, also reflecting higher nonoperating income in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $122 million of net investment income driven primarily by mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment portfolios. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 24%, driven in part by discrete items. We currently estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2024, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of non-recurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nFourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion was up 6% year over year driven by the positive impact of market beta. On average AUM, 2% organic base fee growth, and higher securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was down 2% on an equivalent day count basis. Our annualized effective fee rate was approximately 3.10 basis points lower compared to the third quarter. This was primarily due to lower securities lending revenue, underperformance of non-US equity markets, and client preferences favoring lower-fee fixed income and cash as a result of accelerating organic growth and global equity and bond market appreciation toward the end of the quarter. We entered the first quarter with an estimated base fee run rate approximately 6% higher than our total base fees for the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter and full year performance fees of $311 million and $554 million respectively increased from a year ago, reflecting higher revenue from liquid alternatives, and long only mandates. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 7% year over year, and full year revenue of $1.5 billion increased 9%, reflecting the successful onboarding of new clients, and large eFront on-premises licenses renewals in Q3. Annual contract value or ACV increased 10% year over year as clients increasingly partnered with BlackRock for integrated technology solutions to drive business transformation and scale. We remain committed to low- to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term. Total expense increased 1% in 2023, reflecting higher compensation, G&A, and direct fund expense. We effectively managed our discretionary spend in 2023, and we'll continue to be disciplined in focusing our resources in areas with the greatest opportunity.\nOur fourth quarter operating margin of 41.6% increased by 40 basis points year on year as we continue to drive operating leverage and profitable growth. After the market shock of 2022, our full year as adjusted operating margin of 41.7% was down 110 basis points from a year ago. The decline primarily reflected the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on our 2023 entry rate revenue as well as critical investments in our people and technology. During the year, we reorganized two of our fastest growing businesses, private markets and Aladdin, to stay ahead of our clients' evolving needs and build on our past successes in these areas. These specific groups further simplified their structures, resulting in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $61 million comprised of severance and accelerated amortization of previously granted deferred compensation awards.\nThis charge appears as a single line expense item on our 2023 GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results to enhance comparison to prior periods. In addition, we made resourcing decisions to free up investment capacity for our most important growth initiatives. This resulted in a one-time compensation expense of $28 million in Q4, which is included in our as-adjusted results. Overall, these two actions impacted approximately 3% of our workforce. By taking a targeted and disciplined approach to how we shape our teams and evolve our skill sets to meet changing market and technology environments, we increase investment capacity, we enhance organizational expertise, and we create opportunities for operating leverage and career growth. Looking forward, we're prioritizing investments to propel our differentiated organic growth and operating leverage.\nWe'll aim to align investment spend with our highest conviction structural growth areas, find additional ways to variableize expenses, and generate fixed cost scale through technology automation and optimization of our footprint through our innovation hubs. Excluding the impact of the GIP transaction at present, we'd expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2024. Also excluding the impact of GIP and related transaction costs, we'd expect a low to mid single digit percentage increase in 2024. Core G&A expense. Most core G&A growth should come from continued investment in technology as we look to operate more efficiently and better serve our clients.\nOne of our biggest long-term advantages has been scale, our ability to add significant assets managed with excellence without growing expenses linearly. Our platform strategy has delivered scale and operating leverage over time, and we're committed to delivering a premium operating margin. Our capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first, either to scale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency, and then return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nIn 2023, we returned over $4.5 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Share repurchases have been a consistent element of our capital management strategy. Since 2013, we've repurchased close to 15 billion of BlackRock stock, which generated an unlevered compound annual return of 14% for our shareholders. Over this time period, we reduced our share count by nearly 23 million shares, or 13%. For the trailing five years, we've lowered our share count by 10 million shares, completing 7.8 billion of share repurchases at an average price of $563 for an IRR of over 15%. BlackRock's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $5.10 per share, representing an increase of 2% over the 2023 level at present.\nBased on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions including the relative valuation of our stock price, we're targeting the purchase of $1.5 billion of shares during 2024.\nFull year. Total net inflows of $289 billion were positive across active and index, as well as regions, led by $156 billion of net inflows from clients in the United States, and we had 70 products across our ETF and mutual fund ranges. With over $1 billion in net inflows, BlackRock generated industry-leading ETF net inflows of $186 billion in 2023, representing 6% organic asset growth led by $112 billion of net inflows into our bond ETFs.\nFourth quarter.ETF net inflows of $88 billion reflected significant momentum into year-end, helped by seasonal tax trades and portfolio reallocations. We saw $28 billion of net inflows into precision exposures as institutional clients used these highly liquid instruments to re-risk in the quarter. With Safe Haven Cash providing positive returns, full-year and fourth-quarter retail net outflows of $8 billion and $9 billion respectively were primarily due to allocations out of rising rate-sensitive strategies, namely liquid alternatives and flexible bond funds. This was partially offset by strength in Aperio, which saw record net inflows of $12 billion in 2023. Aperio AUM since acquisition has grown 95% to $80 billion. BlackRock's institutional business generated net inflows of $32 billion in 2023, led by active net inflows of $87 billion, including the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates. Throughout the year.\nIndex net outflows of $55 billion were driven by redemptions from our low fee equity strategies as several large clients adjusted their allocations or redeemed for cash needs.\nFinally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $33 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $79 billion of net inflows in 2023. We're pleased with the continued strong growth in our cash and liquidity business with year-end AUM up 14% or over $90 billion year on year. We're leveraging our scale and integrated cash offerings to engage with clients who are using these products not only to manage liquidity but also to earn attractive returns.\nDemand for private markets remains strong with $14 billion of net inflows into BlackRock liquid strategies during the year. Driven by infrastructure and private credit, we continue to expect these categories to be our primary growth drivers in the coming years. Turning to our planned acquisition of GIP, this is an exciting day for us, our new partners, our clients, and our shareholders. The combination will mark a transformational change in our private market scale and growth. GIP is the world's leading independent infrastructure manager with current client AUM of over $100 billion and fee-based AUM of over $60 billion. The acquisition will create a highly complementary pro forma $150 billion infrastructure platform post-closing, tripling BlackRock's infrastructure client assets. The integration will nearly double our private markets management fees to over $1.5 billion and add over $400 million in post-tax annual run-rate with FRE margins above 50%.\nSince its founding in 2006, GIP has successfully scaled its equity flagship series from its $5.6 billion fund 1 to $20-plus billion in the most recent vintages. GIP's current team of approximately 400 employees across 11 global offices has delivered strong long-term performance for clients and is expected to generate approximately $760 million of management fee revenue in 2023. Turning to the financial terms of the transaction, we are acquiring 100% of the business and assets of GIP for total consideration of $3 billion in cash and approximately 12 million shares of BlackRock stock. 7 million shares will be paid at closing, and 5 million shares to be paid in approximately 5 years subject to certain performance measures. BlackRock will fund the cash consideration through $3 billion of additional debt, which will not meaningfully change its leverage profile.\nPrimarily through growth synergies from proprietary deal origination, larger transaction sizes, capital formation scale, and multi asset class infrastructure investment innovation, we see opportunities to drive significant value creation for BlackRock shareholders. The terms of this transaction ensure long-term continuity and strong alignment of interest among GIP and BlackRock to best serve clients, employees, and shareholders. A substantial majority of the consideration paid at closing and approximately 75% of nominal total transaction consideration will be paid in BlackRock common stock. GIP leadership will become meaningful shareholders of BlackRock with a shared ambition of driving one BlackRock outcomes for our clients and shareholders. 100% of carried interest and capital commitments from all existing GIP funds will continue to be owned by the GIP owners and employees. These are not economically included in the transaction perimeter and support long-term retention and incentives of GIP employees.\nAfter closing, GIP's management team will lead our combined infrastructure platform working with BlackRock's strong investment teams in equity, debt, and solutions. The GIP team will bring a talented group of investments and operational improvement professionals with a proven track record of building and running high performing private markets businesses. Each of the GIP founders will become party to a shareholders agreement that requires shares to be voted in accordance with the recommendation of BlackRock's independent board at any meeting of BlackRock shareholders. We've provided additional detail on the transaction structure and terms in a supplement posted to the BlackRock Investor Relations website this morning. We expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to asset adjusted EPS and operating margin in the first full year post close which will exclude transaction related costs.\nGiven the structural growth trends of the private infrastructure market and what we see as a best-in-class whole-portfolio infrastructure investing capability, we believe the transaction will be accretive to long-term organic asset and base fee growth. These capabilities can be a key source of earnings diversification and growth acceleration to meet or exceed our through-the-cycle 5% or better organic growth ambitions.\nBuilding on strong structural growth trends over this past year and the over $1.9 trillion of organic asset growth of the last five years, we're investing to deliver the industry's only comprehensive platform across public markets, private markets, and investment technology. Having delivered differentiated organic growth and operating margin across the weakest markets in decades, we believe markets are trending to be strong for 2024 with a more risk on tone. BlackRock is a share winner when assets are in motion. We see the pent up demand behind over $1 trillion in money market fund flows this year, poised to deliver significant opportunities across risk assets. Our combination with GIP will put BlackRock in a leadership position to drive great outcomes for clients and deliver new engines of earnings growth for our shareholders. We've built an industry leader in structural growers like ETFs, model portfolios, outsourcing, and investment technology.\nWith Aladdin, we're building a private markets leader at new levels of scale and we see the best opportunities we've had in years to get closer with clients and raise significant private capital. We enter 2024 in a stronger position than ever and all of us at BlackRock are excited about the opportunities ahead for our clients, the firm, and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back to Larry.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. We'll leave plenty of time for your questions later on, but I want to describe how we evaluated bringing our firms together with GIP, why we think the timing is so opportune, and how infrastructure private markets can be so beneficial to all our clients, employees, and to you, our shareholders.\nInfrastructure is a $1 trillion market forecasted to be one of the fastest growing segments of private markets. In the years ahead.\nA number of long-term structural trends support an acceleration in infrastructure investments. These include increasingly growing global demand and upgrading digital infrastructure like fiber broadband, cell towers, and data centers, renewed investments in logistical hubs such as airports, railroads, shipping ports, and supply chains are rewired, and a movement towards increased energy independence in many parts of the world supported by decarbonization infrastructure. In the United States and around the world, there's a public need for greater investment in infrastructure. This growing needs create significant investment opportunities for clients.\nThe unprecedented need for new infrastructure coupled with the record high government deficits means that private capital will be needed like never before.\nThat supply demand imbalance creates compelling investment opportunities for our clients. At the same time, corporates are looking to engage partners in new projects or partially de-risking existing ones. These dynamics offer clients, especially those investing for retirement, the high-coupon, inflation-protected, long-duration investments they need, and we believe it will define the future of asset management for the next 20 years.\nOur acquisition philosophy has always been about growth, not about cost takeouts and or consolidations. Consistently these combinations have resulted in reaching heights that neither BlackRock nor merged partners could ever reach on their own. I truly believe that this will be the case again with the integration of BlackRock Infrastructure and GIP.\nTransformational transactions have strengthened our firm, have strengthened our culture, and bringing top talent, new skills, and experience into our organization. Our culture has evolved as we welcome new teams and colleagues to BlackRock today. It represents a blending of the best parts of the cultures that have come together over the years.\nWhat's made our acquisition so successful was our steadfast commitment to a one BlackRock culture, totally connecting to our clients with one platform, shared goals, a common Aladdin technology, and, as a result, BlackRock is greater than the sum of any one part, and then that drives BlackRock's differentiating growth model.\nReaching this moment is quite personal and emotional for me. Our firms BlackRock and GIP have similar origin stories. We founded BlackRock on understanding investment risks and the factors and forces driving returns initially in fixed income and then across the equity markets and then globally. We wanted to help long-term investors better manage their risk in their portfolios in a scaled way through technology. That is what drove our early investments in Aladdin and all the investments we made since to enhance our understanding of risk factors to deliver superior outcomes for our clients. GIP started with a similar focus in the infrastructure space, understanding operational risks and the factors and forces driving business efficiencies. Like BlackRock's focus on understanding risk and fixed income, GIP built an active approach to analyzing and addressing operational risk.\nMy partners and I had the privilege of pioneering the mortgage-backed securities market. Bayo and his GIP partners, in my opinion, pioneered modern infrastructure investing in private markets, and many of the BlackRock and GIP founders grew up in the same firms early in their careers where we created common roots.\nSome shared experiences, most of them good, sometimes bad, and close client relationships.\nThe integration of BlackRock's existing infrastructure platform with GIP will result in a market-leading comprehensive infrastructure business with truly differentiated origination and asset management capabilities. GIP will be highly complementary and has limited overlap by client and investment programs with BlackRock's existing leading franchises. These include diversified infrastructure, infra debt, infra solutions, climate infrastructure, and decarbonization partners. BlackRock has invested originally and has invested organically and inorganically in growing our infrastructure platform which has $50 billion in AUM, having tripled since our acquisition of First Reserve in 2017. BlackRock has already demonstrated our access to some of the largest pools of capital in the world. We're winning deals like ADNOC pipeline transaction and being chosen to partner with sovereign wealth funds and governments on significant climate infrastructure strategies.\nWe have the sourcing capabilities, but greater AUM scale will enable us to have more sizable positions. The planned combination of GIP with BlackRock will accelerate investment scale, enabling us to grow faster. BlackRock's deep relationships with clients, corporates, governments, and sovereign wealth funds can accelerate investment opportunities.\nGIP's own lending proprietary deal flow leading proprietary deal flow has been supported by investment sizes, relationships, and strong track record, including a long history of successful JVs with large industrial partners. GIP's deals span the world and sectors. Their investments include Gatwick Airport, Edinburgh Airport, Sydney Airport, CyrusOne data center, the Port of Melbourne, and several other major renewable platforms.\nThrough the future combination of BlackRock and GIP, we'll be able to connect our clients with bigger and better opportunities while also accelerating growth, diversifying revenues, and generating earnings for our shareholders. Like Rob and I, Bayo and his partners are all founders. We're excited about the opportunity to have new partners and new colleagues. I'm proud that the consideration of this transaction consists of approximately 75% of BlackRock stock. GIP founders will become among the largest shareholders of BlackRock, and we plan to have Bayo join our Board of Directors post closing of our transaction.\nThere is no question spiritually or financially about whether we are long-term partners. We have the same interests as significant shareholders alongside our broader shareholder base. Our one BlackRock culture has been central to our success over the last 35 years, and cultural alignment has been core throughout our history of successful M&A. From our founding to today. Our firm is purpose-driven, focused on clients, focused on risk management, and powered by data and technology.\nBringing our two businesses together results in an influx of top senior private market talent to BlackRock. GIP founders will lead our combined infrastructure platform with teams of talented investors and business builders. They bring with them a strong investment and performance culture and a commitment to working across one BlackRock.\nI'm confident we'll be looking back on today as another transformational moment in the BlackRock history in a similar way when we can look back at our acquisition of BGI, Merrill Lynch Investment Management, and our early days building Aladdin.\nOur ability to adapt and to evolve and to grow has generated a total return of 9,000% for our shareholders since our IPO in 1999. That is well in excess of our S&P return of 490% and representative of the business model serving all our stakeholders. I truly believe we're better positioned than ever before in our history, and I'm very optimistic on the coming years ahead and the opportunities ahead for all of us. BlackRock was built on optimism. When we founded BlackRock, we knew clients would be at the center of everything we do.\nWe had a deep conviction in the long term growth and the importance of the capital markets in principle and practice. Those beliefs remain core to BlackRock. Today.\nWe are more connected to our clients than ever. Thousands of clients on behalf of millions of individuals around the world have entrusted BlackRock with $1.9 trillion of net new business over the last five years. Thousands more use our technology to support the growth and commercial agility of their own business. Years of organic growth alongside a long-term growth of the capital markets underpins our $10 trillion of client assets which grew in 2023 by over $1.4 trillion.\nIn good times and bad times, whether investors are adding or reducing risk, our consistent industry leading organic growth demonstrates that clients are consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock.\nIn 2023, our clients awarded us with $289 billion in net new assets. During this period of rapid change and significant portfolio de-risking.\nBlackRock's differentiated business model has enabled us to continue to grow with our clients and maintain positive organic base fee growth. We've grown regardless of the market backdrops and even as most of the industry has experienced outflows.\nI think back to 2016 and 2018 when uncertainty and cautious sentiment impacted investment behaviors among institutional and individuals. Many clients de-risked and moved to cash. BlackRock stayed connected with our clients. We stayed rigorous in driving investment performance, innovating new products, technologies, and providing advice on portfolio design. Once clients were ready to move more actively, stepping back into the markets, they did it with BlackRock, leading to new record flows for client flows and organic base fee growth at or above our targets. As we've seen before, when investors were ready to put money back to work, they did it with BlackRock. Flows and organic base fee growth accelerated at the end of the year. We generated $96 billion in total net inflows in the fourth quarter, and we entered 2024 with great momentum.\nI spent much of 2023 on the road meeting with clients around the world, and I plan to do the same thing in 2024 starting this month. Our partnership approach and the performance we deliver is resonating both in markets where we have a long-standing presence and those where our profile is just beginning and strengthening.\nCompanies and clients increasingly want to work with BlackRock. For companies where we are investors, they appreciate that we are a long term consistent capital. We invest early and stay invested through cycles. Whether it's debt or equity, pre-IPO or post-IPO, companies recognize the uniqueness of our global relationships, our brand, and our expertise across businesses, markets, and industries. This makes us a very valuable partner and in turn enables us to be involved in their sourcing and in performance that we provide for our clients.\nFor example, in November our diversified infrastructure franchise invested $550 million in Stratos, a commercially scaled direct air capture facility in Texas, which is expected to be the largest in the world upon completion. Through our fund's joint venture partner Occidental Petroleum, we are providing our clients with investment access to a bespoke energy infrastructure project. This is just the latest example of our sourcing and execution on numerous distinctive deals for clients over the last 18 months. In the United States, we partnered with AT&T on Gigapower JV and invested in Jupiter Power. Beyond the US, examples include such investments in Brasol in Brazil, AirFirst in South Korea, Akaysha Energy in Australia, and Lake Turkana Wind Power in Kenya, just to name a few.\nLast month we announced an innovative partnership with Alterra that we will see a $2 billion investment.\nIn the climate opportunity across BlackRock's private debt and infrastructure equity strategies. This is one of our largest ever private markets mandates. It adds on to our very strong track record investing in the transition, including in emerging markets, and extend our over $100 billion transition investment platform.\nBlackRock's global network of relationships, data analytics, and flexible adaptable capital means we could source unique deals for our clients and mobilize assets and accelerate innovation and economic growth. Our active investment insights, our expertise, our strong investment performance similarly differentiate BlackRock markets. We saw nearly $60 billion active net inflows in 2023 compared to industry outflows across our active franchise. BlackRock has delivered durable investment performance with 87% and 92% of fundamental equity and taxable fixed income AUM above benchmarks or peer median. For the past five-year period.\nIn ETFs, BlackRock generated an industry-leading $186 billion of net inflows for 2023. Our long-term leadership of the ETF industry is another testament to our global platform and our deep connectivity with our clients. BlackRock is the most scaled, diversified ETF provider in the US and globally. We are bringing the ETF benefits of liquidity, of price discovery, and market efficiencies, and access to investors around the world.\nNearly half of the 2023 iShares net inflows were from ETFs listed internationally in local markets. Led by our European iShares net inflows of $70 billion. BlackRock has the number one share of the European ETF market where industry flows were up 70% in 2023. Catalyst trends that we saw in the US years ago, like the growth of the fee-based advisory and model controllers, are just beginning to take root in Europe.\nBlackRock takes a client first approach to product innovation and we continue to develop products that are suited for the new investment regime. For example, we launched 19 active ETFs in 2023 leveraging the benefits of the ETF structure to help clients reach the outcomes they seek.\nSome of these strategies provide access to the insights of our active portfolio managers such as Rick Rieder and Tony DeSpirito. Others use an option strategy to generate income or provide greater downside protection such as our BuyWrite and buffer ETFs. In the fourth quarter we launched a series of LifePath target date ETFs to provide an easier way to save for retirement, especially for the many Americans who lack access to a workplace retirement plan.\nJust yesterday the iShares Bitcoin ETF began trading in another landmark moment that advances ETF innovation and expands access to Bitcoin for investors. We will continue to provide more convenient and cost-effective investment access across asset classes through innovation, through risk management, and technology.\nAladdin is the operating system uniting all of BlackRock and is fundamental and foundational to how we serve our clients across our platform. It is the key technology that powers BlackRock and it also powers many of our clients. The need for integrated data, integrated risk analytics, and the whole portfolio views across public and private markets is driving the ACV growth of Aladdin.\nIn 2023, we generated $1.5 billion in technology service revenues. Clients are looking to grow and expand with Aladdin, reflecting in strong harvesting activities. With over 50% of the Aladdin sales being multi-product.\nThrough its dynamic ecosystem of over 130,000 users, the Aladdin platform is constantly in the state of innovation. Investments in Aladdin AI copilots, enhancements in openness, supporting ecosystem partnerships, and advancing whole portfolio solutions including private markets and digital assets are going to further augment the value of Aladdin for our clients. We led our industry by both being an agent for and adapting to change. Our best years have followed tough years. Just as we continue to innovate and evolve our business to stay ahead of our clients, we are also evolving our organization and evolving our leadership team.\nAs Martin mentioned, we undertook restructuring efforts that were designed to ensure we are aligning resources to our greatest growth opportunities and client needs. As part of this, a number of valued clients, valued colleagues, and friends departed the firm.\nWe truly appreciate the contributions that they made to BlackRock and wish all of them well.\nWe are continuing to anticipate what clients need and shaping BlackRock so they could be getting our insights, our solutions, and the outcomes that they expect from us.\nAs we look ahead. The re-risking of client portfolios will create tremendous prospects for both our public and private market franchises. These are the times where investors are making wholesale changes to the way they build portfolios and BlackRock is leading the way in helping investors build the portfolio of the future, one that integrates public markets and private markets, and it's digitally enabled. We view that these changes are a big catalyst for BlackRock. We set ourselves up to be a structural grower in the years ahead with a diversified platform we built.\nThe need for integration, data technology, and risk management will continue to drive demand for Aladdin. BlackRock was founded on the belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets. Our success has been shaped by a number of those calls and how we would evolve. Our client needs have always been our compass as we listen to them. Today, we have our eyes on themes we believe that will define the next decade of asset management. The continuing of blurring the lines across product structure, the unprecedented need for new infrastructure driving inflation-protected current cash flow, long-duration returns, the accelerating capital markets, and asset management industry around the world.\nWe are positioning ourselves ahead of these transformations by making three major changes in how we work and how we deliver for each and one of our clients. First, we're creating a new strategic global product and solution business that will work across all our investment strategies, asset classes, fund structures, while enabling our ETF and index business across the firm. We have always viewed ETFs as a technology that facilitates investing, and just as Aladdin technologies has become core to asset management, so has have ETFs. That's why we believe in embedding our ETFs and index businesses across the entire firm, and that will accelerate further growth of iShares and every investment strategy within BlackRock.\nWe are looking to the future, and we believe that ETF revolution that iShares led will only continue to accelerate as our clients turn to BlackRock for ETFs as a preferred vehicle for investing in strategies of all types. If you can make an ETF for a Bitcoin, my gosh, you can make an ETF for anything. Second, we are creating a new international business structure to provide a unified leadership to allow us to be simultaneously more global but much deeper local in fast-growing international markets. BlackRock has been a central player in the growth of the global capital markets, and this is including the developing of retirement solutions in every market around the world and bringing the benefits of ETFs to every market to assist them in growing their markets.\nAnd third, we are realigning our private markets business to further leverage the potential of GIP and to meet the growing needs of our clients for infrastructure and other private market investments.\nAll of us at BlackRock have a lot of hard work and a lot of exciting work ahead of us. We have a track record of quick, intense, and successful integrations. We'll be more nimble and aligned with clients through our new architecture and with the aim to be delivering better experiences, better performance, and better outcomes for all of our clients worldwide. I see excitement and incredible amount of energy in our offices. While there's a lot of hard work to come, there really is a bright future for all of us ahead of us. Over the past few months we've seen decidedly more positive sentiment and tone in markets and among clients that are very optimistic will carry into 2024, and once again we look forward to beginning this next BlackRock chapter with our new partners and colleagues at GIP.\nWe enter 2024 with $10 trillion of our clients' money. We enter the year with strong growth momentum, and we enter 2024 as an organization positioned in the future for growth and prosperity.\nAt BlackRock we are energized by a can-do attitude and today I really feel that we're just getting started. I see greater opportunity for BlackRock, I see greater opportunity for our clients, and I see great opportunities for our shareholders today, tomorrow, and stronger than ever before.\nLet me open up for questions. As I mentioned, Bayo will also participate in the Q&A. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time I'd like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you do ask a question, please take your phone off its speaker setting and use your handset. To avoid any potential feedback, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, please re-enter the queue. Pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster.\nYour first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning Craig. Happy New Year.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nManaging Director and Head of Diversified Financials, BofA Securities / Bank of America\n\nHey, good morning Larry. Happy New Year to you too and. Hope everyone's doing well, and congrats on the deal.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nCraig Siegenthaler\n\nManaging Director and Head of Diversified Financials, BofA Securities / Bank of America\n\nMy question is actually on the GIP deal. So this is a high quality business, strong track record, it's big enough to go public, stay independent, but they chose BlackRock and they decided to take stock. So I imagine growth synergies were a driver. So my question is really on the strategic rationale. How can BlackRock's global distribution platform accelerate their growth? And do you see specific client segments? And I'm thinking private wealth where you see low-hanging fruit?\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.",
    "content2": "Great question. I think it will be answered by me and Bayo. Let me once again go over the strategic rationale.\nAs I said in my prepared speeches and I think Bayo would echo everything I'm going to be saying. We're just beginning, I would say. A very bright investment horizon for infrastructure.\nAs I said, deficits matter. More and more governments are going to have more difficulties to do deficit financing, and in turn, more and more governments are even focusing on doing more public-private. I think GIP's success in the UK and Australia are very good examples of working with governments in terms of helping them.\nSell assets but at the same time using the private sector to improve the quality of services. And GIP has been a leader in that. I believe the amount of capital that is going to be needed as we digitize everything, the need for upgrading our electrical power grids worldwide is a must. The capital associated with that is going to be enormous. In my travels around the world, more governmental leaders are talking about the need for energy, energy independence.\nThey look if they have some form of energy; they're going to be trying to be doing more of that. But more importantly, or just as importantly, the amount of capital they need to develop more decarbonizing investments in wind and solar to provide.\nBroader energy for their growth in their economies is very important if we are going to decarbonize the world. Amount of capital and infrastructure is going to be very necessary if we are going to be more and more relying on interconnectivity worldwide. The need for the upgrading of ports is vital. As more and more human beings grow into a middle class lifestyle, the demand for air travel grows dramatically. The need for high quality airports grows dramatically. And so that's just one segment. And then when you think about corporations.\nCorporations historically disposed of divisions through private equity. We see more corporations instead of disposing divisions, selling portions of those divisions, maybe keeping a major part of that, selling parts of their infrastructure or partnering with companies in their infrastructure like the deal we did with Occidental Petroleum for direct air capture, the transaction BlackRock did with AT&T on 5G build out across the United States. These are just a few examples. Pipelines in the Gulf region.\nThe industrial logic is pretty large in our opinion that the next 10 years is going to be greatly about the expansion of the global capital markets in infrastructure. We believe that the demand for capital and infrastructure is only going to grow larger and larger. As I said a few times in my prepared remarks, having a long duration, high coupon inflation-protected asset is a very strong asset class for all the retirement funds. But importantly, as you mentioned, wealth, we believe a great opportunity to providing to the wealth management products these types of products so they can enjoy these type of long duration assets. They're going to throw off these above what I would say public market returns. I believe across the board sovereign funds.\nBoth retirements, both in the defined contribution space and the defined benefit space across the board. These are the preferred instruments. In my calls with clients today, I could tell you more and more sovereign wealth funds see infrastructure as a major growth area in their asset allocation. I'm going to let Bayo talk about BlackRock and us. I would only just say from the BlackRock side we only had one target. We only had one organization where we believed in their business model. It was only one organization where we believe we had such complementary skill sets. And then most importantly, it's a team of leaders under Bayo that we believed in and we believe that will create real opportunities for BlackRock.\nI'm pleased that Bayo will be joining the BlackRock board post closing, and importantly, we look forward to having the intellectual capital that GIP is bringing alongside our superb team and infrastructure.\n\nBayo Ogunlesi\n\nFounder and CEO, Global Infrastructure Partners\n\nWell, what I'll add to that is I think Larry is exactly right. We are about to be in the golden age of infrastructure investing. And so the question for us at GIP was always how do we accelerate what we've done. We could have kept trying to do what we were doing by ourselves. But we thought that looking at it from both point of view, from the point of view of infrastructure investing, Larry is right. There are tremendous tailwinds that are going to drive the demand for private capital infrastructure investing on our client side. The pension funds, the sovereign wealth funds, the asset managers, infrastructure is what they want to invest in. They like the fact that infrastructure has very high yields. The average yield on our mature funds over the last 15 years, annual yield 8%.\nOkay.That's in a world of zero interest rates generating 8% a year. They like the fact that these assets are uncorrelated to other asset classes. Think about what's going on today. Infrastructure assets are doing very well. We have 19 companies in our flagship funds. 12 of them had double digit asset EBITDA growth last year. Five of them single digit EBITDA growth. The only one that didn't was because it sold assets. Compare that to the other real asset class, commercial real estate.\nOkay.So investors love the fact that these asset classes are not correlated. They like the fact there's a lot of downside protection, right, because they provide essential services.\nOkay. And so these are all sort of congruences that we thought, how do we accelerate what we're doing? And the marriage with BlackRock is a marriage made in heaven. Rob Kapito said this is a deal where one plus one equals four. I'm not sure whether it's three or four, but I know Rob is directionally correct. Okay. When we look at the two businesses, they're very complementary. BlackRock has built a terrific infrastructure business. They've tripled the size of it over the last years that they've owned it. But they make mid-market or mid-cap investments. We make large-cap investments. They have a terrific infrastructure debt business. It's mostly investment grade. Ours is mostly below investment grade. They have a capital solutions business that we don't have.\nSo if you put these two businesses together, we can go to clients, large-cap clients, mid-cap clients, offer them a complete array of solutions. You want investment-grade debt. We've got it. You want high investment-grade debt. We've got it. Okay. And so we think this will allow us to accelerate the rate at which we can provide investment opportunities to our clients. And look, it's always nice to think you're right. The proof of the pudding is what people say when you call them. As Larry mentioned, he and I have been on the phone with our clients, and this is what they've said, this is a fantastic transaction. One for us as clients, two for BlackRock, and three for GIP. Now, I wish I had known they put BlackRock ahead of GIP because then I would have asked for a higher price.\nBut you know, it's all worked out very well. And I think the other thing people should recall is, and I hope Martin and Larry don't mind me saying this, we are taking 75% of the consideration stock. The initial offer from BlackRock was actually a low, modest stock. We like the fact that BlackRock thinks their stock is undervalued. And the fact that we are taking 75% in BlackRock stock tells us we also think it's undervalued. And the final thing I'd say is we actually looked at what Larry has talked about how the culture is very different. I think that's absolutely true. But we've also looked at what BlackRock has actually done when it has acquired businesses.\nInteresting congruence iShares BGI 3 trillion assets. When they bought it today, 10.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nBillion.\n\nBayo Ogunlesi\n\nFounder and CEO, Global Infrastructure Partners\n\nOh, $2 billion.\nOkay. So now it's 3.5 billion. Okay. Trillion.\nOkay. So that's actually a little scary. Infrastructure, they've tripled the size. So it's clear to me the subliminal message is we have to at least triple the size of our infrastructure portfolio going forward. I hope that answers your question.\n\nOperator\n\nWell, the next to Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nHappy New Year. Michael.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\n\nHey, good morning. Happy New Year. Congratulations on the transaction. Just curious, what are the plans for integration? If you could talk about that a bit, and any particular lessons that you take away from other private market transactions, acquisitions that we've seen across the industry as you think about driving success here.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike.Happy New Year. We have a really strong track record of successful integrations at BlackRock, and we believe this transaction will prove to be another success. I think Larry and Bayo spoke very much about the common cultures, the shared vision, the opportunities, and the growth with clients. We know that GIP shares the same laser focus on clients and values that we do. Rigorous investment process in the US and the structuring. The transaction was also done to reduce strain on teams and help facilitate the transition into new leadership in a more diversified platform. Some of the organizational changes that we also announced today are going to help us be more nimble and aligned with our clients. We've reorganized businesses for the future with the aim of delivering better experience, performance, and outcomes for clients.\nThe thing I'd add is Larry talked about in his prepared remarks our integrated operating platform. He talked about our track record in integrations. We have built our private markets business with substantial inorganic activity going back all the way to the early 2000s. We built a lot of the existing infrastructure business that we have today also through inorganic transactions that have been successfully integrated. We've been doing this for 10 years in the infrastructure space and look forward to accelerating it with Bayo, his partners, and the entire GIP team who have substantial experience in business building and alternatives.\nAnd the last thing I'll say just about integration is I think in many ways this is a less complex integration in that these are highly complementary platforms Bayo just talked you through, in terms of some of the differences in investing acumen and solutions on the equity side, on the debt side. And so in many ways we have limited amounts of overlap both in clients as well as in the characteristic of our investment solutions. In many ways that makes the integration, I think, nimble and easier to position with clients and more agile for us to bring the platforms together.\nLet me just add one thing. Bayo and I are going to be on the road a lot and we are going to.\nWith the combined organization, we have an amazing story, and we are going to be telling everybody the story from the corporation sides to government. I just got an email from a big government saying, okay, there are things we could do more. So that was a nice email that I just received. But I do believe our key is making sure our clients, the investors that are invested in BlackRock and GIP, that they understand the merits of the combination and that they think this is even better for them. And our job is make sure that everybody sees it and we execute that way.\nWe are very excited about this, and I look forward to being on the road with Bayo.\n\nOperator\n\nWelcome next to Michael Brown with KBW.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nMichael, happy New Year.\n\nMichael Brown\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods\n\nHi, good morning.\nThank you.\nHappy New Year to you as well. Maybe I'll just transition to the organic growth outlook here as we think about 2024. Obviously, there's been a lot of optimism around the acceleration of the fixed income flows, and here with what seems to be a more visible interest rate trajectory. So, I wanted to hear about maybe some of your early conversations you're having with institutional clients regarding allocations and how you expect that to progress through 2024. And when you think about the fixed income inflows, where should we think about where that money will kind of shift from? Is it, is it from the money market funds or is it kind of the ownership of direct securities moving into funds or from bank deposits? Just love some commentary on that. Thank you Larry. Great, Mike. Smart. And. I'll start just on some of the organic growth outlook, and then Rob will talk a little bit about your specific fixed.\nIn 2023, obviously we delivered $289 billion of total net inflows and 1% organic base fee growth. You know, we continue to have conviction here in our 5% base fee target over the long term. We've reached it on average over the last five years and met or exceeded it in six of the last 10. And importantly, I think the way our shareholders evaluate us in years marked by significant market volatility, 2016, 2018, 2022, 2023, we generated positive organic base fee growth, and these last two years no doubt have been more challenged on base fee growth through tough markets. But we've continued to generate positive growth while the industry has seen decay. We don't aim, as you know, to be the fastest grower in any quarter or any year. We aim to deliver more consistent and durable organic growth through markets and over the long term.\nI would note we saw excellent momentum to finish Q4. As I mentioned in my remarks in November, December, we generated an annualized 6% organic base fee growth rate, and that to me suggests that we can trend towards our 5% through the cycle target as rates stabilize and the market's more constructive. This is some of the best organic base fee growth momentum we've seen since 2021. I do want to flag two things, the first of which is I'd particularly flag that iShares in Europe is really well positioned, and I think it's going to be a bigger part of the organic base fee growth story over time. European ETF industry flows are up 70% year on year.\nEuropean iShares had almost 50% flow market share, and a lot of the long-term trends that propelled the US industry to high growth rates are taking hold in Europe. So I think it's just the beginning. We also see this combination with GIP and the potential for higher management fee growth in illiquid alternatives as bolstering, diversifying our overall organic base fee growth trajectory. So I'll give it to Rob on fixed income.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nYes, I'll just add just two things, Mike. I wake up every morning salivating about the $7 trillion that's sitting in money market accounts that's waiting to move. And in order for it to move, you have to have a wide plate of products. That's what we have been developing in client solutions. A lot of this is going to come from money that's flowing into model portfolios, which we are the leader in. And a lot of it is going to come from digital wealth, which is a $17 trillion global market. It's growing at 15%. And ETFs are becoming the investor's preferred vehicle with access to investments. And then lastly, as we blend the active and passive business together, we're going to see a lot of active fixed income portfolios move into an ETF wrapper. We're the leader in ETF wrappers as well. So I think there's a huge, huge runway for fixed income. Really the wind is right behind. We're back for that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks.Good morning, Happy New Year, and also good afternoon.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, Brian.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGood morning.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nMaybe just to ask about the infrastructure, another angle of this, just your outlook. For. Fundraising over the next one to. Two years, given the products that you have, and your thoughts around the growth in that $760 million of related revenue, and maybe just the timing of. I think you have decided a successful fund of 2019 that was a $22 billion fund. So are you in the market now? For a fund or will soon be. Do you expect to exceed that? Then also just in that retail channel, the desire to create democratized infrastructure products for retail investors that have some liquidity features.\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks. I'll start and then I'm sure there'll be some additional color. First of all, clients continue very much to increase their allocations to illiquid alternatives in private markets. These are the client needs that drove our acquisition of eFront. They're the moves that bring us here today.\nWith GIP and the moves that we've made organically and inorganically to build market-leading alternative capabilities. At BlackRock, our alternatives client assets now total $330 billion, including liquid credit. Our private markets liquid alternatives have reached $166 billion in assets, with about $140 billion in fee-paying AUM, and private credit, private equity solutions, and infrastructure were the main drivers of Q4 and full-year flows, with $4 billion and about $14 billion, respectively. Since 2021, we've had excellent momentum in our private markets fundraising. We've raised approximately $96 billion of gross capital across our platform, and we continue to see good momentum with clients. We're building on vintages and strong track records so we can scale successor funds. We expect our primary growth drivers, as I said, over the next three to five years, to be infrastructure, credit, private equity solutions, where we built great franchises.\nWe continue to see terrific opportunities. Larry and Bayo have really talked about what some of these are, but I do think BlackRock has a durable competitive advantage that's been built through our public markets, relationships with global corporates, our advisory work with sovereigns in the public sector around the world, as well as our technology capabilities of the year and bringing together a lot of this public and private sector long-term objectives, efficiently moving capital, the key drivers of industrial transformation. That's often when BlackRock said its best. So we're very optimistic and energized by our capital formation opportunities, particularly with our new partners at GIP. And I think as Larry and Bayo said, they're both going to be traveling a lot.\nSo, I'm looking forward to how those sessions, I think, will help us grow together, but importantly, I think, really bring innovative solutions to corporates through partnerships and unique public-private opportunities for us that will help grow our illiquid alternatives space, fees, and assets.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGIP is in the final stages of raising a very large fund which because it's.\nIn the stages of raising the money, we cannot talk about it. So, stand by. But it's in the late stages of fundraising.\n\nRob Kapito\n\nPresident, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThe other thing is that we are very good at structuring product for the individual investor, the wealth investor. And I'm looking forward to working with Bayo's team to figure out how our teams can get together and democratize those investments. Because as Larry mentioned before, this is such a perfect retirement product. Long duration, good yield, equity upside. It's going to open up new areas of growth that we have not tapped yet.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Brennan Hawken of UBS.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nBayo Ogunlesi\n\nFounder and CEO, Global Infrastructure Partners\n\nGood morning Brennan. How are you? Happy New Year.\n\nBrennan Hawken\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, UBS\n\nHappy New Year.\nCurious question on the deal here.\nIs this a deal that you would consider transformational, or is this more indicative of a desire to continue to add more all its capabilities going forward? And then one just sort of a little bit more granular. The roughly $400 million in FRE is based on 2024 forecasts, from what I can understand. Can you give maybe an indication about where GIP's FRE was for 2023?\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brennan, for the question. It's Martin. First of all, this is unassailably a transaction that we consider transformational. Most definitely our clients feel its transformation. The volume of emails I can see on Larry's screen suggests to me that it's transformational, and what we've talked about is transformational transactions. It's transformational in terms of the capabilities that BlackRock has and can offer to clients, and it's transformational in terms of the financial and earnings impact to the firm. So those two axes are how we've always measured transformational in terms of our capabilities and in terms of the financial impact. And on both fronts this is definitely a transformational transaction. GIP has generated really strong performance as well as FRE growth. I'm not going to comment on the 2023. It will let the 2024 speak for itself.\nBut we continue to see great growth opportunities in terms of being able to expand fee-paying AUM across the illiquid alternatives platform, with infrastructure as a priority, as well as growing base fees in a way that adds to our 5% organic growth objective through the cycle.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nLet me just add on some of our small and large transformational deals. Transformational deals could be as large as. A BGI transaction. But if you remember, everyone, when we did that transaction, most people hated it. They did not see the merits, did not see the marriage of active and passive, did not think cultures can merge, did not understand ETFs as a technology. As Bayo was saying earlier, when we bought BGI it was under $300 billion in iShares assets and now it's over $3.5 trillion.\nIn the past 10 years. We acquired First Reserve when it had about $3 billion and it's more than tripled its assets in a number of years. In terms of infrastructure, just recently we acquired GIP and the assets are 95% since we acquired.\nAnd then just as importantly in Technology, buying eFront, we made a statement that whole portfolio analytics are going to become very important, not just public market analytics. And we are now the leading technology platform both in privates and publics. And you dovetail. All of this is, you know, it's all wrapped around our global view where the global capital markets are doing the technology needs for markets and the movement. And I do believe all of this is going to be playing out. As I said in my prepared remarks, I truly believe infrastructure and Bayo reconfirmed that infrastructure is at the very beginnings and the great need of capital, and because of the type of asset it is, the demand for this type of investment is really going to be strong.\nWe believe, and this is what our statement is, we believe the next 10 years is going to be a lot about infrastructure and this will become more and more of a major component of the entire private markets ecosystem.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, Patrick.\n\nPatrick Davitt\n\nSenior Analyst, Autonomous Research\n\nGood morning everyone. Happy New Year. How's it going? You guys have been pushing this idea. That the $7 trillion in money funds will start to rotate into risk assets for a while now. But the historical data we can see. From past Fed cycles does not really show that, at least from what we can see. It looks like last year's flows maybe came more from the bank deposits than risk positions.What are you seeing, maybe that? We can't see that suggests this cycle will be different. If rates really are higher for. Longer, can't both money funds and bonds win with $17 trillion still sitting in bank deposits? Thanks.\n\nRob Kapito\n\nPresident, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nYeah, so it's Rob here. So the answer is it's going to be dependent upon rates and alternative investments. So I think history shows when the cycle stops, that's when people first start to re-risk. We saw about $40 billion come out of money market funds to us as people re-risk and then there's market volatility and it stops. So I think we have to get to what people will feel is the end of the cycle in rates. And then people will look, the benefit for us is then when they re-risk they usually come into more precision investments which are higher fee type investments and yield really matters. So I think if you look at it, there's a blurring between the bank deposits and the money markets all dependent upon rates. But once that cycle stops, and it's been a start and stop over the last year at least, especially in the fourth quarter, but that's how we look at it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next, but will be our last question, comes from Bill Katz from TD Cowen.\n\nBill Katz\n\nSenior Analyst and Asset Managers, TD Cowen\n\nOkay, thank you and good morning everybody.\nThank you, Larry.\nHappy New Year to you and the team, and congrats on the transaction. Sorry, my phone cut out a little earlier today. The hazards of working from home. So I missed a little bit of the Q&A earlier on. Maybe for Martin, perhaps just a little technical question at this point as you sort of model out the modest accretion as you look forward. I was just sort of wondering how do the economics on the performance fees work? It looks like you're keeping about 40% of the incremental opportunity. Wonder if you could sort of give us a sense of what kind of returns GIP has put up over time and how does that flow down to performance fees?\nAnd then I would presume that as part of the guidance that this new fund that they're in the market for now that Larry just intimated is going to be coming shortly would be part of the economics. And then when you say greater than the 50% FRE margin, can you sort of give us a little more sense on that? Can you try to back into the fee rate as well as the absolute margin?\n\nMartin Small\n\nCFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks Bill. I'm sorry your phone wasn't working, so.\nIt's great to hear from you.\nHappy New Year.\nSo as we said, you know, we expect the transaction to be modestly accretive to EPS and operating margin in the first full year post close. We expect it to be accretive to long-term organic asset and base fee growth over time. We are adding, we expect to be adding pro forma $400 million plus post-tax margin-accretive FRE as a result of the transaction. The transaction structured so that we're acquiring 100% of the assets and business of GIP. So all of the future management base fees will be within the transaction perimeter, and that's where we derive our estimates for the 2024 and beyond FRE growth in the business. In terms of thinking about the fee rates, the fee rates are relatively comparable overall to the BlackRock illiquid alternatives, but think north of 100 basis points in terms of how you're modeling that out.\nAs you noted in the deck that we posted to the investor relations website, the transaction is that GIP owners and employees are keeping 100% of the carried interest for existing GIP funds, and future funds will be 60% to the GIP teams and 40% to BlackRock. I'm not going to talk about fundraising or future funds, but we would expect those performance fees to come on in later years, not in the near term given the trajectory for how vintages come on, and we'd expect improvement in the fee related earnings growth over the next two years. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and for your interest in BlackRock. Our fourth quarter and full year performance is a direct result of our steadfast commitment to serving clients and evolving for our long term needs of our clients. Our acquisition of GIP and the organizational changes will be transformational in accelerating our growth ambitions and delivering value for our clients and for our shareholders. Hopefully everyone could hear that we are incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead of us, the opportunity of having partners like Bayo and his team, and we believe we have never been in a stronger position to grow with the global capital markets and to grow.\nIn being a very large client-serving firm and helping our clients meet their future needs. Everyone have a very good quarter and try to enjoy it as much as possible. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect it.\n\nLaurence?Fink\n\nChairman and CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nSam.\nSa.\nSa."

My name is Cynthia, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions]\nMr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nGeneral Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.\nAs you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Small\n\nSenior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2023. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.\nRate hikes over the last 18 months mean that for the first time in nearly 20 years, clients can earn a real return in cash. In the short term, this has benefited many portfolios. Investors have been able to generate positive returns while waiting for inflation to cool and for more policy certainty from central bankers. This weighting has weighed on industry flows, including here at BlackRock, consistent with prior periods of policy uncertainty like 2013, 2016 and 2018.\nAt September sub-reserve meeting, central bankers decided to pause keeping the policy rate steady, but communicated forward guidance that interest rates will stay higher for longer. We think this is good news. It begins to offer investors more clarity about time frames and entry points into fixed income and equities and a path to rerisking global investment portfolios.\nAt BlackRock, we never pause. We've used this period of investor portfolio redesign to stay close to our clients. We're providing insights, advice and solutions to help clients prepare to deploy assets following greater certainty on markets, terminal rates and the shape of the yield curve.\nClients entrusted BlackRock with $193 billion of total net inflows in the first 9 months of 2023, representing 3% annualized organic asset growth. While our clients' decisions to take advantage of safe haven cash as they redesign portfolios are reflected in our third quarter flows, clients are actively engaging to do more with BlackRock. We believe the long-term trend of clients consolidating business with fewer managers will be accelerated as a result of this period.\nThird quarter gross fund sales were 95% of average levels over the last 12 months and flows would have been meaningfully positive, excluding a $19 billion single client index redemption and $13 billion of market-related precision ETF net outflows. So client momentum remains strong.\nToday, we manage $9.1 trillion in assets for our clients. These units of trust are $1.1 trillion higher than a year ago. Revenues 5% higher, operating income is up 7% and earnings per share increased 14% over this time period. Powering these numbers are clients increasing use of BlackRock as a platform and staying within our ecosystem of capabilities, combining investment, technology and portfolio servicing to meet their specific business needs. This platform approach is driving our industry-leading organic growth over the long term. Market fluctuations and client risk appetite may temporarily lift or lower our AUM and revenues, but our focus remains on delivering BlackRock's platform to clients through access to unique opportunities, expertise and world-class client service.\nOur strategy is working. Clients are choosing to build bigger relationships with BlackRock. We've grown our asset base over the long term, with over $1 trillion of net inflows since the start of 2021 and over $300 billion of that in just the last 12 months.\nWe know our shareholders and clients have high expectations of BlackRock. We believe in our 5% organic base fee growth target over the long term, and we challenge ourselves to envision what it takes to rise above that target. We've said before that we don't strive to be the fastest grower in any given quarter but we continue to drive durable, consistent organic growth well above our peer group over the long term.\nThird quarter total net inflows were $3 billion, and included $49 billion of lower fee institutional index equity redemptions driven by client-specific index allocation changes. Institutional index equity represents less than 3% of BlackRock's total base fees. These lower fee strategies are often only a portion of our clients' overall relationships with BlackRock. For example, results included in the $19 billion redemption from a single client, but the clients working with us to extend its mandates and active strategies. Total quarterly annualized organic base fee decay of 2% reflected net outflows from higher fee precision ETFs and redemptions in active equity and retail liquid alternatives offerings.\nThird quarter revenue of $4.5 billion was 5% higher year-over-year, driven by organic growth, the impact of market and foreign exchange movements over the last 12 months on average AUM and higher technology services revenue. Operating income of $1.7 billion was up 7% year-over-year. Earnings per share of $10.91 increased 14%, also reflecting a lower effective tax rate partially offset by lower nonoperating income compared to a year ago. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 12%, reflecting $215 million of discrete tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $127 million of net investment gains driven primarily by noncash mark-to-market gains in the value of our private equity co-investment portfolio.\nThird quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.7 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM, positive organic base fee growth and higher securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 2%. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was approximately [ 2/10 ] of 1 basis points lower compared to the second quarter. This was due to lower securities lending revenue, underperformance of non-U.S. equity markets and changing client risk preferences favoring risk of lower fee exposures.\nAs a result of continued global equity and bond market depreciation toward the end of the third quarter, including the impact of FX-related dollar appreciation, we entered the fourth quarter with an estimated base fee run rate approximately 3% lower than our total base fees for the third quarter.\nPerformance fees of $70 million decreased from a year ago primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives.\nQuarterly technology services revenue was up 20% compared to a year ago, driven by sustained demand for our technology offerings. Current quarter Technology Services revenue also benefited from the impact of several large client renewals of their eFront on-premises licenses for which accounting treatment recognizes a majority of the revenue at time of renewal. Approximately half of the year-over-year Technology Services revenue increase resulted from these eFront contract renewals. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 10% year-over-year. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term, driven by demand for Aladdin's broadening technology capabilities and the growing value proposition it presents for clients.\nTotal expense was 4% higher year-over-year. Higher compensation and direct fund expenses were partially offset by lower distribution and servicing costs and G&A. At present, we expect full year 2023 core G&A to fall on the low end of our previously communicated guidance of a mid- to high single-digit percentage increase. In line with this outlook, we would also expect fourth quarter core G&A to reflect seasonal increases in marketing spend and execution of planned technology investment spend.\nOur third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 42.3% was up 30 basis points from a year ago, benefiting in part from the favorable impact of market movements on quarterly revenue over the last year. Our platform strategy has delivered scale and operating leverage through time, and we aim to be disciplined in driving profitable growth. We're prioritizing investments to propel our differentiated organic growth and drive operating leverage. We'll look to find more opportunities to variablize expenses, generate fixed cost scale through technology and automation and align investment spend with organic revenue growth potential.\nOur capital management strategy remains consistent. We invest first either to sale strategic growth initiatives or drive operational efficiency and then return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nDuring the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Kreos Capital, adding venture debt capabilities to our credit and private markets franchises. And earlier this week, we announced the minority investment as part of a strategic partnership with Upvest. Our M&A focus is on extending our capabilities in technology in private markets, tapping into revenue pools of adjacent industries and building scale. We repurchased 375 million worth of common shares in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least 375 million of shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous guidance in January.\nBlackRock had $3 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, which were impacted by $49 billion of low-fee institutional index equity redemptions. BlackRock was not immune to an overall slowing of investor activity, but we once again outperformed in what has been a challenging industry environment.\nMomentum in our ETF business continued with $29 billion of net inflows in the third quarter, led by core equity and fixed income ETF net inflows of $34 billion and $12 billion, respectively. Overall ETF flows were impacted by redemptions concentrated in certain market-driven precision and fixed income products.\nThe fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter of ETF flows for BlackRock, when we've seen, on average, 35% of our annual ETF net inflows. BlackRock typically has been a large beneficiary of ETF industry seasonality related to year-end rebalancing and tax planning. In line with these historical results, we'd expect to see an acceleration in iShare's ETF flows as we get closer to the end of 2023.\nWith Safe Haven cash providing positive returns, retail net outflows of $4 billion primarily reflected industry pressure in active equities and liquid alternatives, partially offset by continued strength in SMAs through Aperio. Institutional index net outflows of $36 billion reflected the previously mentioned low-fee index equity redemptions.\nOur institutional active franchise experienced $1 billion of net outflows primarily from active fixed income which was impacted by a handful of client-specific partial redemptions, including reinsurance activity. These outflows were partially offset by continued demand for our target date, illiquid alternatives and outsourcing capabilities. We've built our private markets capabilities across multiple years, and we continue to see strong demand for our illiquid alternative strategies. We generated nearly $3 billion of net inflows in the third quarter driven by infrastructure and private credit.\nWe're only seeing bigger and better private markets opportunities for BlackRock and for our clients. BlackRock's relationships across the world drive our differentiated deal flow. Deal flow alongside great teams with great tech and great data, meaning we can deliver differentiated investment performance and grow vintage over vintage. We're investing as we scale our private markets platform by using our financial strength to bridge successor funds, facilitate growing co-investments activity and seeding new fund launches. These investments can unlock future revenue and earnings potential for our shareholders.\nFinally, cash management net inflows were $15 billion in the quarter. Money market funds returned to earning yields not seen in nearly 2 decades. We're leveraging our scale and integrated cash offerings to engage with clients who are using cash, not only to manage liquidity, but also to earn attractive returns.\nThe current macro environment is causing some clients to pause, slowing overall activity in the asset management industry. Nevertheless, BlackRock has delivered positive organic asset and base fee growth over the last 12 months. We see significant opportunity to deepen relationships and consolidate our share with clients as they resume actively allocating assets. We're staying connected with our clients and positioning for what we believe can be massive growth unlocks.\nLooking ahead, we believe our platform strategy will continue to deliver for both our clients and shareholders, resulting in sustained market-leading organic growth, differentiated operating leverage and earnings in multiple expansion over time.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. Good morning, and thank you all for joining the call. I'd like to begin saying that our thoughts are with everyone who has friends, family or loved ones impacted by terrorist acts in Israel. The violence and the loss of innocent lives has been shocking and truly heart breaking. We at BlackRock will continue to do everything we can to support our colleagues and all our clients in the region.\nTurning to our results. Clients have always been at the center of BlackRock's growth strategy, I believe that BlackRock is better positioned today than ever before to help our clients achieve the long-term outcomes they need. We are having comprehensive conversations with clients globally on how we can partner with them to navigate on a new market regime and capitalize on investment opportunities.\nBlackRock is uniquely positioned in this environment to serve our clients with an integrated advisory, investment management and technology expertise something no other asset manager can provide.\nTo stay in organic growth with end market [ appreciation ] has led to a $1.1 trillion increase in BlackRock's AUM alongside margin improvement, and 14% growth in earnings per share over the last 12 months. Clients have entrusted us with over $300 billion in net inflows over the same time period.\nTechnology Service revenues increased 20% year-over-year, reflecting sustained demand for Aladdin and eFront renewals from several large clients. We remain committed to delivering differentiated organic growth and margin. We've invested ahead of major opportunities for BlackRock in private markets, technology and whole portfolio solutions. Through disciplined execution, we aim to both grow client assets and drive profitable growth, unleashing financial success for our clients alongside revenue and earnings power for our shareholders.\nStructural and secular changes in business models, technology and most of all, monetary and fiscal policy have made the last 2 years extremely challenging for traditional asset management. With the majority of industry players seeing outflows, BlackRock's differentiated business model has enabled us to grow consistently with our clients and maintain positive organic base fee growth since 2022.\nInvestors face continued uncertainty. The S&P saw its best start through July in 26 years, but retreated in August and September. Potential banks are being forced to keep policies tight as they lean against inflationary pressures. 2- and 10-year treasuries climbed to 16-year highs as investors anticipated rates remaining higher for longer. Rapid advancements in technology and artificial intelligence, the rewiring of globalization, the transition to a low-carbon economy, aging populations and a fast-evolving financial system where all macro trends clients are evaluating.\nAs market dynamics shift and uncertainty increases, clients are pausing to think about the future, assessing their options and seeking out BlackRock to take action. BlackRock's quarterly net inflows were not immune to an overall industry slowdown, as Martin discussed. Of course, I'm disappointed when we have softer flow quarters, but the long-term trend of clients consolidating more of their portfolio of BlackRock is only accelerating.\nRate hikes over the past 1.5 years, the fastest in the U.S. since the early 1980s have made cash not just a safe place, but now a very profitable place for investors to wait for the time being. In short investors are being paid to wait, something we haven't seen to this degree in years. Investors can earn 5% to 7% from conservative cash and bond portfolios. This dynamic reduces the near-term incentive to implement portfolio changes, resulting in temporarily slower client activity inflows. The degree to which investors have hunkered down in cash is shown by nearly $7 trillion in money market funds AUM across the industry.\nInvestors will eventually put that money to work. We've seen this dynamic before as recently as 2016 and 2018 when policy uncertainty and ability to earn yields and cash resulted in temporarily slowing in activity. Through these times, BlackRock stayed connected with our clients, connected across our businesses. And what immediately followed those periods in the past were new records for BlackRock client flows and organic base fee growth at or above 5% target.\nWe expect that investors will begin redeploying assets once there's a conviction in a terminal rate and the shape of the yield curve. We see that effect play out in prior cycles, most recently following the Fed pause in 2019 when flows rebounded, particularly in fixed income.\nBlackRock's integrated platform and deep long-standing relationships with clients position us to be a major beneficiary once flows return. We are the only asset manager delivering our Platform-as-a-Service. Clients entrust us with $9.1 trillion in assets, and we are serving them with excellence. We lead our industry in delivering accessibility, affordability and innovation.\nKinds of uncertainty are often when transformational opportunities emerge moments in our history like this have led to new ideas, led to new partnerships and acquisitions. BlackRock has a strong track record of successful transformational M&A. Most people think of BGI and [indiscernible] when I say that. But I also think of acquisitions like eFront and Aperio. They have been smaller in size, but we're also transformational in their own way. In both we anticipated and delivered on our clients' needs. We scaled strong existing technologies and build new revenue streams for our shareholders. Organic growth in Aperio has been over 20% since our acquisition and eFront revenues have grown nearly 50%, while also strengthening our value proposition and positioning in Aladdin and private markets.\nBlackRock has been a successful acquirer and today, advancements in tech and AI, scaling our private markets and more attractive valuations means BlackRock is once again becoming increasingly engaged and M&A trend discussions. What made our acquisition so successful was we're enduring to diffuse the best of the acquired companies into a stronger and faster growing 1, BlackRock, fully connecting all parts of the firm to our clients. We have a proven history of realizing long-term benefits in areas of expansion. Today, we're similarly connecting with our partners across markets to lay the groundwork for future growth.\nIn July, we announced an agreement to form Jio BlackRock, a 50-50 joint venture with Jio Financial Services. And Entity carved out our Alliance industries. India has been an integral part of the global platform, and BlackRock is 1 of the largest international investors in India today. And almost 15% of our colleagues are located across multiple offices in the country. India offers enormous opportunities. Jio BlackRock represents a powerful new partnership in a fast-growing market, where we see the potential to revolutionize India's asset management industry. We look forward to expanding our footprint with the ambition to improve the financial futures for millions of investors in India. BlackRock is working in India and markets around the world to lower the barriers to investing through accessible, affordable and transparent solutions.\nAnother example of the new growth opportunities is our partnership and agreement we announced last month for BlackRock to be the asset manager partner of Monzo. Monzo is the U.K.'s leading digital bank, and we are launching a new investment offering for their 8 million customers, since launched more than 250,000 Monzo clients have joined the waiting list for this new offering. And just earlier this week, we announced our partnership with Upvest to drive innovation in how Europeans access markets and make it cheaper and simpler to start investing. What we have seen in the markets after markets is that we can make investing easier and more affordable and we could quickly attract new clients. For first-time investors, the preferred way of investing is often through ETFs and specifically iShares. Through investment and innovation, we have evolved our iShares ETF franchise to meaningfully increase access to global markets. This includes access for tens of millions of new investors. It also includes access for our most seasoned clients to use our ETF technology to actively allocate across all types of markets. BlackRock's ETF platform delivers industry-leading performance, choice and scale.\nWith growing use cases, diversification and customization, ETFs and indexes are often an increasingly an important component of active management. Across our ETF, BlackRock generated net inflows of $29 billion in the third quarter and nearly $100 billion year-to-date. Flows in core equity and fixing ETFs were partially offset by redemptions in precision ETFs in August and September, something we expect and have seen before in risk-off environment as clients use our ETF to actively manage their portfolios. These tactical allocation tools are unique to BlackRock and they are high utilization reinforces the value proposition associated with iShare's strong secondary market liquidity, its unique options and lending markets.\nBlackRock's market-driven long-duration fixed income product were also an important tool for investors to rotate at a longer duration positions. The breadth of our ETF platform enables us to capture changes in client demand keeping investors within BlackRock. For example, iShare's treasury funds were 3 of the top 5 grossing bond ETFs in the industry, as investors shifted duration preferences in the quarter. Our market-leading levels of performance and liquidity helped our clients nearly reposition as market conditions evolve.\nAs we approach peak interest rates we expect the resurgence in fixed income flows with client capitalizing on higher yield. BlackRock is well positioned to benefit for this reallocation with our comprehensive $2.6 trillion fixed income platform. Going back to the period immediately following the [ Taper ] tantrum in 2013 or the Fed pause in early 2019, the industry saw a quick rebound in fixed income flows following rate stability. Both BlackRock ETFs and our active fixed income funds were large beneficiaries at that time.\nOur conversations with clients aren't about just active and just index. We work with clients to understand their investment challenges, helping them shape and execute strategic portfolio construction decisions. BlackRock is the only asset managers that can deliver outcomes in the context of clients' whole portfolios across market classes, asset classes, investment styles and in public and in private markets.\nOrganizations are turning to the private markets with greater frequency for their capital and financing needs, leading to bigger and better investment opportunities for BlackRock our clients. BlackRock's worldwide network of relationships with corporations and governments sourcing capabilities and a rigorous selection process helps us deliver unique solutions and drive performance for our clients across private market asset classes.\nIn the third quarter, we announced that BlackRock is partnering with the New Zealand government to launch an over $1 billion climate infrastructure strategy. BlackRock's decarbonization partners joint venture also reached $1 billion in committed capital for its first round and has now invested in 5 portfolio companies. These initiatives are a real example of BlackRock's long-standing relationship with clients and how we deliver the entirety of our platform to pioneer solutions and meet our clients' evolving needs.\nWe're also effectively scaling successor funds in private markets, delivering larger funds through raises of subsequent fund vintages. For example, we're on the tenth vintage of our flagship U.S. private lending fund. And we're in the market with a fourth vintage of our global diversified infrastructure equity fund series Infra 4, already raised $4.5 billion in initial investor commitments at close -- at the first close last year, achieving over half its targeted size. This is the next phase of successful scaling of the franchise. In 2020, our third fund in the series raised a total of $5 billion, surpassing the total assets of vintages 1 and 2 combined.\nStrong investment performance is critical to this momentum. Our flagship private equity fund currently stands at more than a 35% net IRR. We've seen double-digit net returns this year in our flagship private credit strategies. BlackRock's proprietary differentiated deal flow is what drives long-term investment performance and outcomes for clients. BlackRock's global network of relationships, data and analytics and flexible, adaptable capital needs we get sourced a unique deal for our clients, and we are increasingly finding that opportunity seek us as much as we seek opportunities. Companies went BlackRock as an investor and a partner recognizes the uniqueness of our global reach, our brand and our expertise across markets and industries.\nOur growing profile from investments around the world in the U.S. and Europe and Asia is leading to more and larger deal opportunities. BlackRock's global relationships and expertise in sourcing and underwriting portfolio and risk management and technology and analytics allow us to unlock unique deals for clients. At the same time, our growing momentum in private markets is delivering value for our shareholders through organic growth and less beta-sensitive revenues.\nYears ago, we anticipated how clients would benefit from alternative investments being evaluated inside a portfolio level of risk management framework. This led to the combination of eFront and Aladdin which has set a new standard in investment and risk management technology. The acquisition of eFront opened up a new segment of alternative GPs and asset services and most importantly, enable us to help clients across their whole portfolio. Our acquisition and integration of eFront continues to be transformational for clients. And we're seeing strong demand both as a stand-alone basis and for whole portfolio solutions across public and private assets.\nWe now have a data platform and business that covers 13,000 funds and over 150,000 assets, a significant portion of the private market fund universe. We're redefining the industry expectations of transparency in private markets. Nearly half of Aladdin's clients are leveraging our newer offerings, including eFront, which is a true competitive advantage in the tech market. And as Martin spoke to, you saw eFront's contribution reflecting in this quarter's tech results.\nInvestors and advisers are increasingly choosing a small number of scale technology platforms that offer everything in their ecosystem in 1 place. Aladdin worked seamlessly alongside other aspects of client investment processes and tech stack, serving as a foundation while enabling clients to create custom solutions to meet their specific needs. To get here, we also have developed deep integration with custodial banks with fund accountants, broker-dealers and other leading ecosystem partners. This flexibility and choice are just some of the reasons clients are entrusting us with the growing numbers of their portfolios.\nGoing forward, we are confident that clients will continue to turn to Aladdin to unify their investment management process. BlackRock's willingness to reimagine our business, our ambition to partner comprehensively with our clients and our drive to innovate ahead of their needs is translating into broader, into deeper relationships, and we see an incredible opportunity for us in front of us.\nWe remain intensely focused on staying close to our clients, especially during periods of market volatility and rising uncertainty. Clients are coming to us for advice, for solutions tailored to this macroeconomic environment, wanting to do more with BlackRock.\nHorizontal connectivity is critical. And our leadership team and an entire organization are coming together to differentiate ourselves in delivering for clients today and preparing to capture the money in motion we anticipate in the near future. As I've always done, I'm challenging our teams to continue to innovate and stay perpetually neurotic about staying in front of our clients. BlackRock will continue to lead in creating more access and connections between long-term investors, capital markets and the real economy. I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities I see for our clients and especially for BlackRock, which will then lead especially for you, our stakeholders.\nLet us now open it up for questions.",

My name is Katie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer; Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nGeneral Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.\nAs you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Small\n\nSenior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2023. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.\nAs a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated our definitions of as adjusted operating income, operating margin, nonoperating income and net income. The adjustments exclude the compensation expense impact of mark-to-market volatility associated with certain deferred cash compensation plans and the nonoperating impact of an economic hedge, which the company began in 2023. Clients entrusted BlackRock with an industry-leading $190 billion of net inflows in the first half of 2023. Our 9.4 trillion in assets, 9.4 trillion units of trust are up over $830 billion since year-end. This increase reflects continued strong organic growth and ongoing client confidence in the work that BlackRock is doing on their behalf as markets evolve.\nClients choose BlackRock for performance. We deliver durable long-term investment performance by executing on health opportunities, sourcing unique deals and managing risk. The foundation of a market-leading asset management platform is comprehensive, high-quality investment products with strong long-term investment performance. Investors and asset owners the portfolio goals and BlackRock enables them through our investment products and solutions. This is BlackRock's platform as a service in action. We bring together the entire firm to combine investment technology and portfolio servicing capabilities to meet clients' specific business needs. Our diversified platform strategy, backed by strong performance is powering our differentiated industry-leading organic growth. It's widening our growth premium as clients choose to do more with BlackRock, while much of the asset management sector faces continued outflows.\nClients are coming to BlackRock for performance and scale using our Platform as a Service to streamline and support the growth and commercial agility -- portfolio of BlackRock in both first half and second quarter net inflows were positive across regions, client types and active index. In the second quarter, BlackRock generated total net inflows of $80 billion representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 2% annualized organic base fee growth. Second quarter revenue of $4.5 billion was 1% lower year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of market movements over the last 12 months on average AUM mix. Operating income of $1.7 billion was down 3% year-over-year, while earnings per share of $9.28 was up 26%, reflecting meaningfully higher nonoperating income compared to a year ago.\nNonoperating results for the quarter included $158 million of net investment gains, driven primarily by noncash mark-to-market gains and the value of our private equity co-investment portfolio. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%. We continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nSecond quarter base and securities lending revenue of $3.6 billion was down 2% year-over-year and reflected the impact of underperformance on non-U.S. equity markets and fixed income market movements on our average AUM partially offset by higher securities lending revenue. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was up 3%, reflecting higher average AUM and securities lending revenue and the impact of one additional day in the second quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was 0.2 basis points lower compared to the first quarter, mainly due to divergent equity beta and changing client risk preferences. Performance fees of $118 million increased from a year ago, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid alternatives. Business momentum remains strong across our technology platform, with clients turning to Aladdin for business transformation and scale enablement.\nClients are increasingly partnering with BlackRock for integrated technology solutions and approximately half of our year-to-date mandates have been across multiple technology offerings such as combining eFront with core Aladdin. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 8% compared to a year ago, reflecting this demand, but also the impact of negative fixed income market movements over the last 12 months on client positions on Aladdin.\nSequential technology revenue reflected the successful completion of integrations for several large clients that went live on Aladdin in the second quarter. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 8% year-over-year. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term, driven by demand for Aladdin's broadening technology capabilities and the growing value proposition it represents for clients. Total expense was modestly lower year-over-year. Lower incentive compensation and distribution and servicing costs were partially offset by higher direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was flat year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income, offset by higher base compensation.\nDirect fund expense increased 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially as a result of higher rebates in the prior year quarter and higher average index AUM. G&A expense was flat year-over-year, partially due to timing of planned investment spend. Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42.5% was down 120 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the negative impact of market movements on quarterly revenue. Our platform strategy has delivered scale and operating leverage through time with 240 basis points of margin expansion in the last 10 years.\nMarkets have improved since the end of 2022, and we aim to be disciplined in driving profitable growth by prioritizing investments to propel our differentiated organic growth and operating leverage. In line with our guidance in January at present, we would expect our head count to be broadly flat in 2023. We would also expect a mid- to high single-digit percentage increase in 2023 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest in the prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for sustained success, primarily through seed and co-investments to support organic growth.\nAt times, we may make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives. Consistent with this inorganic strategy, last month, we announced a private markets acquisition and a minority investment as part of a technology partnership. We expect our acquisition of [ Kreos ] Capital to close in the third quarter of this year, adding venture debt capabilities and further bolstering BlackRock's global credit franchise. The Navalox core banking system, which will ultimately scale both businesses and better serve joint clients.\nWe repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the second quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our previous guidance in January. In May, we capitalized on the improved conditions for debt issuance, issuing $1.25 billion of 10-year debt at a coupon of 4.75%. We expect to invest the proceeds of the offering at substantially the same rate as the cost of borrowing, effectively eliminating incremental cost of carrying additional debt in 2023.\nOur ambition is to be the cloud of investment management and technology. We organize around 3 key principles, access, expertise and service to deliver value to our clients. Our platform strategy backed by these 3 principles drove $80 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter, broadening adoption of iShares ETFs by asset managers, insurance companies and wealth managers fueled net inflows of $48 billion in the second quarter, led by fixed income -- unlocking client demand by providing efficient and expanded market.\nRetail net inflows of $4 billion were led by strength in index SMAs through Aperio and broad-based net inflows into active fixed income. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated $5 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. We're partnering with clients across their whole portfolio, and our clients are leveraging our scaled advisory, asset allocation, OCIO and technology services.\nInstitutional active net inflows of $9 billion included demand for customized LifePath target date mandates and illiquid alternatives. Private markets continued to scale in the quarter. Net inflows of $3 billion represented 10% annualized organic asset growth and were led by private credit and infrastructure. We have approximately $30 billion of nonfee-paying committed capital to deploy in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.\nFinally, cash management net inflows of $23 billion in the second quarter were led by U.S. government money market funds. We're actively working with clients on their liquidity management strategy, providing technology, market and operational insights and, of course, a full range of cash management capabilities.\nLooking ahead, we see significant opportunity to grow our market share and consolidate our position with clients as they choose to do more with BlackRock. We're the only asset manager delivering Platform as a Service. We believe our platform strategy will continue to deliver for both our clients and shareholders, resulting in sustained market-leading organic growth and differentiated operating leverage over time. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Throughout our history, BlackRock has been serving clients. We listened to them. We delivered to them as a fiduciary, and we evolve our capabilities to help them achieve their long-term outcomes across market regimes. We bring together the entire firm as a platform to deliver client outcomes. That's a defining factor of BlackRock's differentiated and industry-leading leadership. .\nAs many of you have heard at our Investor Day last month, we are building the sole platform strategy in asset management that brings together products, services and technology to solve our clients' investment and technology needs. We envisioned BlackRock to be the investment manager cloud, for asset managers and for asset owners. BlackRock's industry-leading results reflect our clients' continued confidence in our long-term performance. We are delivering sustained organic growth and base fee growth even as the traditional asset management industry logs persistent outflows.\nBlackRock generated $190 billion of total net inflows in the first half of 2023, including $80 billion in the second quarter, reflecting positive flows from wealth and institutional clients across regions. We grew technology services revenues and ACV as clients leverage Aladdin to support their investment processes. And we again delivered strong margins for our shareholders. Our scale platform and technology allows us to invest for future growth while maintaining a differentiating margin, which we expanded in 7 of the last 10 years. Organic growth, combined with positive markets and foreign exchange movements has led to an over $830 billion increase and BlackRock's AUM in the first 6 months of 2023.\nAnd as I speak with clients, I hear how their expectations of asset managers are expanding. It's why clients are doing more business with fewer managers. Clients are seeking a broad range of integrated services alongside a strong performance track record to help achieve their desired outcomes. Clients value BlackRock's unparalleled breadth and investment strategies, which span regions, index and actives in both public and private markets. And they're confident in our ability to deliver the investment performance they need through durable alpha and active proprietary deal flow in private markets or prior index tracking of ETFs. Through our diversification and strong performance, we can help clients better match their long-dated liabilities, achieve their operational objectives and streamline their processes. This better enables them to address the needs of their own stakeholders.\nToday, client conversations more often move beyond products, they're about portfolios, about business transformation and how they could benefit from BlackRock's platform scale. That evolution from product to portfolio to platform creates enormous growth potential for BlackRock. And we are intentionally organizing ourselves around our clients, which helps ensure the one BlackRock rock we deliver is greater than any one part of the organization.\nInvestors are facing a complex landscape of competing fiscal and monetary policies with a number of structural forces shaping returns now and over the long term. These forces include a fragmented geopolitical landscape causing a rewiring supply chains, a transition to a lower carbon economy and the aging population in the developed world, all of which are likely to be inflationary over time. This year, U.S. equity markets rally has been fueled by just a few technology firms and hope that artificial intelligence will gain widespread adoption. I believe AI has a huge potential to enhance productivity and transform margins across sectors. It may be a technology that can bring down inflation. But in the meantime, potential banks continue to face a sharp trade-off between living with some inflation and/or damaging economic activity.\nAgainst this backdrop, clients are turning to BlackRock to provide insights to help them manage risk. We capture new opportunities and to implement enterprise technologies. Clients are choosing BlackRock for our platform combination of technology and advisory alongside ETFs, active investing and private market capabilities. Our ETF platform and franchise cuts horizontally across clients, product and the market ecosystem to provide access to an expanding world of investments.\nBlackRock captured the #1 share of ETF industry flows in the second quarter of 2023 generating $48 billion of net inflows. These industry-leading net inflows was led by a continued demand for iShares bond ETFs, and we aim for our bond ETF AUM to more than triple to $2.5 trillion by 2030. This is not just because of the generational opportunities in VIX income, but because bond ETFs are also delivering benefits such as access, transparency and liquidity to both institutional and wealth clients at an accelerating pace.\nBlackRock will continue to drive bond ETF innovation and growth as the bond market modernizes and investors moved to capture significant opportunities in fixed income. Our ETF business is evolving to increase access to all kinds of markets more efficiently with more transparency and more conveniently than ever before. We recently completed the largest global ETF launch in history with 2 transition focused ETFs. The launch is another example of our commitment to provide choice and access to our clients through the breadth of our leading transition and ETF capabilities. The ETF launched with nearly $3 billion in seed capital as we connected with BlackRock to execute on an innovative client solution.\nOur clients are also focused on outcomes, and this manifests in a portfolio blending active index, private markets and cash. We often talk about how index ETFs are being used actively by all types of investors and active managers are increasingly leveraging the many benefits of the ETF wrapper. In May, we launched 2 active ETFs led by Rick Rieder and [ Tony DeSpirito ], these ETFs will be great tools for client advisers to gain access to our active insights within our ETF structure.\nClients choose BlackRock for performance. This is across multiple dimensions, including investment performance, client service and operational excellence. Across our active franchise, BlackRock has delivered durable investment performance with 81% and 90% of our fundamental equities and taxable fixed income AUM above benchmark or peer medium for the last 5 years. Our global connectivity, our scale, our technology, our market access position positions us to deliver the alpha our clients' need. Our expertise in portfolio construction and asset allocation combined with strong investment performance has differentiated BlackRock in the market. We saw $73 billion of active net inflows in the first half of 2023 compared to active industry outflows.\nWe're also unlocking opportunities for clients in private markets, where we have a $30 billion of committed capital, and we're growing in private markets organically through new launches, scaling of our successor funds, and at times, we will execute on inorganic transactions to further expand our capabilities and global reach. To this end, we recently announced our planned acquisition of [ Crius ] Capital, a leading provider of venture debt financing in Europe. When we talk to clients about their private market allocation, the number one thing you're looking for as a selective manager's proprietary, differentiated deal flow. BlackRock's global network of relationships, our data, our analytics and flexible, adaptable capital needs we could source unique deals for our clients.\nDoing so, we deliver value for our clients and our fund portfolio of companies. Our long-term private capital team acquisition of [ CRE ] in May 2020 is an excellent example of the outcomes that can be achieved through the strength of our proprietary sourcing, our proprietary underwriting and value creation capabilities. LTPC acquired CRE during the depths of the COVID lockdown and last month that we announced that they had entered an agreement to sell the company to a strategic buyer caring beauty. The LTPC team had the conviction that CRE was an extraordinary business with multiple levers for value creation that would help accelerate growth even during the pandemic. And with last month's agreement, the fund is expected to realize significant alpha for our clients.\nI find more often now that companies want BlackRock as a trusted investor and a trusted partner. BlackRock is a long-term friendly capital with global client relationships. We invest early and we can stay invested through cycles, whether it's debt or equity or a pre-IPO through post IPO. Companies recognize the uniqueness of our global reach, our brand and our expertise across markets and industries. We are a valued partner to these clients, and companies want to work with BlackRock and this enables our proprietary origination. We are tapping into our deal flow across our private markets asset classes, and especially focusing on credit and infrastructure. Our connectivity across the real economy is bringing benefits to both clients and the communities in which our underlying investment projects operate. As I meet with clients around the world, I hear how our profile is strengthening, in local markets as a result of our leadership in infrastructure investing.\nIn the United States, we partnered with AT&T and GigaPower JV and invested in Jupiter Power, which operates one of the largest battery storage fleets in Texas. And our relationships around the world continue to expand our reach in new ways. This is evident from our most recent investments, whether it's first air in South Korea, or Acacia Energy, which is building the world's largest grid scale battery storage facility, the [ Warta ] battery in Australia. These are just a few examples. Our growing profile from these investments is leading to more and larger deal opportunities, which will deliver growth for BlackRock's clients and to you, our shareholders. The portfolio of the future is outcome-oriented, customized and seamlessly combined public and private markets.\nBlackRock is the only company that can offer both the portfolio investments in technology through eFront and Aladdin. Aladdin is bringing the portfolio of the future to life by providing technology in a digital-enabled and customized way. Combining risk management, the investment book of record performance, accounting and data all in one place. Market volatility and growing cost pressures and complexities and optimizing whole portfolios underscore the need of enterprise operating and risk management technology.\nThe value of Aladdin's integrated end-to-end technology platform is resonating. In the same way that clients are consolidating their portfolios with fewer asset managers, clients are looking to do much more with Aladdin. And over the last 12 months, 40% of our new annual contract value came from the expansion of existing relationships. And I'm pleased to say that our retention rates remain very high at 98%. We're not only expanding Aladdin's capabilities, we're also tackling bigger addressable markets by extending into adjacent offerings. We're enabling a whole portfolio ecosystem empowering clients through data and opening Aladdin to drive even more innovation. We are creating deep integration with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions. Our recently announced partnership with Avaloq is the latest example. We are engineering Aladdin for the future, and as clients look to do more with fewer partners, our SaaS technology business will enable greater agility for clients in delivering higher recurring revenues for our shareholders.\nAladdin and Aladdin Wealth are increasingly core components of outsourcing relationships. Our success across a number of significant outsourced solutions over the past several years are catalyzing a dialogue with more and more clients. I recognize the headline multibillion-dollar mandates get much of the attention. But we're bringing our expertise to clients in all segments, not just large pension funds or insurers but also wealth managers and charities and endowments and family offices.\nSecond quarter results, including continued momentum in institutional and wealth outsourcing, particularly in family office models and SMA and last week, Quintec Private Bank announced they selected BlackRock to provide an expanded set of investment solutions, advisory solutions and risk management and technology. This is another example of how clients are turning to BlackRock as they scale and they grow their own business, and we help them do that. Asset Management or technology or the multitude of other industries, clients are consolidating their relationships and moving to platforms that provide strong performance in integrated services. BlackRock intentionally invested and built our business model to be in the forefront of this trend. And this is resonating in our results as clients increasingly turn to BlackRock for performance and for our platform services.\nPrior entity leading results and momentum are a direct result of our dedicated employees and leadership team. Our success over the last 35 years has been built on the steadfast commitment to operate as one BlackRock, fully connected to our clients, on one platform with one culture using one technology. It is our leadership team that is delivering the power of this hyper-connected platform to our clients. These leaders make us a hyper-connected team. The collaboration in their horizontal leadership are essential to our success and growth.\nAs I said in our Investor Day, I'm not planning to leave BlackRock anytime soon, but my goal has always been to ensure that when Rob Kapito and I move on, the firm is even better hands than it is today. And I'm confident we are going to achieve that. In building the company, we have always taken a long-term view and our approach in developing our leadership talent is no different. BlackRock's Board and I are highly focused on identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We also seek to align their long-term interest with those of our shareholders, our clients and one another through shared incentives that reward long-term value creation.\nA key part of this ongoing initiative is the recent issuance of a onetime long-term equity incentive grants for a small group of leaders, featuring extended vesting periods. These awards represent a key long-term strategic investment in the success and stability of BlackRock's leadership plans. And as we execute on our platform as a service strategy, our goal is that these grants will help promote a continued, collaborative long-term performance culture between our leaders across our horizontal leadership capabilities and for many years to come. Because I want to underscore that we are in the very early days of a long-term shift in client consolidation of their investment managers, their technology requirements towards a more comprehensive platform.\nIn the same way that organizations have traditioned from on-site data to hardware to cloud providers. Many clients are now transitioning from in-house investment and technology models to BlackRock. For years, we have focused on delivering one BlackRock to our clients with horizontal connectivity, integrated services and a strong performance. I truly believe this is the future of investing, and BlackRock is a forefront.\nI believe we're one of the most exciting times in BlackRock's history, I could say very clearly that both Rob and I are energized by these new examples that we see every day and how we are delivering value for all of our BlackRock stakeholders. Thank you, and let's open up for questions.",

My name is Jess, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc., First Quarter 2023 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Martin S. Small; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nGeneral Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from the statements.\nAs you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Small\n\nSenior MD, CFO & Global Head of Corporate Strategy\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2023. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results. I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2023, we updated our definitions of as adjusted operating income, operating margin, nonoperating income and net income -- they now exclude the compensation expense impact of mark-to-market volatility associated with certain deferred cash compensation plans and the nonoperating impact of an economic hedge, which the company began in 2023. We believe this change provides investors and management with a more useful understanding of our core financial performance over time and increases comparability with other asset management companies.\nBlackRock regularly reviews our disclosures with the goal of providing helpful information to our investors and streamlining where appropriate. To this end, we also simplified our disclosure of distribution revenue and expense beginning in the first quarter. I'm excited to be presenting for the first time as CFO. As many of you know, most of my first 17 years at BlackRock were spent in client-facing roles. And I can tell you firsthand, BlackRock was built for clients.\nFinancial cracks and economic damage from this rapid rate hiking cycle burst into view over the last few weeks, 20 years of easy money is definitely behind us. The world is adjusting to higher rates and tightening credit conditions. BlackRock's platform has been built over time to help clients in all market environments. Market dislocations present significant opportunities for BlackRock and most importantly, for our clients. Asset management firms connect investors to capital markets, and we see these recent dislocations driving more economic activity and growth to markets.\nWe've spent 35 years creating more access, creating more connections among long-term investors, capital markets and the real economy. We've unlocked new markets through iShares and personalized SMAs. We pioneered unconstrained bond strategies, and we put Aladdin on the desktops of thousands of investors and advisers, leading the industry, leading our clients on this journey with world-class investment capabilities, market insights, advice and technology, that's the center of BlackRock's growth strategy. We're a partner. We have long-term perspective. We have the ability to move quickly in times of stress. We're a whole portfolio adviser, providing end-to-end technology and investment portfolio servicing.\nClients use BlackRock as a scale enabler. They use our platform as a service. They use it to streamline and support the growth and commercial nimbleness of their own business. Our unique platform combination of ETFs, advisory, outsourcing technology alongside with active and private markets capabilities, that's what's driving BlackRock's differentiated organic growth.\nWhether adding or reducing risk, our continued industry-leading organic growth demonstrates that clients are consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock. And in the first quarter, BlackRock generated total net inflows of $110 billion, representing 5% annualized organic asset growth and 1% organic base fee growth.\nFirst quarter revenue of $4.2 billion was 10% lower year-on-year, primarily driven by the impact of significantly lower markets and dollar appreciation over the last 12 months on average AUM as well as lower performance fees.\nOperating income of $1.5 billion was down 17%, while earnings per share of $7.93 was lower 17% versus a year ago, also reflecting a higher effective tax rate partially offset by higher nonoperating income.\nNonoperating results for the quarter included $60 million of net investment gains driven primarily by mark-to-market gains and the value of our private equity co-investment portfolio and unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 25%. This reflects lower discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2023. The actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. First quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.5 billion was down 9% year-over-year. This reflected the negative revenue impact of approximately $800 billion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on our AUM over the last 12 months and was partially offset by the elimination of discretionary money market fund fee waivers and higher securities lending revenue.\nSequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue increased 3%, reflecting higher average AUM and securities lending spreads, partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our annualized effective fee rate was modestly lower compared to the fourth quarter, mainly due to changing client risk preferences.\nPerformance fees of $55 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower revenue from alternatives.\nIn 2022, our Aladdin platform delivered record net sales and we continue to see strong client interest for our technology solutions. Quarterly technology services revenue was approximately flat compared to a year ago, reflecting this continuing strong demand but also significant headwinds associated with the foreign exchange impact on Aladdin's non-dollar revenue and market declines on Aladdin's fixed income platform assets over the last 12 months.\nSequential Technology Services revenue was impacted by onetime fees in the prior quarter and the timing of implementations. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 6% year-over-year. We remain committed to low to mid-teens ACV growth over the long term, especially as periods of market volatility have historically underscored the importance of Aladdin and generated increased demand.\nTotal expense decreased 5% year-over-year, reflecting lower compensation and direct fund expense partially offset by higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down 6% and primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees.\nG&A expense increased 6% due to higher marketing and promotional expense, including the impact of higher T&E expense and higher occupancy expense as a result of our moving to our new headquarters right here in Hudson Yards, New York. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased 10%, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense.\nDirect fund expense was down 4% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower average index AUM. Sequentially, quarterly direct fund expense increased due to higher average index AUM in the current quarter and higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter. Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 40.4% was down 380 basis points from a year ago. This primarily reflects the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on quarterly revenue. Although markets have improved since the end of 2022, we will continue to be disciplined in prioritizing our hiring and overall investments with the aim of delivering organic growth and a differentiated operating margin.\nThe diversification and the resilience of our platform allow us to pursue critical investments while maintaining focus on expenses in our margin. BlackRock's industry-leading organic growth is a direct result of the disciplined investments we've consistently made through market cycles. Our business is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, and we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible.\nIn line with our guidance in January, at present, we'd expect our headcount to be broadly flat in 2023, and we'd also expect a mid- to high single-digit percentage increase in 2023 core G&A expense. Our capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.\nWe continue to invest through a prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. This is primarily through seed and co-investments to support organic growth. We will make inorganic investments where we see an opportunity to accelerate growth and support our strategic initiatives.\nBlackRock's stable and differentiated business model enables us to invest and remain opportunistic. Our acquisition philosophy focuses on extending our product capabilities and our distribution reach. Prior examples of this strategy are the acquisitions of eFront to extend Aladdin's whole portfolio coverage, Aperio to scale direct indexing and First Reserve to enrich energy and infrastructure investing at BlackRock for our clients.\nAs previously announced in January, we increased our quarterly dividend by 2.5% to $5 per share of common stock. We also repurchased $375 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, we still anticipate repurchasing at least 375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our previous guidance in January.\nBlackRock's $110 billion of total net inflows, evidence our strong ongoing connectivity with clients, which only grew as market and liquidity stress events unfolded in the quarter. First quarter ETF net inflows of $22 billion were led by demand for our bond ETFs. This was partially offset by seasonal tax trading and sentiment-driven outflows from U.S. equity style box exposures in precision ETFs.\nAs we've seen repeatedly in periods of market volatility, investors use iShares to implement tactical asset allocation preferences in their portfolios. Our bond ETFs again delivered for clients and generated $34 billion of net inflows. We've invested for years to support the growth of bond ETFs, both to create a diversified bond ETF platform and to deliver the liquidity and price transparency our clients expect, especially during periods of market volatility.\nRetail net inflows reflected strength in index SMAs through Aperio and broad-based net inflows into active fixed income.\nBlackRock's institutional franchise generated $81 billion of net inflows as we continue to partner as a scale enabler, a platform for institutional clients seeking turnkey access to investment expertise, greater customization, industry-leading risk management, technology and investment servicing. Institutional active net inflows of $72 billion were led by multi-asset and fixed income net inflows, which included fundings from several significant outsourcing mandates.\nDemand for private markets also continued with $4 billion of net inflows, representing 16% annualized organic base fee growth led by private credit and infrastructure.\nWe continue to source unique deals for our clients through our global network of relationships. They're underpinned by data, analytics and technology. Examples include our agreement to form GigaPower a joint venture with one of our diversified infrastructure funds and AT&T.\nWe have approximately $33 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients in a variety of alternative strategies, and this represents a significant source of future base and performance fees. In aggregate, BlackRock generated approximately $68 billion of active net inflows during the quarter, and we've now generated positive active flows in all but 2 quarters since the beginning of 2019.\nFinally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $8 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. Flows were driven by surging demand for our cash management solutions in March as clients looked to diversify away from deposits and enhance cash yields. March net inflows offset net redemptions in the first 2 months of the quarter that were primarily due to client-specific activity such as SPAC unwinds.\nWe're actively working with clients on their liquidity management strategies, providing technology, market and operational insights and, of course, delivering a full range of cash management capabilities. BlackRock's first quarter results highlight the benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified and resilient investment technology platform.\nThroughout our history and in its most recent crisis, BlackRock's led by listening to clients. I'm excited about our future and the growing opportunities for BlackRock for our clients, for our employees and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nFounder, Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Martin. And congratulations on your first earnings call as CFO. And good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining the call. BlackRock is a source of both stability and optimism for our clients. We are helping them navigate volatility and embed resiliency in their portfolios while also providing insights on the long-term investment opportunities to be had in today's markets.\nIn 2022, BlackRock generated $307 billion in net new assets and captured over 1/3 of long-term industry flows. Strong momentum continued into 2023, and we once again led the industry with $110 billion of net inflows in the first quarter. The consistency of our results across both good and bad markets across from our clients' confidence in BlackRock's performance, BlackRock's guidance and our fiduciary standards.\nAs I wrote in my Chairman's letter last month, recent market volatility and stress in the regional banking sector are the consequences of prolonged periods of aggressive fiscal and monetary policy coming to an end. These policies contribute to a sharp rise in inflation with the Federal Reserve responding with the fastest pace of rate hikes since 2000 -- excuse me, since 1980s.\nThe cost of these hikes is now materializing, including through shocked to regional banks. Fears of impairment and held-to-maturity portfolios and bank balance sheet and a crisis of confidence in regional banks set off a wave of shutdowns, seizures and regulatory interventions that we haven't seen at this scale in a long time. As these historic events were unfolding, we marked the 35th anniversary of the founding of BlackRock.\nThroughout our history, moments of dislocation and disruption have been inflection points for BlackRock. This is where opportunity arises for both BlackRock and for our clients. From times like this, we have always emerged stronger more differentiated in the industry and much more deeply connected to each and every client.\nWe founded BlackRock based on our belief in the long-term growth of the capital markets and the importance of being invested in them BlackRock has grown as the role of the capital markets has grown over the past 35 years. I believe the current crisis of confidence in the regional banking sector will ultimately fuel another round of growth in the capital markets.\nBlackRock will be an important player, and there are going to be more opportunities for clients as people, companies and countries increasingly turn to markets to finance their retirement, their businesses and the entire economies. BlackRock operates from a position of strength. While others may be consumed by near-term pressures, we are at the forefront of trends and opportunities that will shape our growth as a firm and deliver the best outcomes for our clients.\nThe powerful simplicity of our business model is that when we deliver value for our clients. We also create more value for all our shareholders. We have stayed hyper connected with our clients, offering them the first -- the firm's best thinking on what's happening in the markets, anticipating their questions and concerns and acting as their trusted partner and adviser in times of need. Leading with empathy, being at the front foot, putting our collective experience at our clients' disposable moving fast, linking globally, that's BlackRock at our best.\nInvestors are looking to BlackRock for insights and thought leadership on the economy on markets, on geopolitics and asset allocation. Within the first week following the SVB collapse, we reached thousands of clients, providing them with real-time information and our views on the unfolding events.\nOur BlackRock Investment Institute has hosted dozens of calls for institutional investors and financial advisers. Senior business leaders and investors at BlackRock have met over 100 CEOs, CIOs, executives and public officials. BlackRock's Financial Markets Advisory group advises financial and official institutions as well as other public and private capital markets participants.\nFMA recently was awarded a mandate by the FDIC to advise and support asset dispositions related to SCB and Signature Bank resolutions. We are honored to have been selected and approached this with all of our FMA assignments with a great sense of discretion and a deep, deep sense of responsibility.\nBlackRock is partnering with clients to navigate immediate concerns around market volatility and liquidity while also staying focused on their long-term goals. Through this connectivity, we're having richer conversations with clients than ever before, about their whole portfolios, in many cases, deepening their relationships with them.\nOur Aladdin technology and integrated asset management platform enables us to help clients quickly understand their portfolio exposures to help them manage liquidity and express changing risk preferences and capture opportunities in response to market events. The horizontal connectivity and responsibility and constant open line of communication requires at this most recent crisis continue to be exemplified across the firm.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, clients entrusted BlackRock with $110 billion of total net inflows, driving positive annualized organic base fee growth. Organic growth this quarter was led by ongoing momentum in our long-term strategic priorities, including bond ETFs and outsourced CIO mandates. Clients also came to BlackRock for immediate liquidity and tactical allocation needs. Whether it was through our diversified cash management offerings, our short-duration fixed income products, precision ETFs or exposures in valuational tools in Aladdin. We were there for our clients providing advice options and swift execution.\nBlackRock ETFs once again prove their value as critically important tools for active management and in providing liquidity, transparency and price discovery declines during stressed markets. Across our ETF platform, BlackRock generated net inflows of $22 billion in the first quarter. Industry-leading flows into bond ETFs were particularly offset by outflows from our precision ETFs. These tactical asset allocation tools are unique to BlackRock and are used to express risk on or risk off us as they were in this past quarter. In periods of weaker equity markets, we see investors leverage this ETF segment to actively reduce their exposures and for tax loss harvesting trades. As a result, in markets like the first quarter, you'll see outflows from our Precision segment and the opposite in risk on markets. We have seen this pattern play out following the equity sell-off in 2018. And in December and in the first quarter of 2020 and most recently in the third quarter of 2022.\nIn each of these prior periods, inflows follows when risk on sentiments return. The high utilization of Precision ETF reinforce the value proposition associated with iShares' strong secondary market liquidity and unique options and lending market ecosystems. BlackRock led the industry with $34 billion of bad ETF net inflows and we're representing over 60% of total fixed income ETF trading volumes during the quarter.\nEspecially as the U.S. treasury market experienced large and historic moves, investors turn to bond ETF access treasury markets and manage interest rate risk. BlackRock's U.S. Treasury ETF range has over $180 billion of assets, providing exposures across the entire yield curve. Investors use BlackRock's leading platform to manage their risk to quickly shift to safe haven assets and to manage their cash.\nI've often talked about how ETFs have been modernizing the bond market by contributing real-time information about pricing and market conditions. Notably, ETF liquidity remains strong even as the underlying market liquidity became more challenged. Trading costs in iShares U.S. treasury ETFs remained low despite moving higher in the underlying bonds.\nFor example, iShares 20-year-plus year treasury bond ETF, bid-ask spread held at 1 basis point, while the underlying bonds at many times traded far wider. BlackRock Fixed income ETFs are increasingly being used for active management. BlackRock's own active managers pioneered the use of fixing ETFs for many years ago, for liquidity management for hedging and for efficient tactical allocation.\nToday, we see most of the world's leading asset owners, wealth managers and active asset managers as clients of BlackRock fixed income ETFs. We are evolving these client relationships from single-use cases to broader adoption, including active applications for a more holistic view of fixed income portfolio allocations across fixed income ETFs, actively managing strategies and for individual bonds.\nIShares performance under extreme conditions continue to unlock sources of client demand and expand our opportunity set. Investors of all types are turning to iShares bond ETFs, both in normal market environments and particularly during times of market stocks. Liquidity has also become paramount for our clients. Cash is the lifeblood of individuals and organizations, especially in times of stress.\nAnd our teams have been partnering with clients as they reevaluate where they put their cash and how to balance holdings assets and traditional bank deposits alongside other options like money market funds or ultra-short bond strategies. In the month of March, BlackRock saw over $40 billion of net inflows into our cash management strategies. We expect to shift from deposits to money market funds to be a longer-term trend and are actively working with clients to help them diversify and enhance the yields they're earning on their cash.\nCash often gets overlooked. Now that yields are back after -- back after a decade of a lost decade of near zero rates, we're excited to help clients put their cash to work at BlackRock. Through our cash matrix in Aladdin technology, our risk management and product innovation and collaboration across the $3.3 trillion fixed income and cash platforms. So we are positioning BlackRock to be a partner of choice for our clients' liquidity and cash management needs.\nAsset owners and investment in wealth managers are increasingly looking to focus on core competencies and outsource more of their investment process. As they do this, they want a partner that can provide seamless integration solutions better, faster and more efficiently. Our notable success is on onboarding and executing outsourcing mandates over the past several years have catalyzed dialogues with more and more clients.\nEarly in 2023, 2 large pension funds chose BlackRock for significant OCIO engagements. In the United Kingdom, Royal Mail announced it selected BlackRock to manage its over $10 billion of defined benefit scheme, trusting BlackRock to look over the pensions of its 118,000 members.\nIn the United States, we are honored to have been selected by a named fiduciary for a pension covering more than 350,000 union workers and retirees. These mandates and other outsourcing assignments underpinned $81 billion of institutional net inflows in the first quarter and are yet more examples of how BlackRock's range of resources our experiences and our deep connectivity in local markets are resonating with more and more clients and supporting more and more clients.\nIn the last 3 years, BlackRock has been entrusted to lead outsourcing mandates totaling $400 billion in AUM, including $200 billion in the last 12 months alone. And just yesterday, it was announced that we have been appointed as a primary asset manager partner to LV, the U.K. mutual insurer.\nDuring this time of historic market volatility, clients globally are increasingly interested in how we can help them with outsourcing. We are hearing with all types of clients, not only pension and insurers, but also now endowments and foundations, health care organizations and actually larger family offices.\nWe expect the trend towards outsourcing to continue with BlackRock driving investment management and technology transformations for our clients. Technology outsourcing is similarly on the rise as companies look to replace multiple loosely connected systems with a single strategic partner who offer a complete solution.\nAladdin enables clients to operate horizontally to share consistent data and to build and manage whole portfolios. While there's been tremendous ups and downs in the broader market and operating environment, the need for digitization and efficiency through technology remains a constant.\nMarket volatility and the growing demand for immediate precise information on direct and indirect exposures is only underscoring the need for robust technology, operating and risk management technology offered through Aladdin. In the week following the collapse of SVB, we saw significant increases in usage of Aladdin's exposure and interactive modeling tools as our clients sought to understand their exposure to specific securities, to sectors and to their yield curve. They leverage Aladdin capabilities to manage interest rate risk and portfolios and set enterprise-level broker and trade restrictions.\nSimilarly, Aladdin Wealth clients turn to the platform to better understand their clients' exposures as they have in other significant market events like the start of COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Usage following failure in the U.S. regional banks more than doubled at many of our wealth client platforms.\nAladdin was designed, Aladdin was built for these type of times, and we are proud that our technology is enabling all our clients to act quickly and with clarity and with much greater confidence during these market shocks. Our results this quarter and amid the most recent crisis are only the latest example of BlackRock doing what it does best.\nStay in front of the clients' needs, helping them to see challenges as opportunities and providing hope for what comes next.\nIn 2023, is presenting an incredible opportunity for long-term investors. There's more yield to be earned in cash. Infrastructure and private credit are offering attractive returns. Bonds can be a major component in portfolios and equities are at much better valuations. BlackRock is connecting our clients to these opportunities and providing them with the confidence to continue investing for the long term.\nEspecially in periods of dislocation, our willingness to reimagine our business and to be nimble and seizing emerging opportunities have bolstered our growth and generated differentiated value and returns for our shareholders. Our stable and differentiated business model enable us to remain opportunistic, and we will continue to be deliberate and systematic in our investments.\nWe are constantly looking at opportunities as we assess possible accelerators of growth support of strategic initiatives and test the boundaries of how we think about BlackRock's business. At our founding, 35 years ago, when BlackRock was as much of a concept as it was a company, there was 1 thing we knew we had to get right, and that was always start with the client.\nWe've listened to them. We learned a lot from them. We put their needs first. Since then, we have developed leading franchises in ETFs and advisory outsourcing, and in technology. And we worked tirelessly to integrate these capabilities into our One BlackRock business model and culture. It is this combination of capabilities that make BlackRock truly unique. And we're opening new channels for growth by scaling our alternative franchise by expanding the market for bond ETF, providing clients access to emerging opportunities in area like transition finance.\nOur momentum is a result of many years of thoughtful investments in the infrastructure needed to support complex global mandates at the whole portfolio level. The power of BlackRock's integrated platform enables us to deliver better outcomes for our clients and differentiating growth for you, our shareholders. Over the past 5 years, BlackRock has delivered an aggregate of $1.8 trillion of total net inflows or a 5% average organic asset growth compared to flat or negative industry flows.\nOver this 5-year time period, Black -- the markets have been both -- have both rallied and have had contractions. But BlackRock has consistently generated organic growth, reflecting the resiliency of our diversified platform and the investments we made towards that platform. Clients are entrusting more of their portfolios with BlackRock and an endorsement of the platform performance we offered, guidance we provide and the fiduciary status we uphold to each and every client.\nAs we look forward, our success in what we will achieve comes down to our people. Everything we have accomplished and will accomplish is because of how we have all worked together to put our clients first. I'm so incredibly proud of how our employees rallied together in a time of crisis to support our clients to support their fellow colleagues and then making sure we're supporting every one of our stakeholders.\nLooking back at the last 35 years, it is our people who have enabled us to achieve all that we have had as an organization. And we are just getting started. BlackRock is still in the early chapters and I'm more excited than ever about the potential and the promise that we have lying ahead. Thank you. Operator, let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Karen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference.\nOur host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. (Operator Instructions)\nMr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nSenior MD, General Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary Stephen Shedlin\n\nCFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, and Happy New Year to everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022.\nBefore I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. As a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as-adjusted operating income, operating margin and net income. Year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials.\nThroughout BlackRock's history, we have consistently invested in our business with a long-term focus and commitment to serving clients across market environments. We have established leadership positions in high-growth areas, such as ETFs, private markets, outsourced solutions and technology. And we have integrated these industry-leading capabilities into our One BlackRock business model and culture to create a distinct and differentiated value proposition for clients.\nAs a result of these investments, we grew organically at our fastest rate ever in 2021. And while 2022 was one of the most challenging market environments in over 50 years, clients around the world once again turned to BlackRock for advice and assistance to construct more resilient portfolios. In good times and bad times, whether adding or reducing risk, our continued industry-leading organic growth demonstrate that clients are increasingly consolidating more of their portfolios with BlackRock for long-term solutions that solve their most challenging investment needs and address their unique risk preferences and priorities.\nDuring 2022, BlackRock generated industry-leading total net inflows of over $300 billion and delivered positive organic base fee growth. Importantly, we ended the year with strong momentum, generating approximately $114 billion of total net inflows in the fourth quarter, representing 3% annualized organic base fee growth, and reflecting continued momentum in iShares and significant outsourcing mandates.\nFull year revenue of $17.9 billion was down 8%. Operating income of $6.7 billion and earnings per share of $35.36 both declined 13% compared to 2021. For the fourth quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was 15% lower year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of lower markets and dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees.\nQuarterly operating income of $1.6 billion was down 25%, while earnings per share of $8.93 was 16% lower versus a year ago, also reflecting higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $159 million of net investment income, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains in our private equity co-investment and seed investment portfolios and our strategic minority investment in Envestnet.\nOur as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 23%, driven in part by discrete items. We currently estimate that 25% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2023, primarily due to an increase in U.K. tax rates, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nFourth quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.4 billion was down 14% year-over-year, in line with the corresponding decline in average AUM, primarily reflecting the negative revenue impact of approximately $1.7 trillion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on AUM over the last 12 months. Sequentially, fourth quarter base fee and securities lending revenue was down 4% despite positive organic base fee growth in the quarter. Our fourth quarter annualized effective fee rate decreased by approximately 0.5 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the previously discussed impact on our fourth quarter entry rate, continued mix change favoring lower fee mandates and lower securities lending revenue.\nFourth quarter and full year performance fees of $228 million and $514 million, respectively, decreased from a year ago. The decline primarily reflected lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only mandates, partially offset by higher fees from illiquid alternatives. Notably, as our private markets business continues to scale, full year performance fees from illiquid alternatives increased 42% year-over-year. And our unrecognized deferred carry balance, which represents a portion of our potential future carry fee revenue, exceeds $1.4 billion.\nOur Aladdin business delivered record net new sales in 2022, and demand for our technology solutions has never been stronger. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 4% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.4 billion, increased 7%. Both periods reflected significant revenue headwinds associated with the FX impact on Aladdin's non-dollar revenue and market declines on Aladdin's fixed income platform assets. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 8% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 10% from a year ago.\nTotal expense decreased 4% in 2022, reflecting lower compensation, direct fund expense and G&A expense. For the full year, employee compensation and benefit expense was down 5%, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees and lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs partially offset by higher base compensation. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we finalized full year compensation in the fourth quarter.\n2022 direct fund expense decreased 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower average index AUM. The sequential decline in quarterly direct fund expense also includes the impact of higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding product launch costs, fourth quarter G&A expense increased 2% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strategic investments in technology and the impact of higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense partially offset by lower occupancy and sub-advisory expense. For the full year, we estimate that core G&A expense was up 11% compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher technology spend associated with our Aladdin cloud migration and a return to more normalized levels of T&E expense.\nOur full year as-adjusted operating margin of 42.8% was down 400 basis points from a year ago, primarily reflecting the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on revenue and the ongoing longer-term strategic investments we have been making in technology and our people.\nBlackRock's industry-leading organic growth is a direct result of the disciplined investments we have consistently made through market cycles. As we've shown throughout our history, it's often in times of greatest uncertainty where BlackRock's differentiated model enables us to continue playing offense, and we emerged even stronger. Since July, we have been aggressively managing the pace of our discretionary spend, so we would be better prepared for 2023, a year in which we will need to increasingly focus our resources on areas of greatest opportunity.\nIn order to continue investing in our people and critical strategic priorities during the year, we recently restructured the size and shape of our workforce to free up investment capacity for our most important growth initiatives. By taking a targeted and disciplined approach to how we shape our teams, we not only increase investment capacity for these initiatives, but also create opportunities for our incredible talent.\nThis resulted in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $91 million, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 500 impacted employees or 2.5% of our global workforce. This charge appears as a single line expense item on our 2022 GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results to enhance comparison to prior periods.\nOur business is incredibly well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us, and we remain deeply committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. At present, we would expect our head count to be broadly flat in 2023. Optimizing the shape of our talent pyramid and growing our footprint in iHub innovation centers will continue to be central to our talent strategy, allowing us to continue to support growth at scale.\nIn addition, we would also expect a mid- to high single-digit increase in 2023 core G&A expense driven by the upcoming move to our new Hudson Yards headquarters, continued investment in technology to scale our operations and support future growth, and the annualized impact of migrating Aladdin clients to the cloud, which is now substantially complete.\nWe are also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. During 2022, we allocated $1.2 billion of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth, and our year-end portfolio now approximates $3.9 billion.\nOur strategic minority investments are reinforcing various elements of our strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for our shareholders. During the year, we invested in Circle and became the primary manager of the USDC cash reserves. And we recently made a minority investment in Human Interest, a tech-enabled end-to-end retirement plan solutions provider, which is helping Americans employed by smaller businesses access easier ways to save for their retirement.\nWe also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and returned a record $4.9 billion to shareholders in 2022, including $1.9 billion of share repurchases, an increase of over 30% from 2021. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased over $13 billion of BlackRock's stock, reducing our total outstanding total shares by 13% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of approximately 15% for our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we are targeting the repurchase of at least $1.5 billion of shares during 2023.\nAs you will hear more from Larry, BlackRock's strategy has always been guided by our clients' needs. We are relentlessly focused on providing choice, delivering strong investment performance and executing our fiduciary duties with excellence. This enables us to build deeper and broader relationships with more clients and drive differentiated growth across our platform.\nFourth quarter long-term net inflows of $146 billion, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, were led by flows into strategic growth areas, including ETFs, outsourced solutions and illiquid alternatives. Full year long-term net inflows of $393 billion were positive across all regions, led by net inflows of $230 billion from clients in the United States.\nBlackRock generated industry-leading ETF net inflows of $220 billion in 2022, representing 7% organic asset growth and 3% organic base fee growth, including a record $123 billion into bond ETFs. Fourth quarter ETF net inflows of $90 billion reflected some seasonality but also reflected the diversity of our product and client segments. Surging demand for our bond ETFs, which saw $47 billion of net inflows, represented the second-best quarter in our history. We also saw continued strength in core equity ETFs as well as precision exposures as clients reassessed tactical asset allocation changes during the quarter.\nFull year retail net outflows of $20 billion reflected ongoing industry pressures in active fixed income and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in index SMAs and our systematic equity income and multi-strategy alternative funds. Fourth quarter retail net outflows of $15 billion reflected similar trends.\nBlackRock's institutional business generated record net inflows of $192 billion in 2022, representing 4% organic asset and 3% organic base fee growth, paced by approximately $170 billion of active net inflows, reflecting broad-based strength across all product types and the funding of several significant outsourcing mandates. Fourth quarter Institutional active net inflows of $76 billion were also positive across all product types and included the funding of the substantial remainder of the AIG Corebridge fixed income mandate.\nWe remain well positioned to meet investor demand for risk-adjusted alpha and yield, and our diversified active fixed income platform, with strong 3- and 5-year performance records across total return, unconstrained, high yield and credit, is especially well positioned for growth as interest rates stabilize in the latter part of the year. Demand for private markets also continued with $16 billion of net inflows into illiquid strategies during the year, driven by private credit and infrastructure.\nIn addition, as our private markets business continues to grow, we also raised significant new client commitments in 2022. We now have approximately $34 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing approximately $260 million of future annual base fees and significant potential performance fees. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform experienced $32 billion of net outflows in the fourth quarter and $77 billion of net outflows for the year.\nDespite a particularly challenging year for the broader institutional liquidity industry, BlackRock became the #1 international money market provider. And as rates stabilize, we are well positioned to grow market share by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology and risk management capabilities.\nBefore I hand it over to Larry one last time, I'd like to take this moment to thank him for giving me the opportunity to be CFO of this amazing organization for the last 10 years. It's truly been the highlight of my career, and I'm deeply grateful for the feedback, advice and wisdom I have garnered from our shareholders; our sell-side analysts; our Board; my BlackRock colleagues; and most of all, the amazing finance team I've had the privilege to work alongside.\nBlackRock is incredibly well positioned to continue generating differentiated growth and delivering for clients, employees and shareholders, and I look forward to continuing the journey in my new role. I'm even more excited for what lies ahead with Martin Small as our next CFO. I know we will be in great hands.\nWith that, over to you, Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nChairman & CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGary, big hug. Thank you. Excellent job.\nGood morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. Thanks, everyone, for joining this call. Today and throughout BlackRock's history, we have focused on delivering the best financial returns for each and every client. In line with our objectives and goals, we remain relentless about staying ahead of their needs, of all our clients' needs, providing them with more choice, innovating to help them achieve financial well-being. We serve clients of all types: Large, small, individuals and institutions, in all parts of the world. So providing them choice is critical in helping each of them achieve their unique financial goals.\nWe have built the industry's most comprehensive and integrated investment and technology platform to provide them with solutions that fit their unique objectives. Our job is then to deliver the best financial returns based on their individual preferences. It is this differentiating platform that drives our differentiating results.\nBlackRock generated $307 billion in net new assets and positive organic base fees in 2022. These industry-leading results reflect by -- the decision by thousands of organizations and investors that continually place their trust in BlackRock. The consistency of our results across both good and bad markets, markets up and down, comes for our clients' confidence in BlackRock's performance, our guidance and our fiduciary standard.\nIn the United States, we generated $230 billion of long-term net inflows, and flows were positive across all regions throughout the world. We generated organic growth across index and active and across all long-term asset classes, from fixed income to equities to multi-asset to alternatives, as clients turned BlackRock for more solutions across their entire, whole portfolio. We ended the year with very strong momentum with $114 billion of fourth quarter net inflows, representing 3% annualized organic growth base fees. We estimate that BlackRock captured over 1/3 of the long-term industry flows in 2022, leading the industry and delivering positive organic base fees for the year.\nOver the past 5 years alone, BlackRock has delivered an aggregate $1.8 trillion in net inflows or 5% average organic asset growth compared to flat or negative industry flows. Over this 5-year period of time have been both rallies and contractions, but BlackRock has always delivered growth, reflecting the power of our connectivity to our clients, our fiduciary standards and our diversified platform.\n2022 was a year of transition and a complex market environment for every one of our clients. We witnessed transformation in the geopolitical world order that rewired globalization and supply chains, upending assumptions about inflation and drove the normalization and eventually tightening of monetary policy.\nProduction constraints, labor shortages and energy and food price disruptions and price increases followed the Russian invasion of Ukraine, causing inflation to hit a 40-year high, sparking a cycle of rate hikes by central banks. Inflation continues to be a top concern despite recent cooling we saw at the end of this year -- in the beginning of this year. Global growth continues to slow.\nThe challenges society has experienced, not just in the past year, but since the pandemic, has eroded hope and reinforced pessimism in many parts of the world. We've seen a decline in birth rates, an increase in aging populations, a rise in nationalism and populism. And I fear that we are entering a period of economic malaise. To correct this, the role of business becomes even more critical than ever. Leaders must continue to invest in technology and research and development to improve long-term prospects and to provide a vision that offers hope about the future.\nFundamentally, investing is also an act of hope, hope that the future will be better than the present. If people do not have hope, they will not take money out of a bank account and invest it in a 30-year retirement outcome. Today, the financial narrative is so often about the near-term market moves, the topic of the day, like the latest meme stock or media headlines about political polarization.\nThroughout our history, BlackRock has taken a long-term approach to investing. It is BlackRock's role to show people the benefits of investing for the long term. to give them hope that, over time, their returns with a balanced portfolio can deliver long-term financial security. Against the current backdrop, BlackRock has an even greater obligation to help our clients wade through the uncertainty and give them the confidence to invest in the long term.\nWe see many opportunities for our clients to capitalize on market disruption, to rethink portfolio construction, to consider the renewed income generation potential of bonds, or to reallocate to sectors that may be more resilient in the phase of elevated inflation. BlackRock is uniquely positioned to help clients navigate opportunities in this environment because of our diversified platform and integrated investment management, technology and advisory expertise.\nOur whole portfolio approach is resonating more than ever before and underpins the record $192 billion of long-term net inflows from institutional clients in 2022. Institutional clients are choosing BlackRock because of our scale, our resources and the expertise to take on the challenges of each and every market. Clients select us because we think and invest for them in the long term and in alignment with their beneficiaries, whose time horizon span decades.\nIn an increasingly complex investment environment, we're seeing strong demand from clients looking to partner with BlackRock for outsourced solutions and expect this to continue in 2023. Just in the last 2 years, BlackRock has been entrusted to lead several significant outsource mandates totaling over $300 billion in AUM, spanning existing and new clients. And I'm proud to say our pipeline remains very strong.\nIn 2022, BlackRock helped millions of investors plan for their financial futures as they continue to turn [to iShares] ETFs for long-term investments. iShares led the industry with $220 billion of net inflows. We are proud that iShares offers the most choice in our industry. In 2022 alone, we launched over 85 new ETFs globally. And as a testament to our scale, the demand from our clients and our diversification, we had over 70 different iShares ETFs with annual net inflow surpassing $1 billion.\nOur growth was well diversified across our core equity, our fixed income, factors, sustainable and thematic ETF product categories and we have seen repeatedly, in periods of market uncertainty, investors turn to iShares' precision exposure ETFs to make those tactical asset allocation decisions into year-end.\niShares bond ETFs generated a record $123 billion of net inflows, we again led the industry. And 6 of the top 10 asset-gathering bond ETFs in 2022 were iShares. When I started my career a long time ago as a bond trader, it was much more difficult for individuals to access the bond market. Their options were high-cost mutual funds or paying large markups to brokers to buy bond directly. 20 years ago, iShares launched the first 4 U.S.-listed bond ETFs. And today, we provide over 450 ETF choices across our $760 billion iShares fixed income platform.\nIn an uncertain rate and credit environment this year, iShares bond ETFs benefited from having the most diverse product offerings in the industry, spanning governments, investment-grade, high-yield, emerging markets, municipals, innovations like BuyWrites and iBonds. The diversification means we can meet our clients' demands as it evolves. Earlier this year, investors used iShares bond ETF to express preference for short-duration treasuries. And more recently, our high yield, our corporates, long-duration ETFs, have been leading the flows.\nThe role of bonds in a portfolio is increasingly relevant. For the first time in years, investors can actually earn very attractive yields without taking much duration or credit risk. Just a year ago, the U.S. 2-year treasury note was yielding approximately 90 basis points, and today, they're earning over 4% with corporate bonds earning over 5% and high-yield earning 8%.\nClients are coming to BlackRock to help them pursue generational opportunities in the bond market, and our leading $3.2 trillion fixed income and cash platform is well positioned to capture accelerating demand. In addition to our industry-leading bond ETF flows, clients turned to BlackRock's high-performing active platform, where over 80% of taxable fixed income assets are performing above benchmarks or peer median for the 3- and 5-year period.\nThere will be more money moving around. And as investors recalibrate, we believe we will benefit as clients build portfolio with high-performing active investments alongside ETFs and of course private market strategies.\nThe need for income and uncorrelated returns against the backdrop of higher inflation and a more challenged market for public equities will continue to drive demand for private markets. We raised $35 billion in client capital in 2022 led by private credit in infrastructure.\nWe're successfully scaling successor funds, delivering larger funds through raises of subsequently fund vintages. In 2020, our third Global Energy & Power Fund raised a total of $5 billion, surpassing the total assets of vintage I and II combined. In 2022, the fourth fund raised $4.5 billion in investor -- in initial investor commitments at first close, achieving over half of our targeted $7.5 billion raise.\nOur diversified infrastructure funds are providing social and economic benefits to communities in the United States and around the world. We recently announced an agreement to form Gigapower, a joint venture with one of our diversified infrastructure funds and AT&T, which upon closing, will provide fiber networks to customers and communities outside AT&T's traditional service area. The network will advance efforts to bridge the digital divide and ultimately help spur local economies and the communities in which Gigapower operates.\nOne of the largest opportunities in infrastructure investing over the coming years will be the renewable infrastructure. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act contains a range of measures to spur greater investment in demand for renewable energy, infrastructure and technology. In Europe, the energy supply shocks in 2022 have only sharpened the focus on energy security and given rise to the European Commission's REPowerEU plan for renewable energy investment.\nClient demand for income and uncorrelated returns also resonated in our multi-asset and fundamental active equity platforms, where we saw in our tactical asset allocation and equity dividend franchises, we see great opportunities for clients in our income and dividend growth equity offerings, which can be tools to help thread the needle between generation of income and growth that could potentially outrun inflation.\nAladdin is foundational to how we serve clients across our platform. It helps us deliver precise tracking for our iShares ETFs; it allows us to onboard and service increasingly large, complex mandates; and it has consistently demonstrated its value in proceeding -- in processing high trading volumes and providing transparency into portfolios in volatile markets.\nOur multi-decade investment in Aladdin continues to differentiate BlackRock and continues to differentiate Aladdin, both as an asset manager and as a leading fintech provider. Periods of market volatility have historically underscored the importance of Aladdin. And in 2022, we saw record net sales of Aladdin contributing to 10% growth in our annual contract value on constant currency basis. We see clients doubling down on technology and leveraging fewer providers to do more with less. This is evidenced by our mandates this year, about half spanning multiple Aladdin products.\nWe continue to evolve and enable clients to further simplify their operating infrastructure with Aladdin. Clients increasingly want to tailor how they use Aladdin to meet their own unique and specific needs, and we are providing them with choice and flexibility. We are creating deep integration with ecosystem providers and third-party technology solutions. Our partners include asset servicers, cloud providers, digital asset platforms, trading systems and others who can work with clients in their Aladdin environment to provide a more customized and seamless end-to-end experience.\nWe continue to innovate in a variety of areas to expand the choice we offer clients. We're transforming on how clients can engage with companies they are invested in through our Voting Choice technology. BlackRock was the first organization to build and launch technology empowering institution clients, in BlackRock's separate accounts and nearly 650 pooled vehicles, to choose how to vote the shares of the companies they own through our own index capabilities.\nNearly half of our clients' index equity assets under management are now eligible. This includes all public and private pension plans we manage in the United States as well as retirement plans serving more than 60 million people around the world. And in just the last 6 months, the number of index equity clients yearly committed to Voting Choice has more than doubled. We are also working to expand this capability to individual investors in markets like the United Kingdom and in funds where it's possible.\nThe majority of BlackRock's clients are investing to finance retirement, and BlackRock has been in the forefront of innovation and advocacy for retirement solutions throughout our entire history. We recently made a minority investment in Human Interest, which is helping small and medium-sized businesses provide affordable, accessible retirement plans to their employees so more Americans can serve and save for a secured financial future. We believe Human Interest's vision aligns closely with BlackRock's mission of helping more people experience financial well-being by making retirement plans accessible to more Americans.\nWe've always believed in being agile in how we manage BlackRock. That is how we built our industry-leading position and generated value for shareholders over the long run. The uncertainty and the opportunity around us makes it even more important that we stay in front of the changes in the market and focus on delivering for each and every client. To extend our market leadership, we must invest in our people, invest in our platform for the long term by allocating resources where they are needed most in ways that are cost-effective and support our ability to scale.\nAs Gary mentioned, our restructuring effort resulted in a number of valued colleagues and friends leaving the firm. We greatly appreciate the contributions they have made to BlackRock and wish them the best for them. BlackRock remains a growth company. Even with this restructuring, our head count will still be 6% higher than a year ago. Looking ahead, we have deep conviction in our strategy and ability to execute with scale and with expense discipline.\nWe are honored that our clients have entrusted us with over $300 billion of net assets in 2022. We see similar clients' needs reshaping and shaping the opportunity set for 2023, be it a large insurance company seeking outsourced partnership with scale and expertise, pension funds looking for attractive yields and less duration and credit risk, or financial advisers using our models and iShares to build better portfolios to meet the challenges -- the long-term challenges of our clients.\nThe investments we have made over the years have also positioned us to capture emerging opportunities and bond ETFs, huge opportunities in the re-buildout of infrastructure in the United States and the world and opportunities in transition finance, our momentum in Aladdin has never been stronger and our advisory capabilities continue to play a critical role in our dialogue with clients.\nI've spoken frequently over the years about the need for CEOs to effectively articulate the value their companies deliver to shareholders, clients, employees and other stakeholders. Similarly, as the CEO of BlackRock, I have a responsibility to articulate the BlackRock story, and it has never been more critical to do that than now.\nOver the past year, BlackRock has been the subject of a great deal of political and media discourse. It is my duty to address the questions being asked of us, a responsibility that I take very seriously. Some of these people have suggested we are either too progressive, some of them suggested we're too conservative in how we manage our clients' money.\nI'm going to just tell everybody, we're neither. We're a fiduciary. We put our clients' returns first. We offer every client investment choices and then pursue their objectives that they choose and the performance they seek. I want to make it clear to our clients, our shareholders and all our stakeholders that we will be determined in pursuing the outcomes that our clients desire.\nThis steadfast focus has not only enabled us to deliver for clients but also to drive growth for each and every one of our shareholders. Since our IPO in 1999, BlackRock has delivered a 7,700% total return to our shareholders. And this is the strongest return of a financial services company in the S&P 500 over that period.\nI thank BlackRock employees for the commitment to upholding our culture and living every day our purpose. They're always striving to better serve each other and each of our clients and finding new and innovative ways to be helping our stakeholders achieve a financial well-being.\nI really do want to call out and thank Gary once more for his last earnings call. He's been a friend way beyond his term at BlackRock. He's been an adviser. Sometimes, he's been tough. Sometimes, he's been lovely. And he -- but Gary has been an important part of driving our growth over these last 10 years and driving the success of our share price for our shareholders. I am thrilled personally and professionally he will continue to be with us at BlackRock as a Vice Chairman. And I look forward to having Martin Small join us as the CFO for our next call in April.\nThank you, everyone, and let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Jake, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nSenior MD, General Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.\nAs you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary Stephen Shedlin\n\nSenior MD & CFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2022. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.\nAs a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as-adjusted operating income, operating margin and net income. Year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials.\nMarket conditions remained very challenged in the third quarter, with global equity and debt markets ending down 25% and 14%, respectively, for the first 9 months of 2022. In total, these market declines, along with significant dollar appreciation against major currencies, reduced the value of BlackRock's assets under management by over $2 trillion since December 31. Inflation, rising rates, liquidity, market volatility, and geopolitical uncertainty remain significant concerns for clients, but more of them are turning to BlackRock for comprehensive solutions to help build more resilient portfolios. They increasingly value our unparalleled breadth of investment products, styles and exposures, which allows them to customize portfolios to address the investment policies, return targets, and unique needs of their stakeholders.\nOur ability to deliver this customization at scale is a unique advantage, and it is during times of market uncertainty that the power of our platform becomes most evident. Despite the most challenging market backdrop in decades, BlackRock generated industry-leading long-term net inflows of $248 billion during the first 9 months of 2022, demonstrating the strength and stability of our globally-integrated multi-asset solutions-oriented platform.\nWe've invested for years to develop leading franchises in high-growth areas such as ETFs, private markets, outsourced solutions and technology. And importantly, we've worked tirelessly to fully integrate these capabilities into our One BlackRock business model and culture. This connectivity and collaboration is more important than ever before, as we bring together the entire firm to deliver better outcomes for our clients and differentiated growth for our shareholders.\nAnd while we can't control near-term volatility or the specific client risk preferences that may result, BlackRock's platform has been purposely built over time to help clients meet their objectives regardless of the market environment. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock's broad-based platform has generated approximately $400 billion of total net inflows, representing positive organic base fee growth of 2%. During a tumultuous market environment, BlackRock generated third quarter long-term net inflows of $65 billion, representing approximately 3% annualized organic asset growth. Quarterly long-term net inflows were partially offset by net outflows from cash and advisory AUM. However, total quarterly annualized organic base fee decay of 4% reflected outflows from higher fee precision ETFs, the continued impact of elevated redemptions in active equity and fixed income mutual funds, and outflows in institutional money market funds.\nThird quarter revenue of $4.3 billion was 15% lower year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of significant lower markets and dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees.\nOperating income of $1.6 billion was down 22% and reflected the impact of approximately $96 million of closed-end fund launch costs in the third quarter of 2021. Earnings per share of $9.55 declined 16% versus a year ago, also reflecting a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by lower nonoperating income compared to a year ago.\nOur as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 19%, reflecting $93 million of discrete tax benefits. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2022, but the actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nNonoperating results for the quarter included $219 million of net investment income and reflected a $267 million noncash gain related to our strategic minority investment in iCapital.\nThird quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $3.5 billion was down 10% year-over-year, broadly in line with the decline in our average AUM. The negative revenue impact of approximately $1.9 trillion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on AUM over the last 12 months was partially offset by positive organic base fee growth over the same period and the elimination of discretionary yield support, money market fund, fee waivers versus a year ago.\nOn a constant currency basis, we estimate second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue would have been down 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, while base fee and securities lending revenue was down 4% on an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was approximately flat. As a result of continued global equity and bond market declines toward the end of the quarter, including the impact of FX-related dollar appreciation, we entered the fourth quarter with an estimated base fee run rate approximately 7% lower than our total base fees for the third quarter.\nPerformance fees of $82 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternative products, including lower fees from a single hedge fund with an annual performance measurement period that ends in the third quarter.\nOur Aladdin business delivered record sales in the first 9 months of 2022, and demand for our technology solutions has never been stronger. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting this increased demand, but also reflecting significant headwinds associated with the FX impact on Aladdin's nondollar revenue and market declines on Aladdin's fixed income platform assets.\nAnnual contract value, or ACV, increased 7% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 10% from a year ago. Total expense decreased 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower compensation, G&A and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down 12%, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees, partially offset by higher base fee compensation.\nQuarterly G&A expense declined 6% versus a year ago and reflected the impact of $96 million of closed-end fund launch costs in the third quarter of 2021, which are excluded when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. Excluding these costs, G&A expense increased 13% due to higher marketing and promotional expense, including the impact of higher T&E expense and ongoing strategic investments in technology, including cloud computing costs. Sequentially, G&A expense was up 5%, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense.\nDirect fund expense was down 10% year-over-year, driven by lower average index AUM.\nOur third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 42% was down 560 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the immediate negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on quarterly revenue and the ongoing longer-term strategic investments we have been making in technology and our people.\nBlackRock's industry-leading organic growth is a direct result of the purposeful investments we have consistently made through market cycles. The diversification and stability of our platform has allowed us to pursue critical investment when others have been forced to pull back. But we also recognize that this market environment may require a different playbook. While we continue to have deep conviction in our strategy and the long-term growth of the global capital markets, we have begun to more aggressively manage the pace of certain discretionary spend. We are continuing to pursue critical hires that support our near-term growth, but are pausing the balance of our hiring plans for the remainder of 2022.\nIn addition, we now expect our full year increase in 2022 core G&A to be in the range of 13% to 15%, lower than our previous guidance of 15% to 20% that we communicated in January. While these steps will not materially impact our 2022 results, they will better position us going into 2023, should market headwinds persist.\nThroughout our history, we've demonstrated that we are pragmatic and agile in managing our expenses. As always, we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible and will be prudent in continuing to assess our overall level of spend in the current environment. Our capital management strategy remains to first invest in our business and then to consistently return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased nearly $1.4 billion worth of shares in the first 9 months of this year, including $375 million in the third quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares in the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous guidance.\nBlackRock's third quarter long-term net inflows of $65 billion once again demonstrate the stability of our diversified platform and the strategic alignment with clients. We're increasingly looking for partners who can provide them with global insights and whole portfolio solutions tailored to their future goals.\nThird quarter ETF net inflows of $22 billion were led by surging demand for our bond ETFs, partially offset by sentiment-driven outflows from commodities, broad emerging markets exposures and small-cap equity precision ETFs. As we have seen repeatedly in periods of market volatility, investors turn to iShares precision exposure ETFs to express risk and tactical asset allocation preferences.\nBond ETFs generated $37 billion of net inflows, the second best quarter in our history. We're not only leading the bond ETF industry in terms of AUM and net new business market share, but we're working with all stakeholders to grow the bond ETF industry itself. It took 17 years for the industry to reach $1 trillion in 2019. It is now closing in on $2 trillion, and we believe that the industry will be at $5 trillion before the end of the decade, with BlackRock leading that significant growth.\nRetail net outflows of $5 billion reflected ongoing industry pressures in active fixed income and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in index SMAs and our systematic equity income and multi-strategy alternatives funds.\nInstitutional active net inflows of $71 billion were led by fixed income and multi-asset net inflows and included the impact of several previously announced significant outsourced CIO mandates, including the funding of approximately 45% of the AIG Core Bridge fixed income assignment.\nInstitutional index net inflows of $23 billion -- net outflows of $23 billion primarily reflected equity net outflows as clients sought to derisk or rebalance in the current environment.\nDemand for alternatives also continued, with $2 billion of net inflows and $4 billion of new commitments raised across our liquid and illiquid platform during the quarter. New illiquid commitments were driven by private credit and infrastructure. We now have approximately $37 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.\nOur cash management platform experienced net outflows of $40 billion, primarily driven by redemptions from U.S. government money market funds, as reduced debt issuance in a higher rate environment, coupled with ongoing capital management and a general reduction in corporate cash levels, contributed to industry-wide institutional outflows. As rates stabilize, BlackRock is well positioned to grow market share by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology and risk management on behalf of liquidity clients.\nFinally, third quarter advisory net outflows of $9 billion were primarily linked to the successful transition of the last remaining assets managed in connection with our assignment with the New York Federal Reserve Bank.\nThroughout our history, BlackRock is led by listening to clients. This connectivity has been foundational to our growth over the last 34 years, and our relationships with clients have never been deeper. We have always capitalized on market disruption to emerge stronger by continuing to innovate, to work collaboratively, and to deliver the full power of our platform. While challenging, this market environment is no exception.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nChairman & CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Today and throughout our history, we have focused on providing our clients with choice in how they pursue their long-term investment goals. Over the last 34 years, we have built the industry's most comprehensive and integrated investments in technology platform. Our diverse solutions provide clients with more choice to address their unique priorities. It is our job to deliver them the best financial returns based on our clients' own preferences.\nOur comprehensive platform allows us to serve clients around the world of all types and sizes, whether you are looking for a broad-based index exposure, private markets or fully outsourced solutions. For many clients, market-weighted portfolios will suit their needs. Others may want access to precise exposures in certain regions or sectors, whether that's Latin America or Southeast Asia or health care or agriculture. Some others will want their investments to reflect their values or contribute to environmental priorities or pursue opportunities in the energy transition.\nBlackRock provides investment choice to our clients, and our clients decide how they invest their money. Because of this, clients are turning to BlackRock more than ever. Our broad investment product capability, our leading technology platform, our whole portfolio approach, and global insights are strongly resonating worldwide with our clients. I cannot think of a time when we are having more comprehensive conversations with more clients than we are today.\nFirst 9 months of 2022 have brought on a complex economic environment. Consumers, companies and portfolios remain impacted by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which reached a record high against the pound in the quarter, following a holistic plunge in the U.S. Gilt markets. Central banks continue to prioritize bringing down inflation, as they should. At the same time, increased government stimulus is creating a disconnect between fiscal policy and monetary policy. While central banks are tasked with bringing down inflation, governments are injecting stimulus into the economy, making the central bank's jobs even harder.\nThe speed at which central banks are raising rates to rein in inflation alongside slowing economic growth is creating extraordinary uncertainty, increased volatility, and lower levels of market liquidity. After an early summer rally in equities, markets again came under pressure in the third quarter, with equity markets ending down 25% for the first 9 months, and the aggregate bond index is down over 14%. While, of course, BlackRock is not immune to the impact of markets and currency moves, we remain focused on what we can control.\nWe are bringing our capabilities and insights to clients to help them navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by this environment. Even when much of the industry has experienced outflows, clients entrusted us with more than $248 billion in net new business in the first 9 months of 2022, including $65 billion in the third quarter. And our voice continues to resonate in every region where we operate.\nIn the U.S. alone, during the third quarter, clients awarded us $84 billion of long-term net inflows. BlackRock is uniquely positioned in this environment because of our integrated investment management, integrated technology and our advisory expertise, something no other asset manager can provide. Even with these historical difficult market conditions, BlackRock's AUM is still up $2 trillion since the beginning of 2019. And during that period, we also added over $1.6 trillion in assets under management from organic growth alone. No one else in the industry has done this. And let me be clear, this is not by an accident. For years, we strategically invested in our platform, both organically and inorganically, in anticipation of our clients' evolving needs and preferences.\nWhat made our investment so successful was our steadfast commitment to integrate our capabilities onto one platform, onto one culture, onto one technology platform. That is what One BlackRock is about, and this is why we connect to our clients worldwide. They have one organization to come to. That culture and approach is just as relevant today, maybe even more so, while others are talking about change and challenges in the asset management industry that we have long anticipated, long prepared for, and we are spending our time delivering solutions to our clients.\nOur long-standing commitment to reimagining our business to innovate ahead of the needs of our clients is translating into industry-leading organic growth we're generating today. BlackRock's whole portfolio approach is resonating more than ever against this market backdrop, as clients look for partners with comprehensive capabilities and a global outlook to help them rethink their portfolio allocations. It is especially essential to the momentum we are seeing in these major outsourcing mandates.\nBlackRock anticipates a growing need from insurance companies, pension and wealth distribution partners for more comprehensive outsourced solutions, as they are increasingly looking to focus on their core business. We invested to align our investment expertise, operational expertise, and technology to address these clients' needs.\nThe movement towards outsourcing accelerated even faster than we anticipated. And BlackRock has been in the forefront, working with clients of all sizes that help them meet their investment objectives and to better serve their own stakeholders. Just in the last 2 years, we are honored that BlackRock has been entrusted to lead several significant outsourced mandates totaling over $300 billion in AUM, spanning existing, but also entering new client relationships and new capabilities.\nThird quarter results included some of the flows that these outsourced relationships have, and we see strong momentum going forward. Aladdin is not only the operating system that unites all of BlackRock, it is a key component of many of our largest clients' relationships. Driven by our continued innovation and the power of our user provider model, demand for Aladdin has never been stronger.\nWe've seen record new mandates in 2022, and see strong momentum going forward. We have invested to expand Aladdin's value proposition to addressing our clients' needs across investment life cycle. Aladdin's integrated offerings are resonating with clients, with about half of this year's mandate spanning multiple Aladdin products. This includes clients using the Aladdin whole portfolio view, which grew out of our own acquisition of eFront, to seamlessly manage portfolios across public and private asset classes on one single platform. It includes clients leveraging Enterprise Aladdin, alongside Aladdin Accounting or the Aladdin Data Cloud.\nThe success of our expanded Aladdin offerings demonstrates how clients value our innovation and our integrated capabilities. Just as Aladdin is transforming the operating system of the asset management industry, bond ETFs are revolutionizing fixed income investing with iShares leading industry growth and industry innovation. iShares bond ETFs generated $76 billion of net inflows in the first 9 months in 2022, even as a generational rise in inflation and tighter monetary policy resulted in sharp price declines in the bond markets.\nFlows in 2022 highlighted the unique diversity of BlackRock's Bond ETF platform. Flows were led by U.S. Treasury ETFs, but also saw strong growth in investment grade in municipals and international government bonds. Today, BlackRock's ETF platform stands at $700 billion in AUM across 300 ETFs, serving millions of investors globally.\nWe also saw more opening of the bond ETF ecosystem, such as the CME's announcement that it would accept certain bond ETFs for collateral management and continued adoption from U.S. insurers, giving changes to the bond ETF capital treatment announced earlier this year.\nBeyond fixed income, we are partnering with clients to deliver benefits of ETFs to their portfolios across each of their major product categories. Investors continue to turn to iShares ETFs for long-term investments, active and for passive. And we also saw growth across core equity, sustainable ETFs in the third quarter and throughout the year.\nAcross our ETF platform, BlackRock generated inflows of $22 billion in the third quarter and $131 billion year-to-date. ETF flows for BlackRock were particularly impacted by high utilization of iShares precision exposures ETFs by institutional clients for their own exposure management. The tactical asset allocation tools are unique to BlackRock, and high utilization of ETFs reinforce the value proposition across the iShares' strong secondary market liquidity and unique options and lending market ecosystem to allow our portfolios and investors to either go long or short using iShares as a vehicle to express their market views.\nBlackRock's leading performance and innovation in the ETF industry is another testament to the integrated nature of our model and our platform. Aladdin enables us to handle complexity and precision with scale. iShares products diversification and innovation offers clients the widest choice in the industry.\nGlobally, we have over 1,000 ETFs, nearly 6x the number of our next largest player. In 2022 alone, we launched 75 new ETFs, nearly double the number of launches by the next 3 largest providers combined. The breadth of this platform also enables us to capture changes in client demand and help our clients nimbly reposition as market conditions evolve. ETFs are increasingly the first place investors go to make tactical asset allocations and updates, manage liquidity or position for compelling long-term opportunities. And particularly, clients have been turning to us to help them navigate rapidly rising rates and capitalizing on generational opportunities in fixed income.\nBlackRock's top-performing diversified fixed income platform across ETFs, and active and across duration, across credit, and high yield is uniquely positioned to help clients in line with their specific needs and goals, whether it is to lock in risk-free yields or to generate more income or to hedge against inflation.\nIn addition to significant funding from outsourcing relationships, BlackRock's active platform demonstrated continued momentum and systematic equities in LifePath target date funds and alternative strategies. We believe we will benefit from money in motion as clients recalibrate and build portfolios with high-performing active alongside ETF and private markets.\nWhile market volatility impacted shorter-term performance in some funds, long-term performance remains strong, so approximately 89% of our active fixed income and 82% of our fundamental equity are above our peers and medium for the 5-year period. We continue to see demand for alternatives, especially in private credit and infrastructure. As investors seek additional sources of yield or uncorrelated returns amid this more challenging public market alpha, we raised $6 billion through commitments and net inflows in the third quarter and $23 million in the first 9 months of 2022.\nBlackRock has built comprehensive private market capabilities that provide exposure across illiquid alternative asset classes and importantly are integrated as a part of the One BlackRock platform. This is unique in the industry and offers us a tremendous leverage, alternatives at BlackRock benefiting from the firm's global footprint, our network of clients and distribution relationships, access to differentiating high-quality deal flow, understanding our clients' whole portfolios and leading data analytics and technology.\nIn addition to our investment and technology capabilities, our Financial Markets Advisory group continues to play a critical role in advising financial and official institutions. In the third quarter, we announced that our FMA group will be working pro bono with the Government of Ukraine to provide advice on designing and investment framework, with a goal of creating opportunities for both public and private investors to participate in the future of reconstruction and recovery of the Ukrainian economy.\nBlackRock continues to innovate in a variety of areas to expand the choices that we offer to our clients. Last fall, we announced BlackRock's Voting Choice Initiative, which leverages our technology to help eligible institutional clients participate in proxy voting decisions. Following years of work on technology and regulatory barriers, nearly half our clients' index equity assets, including pension funds representing more than 60 million people, have simple and efficient options about their preferences, if they choose. We're going to expand choice even further, and we're committed to a future where every individual investor can have the option to participate in the proxy voting process, if they choose.\nOf the client assets currently available for voting choice, nearly 25% are held by clients who have so far elected to exercise their own voting choice and voting preferences. For other clients, BlackRock investment stewardship team serves as an important link between them and the companies they invest in.\nOver the past few months, I've been energized by the surge in people and activity in our offices around the world. Our people across all levels of our organization are more motivated, they're more engaged and more focused on the future than ever before. Just as we continually innovate and evolve our business to stay ahead of our clients' needs, we also evolve our organization and our leadership team, key to delivering the full power of One BlackRock to our clients and having our senior leadership team, having deep experience, knowledge and connectivity across the entire firm, with a desire of building deeper and broader horizontal leadership.\nWe make organizational leadership changes every few years because we believe these changes bring the best benefits to our clients, our shareholders, our firm, and to our leaders themselves. These changes not only keep us more tightly connected, they stimulate fresh thinking and helping us better anticipate all our clients' needs.\nPart of the changes to our leadership that we announced last week reflected Gary's desire to take on a new role, once again working directly with clients. He will be with us as CFO for the next quarter's earnings and through our year-end reporting. But I want to take a minute to recognize and thank you. Thanks, Gary. He's a great friend and has helped drive strong growth for BlackRock and our shareholders in the last 10 years as the CFO, and for many years before that as our true trusted adviser. I'm glad he'll continue with us at BlackRock as the Vice Chairman focusing on a number of our strategic client relationships. And I know that Martin, who has been named as our new CFO, will hit the ground running. With deep knowledge, deep experience from his 16 years at BlackRock across a varieties of different roles, Martin is a true example of stellar and pursued horizontal leadership with many different experiences within the firm. He will be working very closely with Gary and the entire finance team over the next few months to ensure a smooth transition.\nBlackRock is fortunate to have a diverse and engaged Board of Directors who act as stewards on behalf of all our shareholders and stakeholders in overseeing BlackRock's management and our operations. It has always been important that our Board functions as a key strategic governing body that advises and challenges our management team that guides BlackRock into the future.\nBeth Ford has been the kind of a Director we seek out, someone who brings new perspectives and new expertise to the Board. She has been an invaluable, valued member of our Board. But because of her spouse's new position as CIO of the Minnesota State Board of Investments, she decided that it would be appropriate for her to step down from our Board. And we're grateful for the many contributions that Beth has made as a member of the BlackRock Board.\nWe built BlackRock because we believe in the power of the capital markets, the power of what they have done in transforming economies for their long-term growth, and the importance of being invested in them. The money we manage belongs only to our clients. Over many years, we have built the most comprehensive platform to help them meet their investment objectives and deliver better outcomes for the portfolio. We provide them choice, so that their portfolios can be tailored to match their preferences and their goals unique to them.\nOur clients hold many different views. They operate in vastly different regulatory and cultural environments. And in this politically polarizing world we're living in today, we think that the model of client choice that we built during the last 34 years is more important than ever. In the last few months, especially in the United States, our industry and BlackRock itself has been the subject of increased political dialogue. We've seen and heard a lot of misinformation about BlackRock.\nWe're engaging more with our stakeholders than ever before. We're telling our story so that people can make decisions based on facts, not on misinformation, not on politicization by others. I do believe that the vast majority of our clients, our voice is resonating as strong as ever. We hear it in our dialogue with them and we see it in our flows. Again, in the United States alone, we have had positive net term inflows of $133 billion in the first 3 quarters of the year. And as I noted earlier, in the third quarter alone, we had 40 -- excuse me, $84 billion in long-term net inflows awarded to BlackRock by U.S. clients.\nThe majority of our clients are investing to fund the retirement of teachers, of nurses, of firefighters, of factory workers, who are saving for their future. They are entrusting BlackRock with more of their portfolios because they know we are here to serve them today and all tomorrows in the future and have a track record of helping them achieve their goals. They remain -- our clients remain our North Star.\nAs markets change and as our clients need more of us, we will stay true to our fiduciary mindset, our innovation instinct, and our One BlackRock culture that has defined us and enabled differentiating growth and differentiating relationships with our clients. I believe the best of BlackRock is ahead of us. And we are all committed to delivering the power of our unified platform to benefit our clients, to benefit our employees, and most of all, to benefit our shareholders.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Jake, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. (Operator Instructions)\nThank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nSenior MD, General Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary Stephen Shedlin\n\nSenior MD & CFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2022. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing today primarily on our as-adjusted numbers.\nAs a reminder, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as-adjusted operating income, operating margin and net income, year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials. Global equity and debt markets delivered their first -- worst first half returns in decades as investors reacted to uncertainty associated with rising recession fears, surging inflation, interest rate hikes and geopolitical tensions. In total, these market declines, along with significant dollar appreciation against major currencies, reduce the value of BlackRock's assets under management by $1.7 trillion since December 31.\nDespite this challenging backdrop, BlackRock's comprehensive platform still generated industry-leading organic growth of over $175 billion of net inflows in the first half of 2022. BlackRock's second quarter results once again demonstrate the resilience of our platform and validate the investments we have consistently made to build the most comprehensive range of investment management and technology solutions in the industry. I cannot think of a time when the value of our diversified platform and our commitment to continuously investing for the long term ahead of client needs has been more evident.\nOver the last 12 months, BlackRock's broad-based platform has generated over $460 billion of total net inflows, representing 5% organic base fee growth, providing a strong foundation to help immunize our base fees from the impact of double-digit market declines on our assets under management.\nDuring a tumultuous second quarter, BlackRock delivered total net inflows of $90 billion, representing 4% annualized organic asset growth. Flows were positive across all product types and regions, demonstrating diversification of our differentiated platform, even in the face of macro and industry headwinds and an ability to quickly adapt to changing client needs.\nImportantly, second quarter flows did not reflect the funding of any significant AIG-related assets, which will now occur in the second half of this year. Second quarter annualized organic base fee decay of 1% reflected client portfolio repositioning, favoring lower-fee index and cash products and higher redemptions in active fixed income and equity mutual funds. Second quarter revenue of $4.5 billion was 6% lower year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of significantly lower markets and dollar appreciation on average AUM and lower performance fees.\nOperating income of $1.7 billion was down 14% year-over-year, while earnings per share of $7.36 was down 30%, also reflecting meaningfully lower nonoperating income compared to a year ago. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $200 million of net investment losses, driven primarily by unrealized mark-to-market declines in the value of our unhedged seed capital investments and minority stake and investment.\nOur as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 25%. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2022 though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nDespite double-digit declines in equity and fixed income indexes year-over-year, second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.7 billion was down just 2% year-over-year. The negative impact of approximately $1.5 trillion of market beta and foreign exchange movements on AUM over the last 12 months was partially offset by 5% organic-base fee growth over the last year and the elimination of discretionary yield support money market fund waivers and higher securities lending revenue versus a year ago.\nOn a constant currency basis, we estimate second quarter base fee and securities lending revenue would have been flat year-over-year. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was down 4%, reflecting the impact of continued market declines on average AUM. On an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was up approximately 0.3 basis points benefiting from the elimination of discretionary money market fund fee waivers and higher securities lending revenue.\nAs a result of significant global equity and bond market declines during the quarter, including the impact of [excess] related dollar appreciation, we entered the third quarter with an estimated base fee run rate approximately 5% lower than our total base fees for the second quarter.\nPerformance fees of $106 million decreased from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower revenues from alternative and long-only products. Our Aladdin business delivered record sales in the first 6 months of 2022, and demand for our technology solutions has never been stronger. Quarterly technology services revenue increased 5% from a year ago, reflecting this increased demand, but also reflected the currency impact of significant dollar appreciation on Aladdin's nondollar revenue. Annual contract value or ACV increased 10% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we estimate ACV would have increased 13% from a year ago. We remain committed to low to mid-teens growth in ACV over the long term, especially as periods of market volatility have historically underscored the importance of Aladdin and generated increased demand from clients.\nTotal expense was flat year-over-year, reflecting lower compensation and direct fund expense partially offset by higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower incentive compensation due to lower operating income and performance fees and lower deferred compensation expense, driven in part by the mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs partially offset by higher base compensation.\nDirect fund expense decreased 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower average index AUM. G&A expense was up 12% year-over-year primarily driven by higher T&E expense and other costs associated with return to office and ongoing strategic investments in technology, including the migration of Aladdin to the cloud. Sequentially, G&A expense was up 7%, primarily reflecting higher G&A expense.\nOur second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.7% was down 320 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the immediate negative impact of markets and foreign exchange movements on quarterly revenue and the ongoing longer-term strategic investments we've been making in technology and our people. While we can't control near-term market volatility, we are always prepared for it. We have strong conviction in our strategy, our clients' increasing needs for whole portfolio and technology solutions, the growth of global capital markets and the strength of our proven operating model. The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of environments, and we continue to believe that our growth engines including ETFs, alternatives, technology and whole portfolio solutions are well positioned to increase market share.\nWhether it was during the financial crisis of 2008 or in the early days of the pandemic in 2020, BlackRock has always capitalized on market disruption and emerge stronger because the stability of our business model enables us to responsibly invest for the long term and continue playing offense when many others are forced to pull back. We have navigated these choppy waters before and are well prepared for what may lay ahead.\nAs always, we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We are continually focused on managing our entire discretionary expense base, and we'll be prudent in reevaluating our overall level of spend in the current environment.\nOur capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $1 billion worth of shares in the first half of this year, including $500 million in the second quarter. Our repurchases exceeded our planned run rate as we took advantage of what we viewed as attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock.\nAt present, based on our capital spending plans for the year, and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with previous guidance.\nBlackRock's second quarter net inflows of $90 billion, once again demonstrate the stability of our diversified platform to adapt to changing markets and client needs. ETF market share has increased as investors use them as vehicles of choice for strategic and tactical portfolio reallocation. Illiquid alternatives continue to provide clients with higher income and uncorrelated returns, as the traditional hedge between stocks and bonds has weakened. And demand for cash management offerings is increasing amid rising rates. BlackRock was the beneficiary of each of these industry trends during the second quarter, enabling us to capture money in motion as investors recalibrated their portfolios.\nBlackRock's second quarter ETF net inflows of $52 billion were positive across each of our product categories, core strategic and precision representing 7% annualized organic asset growth. Our strategic category drove nearly 70% of net inflows in the quarter led by continued demand for our diversified fixed income offering as clients utilize bond ETFs to reposition portfolios given the major shifts in the fixed income market.\nCore equity and higher fee precision ETFs also saw net inflows of $15 billion and $1 billion, respectively. We've invested for years to support the growth of fixed income ETFs both to create a diversified bond ETF platform and to deliver the liquidity and price transparency our clients expect, especially during times of market stress. And another challenging quarter for fixed income markets, our bond ETFs once again delivered for clients and generated $31 billion of net inflows.\nRetail net outflows of $10 billion reflected industry pressures in active fixed income and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in index SMAs, (inaudible) bonds and our systematic multistrategy alternatives fund. Gross sales in U.S. active mutual funds have remained strong but were offset by elevated redemptions from long-duration fixed income, high-yield and growth equities.\nBlackRock's institutional franchise generated $26 billion of net inflows as we continue to partner with institutional clients to deliver investment expertise, greater customization, industry-leading risk management and the benefits of our global scale. BlackRock's Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were led by growth in systematic active equity, illiquid alternatives, LifePath target-date funds and outsourced CIO solutions.\nWe see continued demand for our outsourcing capabilities and are increasingly engaging with the world's most sophisticated institutions to partner with them on whole portfolio solutions. In March, we announced an assignment with AIG, where BlackRock will manage up to $150 billion of AIG's investment portfolio and execute an Aladdin mandate, roughly $400 million from this assignment funded during the second quarter. At present, we expect the Aladdin contract to be executed and the majority of the remaining AIG assets to be funded during the second half of 2022.\nBlackRock's institutional index business generated net inflows of $21 billion led by continued strength in LDI solutions. Across institutional and retail clients, demand for alternatives continued with nearly $5 billion of net inflows across liquid and illiquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by private credit, infrastructure and private equity.\nFundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $36 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.\nFinally, with cash becoming a more attractive asset class as rates rise, BlackRock's cash management platform generated $21 billion of net inflows in the second quarter, benefiting from the investments we've made to build this business in recent years. Net inflows were driven by U.S. government mandates and included inflows from Circle as we became the primary manager of their USDC cash reserves. In a rising rate environment, BlackRock is well positioned to grow market share by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology and risk management on behalf of liquidity clients.\nAs BlackRock has demonstrated throughout our history, challenging environments create unique opportunities for future growth, and we've always emerged stronger and more deeply connected with our clients. While we are not immune to market headwinds, the last few months have only given us more conviction and our strategy and ability to deliver differentiated growth over the long term. The diversification and breadth of our platform enabled us to serve clients across market environments, and we believe BlackRock is as well positioned as ever to meet the needs of all stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nChairman & CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. The first half of 2022 brought on a combination of macro financial and economic challenges that investors haven't seen in decades. Rising energy prices disrupted supply chains in hawkish pivots of central banks to confront inflation has sparked the real assessment of growth, profitability and risk across financial markets.\nCentral banks are trying to rein in supply-driven inflation running at multi-decade highs without triggering a deep recession. Demand in the economy now is about the same as it was in pre-COVID. But as pandemic restrictions have lifted, we're seeing that it's easier to restart demand than it is to restart supply. Countries and companies were already reevaluating their interdependencies following supply chain disruptions during the pandemic. And the Russian invasion Ukraine has only intensified the prioritization of supply chain resiliency, and security over cost of these supply chains and efficiencies of these supply chains.\nIn the United States, the Fed's effort to fight inflation through faster rate hikes helped push the U.S. dollar to a 20-year high in the quarter, impacting consumers companies, portfolios in the United States and around the world. U.S. companies with international businesses, including BlackRock, are facing foreign exchange headwinds impacting the value of their overseas earnings. Markets are reflecting investor anxiety as investors evaluate the potential impact of these pressures. 2022 ranks as a worst start in 50 years for both stocks and bonds. With global equity markets down 20% and the aggregate bond index down about 10%.\nWhile BlackRock is not immune to these markets and foreign exchange headwinds, we see it as an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with all our clients worldwide. And it is during these uncertain times like these, that the resiliency and diversification of our platform is most evident. BlackRock generated $175 billion of total net inflows in the first half of 2022, including $90 billion in the second quarter. And these flows do not yet include any funding of the significant portion of the large client mandate we announced last quarter.\nThe substantial organic growth demonstrates our ability to deliver industry-leading flows even in these most challenging environments. Even after the worst first half declines in decades, BlackRock's assets are over -- are up over $2.5 trillion since the beginning of 2019. And what I'm most impressed with -- at the same period, we generated $1.5 trillion of AUM through organic growth alone. No one else in the industry has come close to that. Our strategic investments over the years, including iShares, ETFs, private markets, active whole portfolio solutions at Aladdin have allowed us to build a comprehensive platform to solve our clients' needs across market environments.\nI cannot think of a time when BlackRock's strategic focus has been better aligned to the market and the needs of our clients than it is today. We see more and more clients looking for a partner who can provide a truly whole portfolio approach across index, across active in cash, across private markets, but all underpinned by global insights and our industry-leading risk management technology.\nOnly BlackRock can offer that. That is why clients are entrusting us with more of their portfolios. That is why BlackRock has seen such a substantial increase in OCIO mandates. That is why we had record Aladdin mandates this year. Connectivity with clients is even more important in a volatile and uncertain environment. Our clients more than ever are turning to BlackRock to help them navigate uncertainty. There have been incredible demand for clients for insight from BlackRock.\nDuring the recent months of volatility, we have hosted numerous large-scale events to share our market outlook. In addition, our direct connectivity with our clients. In the first half of the year, the BlackRock Investment Institute had hosted calls reaching a record number of clients, providing unique global insights, further amplifying our connectivity and reinforcing our voice with our clients globally. This connectivity enables us to better understand the challenges our clients are facing. And our comprehensive solutions have enabled us to help clients reallocate risk, rebalance, increase liquidity and capture opportunities in response to market moves.\nOur iShares business is one of the examples where our continuous innovation has allowed us to deliver new solutions for clients and for -- growth for the firm. 20 years ago, in December of 2002, iShares launched the first U.S. domicile bond ETF, innovation that went on to break down many barriers in fixed income investing.\nToday, both individual investors and large institutions are using bond ETFs for convenient, efficient exposures to thousands of global bonds and to make quick specialized recalibrations to their portfolio. In other words, they're using bond ETFs for active investing. The challenges associated with high inflation to rising interest rates are attracting more first-time bond ETF users and prompting existing investors to find new ways to use ETFs in their portfolios for active investing.\nIn the second quarter, we generated $31 billion of fixed income ETF net inflows led by record flows in the month of May. Fixed income ETFs once again delivered the market quality that clients expected from us in stressed markets, providing liquidity, providing price transparency. U.S. fixed in ETF trading volume reached new records. In fact, the second quarter average volumes was up over 50% compared to last year.\nOur growth this quarter highlights the diversity of our fixed income ETF product range and our ability to serve clients as their needs change. As we still see this is the early days of a major transformation of how people invest in fixed income, we expect the bond ETF industry will nearly triple and reach $5 trillion in AUM at the end of the decade, driving significant growth in the broader ETF industry. When you consider that we build our fixed income ETF platform in an extremely low yield environment, it is particularly exciting to consider how rising rates will bring a whole new set of investors into these funds.\nBeyond liquidity and market access, investors also turned to iShares ETF for long-term investments. We saw growth in each of our ETF product categories in the quarter for $52 billion of total ETF net inflows. BlackRock's active platform demonstrated continued momentum in systematic equities, LifePath target-date, alternative strategies and great opportunities in our industry-leading fixed income platform like SIO.\nWe believe we'll outpace industry flows and active management due to our strong long-term investment performance and our diversified platform. While market volatility impacted shorter-term performance in some funds, long-term performance remains strong with approximately 85% of our active taxable fixed income and fundamental equity AUM above medium and benchmark here for the 5-year period.\nThe diversity of our broad investment management platform enables us to capture changes in demand within active or as investors change our allocations to index or private markets. We saw this phenomenon in fixed income during the quarter where active fixed income net outflows were offset by inflows in fixed income ETFs and index LDI strategies as certain clients look to reallocate or immunize their portfolios. We also saw it as client demand shifted to cash as the interest rate environment improved, and we continue to see strong demand for illiquid alternative strategies with clients growing their allocations to private markets to improve portfolio diversification and to fix sources of yield and uncorrelated returns.\nIn alternatives, we raised nearly $8 billion through committed and net flows across liquid and illiquid strategies. In liquid, flows were driven by private credit and infrastructure and liquid flows were led by our systematic multi-strategy funds, which takes a credit-oriented approach. Since 2021, BlackRock raised over $55 billion of gross capital across our entire alternatives platform.\nOne of the biggest long-term opportunities in alternatives will be the intersection of infrastructure and sustainability. Recent supply shocks have only increased the focus on energy security and compounded the need for infrastructure investments. Last month, we announced it a perpetual infrastructure strategy that will partner with leading infrastructure businesses over the long term to help drive the energy transition from shades of brown to shades of green. This will help address the historic long-term investment opportunity presented by the global transition to a low-carbon economy.\nBy 2050, an estimated $125 trillion of investments is needed globally to reach a net 0. That applies an annual investment needs to grow to over $4 trillion compared to the $1 trillion a year -- that is being achieved this year. As a fiduciary, we're working with clients to help them understand, to help them navigate and for clients to choose and help that transition.\nBlackRock's cash management platform reached record AUM levels in the quarter and generated $21 billion of net inflows. Surging short-term rates, flattening yield curves and now an inverted yield curve has made cash not just a safe place, but now also a more profitable place as investors wait as they evaluate how to optimize their portfolios for the future. Even during low rate environments, we invested in our cash business and have grown our share, positioning us well to benefit from the resurgence of client demand as rates rise.\nBlackRock's diverse cash management offerings, including governments, prime municipals, ESG strategies allow us to serve all our clients' cash allocation needs. Market volatility, growing cost pressures and increasing complexities and optimizing whole portfolios have only underscored the need for robust enterprise operating and risk management technology. The value of Aladdin's integrated end-to-end technology platform and leading risk analytics became particularly evident in these market conditions. When portfolio managers needed real-time information, sophisticated tools to manage risk exposures and make investment decisions. We saw record Aladdin [client] (corrected by company after the call) mandates in the first half of 2022, expanding our range of technology solutions with strong demand for our newer capabilities, including Aladdin accounting, eFront and whole portfolio view.\nThe market environment has also reinforced the need for offerings like Aladdin Wealth. Users of Aladdin Wealth by financial advisers at our largest clients have increased by more than 40% since the onset of market turbulence this year as financial advisers look to assess portfolio risk for all their clients for their entire business.\nBlackRock's technology and risk management capabilities are also supporting the growth of our OCIO business. Since the beginning of 2019 and with the anticipated funding of the $150 billion AIG mandate later this year, we all have raised over $430 billion for major OCIO and fixed income insurance outsourcing assignments. As the trend towards outsourcing increases, BlackRock is well positioned to capture this opportunity and be a trusted partner for our clients.\nAnother major trend defining our industry over the past several years has been interest in sustainable investing. And we continue to see strong client demand for sustainable strategies. BlackRock manages nearly $475 billion in dedicated sustainable AUM on behalf of our clients, and we saw over $20 billion of net inflows across active index and cash management in the quarter.\nOne note -- particularly noteworthy strategy we announced in May was an $800 million commitment raised for the BlackRock Impact Opportunity Fund. This fund is first of its kind, a return-seeking multi-alternative strategy that invest in businesses and projects owned and led by or serving people of color.\nThe topic of sustainable investing has sparked a lot of debate in recent months. In many ways, it reminds me my early days being in the mortgage market. When I started my career working as a mortgage trader in the 1970s, shocking? Mortgage loans were first being securitized into bonds. There were lots of questions from investors, lots of questions from policymakers, lots of questions from regulators alike. While the mortgage market has since had many ups and downs, it is today a $10 trillion market. And with the appropriate underwriting standards, it has played a vital role in delivering attractive returns to investors and making homeownership affordable for millions.\nJust 2 years ago, the sustainable investing was not a priority for many clients. It is now one of the fastest-growing segments of the asset management industry, and one of the topics our clients are asking more questions than in any part of our business. I continue to believe that we are in the early days of this trend. Two years ago, I said, I believe it will fundamentally reshape finance. I still believe that. But as in the early days of the mortgage market, there are a lot of questions. And with the mortgage market, the key to avoiding excesses and missteps is through better data and through better analytics. That's why BlackRock is so focused on leveraging and creating better ESG data and analytics to help our clients better understand risk and opportunities in their portfolio, including those related to global transition to a low-carbon economy.\nESG data indexing is still an evolving area. And we are working with our partners to assess and refine the best available data to help our clients meet their investment objectives in alignment with ESG preferences. We have long encouraged companies to report on sustainability issues so that investors better analyze how companies are navigating the transition to a low-carbon economy and other critical investment considerations. We believe that common taxonomy and coordinated high-quality disclosure framework will allow investors to more effectively compare data across companies and geographies.\nWe must also recognize that the energy transition itself is a journey and will not occur overnight. It is not going to be a straight line. It can only work if the energy transition is fair and just. To ensure that the continuity of affordable energy during the transition, companies will need to invest in both fossil fuels like natural gas and renewable sources of energy. That is why we are working with energy companies throughout the world who are essentially meeting society's energy needs, and we will play a critical role in helping any successful transition.\nAnother area that has been increasingly interested with our clients as digital assets. BlackRock has been studying the ecosystem, particularly in areas that are relevant to our clients, including stablecoin, crypto assets, tokenization, permissional blockchains. Last quarter, we announced our minority investment in Circle, a global Internet payment company, an issuer of USD coin. A stable coin that is one of the fastest-growing digital assets in the world. As part of our relationship, we became their primary manager of their USDC cash reserves with assets invested entirely in short-term U.S. treasuries.\nThe digital asset space is a developing area that has attracted increased attention from investors and policymakers, and we are encouraged by the discussion of the debate that is occurring about the creation and implementation of an appropriate regulatory approach and framework. The crypto asset market has witnessed a steep downturn in valuations over recent months, but we are still seeing more interest from institutional clients about how to efficiently access these assets, using our technology and product capability. This is a space that we are continuing to explore to help our clients who want to learn more and to help them who wanted to participate in these assets and to do it in a transparent and an efficient way.\nBlackRock continues to innovate in a variety of areas to expand the choices we offer clients to help them achieve their goals. Last fall, we announced the BlackRock Voting Choice initiative, which uses technology to help eligible institutional clients participate and proxy voting decisions. In the second quarter, we further expanded the opportunities for eligible clients, including public and private pension funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds to participate in proxy voting decisions.\nFollowing years of work on technology and regulatory barriers, nearly half of our clients' index equity assets including pension funds representing more than 60 million people have simple and efficient options to vote their preferences if they choose. The client assets currently available for voting choice nearly 25% are held by clients who have so far elected to exercise their own voting preference, and we're working to expand choice even further. We're committed to a future where every investor, even individual investors can ultimately have the option to participate in proxy voting processes as they choose.\nOver the course of BlackRock's 34-year history, and in the years since the financial crisis and our acquisition of BGI, markets have experienced various periods of volatility and uncertainty. BlackRock has always come through stronger. It is through periods like this, clients more deeply connected with BlackRock's platform, and we have more opportunities to work with our clients to continue to differentiate ourselves, and we are working with more and more of our stakeholders worldwide. We have always emphasized the connection between BlackRock taking a long-term view of our business and delivering differentiating growth for our shareholders. Many of BlackRock's biggest successes have grown out of times of uncertainty and disruption. I see more opportunities for BlackRock today than ever before, and I'm incredibly excited about our future.\nAs we look to realize those opportunities, we will continue to invest for the future and evolve ahead of our clients' changing needs. The diversification, the resiliency of our platform allows us to pursue critical investments while maintaining our focus on expenses and our own margins.\nWe'll continue to manage what we can control, bringing together the entire firm to serve every one of our clients, big or small, to strategically invest in the highest growth opportunity in the future, leveraging our scale to deliver benefits to our clients and operating more efficiently. We will continue to drive forward on our commitments to our clients, to our shareholders, to our employees. And as I said earlier, I believe that BlackRock's position has never been stronger.\nWith that, operator, let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Myra, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. First Quarter 2022 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink, Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. (Operator Instructions) Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nSenior MD, General Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary Stephen Shedlin\n\nSenior MD & CFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2022. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I'll be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. As many of you know, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we updated our definitions of as-adjusted operating income, operating margin and net income to exclude the impact of intangible asset amortization, other acquisition-related costs and contingent consideration fair value adjustments. We believe that excluding the impact of these expenses provides investors and management with a more useful understanding of our financial performance over time while also increasing comparability with other asset management companies. BlackRock regularly reviews our disclosures with the goal of providing helpful information to our investors, and we may consider additional non-GAAP adjustments in the future. .\nTo provide consistent comparisons to historical results, we recast quarterly as-adjusted metrics to account for these changes for 2020 and 2021. This recast was posted on BlackRock's Investor Relations website in late March and also has been included on Pages 12 and 13 of our earnings release while year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials.\nBlackRock's performance in the first quarter once again underscores the strength of our platform and our ability to serve clients in a variety of market conditions. We've invested for years to diversify our platform and to develop industry-leading franchises in ETFs, private markets, technology, active management and sustainable investing. These successful multiyear investments have enabled us to deepen our solutions-oriented relationships with clients and have strengthened and diversified our organic revenue growth profile.\nBlackRock generated total net flows of $86 billion in the first quarter, representing 3% annualized organic asset growth with $114 billion of long-term net inflows partially offset by $27 billion of generally seasonal cash management outflows. Quarterly long-term net inflows were positive across all asset classes, investment styles and regions. Annualized organic base fee growth of 2% reflected the impact of 2 sizable institutional index mandates and strong flows into core equity ETFs during the quarter.\nFirst quarter revenue of $4.7 billion increased 7% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.8 billion rose 14% reflecting the impact of approximately $185 million of closed-end fund launch costs in the first quarter of 2021. Earnings per share of $9.52 was up 18% compared to a year ago, also reflecting a lower effective tax rate and a lower diluted share count partially offset by lower nonoperating income in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $29 million of net investment losses driven primarily by mark-to-market declines in the value of unhedged seed capital investments.\nOur as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was approximately 17% and included $133 million of discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to stock-based compensation awards that vest in the first quarter of each year. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2022, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation.\nFirst quarter base fee and securities lending revenue of $3.8 billion was up 7% year-over-year primarily driven by 8% organic base fee growth over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fee and securities lending revenue was down 3%, reflecting in part the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our effective fee rate was essentially flat compared to the fourth quarter as the negative impact of divergent equity beta was offset by lower discretionary money market fee waivers. We incurred approximately $75 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers in the first quarter. However, waivers for our flagship funds were essentially removed following rate hikes by the Bank of England and Federal Reserve in March. Recall that approximately 50% of gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, so the benefit to base fees is partially offset by higher distribution expense.\nPerformance fees of $98 million decreased from a year ago primarily reflected lower revenue from liquid alternative and long-only products partially offset by higher fees from illiquid alternatives. Recent market volatility could result in a reduced ability to earn performance fees from certain liquid alternative and long-only products during the remainder of 2022.\nQuarterly technology services revenue increased 11% from a year ago. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 13% year-over-year, and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering low to mid-teens ACV growth as we see strong demand for Aladdin's end-to-end cloud-based SaaS capabilities.\nTotal expense increased 3% year-over-year driven primarily by higher compensation expense. Recall that expense in the first quarter of 2021 included $185 million of closed-end fund launch costs, which are excluded when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 7% year-over-year, reflecting higher base compensation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation driven in part by the lower mark-to-market impact of certain deferred cash compensation programs.\nG&A expense was down 17% year-over-year, reflecting the previously mentioned closed-end fund launch costs in the first quarter of 2021. Excluding these costs, G&A expense increased 19% from a year ago due to ongoing strategic investments in technology, including the migration of Aladdin to the cloud, along with increases in marketing and promotional expense, including higher T&E expense associated with our return-to-office strategy. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased 12% primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and lower professional services and occupancy expense, partially offset by higher technology expense.\nDisclosure enhancements introduced this quarter include the addition of a separate G&A expense line item for subadvisory expense, which historically was included within portfolio services expense. We hope this will provide more transparency into costs associated with the successful growth of our OCIO business, which are more than offset by associated base fees. As Larry will discuss in more detail, momentum in our OCIO business is accelerating as the trend towards outsourcing increases, and BlackRock is well positioned to capture this opportunity.\nDirect fund expense increased 3% year-over-year primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. Sequentially, quarterly direct fund expense increased despite lower average index AUM due to higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter.\nOur first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 160 basis points from a year ago primarily reflecting the ongoing strategic investments we are making in technology and our people. As we stated in January, our business has never been better positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us. We are increasingly seeing clients looking for ways to optimize portfolio returns at a lower cost by forging deeper relationships with fewer managers, including fully outsourced relationships. These trends favor global, comprehensive and scaled platforms like BlackRock's as evidenced by several such wins over the recent quarters, and we see more opportunities ahead.\nAs always, we remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We have deep conviction in the stability of our diverse business model, which has demonstrated strong resilience in a variety of markets and our ability to proactively manage our cost structure. In the near term, we remain focused on the opportunity set ahead of us and are continuing to invest responsibly to support our growth and to drive our strategic initiatives. We continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base, and we will continue to be prudent in reevaluating our overall level of spend if market conditions necessitate us doing so.\nOur capital management strategy remains, first, to invest in our business; and then to return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. We continue to invest through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success through seed and co-investments to support organic growth and through strategic investments to further accelerate our efforts.\nAs Larry will discuss in more detail, earlier this week, we announced a minority investment in Circle, the operator of the market infrastructure for USDC, a dollar-based fully reserved stable coin and one of the fastest-growing digital assets with more than $52 billion in circulation. Circle's technology currently enables the frictionless and real-time transfer of payments and is being explored for other applications across the financial ecosystem.\nWe previously announced an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend to $4.88 per share of common stock and repurchased $500 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we still anticipate repurchasing at least $375 million of shares per quarter for the balance of the year, consistent with our previous guidance in January.\nAs you'll also hear from Larry, BlackRock relationships with our clients have never been stronger, and they continue to turn to BlackRock to help them meet their long-term investment needs. BlackRock's first quarter and total net inflows of $86 billion were positive across client channels and regions highlighting the breadth of our platform. ETFs generated net inflows of $56 billion, representing 7% annualized organic asset and 4% annualized organic base fee growth. Results once again highlight the unique diversity of our ETF product segments supported by particularly strong flows in core equity, sustainable and commodity ETFs.\nThe diversity of our ETF franchise enables us to generate durable, industry-leading organic revenue growth in varying macroeconomic environments. For example, as inflation expectations persisted, investors turn to our commodity ETFs, where we are now the clear category leader, and as Larry will highlight, our bond ETFs gathered net inflows in one of the most challenging quarters for fixed income in recent history.\nRetail net inflows of $10 billion were positive in both the U.S. and internationally and reflected strength in equities, liquid alternatives and active multi-asset funds. BlackRock's institutional franchise generated $47 billion of net inflows as our global scale, investment expertise and world-class technology and risk management enable us to increasingly serve as the partner of choice for institutional clients.\nBlackRock's institutional active franchise generated $16 billion of net inflows, led by continued growth into our LifePath target date, alternatives and systematic active equity offerings. Institutional index net inflows of $31 billion included approximately $70 billion from 2 large institutional clients with whom we have deep relationships, spanning multiple investment strategies.\nDemand for alternatives also continued with $6 billion of net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the quarter driven by private credit, infrastructure and liquid alternative offerings. Fundraising momentum remains strong, and we have approximately $36 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.\nOur $330 billion alternatives and liquid credit platform has gained significant momentum over recent years. And to provide increased visibility, starting this quarter, we're including additional detail in our earnings supplement on AUM and committed capital managed by our alternatives team.\nOverall, BlackRock generated approximately $20 billion of active net inflows during the quarter and has now generated positive active flows in all but 1 quarter since the beginning of 2019. Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw net outflows of $27 billion driven by redemptions from offshore prime and U.S. government money market funds, in line with the broader money market fund industry.\nBlackRock has steadily grown our share of the cash management industry by leveraging our scale and delivering innovative distribution and risk management solutions for clients. We are an existing manager of the cash reserves that underpin USDC, and we look forward to partnering with Circle to expand that relationship and become their primary manager in the future.\nIn summary, our first quarter results once again highlight the benefits of the investments we've made in high-growth areas to diversify and strengthen our platform. Many of the areas in which we are generating strong growth today, such as alternatives and ESG, were not significant contributors just a few years ago. As a result, we are better able to deliver resilient organic growth and develop deeper client relationships today than at any point in BlackRock's history. Our commitment remains to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible, and we will do so responsibly to meet the needs of all stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nChairman & CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As I wrote to shareholders last month, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has created a humanitarian tragedy and is impacting not only geopolitics but also the global economies.\nIt's going to fundamentally alter the path of globalization that we've seen over the past 30 years. The flow of goods and people across borders will still be critical to economic growth and new technologies will continue to shrink geographic distances, but countries and companies are reevaluating their interdependencies in a way that we have not seen since the end of the Cold War.\nAs a fiduciary, BlackRock is working to understand how these structural changes will impact our client portfolios, and we will help them pursue their long-term financial goals. The breadth and scale of BlackRock's platform enables us to serve clients in all market environments. We invested over many years to build a comprehensive investment platform, industry-leading technology and a global footprint with local expertise. By evolving ahead of the needs of our clients, we have grown as a trusted partner to all our clients.\nWe constantly work to provide our clients with that type of insight, but close connectivity becomes even more important during periods of market volatility and uncertainty. Over the last 2 months, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, BlackRock held over 200 client engagements and hosted market update calls attended by more than 4,600 clients.\nI also recently visited clients in Japan and the Middle East and here in the United States, many of whom are trying to understand how geopolitical and macroeconomic shifts might impact their investment outcomes. I remember the same heightened level of connectivity with our clients during the initial weeks of the pandemic in spring 2020.\nI believe our relationships with clients have never been stronger. Our clients appreciate our voice and our consistent advocacy for long-term investing on their behalf. Our first quarter's result demonstrates these strengths. BlackRock generated $114 billion in net long-term inflows in the first quarter, demonstrating the breadth of our asset management platform and positive flows across all product types all investment styles in all regions.\nOrganic growth in the quarter included 2 significant client mandates, reflecting our ability to deepen partnerships and build a comprehensive relationship with clients globally. We also saw a 13% ACV growth in technology services as more clients recognize the benefits of Aladdin. I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and we will continue to invest for the future.\nThroughout our 23-year history as a public company, we have demonstrated that we are intentional about our investment spend and focused on our margins. I have found that often, in times of market uncertainty, that is the greatest opportunity that we could find. BlackRock's breadth and resilience enables us to play offense when others may be pulling back. Our agility in responding to opportunities and continued investments across market cycles have driven our industry-leading growth, our consistent growth and generated value for our shareholders.\nOur investments are closely aligned with our strategy to keep [Alpha] at the heart of BlackRock, accelerated growth in iShares, in private markets and Aladdin to deliver a whole portfolio advice and solutions to our clients and be the global leader in sustainable investing.\nOur clients are trying to understand the implications of the rapidly changing investment environment. The Russian invasion of Ukraine marks a profound geopolitical shift that is accelerating a reassessment of global supply chains. It also creates a supply shock in commodities that is further increasing inflation. Even before the war, inflation was already top of mind for many investors as the effect of the pandemic, including the shift in consumer demand from services to capital goods, labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks, broad inflation in the United States, in Canada and the United Kingdom, across European Union to the highest level in decades.\nCentral banks are in a difficult position as we look to carefully raise rates to contain inflation without harming economic activity and employment. They may eventually have to live with a supply-driven inflation rather than take policy rates above neutral levels. However, they may be forced to be more aggressive policy stance of inflation expectations become unchartered.\nBond markets have been quick to price in the Fed's rate projections and saw one of the worst quarters on record for the U.S. bond market. The market was down or the U.S. aggregate index was down more than 5%. Equity markets, on the other hand, has shown some resilience. Following significant market volatility in the first quarter, U.S. and European broad market indexes regained some of their losses and ended down the quarter around 5% and 6%, respectively.\nAs always, BlackRock remains guided by our clients' needs, and we constantly evolve so we could be better serving them. Clients increasingly want to work with fewer partners who could provide more, and BlackRock is uniquely positioned to capture opportunities as clients consolidate their investment providers. We have the investment expertise. We have the operational excellence and the technology capabilities work with clients of all types and sizes, and we are well positioned to help them meet their objectives and to serve all of their own stakeholders.\nThe global insurance industry, for example, is undergoing significant transformation as insurers optimize their operating model and leverage outsourced investment management solutions. We have built a leading insurance platform [compromising] fixed income investment specialists, insurance advisory expertise and added analytical capabilities to deliver the best of BlackRock to our insurance clients.\nWe are also seeing the results of these investments through deeper relationships with all our clients, and significant opportunities are in front of us today. Last month, we announced the significant assignment with AIG, spanning asset management and Aladdin. BlackRock will manage up to $150 billion of AIG and its life and retirement company's investment portfolio.\nThis is another great example of one BlackRock effort, to bring together our platform, to serve our clients in a way that no other asset manager can do. All of us here at BlackRock take a deep responsibility in managing every dollar for every client who awards us money from institutions entrusting us with their whole portfolios to that individual investor using one of our ETFs in their first investment account.\nIn the first quarter, we once again saw investors using ETFs to quickly allocate capital and the managed risk during periods of volatility. In the U.S., iShares' secondary trading volumes were up nearly 40% compared to 2021 levels providing clients worldwide with the liquidity they needed in volatile markets.\nWe generated $56 billion of ETF net inflows in the first quarter with growth coming from each of our major product categories, including core strategic and precision ETFs. In fixed income ETFs, we generated $8 billion in net inflows for the quarter. Similar to equity ETFs, we are seeing more investors adopt and use fixed income ETFs to gain market exposure and for tactical positioning within their fixed income exposures. We saw demand for treasury, short duration, inflation-linked, sustainable munis and broad-based market exposures would more than offset risk-off sentiments in areas like high yield and emerging markets.\nOur growth in fixed income ETFs highlight the diversity of our fixed income ETF product range and our ability to deliver the market qualities clients expect in stressed markets. The liquidity, the transparency and lower transaction costs of fixed income ETFs present a more efficient way for investors to access the entire bond market. We believe that our fixed income ETFs will benefit from more long-term secular tailwinds that play a significant role in the modernization of the $100 trillion bond market.\nBlackRock generated $20 billion of active net inflows across our active equities, multi-asset and alternative strategies. Investment performance remains strong over the long term, positioning us well for future growth with 86% and 81% of our taxable fixed and fundamental active equities above benchmark or peer medium for the 3-year, respectively, and for the 5-year period. 90% of our taxable fixed income, 83% of our fundamental active equity AUM is above benchmark or peer medium. In the U.S., 75% of our active mutual funds are in a Morningstar 4- or 5-rated fund, and we continue to generate growth and capture market share across the U.S. active mutual fund franchise in the first quarter.\nIn alternatives, we generated $6 billion of net inflows across liquid and illiquid strategies led by private credit and infrastructure. And we're continuing to steadily deploy assets on behalf of our clients, including another $5 billion in the first quarter. Deployment activity was led by our climate finance partnership strategy that we announced last year, which seeks to accelerate the flow of capital into climate-related investments in the emerging markets. One of the biggest opportunities in alternatives in the years ahead will be the intersection of infrastructure and sustainability.\nIn response to the energy shocks caused by the war in Ukraine, many countries around the world are reevaluating their energy dependencies and are looking for new sources of energy. This may mean increasing production of traditional energy sources in the near term. But I believe recent events will accelerate the shift towards greener sources of energy in many parts of the world over the long term, and we will see a tremendous changes in the energy transition. This presents a significant long-term opportunity for investments in infrastructure, renewable, clean tech on behalf of our clients.\nBlackRock has one of the largest renewable power platforms in the industry, managing over $8 billion of assets and client commitments. And we are expanding our transition-focused investment strategies. BlackRock is committed to be helping clients navigate this energy transition. We are working with energy companies throughout the world who are essential in meeting society's energy needs. It will play a critical role in any successful transition. To ensure the continuity of affordable energy prices during the transition, fossil fuels like natural gas will be important as a transition fuel.\nBlackRock is also investing on behalf of our clients in natural gas pipelines. For example, in the Middle East, we invested in one of the largest pipelines for natural gas, which will help the region utilize less oil for power production. These investments are a great example of helping countries go from dark brown to lighter brown as a substitute oil with a cleaner base fuel like natural gas. Client demand for sustainable investments, more broadly, also continue to be strong. We saw a $19 billion of long-term net inflows into both our active and index sustainable strategies in the first quarter.\nOur ability to partner with clients across the whole portfolio and quickly adapt to rapidly shifting market environments continues to drive demand for Aladdin's integrated end-to-end technology platform. BlackRock remains focused on investing in Aladdin to support its areas, such as chapters of growth, and extending its capabilities into areas like whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and sustainable investment solutions.\nWe see the value proposition of Aladdin deeply resonating with clients, and we generated a 13% technological service ACV growth over -- year-over-year. Clients are increasingly combining Aladdin with our newer offerings such as eFront or Aladdin accounting, highlighting the benefits of our continuous innovations and investments to stay ahead of our clients' needs. Our Aladdin client relationships are long term in nature, and we will have historically seen industry-leading contract renewable rates.\nThe recent market environment has also reinforced the need for offerings like Aladdin Wealth. Usage of Aladdin Wealth by financial advisers at our clients has increased by more than 40% during the first quarter as financial advisers look to assess portfolio risk, to assess market exposures across every one of their clients across their entire business. We have over 2 dozen global client -- Aladdin Wealth clients and expect further growth to come from expansion into different wealth segments and in markets around the world.\nWe are increasingly interest -- seeing interest from our clients that BlackRock is also studying digital assets and their associated ecosystem, including crypto assets, stable coin, tokenization and permission blockchains, where we see a potential to benefit our clients and capital markets more broadly. Earlier this week, we announced that BlackRock made a minority investment in Circle, a global Internet payment firm and the sole issuer of USD coin, a dollar-based fully reserved stablecoin, which is one of the fastest-growing digital assets in the world. BlackRock is already the manager of USDC cash reserves, and we look forward to begin expanding our relationship to become the primary manager of the cash reserves.\nOver the past year that we have worked with Circle, we have been so impressed with their mission, their management team, their technology and their thoughtful approach to growth. BlackRock has always led by listening to our clients, by anticipating and embracing change and investing in ahead of their future needs.\nLet me say again, we are very honored by the deep trust our clients place in us. My recent meetings with our clients around the world have only strengthened my conviction in the opportunities that BlackRock has in front of us. I believe we have never been better positioned for our future.\nAs always, I'm incredibly proud of our employees who live our principles, who are staying true to our purpose and are focusing on the long-term needs of our shareholders, the long-term needs of our clients, the needs of our colleagues and the needs and long-term issues that are impacting the communities where we work every day. With that, let's open it up for questions.",

My name is Jerome, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade.\n(Operator Instructions)\nThank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher Joseph Meade\n\nSenior MD, General Counsel & Chief Legal Officer, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, (inaudible) which was some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today, but processes no duty not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary Stephen Shedlin\n\nSenior MD & CFO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chris. Good morning, and Happy New Year to everyone. I hope everyone and their families are remaining safe and healthy.\nIt's my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. Before I turn it over to Larry, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, as always, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.\nThrough our BlackRock's history, we have consistently and systematically invested in our business with a long-term focus and commitment to serving clients, employees, shareholders and the communities in which we operate. As a result of these long-term investments in 2021, we grew organically at our fastest rate ever and continue to expand our organic growth premium versus the industry even as our assets under management reached new highs. We have continually invested to develop industry-leading franchises in ETF, private markets, technology, our active investment platform and more recently in ESG and in China. These investments all reflect a singular focus on helping clients construct resilient (inaudible) portfolios and they are driving the record levels of growth we're seeing today. BlackRock generated net inflows of $540 billion in 2021, representing 6% organic asset growth and 11% organic base fee growth. Each of our strategic priority areas drove significant growth during the year. Importantly, despite fourth quarter volatility, we finished the year with strong momentum, generating $212 billion of total net inflows, reflecting annualized organic base fee growth of 9%. Continued strong flows from our entire active franchise, along with record iShares flows, which benefited from typical year-end rebalancing and tax management contributed to the fourth quarter's robust organic growth. We continue to build out our platform in 2021 as the strength and stability of our operating model allowed us to aggressively reinvest in our business, deliver record financial results and return approximately $3.7 billion of capital to shareholders.\nFull year revenue of $19.4 billion was up 20%, operating income of $7.5 billion rose 19% and earnings per share of $39.18 was up 16% versus 2020. For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $5.1 billion and operating income of $2.1 billion, up 14% and 11%, respectively, from a year ago. Quarterly earnings per share of $10.42 was up 2% versus a year ago, reflecting a higher effective tax rate and lower nonoperating income in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $86 million of net investment income, driven primarily by mark-to-market gains in our private equity total investment portfolio. Our as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 25% driven in part by discrete items.\nWe currently estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2022, though the actual effective tax rate may differ because of nonrecurring or discrete items or potential changes in tax legislation. Fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue of $4 billion was up 17% year-over-year, primarily driven by 11% organic base fee growth and the positive impact of market data on average AUM, partially offset by higher discretionary money market fee waivers versus a year ago and strategic pricing investments over the last year. Sequentially, fourth quarter base fees and securities lending revenue was up approximately 1%. Our fourth quarter annualized effective fee rate decreased by [2 tenths of a basis point] from the third quarter as the continued positive impact of strong organic base fee growth was more than offset by the negative impact of divergent equity beta, which accelerated into quarter end and lower securities lending revenue in the current quarter. We incurred approximately $135 million of gross discretionary yield support waivers in the fourth quarter, essentially the same as the third quarter, bringing total labor to approximately $500 million for the full year. Given the current prospects for higher rates in the near term, we now anticipate most of these waivers would see shortly after the first 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate, resulting in a [1 half] basis point increase to our annualized effective fee rate. Recall that approximately 50% of these gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, reducing the impact on operating income.\nFor the year, we generated record performance fees of $1.1 billion, which were increasingly diversified compared to a year ago and reflected strong alpha generation across our platform. Notably, since a year ago, performance fees from liquid alternatives have increased more than 150%, and our unrecognized deferred carry balance has more than doubled to over $1.4 billion as our private markets platform continues to scale. Quarterly technology services revenue was up 11% year-over-year, and full year revenue of $1.3 billion increased 12%. Annual contract value, or ACV, increased 13% year-over-year and we remain confident in our ability to continue delivering low to mid-teens ACV growth as demand for Aladdin's end-to-end cloud-based SaaS solution is stronger than ever.\nWe are heavily investing -- heavily investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth in order to extend our capabilities in high demand areas such as the whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and sustainability. Total expense increased 20% in 2021 driven primarily by higher compensation, G&A and direct fund expense. For the full year, compensation expense increased 20%, reflecting higher base salaries and higher incentive compensation driven by growth in operating income and higher deferred compensation expense. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine final full year compensation in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter G&A expense increased 15% year-over-year, reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense, which included higher T&D expense, higher occupancy expense partially driven by higher COVID testing costs and higher portfolio services and technology expense.\nFor the full year, excluding approximately $350 million of noncore G&A expense, which included $274 million of aggregate fund launch costs, core G&A expense was up 15% compared to 2020. Recall that we exclude the impact of fund launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin. The year-over-year increase in core G&A was largely attributable to technology, data and portfolio services expense, all of which drive revenue growth. Increased technology and data spend was driven by our Aladdin cloud migration market data investments to support our index and ESG franchises and broader tech spend to support productivity improvements. Approximately 2/3 of the increase in our 2021 portfolio services expense related to sub-advisory costs associated with significant OCI wins and are offset by associated base fees. 2021 direct fund expense increased 24% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average index AUM. Sequentially, quarterly direct fund expense declined despite higher average index AUM due to higher rebates that seasonally occur in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, full year intangible amortization expense increased $41 million year-over-year due to our Appirio acquisition, which closed in February 2021. Our full year as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up 30 basis points versus 2020. Our business has never been positioned to take advantage of the opportunities before us and we remain deeply committed to investing responsibly and aggressively through market cycles, so we can continue to generate differentiated organic growth over the long term. Consistent with this growth ambition, we are once again targeting record investment in our people, strategic priorities and platform infrastructure during 2022.\nAt present, we would expect headcount to increase by as much as 10% with a continued focus on optimizing our talent pyramid for more junior roles and growing our footprint and iHub innovation centers. We would also expect core G&A to increase by 15% to 20% as we continue to invest in technology to scale our operations and support future growth, including completing Aladdin's cloud migration, delivering new Aladdin capabilities and continuing to open the platform to promote client innovation. We are also investing through prudent use of our balance sheet to best position BlackRock for continued success. During 2021, we allocated $1.5 billion of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth, and our year-end portfolio now approximates $3.7 billion.\nOur strategic minority investments are reinforcing various elements of our strategy and simultaneously generating very attractive returns for our shareholders. And we continue to invest inorganically when we see opportunities to accelerate our organic growth in key strategic growth areas, as we did through our acquisitions of the physical climate and transition risk models of rhodium and Baringa, which will be critical to building best-in-class ESG capabilities within Aladdin.\nWe also remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases and returned an aggregate $3.7 billion to shareholders in 2021. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased over $11 billion of BlackRock's stock, reducing our outstanding total shares by 11% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 20% for our shareholders. At present, based on capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we are targeting the repurchase of $1.5 billion of shares during 2022.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $4.88 per share, representing an increase of 18% over the current level. Finally, in early December, we completed the debt issuance to take advantage of current low interest rates and pre-refinance our $750 million [3 and 3/8] notes to June 2022. We successfully raised $1 billion of new 10-year notes with a 2.1% coupon, the second lowest U.S. dollar coupon in BlackRock's debt stack.\nAs you will hear more from Larry, BlackRock's strategy has always been guided by our clients' needs. We relentlessly focused on helping them meet their financial objectives and our deeper and broader relationships with more clients are driving growth across our entire platform. Fourth quarter total net inflows of $212 billion, representing 9% annualized organic AUM and base fee growth, were led by flows into ETFs and our top-performing active franchise. Record full year net inflows of $540 billion were positive across all client types, investment styles and regions and reflected records for both ETFs and active strategies. ETFs generated $306 billion of net inflows in 2021, representing 11% organic asset growth and 9% organic base fee growth. Record fourth quarter ETF flows of $104 billion reflected some seasonality, but also reflected the diversity of our product and client segments and accelerating secular shifts occurring in the market. We saw continued strength in core but our strategic product segments, particularly sustainable and fixed income were the largest contributors to our fourth quarter flows.\nSustainable ETF AUM of $150 billion nearly doubled during the year and our $750 billion fixed income ETF platform grew organically by double digits, even in one of the most challenging macro environments for fixed income in several years. Clients also continue to use our broad-based precision exposures to express risk on sentiment during the year. BlackRock generated full year retail net inflows of $102 billion, representing 12% organic asset growth and 14% organic base fee growth, significantly outperforming the broader mutual fund industry. Retail flows were positive in both the U.S. and internationally, reflecting broad-based strength across our active platform. Fourth quarter retail net inflows of $22 billion reflected similar trends, but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains and dividend reinvestment. We remain well positioned to meet investor needs for risk-adjusted alpha and yield and our diversified fixed income platform with top-performing strategies across total return, unconstrained, high yield and credit offers choice to investors in any rate environment. Institutional index net outflows of $118 billion in 2021 reflected equity net outflows, including the previously disclosed $58 billion low fee institutional redemption in the second quarter, partially offset by fixed income net inflows as many large clients rebalanced portfolios after significant equity market gains or tactically shifted assets to fixed income and cash.\nBlackRock's institutional active franchise generated a record $169 billion of net inflows in 2021, reflecting broad-based strength across all product categories and the funding of several significant OCIO mandates. We are seeing strong momentum in our OCIO business, evidenced by another significant core fixed income funding in the fourth quarter. We also saw continued growth in our LifePath target date franchise and remain committed to helping investors around the world plan and invest for retirement. In the aggregate, strong growth across active strategies led to 7% organic base fee growth for our institutional channel in 2021. Across retail and institutional client types, BlackRock generated a record $49 billion of active equity net inflows for the full year, led by top-performing franchises in technology, health sciences and U.S. growth equities as well as quantitative strategies. We remain well positioned for future growth in our active platform with over 75% of our fundamental active equity, systematic active equity and taxable fixed income assets performing above their respective benchmarks or pure medians for the trailing 5-year period.\nOverall demand for alternatives also continued, with $27 billion of net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies during the year driven by credit, infrastructure and our multi-strat and global event-driven hedge funds. Total alternatives fundraising (inaudible) to record in 2021, and we have approximately $36 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing over $230 million of future annual base fees and significant potential performance fees.\nFinally, BlackRock's cash management platform generated $44 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and $94 billion of net inflows in 2021 as we continue to grow market share in a persistent low rate environment by leveraging our scale, product breadth, technology and risk management on behalf of clients. It has been another strong year for BlackRock. Our global scale and diverse platform allow us to continue investing for the future, whether in good markets or more challenging ones our differentiated business model remains incredibly well positioned to sustain industry-leading organic growth and deliver long-term shareholder value. Our commitment remains to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible and we will do so responsibly to meet the needs of all stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Larry.\n\nLaurence Douglas Fink\n\nChairman & CEO, BlackRock, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I hope you all have had a healthy and happy holiday season, that all of you are staying safe.\nThroughout BlackRock's history, we have relentlessly focused on helping our clients meet their investment goals and solve their most complex challenges. We have continually invested and reinvested in our business to meet and anticipate our clients' evolving and changing needs and to deliver the most comprehensive global investment and technology platform. Our 2021 results truly demonstrated the benefits of those investments. BlackRock delivered the strongest organic growth in our history even as our assets under management reached new highs.\nWe generated $540 billion in net inflows in 2021, representing a record 11% organic base fee growth. We also ended the year with strong momentum with $212 billion of fourth quarter net inflows, reflecting our 7th consecutive quarter of organic base fee growth above our 5% target. And we have steadily expanded our organic growth premium relative to the industry, relative to our competitors as our clients continue to entrust us with more of their portfolios. Importantly, our growth is more diversified than it's ever been. In 2021, our active platform, including alternatives, contributed $267 billion of inflows representing nearly half of our total net inflows. ETFs remained a significant growth driver with record flows of $306 billion. And our technology services revenues grew by 12%, reaching $1.3 billion. This strong momentum across our entire business drove record financial results. For the year, BlackRock delivered 20% revenue growth, 19% operating income growth, 16% ETFs growth and at the same time, we expanded our margins.\nYears into the pandemic, we continue to confront new virus strains. We're confining divergent restriction approaches country by country and even an uneven economy worldwide. Meanwhile, inflation has reached a 40-year high as we see several structural changes take hold. Consumer demand has shifted from services to household goods as people are spending more time at home and benefiting from higher levels of savings. Labor shortages are causing supply chain bottlenecks as people have more choice in the gig economy.\nThe quit rate in the United States has ever been higher reflecting the confidence of employees. And we will need to recognize that the energy transition is inherently inflationary given the significant cost differential between clean and traditional technology today. And that is why we are so optimistic about investing in green technology to move the energy transition forward. BlackRock has always focused on evolving and staying ahead of our clients' needs as they navigate change, and they are coming to BlackRock more than ever before. They value BlackRock's insights, they value the breadth of our solutions. They certainly value our global footprint.\nAs a result, BlackRock is building deeper partnerships with more clients across their whole portfolio throughout the world. We have strong conviction in our ability to continue generating differentiated organic growth over the long term because we have built a platform to help our clients as a fiduciary to meet their objectives in all market environments. And we continue to invest ahead of their evolving needs and are swiftly and aggressively trying to embrace new market opportunities.\nOur long-term strategy remains to be -- remains to keep up and performance at the heart of BlackRock to accelerate growth in iShares to build out our illiquid alternatives that continue to differentiate our technology to deliver a whole portfolio solution and become a global leader in sustainable investing. BlackRock is a $2.6 trillion active manager and our multiyear investment in incorporating data science, sustainability and new tools for portfolio construction is resulting in stronger growth than at any time in our corporate history.\nWe generated a record $267 billion of net inflows from active strategies in 2021, including a second consecutive year of record active equity inflows. Active strategies contributed over 60% of our annual organic base fees, and our growth is significantly outpacing that of our peers and the broader industry as we take market share in this fragmented landscape.\nBlackRock's active mutual fund captured the #1 share of industry flows in 2021, and our organic growth rate has tripled the industry. As Gary discussed, our investment performance remained strong with 88% of retractable fix system and 78 of our fundamental active equity funds above benchmark or peer median for a 5-year period. And in the U.S., nearly 80% of our active mutual funds are rated either a morningstar 4 or Morningstar 5, hinging us well for future growth. Clients are increasingly -- increasing their allocation to alternative strategies as they search for diversification and higher returns. BlackRock has built a broad platform across infrastructure, private credit, real estate and private equity to meet that demand. We raised a record $42 billion in client capital in 2021 and are confident in our ability to accelerate our growth as a leader in private markets.\nInfrastructure, for example, has significant secular tailwinds, driving growth and will be an important engine of fiscal stimulus for economies looking to build for their future. BlackRock is incredibly well positioned to capture opportunity in this area. We are 1 of the largest infrastructure managers in the industry with over $35 billion of client assets, including 1 of the largest renewable power platform. We have grown our platform fourfold in the last 5 years and look forward to partnering with more clients as we raise new vintages in our flagship funds and launched new innovative strategies in this asset class.\niShares also had a record year as the global ETF industry crossed $1 trillion in annual inflows for the first time. Growth was driven by greater adoption globally from asset owners, asset managers, wealth managers and more recently, for many of the approximately 40 million first-time investors who opened self-directed investment accounts over the last 2 years.\nBlackRock and iShares ETFs generated a record $306 billion of net inflows in 2021. We saw strength across each of our product categories including over $100 billion of net inflows into our core ETFs for the first time and nearly $80 billion in our fixed income ETF and more than $50 billion into each of our sustainable and precision ETF categories.\nWe saw strong client demand for fixed income ETFs despite a challenging macro environment for fixed income more broadly. Our growth benefited from the diversity of our product range across inflation rate bonds, municipal bonds, sustainability and emerging market exposures and the diversity of our client base, many of whom are increasingly using ETFs are part of their active portfolio construction. Worldwide ETFs are increasingly becoming the vehicle of choice for accessing a broad range of investment exposures, both in a passive way and in an active way. And as barriers for ETF adoption comes down, it is enabling a new generation of investors to access markets and more and more of them are looking to ETFs as a default investment vehicle.\nFor those wanting to create more customized indexes, our Aladdin technology has long provided this capability to institutions. And through our recent Aperio acquisition, we can now provide custom index capabilities to U.S. wealth advisers. Following a breakout in 2020, momentum and sustainable investments continued, and we generated a record $104 billion of net inflows in 2021 as client demand for sustainable strategies accelerated.\nWe now manage $509 billion in sustainable AUM, more than double from a year ago and remain committed to innovating and expanding choice for our clients. One of the biggest opportunities of this generation will be helping our clients navigate the global transition to a net 0 economy. We have already seen $4 trillion of capital move from traditional investments to sustainability ones in the last 2 years alone and this is just the beginning. The transition will not happen overnight and it will require significant investment in technology. BlackRock is working with companies across a wide range of carbon-intensive sectors that are proactively transforming their businesses and whose innovation will be critical to the world's decarbonization agenda. We believe these companies will present an important investment opportunity for investors. BlackRock is intently focused on helping our clients participate in these opportunities and understand the impact of the transition on their portfolios through better data and analytics. Our ambition is to move more capital into transition than anyone else. Our multi-decade investment into Aladdin technology platform continues to differentiate BlackRock both as an asset manager and a leading fintech provider. We generated $1.3 billion in annual technology revenues, up 12% year-over-year. We remain focused on continually evolving Aladdin for the next decade and beyond. We are innovating and extending our capabilities into areas of high client demand, including whole portfolios, wealth and sustainability.\nThe combination of Aladdin and eFront for example, which allows a client to bring together their whole portfolio in 1 place and customized at scale has already been embraced by over 2 dozen clients, and the pipeline is the strongest it has ever been and growing. The breadth of BlackRock investment strategies, our technology capabilities and our one BlackRock culture are truly what differentiates us in providing global portfolio solutions to our clients. In my conversations with clients around the world, I'm hearing about the challenges they are facing and their desire to consolidate the number of partners that they work with. They are increasingly choosing BlackRock as their partner of choice for those large strategic complex relationships. This is resonating, especially in our work with insurance clients.\nOur strong fourth quarter inflows included a previously announced $49 billion of active fixed income mandate from a large strategic insurance client. Our role at BlackRock is to leverage our insurers expertise and our diversified global platform across asset management, technology, sustainability, advisory solutions to deliver fully and completely to our clients. We see significant opportunity to work more closely with our insurance and broader OCIO clients in 2022 and beyond. Our ability to address client challenges enables us to fulfill our purpose and drive long-term performance that benefits all our stakeholders. Over the last 5 years, Clients have entrusted us with $1.8 trillion of net new assets. That's our organic growth for the last 5 years. We crossed $10 trillion in AUM in the fourth quarter. As with every milestone we reached over the decade, we are incredibly humbled by our client support and their incredible trust they have placed on us. All of us at BlackRock feel and take this deep responsibility in managing every dollar our clients awarded us, whether it is an individual investor using one of our ETFs is their first portfolio or investment account or a very large pension fund entrusting us with their whole portfolio. It is truly an honor that we recognize every moment and every day.\nBlackRock's consistent results are possible because of our dedicated employees. I often talk about the importance of putting a company's purpose at the foundation of a relationship with all stakeholders. Our purpose is resonating with our employees more than ever. BlackRock employee base has remained stable over the last 2 years amidst its turbulent environment. And I'm extremely proud of how passionate our 18,000 employees are in helping more and more people experience financial well-being.\nI want to take this moment to thank each and every one of our employees and every one of them individually for their continued partnership resilience and hard work and dedication through another difficult year. Everything BlackRock does is rooted in our culture of focusing on the long term, and we will continue to innovate. We will continue to be using our scale and contributing to a more equitable and more resilient future to benefit more clients to benefit our employees, and to benefit our shareholders and the people and communities worldwide where we operate. I firmly believe that the efforts of 2021 will position BlackRock to deliver value over the long run for all our stakeholders. With that, let me open it up for questions.",

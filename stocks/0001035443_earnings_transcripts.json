[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz from Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaula Schwartz\n\nManaging Director\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAnd now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nExecutive Chairman & Founder, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to Alexandria's third quarter earnings call. With me today are Hallie Kuhn, Peter Moglia and Marc Binda.\nLet me start off as I usually do with a quote. My friend and mentor Jim Collins, who wrote his well-known book built to last noted that, the secret to an enduring great company is its ability to manage continuity and change simultaneously, a discipline that must be consciously practiced, keeping clearly focused on which should never change and what should be open to change. And clearly, our development pipeline is front and center in that. Jim's visionary wisdom and advice is a great frame for Alexandria at this moment in time as the gold standard and leader of our niche.\nWe invented and pioneered life science real estate, a whole new asset class and category 31 years ago during the early years of the biotechnology revolution. Our North Star was and remains our focus on innovation clusters and ecosystems unique to the life science industry different than almost every other property type. We're blessed with best assets, best tenants, best megacampus and best team.\nOur relentless mission is driven by building the future of life-changing innovation and enabling the world's leading innovators to advance and better human health. The biotechnology revolution started almost 50 years ago. And in those 50 years, we've only been able to therapeutically address less than 10% of the more than 10,000 diseases known to human kind. No one lives in a family, community, which has not been struck by the [indiscernible] disease and illness devastating in so many ways.\nWe now find ourselves on the precipice of an entirely new age of discovery and innovation at the intersection of biology and technology 50 years later. Biology, it's important to remember, is inherently slow and complex. The life science industry and particularly the innovation engine of the biotech sector is mission-critical for a strong, safe, healthier country and planet as well as for America's global leadership future economic growth and security.\nAs opposed to most property types, office, industrial and resi, we operate in a highly regulated industry that takes extraordinary time and cost to bring life-changing medicines to patients. To get a life-saving product on the market, you only can sell that product for a handful of years in a regime of pricing oversight sometimes control different than other property types. I wonder what Microsoft would say if they were told you could only license window for a decade and then you lose the right to retain revenue or develop revenue from that innovation. If it matters fundamentally if the government is shut down or not operating effectively or efficiently.\nThe four pillars of the life science industry are critical and a critical bedrock to what I've just said about this country's health. We must preserve, protect and grow the strong and basic translational research. It is a critical bedrock of new discoveries, and we must deal hopefully quickly with the current limitation on indirect overhead cost, which is timing demand out of the institutional sector.\nWe must preserve, protect and grow the robust entrepreneurial ecosystem with access to affordable capital. Cost of capital today is high for discovery research engines, from the venture capital to the IPO to the M&A we are in a continuing difficult environment, getting better, but difficult nonetheless. That's the second bedrock.\nThe third one is providing a reliable and efficient and time-sensitive regulatory science framework and pathways, once again, the FDA must compress time frames and cost of R&D development. We met with Commissioner McGarry at the end of September, and he is super focused on this issue. Important to note that total development time frame for molecules in the Western world, U.S. and the EU ranges in the neighborhood of about 10 to 12 years versus China, which is about 1/3 of that time frame in their early stage of development in this industry. Approximate cost to bring products to market in the Western world is somewhere in the range of about $1.5 billion. And in China, it's about 50% to 90% below that. So we're faced with a very different circumstance today that the industry must face.\nAnd the fourth pillar is providing reasonable reimbursement for innovative medicines, which are costly and time consuming to bring to market. We at Alexandria has successfully navigated the dot-com bust and crica 2000, the great financial crisis, circa 2008, 2009, both when we are unrated non-investment-grade, and during the GFC, we had 30% of our gross assets in non-income producing land at Mission Bay and Cambridge. But this time, the navigation is once again different than before. We've seen the unprecedented [indiscernible] market -- the unprecedented bold biotech market post GFC 2014 to '21 capped off by the rocket ship of COVID rate funding and demand, a very low interest rate environment went along with that, which incentivized really foolish speculation by financially motivated real estate companies and they're even more foolish capital partners.\nThis brought an unwanted and unnecessary oversupply to many of the innovation submarkets. This has never happened in this niche before. But they're learning painful lessons that this real estate niche is unique and different from all others. This was followed by a biotech bear market, we're now in the fifth year, which is starting to turn the corner, and we're now witnessing the bottom and early signs of a recovery and strengthening as we predicted at NAREIT in June.\nThe industry is now enduring a government shutdown and the impact to the FDA is pretty serious.\nThis brings us to the third quarter a critical juncture and time for this industry. On the one hand, the greatest prospect ever for innovation in our time, and coupled with the relentless change in government shutdown. [indiscernible] deposition, huge congrats to our first-in-class team were navigating this difficult environment with relentless grit and determination and unparalleled experience and expertise. While declines in FFO per share, occupancy and guidance are tough at any point in time, Alexandria remains strong, tough resilient and continuing beacon of life for our life science industry.\nOne of our North Stars has been our balance sheet, working out of the GFC when we are unrated to today. We're now one of the top 15 of all REITs. It's strong, flexible and we have the longest weighted average remaining debt of all S&P 500 REITs at 11.6 years, over $4 billion of liquidity, strong fixed coverage ratio 96%, almost 97% of our fixed rate debt is at [ 39.7 ] blended interest rate and 1 area of laser focus for us will be to continue to reduce our current non-income-producing assets on the balance sheet from the current 20% as we diagram for you in the supplement and press release, to about 10% to 15%.\nAs opposed to the great financial crisis where we had 30% non-income producing assets as a percentage of gross assets with an unrated balance sheet there was pent-up demand and no supply coming out of the GFC year. So we kept our land at Mission Bay and Cambridge for future development, which provided a decade of unprecedented growth.\nAlexandria has will continue in this environment to accelerate its transition from substantial development to a build-to-suit on mega campus only development model. We intend to continue to decreased construction spend, preserve capital and not create further supply.\nAnd then finally, let me make a couple of comments before I turn it over to Marc for an in-depth review of the quarter and kind of factors impacting 2026. Let me make a couple of comments about leasing. The lifeblood of Alexandria's sector, a leading platform with the largest number of clients and strongest tenant base is our leasing. And our tenant base, of course, 53% of our leases are two investment grade or big cap, tenants with an average almost 9.5 years weighted average lease term for our top 20 tenants, and 18 of the top 20 pharmas are our tenants, a best example of our brand being the most trusted in the industry. And congrats to our team for the historic lease executed in this third quarter for 16 years with a credit -- existing credit tenant for almost 500,000 square feet at our Campus Point Megacampus in San Diego. We're proud to say that our ARR from megacampuses 77% and is continuing to approach 80%.\nWe continue to benefit from stellar operating margins and a very disciplined G&A run rate. Q3 was a solid quarter of leasing. However, institutional demand is still stuck due to the NIH issues and particularly the reimbursement of indirect costs. Coupled with we need to see more green shoots from early-stage venture-backed companies as well as the larger cadre of public biotech companies which have yet to recover in a meaningful way. We're starting to see green shoots on that, but that will be a critical litmus test going forward.\nAnd finally, before I turn it over to Marc for comments, let me just say we intend to continue to meet the market for our tenants and continue to successfully lease and dominate our space. And with that, Marc?\n\nMarc E. Binda\n\nChief Financial Officer & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Joel. This is Marc Binda, Chief Financial Officer. Good afternoon. I plan to cover the performance for the third quarter as well as some key emerging trends expected to impact 2026.\nOur team continues to navigate a challenging environment given macro industry and policy factors beyond our control. Please refer to our earnings release for our EPS results. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $2.22 for 3Q '25 and included the following three key impacts compared with the prior quarter.\nFirst, occupancy was effectively down 1.1% for the quarter after considering the benefit from the exclusion of assets with vacancy, which were sold or designated for held-for-sale during the quarter, and was driven by a challenging life science supply and demand dynamic.\nSecond, there was a $0.03 reduction in rental income associated with one tenant in our Seattle market to adjust rental income to cash basis. Importantly, that tenant remains in occupancy and is current on rent pending future critical milestones in the first half of 2026.\nAnd third, other income was down $8.7 million or about $0.05 compared to the prior quarter. Current quarter other income of $16 million remains consistent with the prior 8 quarter average. And as we discussed in our prior call, 2Q '25 did have some lumpy fees in there.\nLeasing volume for the quarter remained solid at 1.2 million square feet, in line with the 5 quarter average. This includes the previously announced 467,000 square foot build-to-suit lease with a multinational pharma tenant that was executed in July.\nWe continue to benefit from our scale, high-quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 82% of our leasing activity in the quarter coming from our existing deep well of approximately 700 tenant relationships.\nRental rate growth for lease renewals and re-leasing the space for the quarter was solid at 15.2% and 6.1% on a cash basis, which is at the high end of our guidance range for the year. We've reduced our guidance for 2025 rental rate increases on renewals and re-leasing the space by 2%, primarily due to one short-term renewal in Canada that was executed in October as well as some higher free rent.\nLease terms on leasing continue to be long at 14.6 years for the quarter, which is well above our historical average, and tenant improvement leasing costs on renewals and re-leasing the space for the quarter are relatively consistent with the prior year and down from the first half of the year.\nOccupancy at the end of the quarter was 90.6%, which was down 20 basis points from the prior quarter. As of September 30, certain assets with vacancy were designated for held-for-sale and were removed from our operating occupancy metric, which benefited occupancy at September 30 by 90 basis points. As a result, the decline in occupancy for our operating properties on an apples-to-apples basis declined by 110 basis points during the quarter.\nWhile occupancy declined due to oversupply in certain of our submarkets, it's important to highlight that our megacampus platform, which represents 77% of our annual rental revenue as of 3Q '25 outperformed overall market occupancy in our three largest markets by 18%. Our outlook for year-end occupancy was reduced by 90 basis points to a range of 90% to 91.6%. Our outlook assumes up to a 1% benefit from assets with vacancy, which could potentially be sold or designated as held-for-sale by December 31, which implies an 80 basis point decline in occupancy by the end of 2025, based upon the midpoint of our guidance.\nOur team continues to execute with 617,458 square feet of leasing completed to date for spaces that are vacant today and expected to deliver upon the completion of construction in May of next year on average. Looking ahead to next year, we have 1.2 million square feet of lease expirations through the end of 2026, and which are in great assets in AAA locations but are expected to go vacant, and we expect downtime on those assets.\nSame-property NOI was down 6% and 3.1% on a cash basis for the quarter. The decline in same-property was primarily driven by lower occupancy. In addition, we provided an alternative same-property presentation, which recast the first and second quarter results based upon the third quarter same-property pool to provide a consistent quarterly trend view given several assets that were removed from the third quarter same-property pool as they were either sold or designated as held-for-sale. It's important to note that this alternative presentation shows higher same-property performance in the first half of 2025, which means there will be a tougher benchmark in the first half of 2026.\nWe reduced our outlook for same-property performance for 2025 by 1%, primarily due to slower-than-anticipated leasing caused by a slower realization of demand. Despite this change, we continue to benefit from a very high-quality tenant base with 53% of our ARR coming from investment-grade or publicly-traded large cap tenants, long remaining average lease terms of 7.5 years, average rent steps approaching 3% on 97% of our leases, solid rental rate increases of renewed and re-leasing space during the quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA margins remained strong at 71% for the most recent quarter, consistent with our 5-year average.\nOn G&A, we continue to make great progress towards our goal of annual savings for 2025 of approximately $49 million compared to 2024 through a number of prudent and strategic cost savings initiatives. Our trailing 12 months G&A cost as a percentage of NOI was 5.7%, which represents approximately half the average of other S&P 500 REITs. We expect that around half of the 2025 savings will continue into 2026, given the temporary nature of some of the 2025 savings.\nWith projects under construction and expected to generate significant NOI over the next few years, and other earlier-stage projects undergoing important entitlement design and site work necessary to be ready for future ground-up development, we are required to capitalize a portion of our gross interest cost. We have and will continue to curtail our large development pipeline coming off a decade bull run for the industry fueled by the rocket ship demand of COVID. Given the lack of clarity on near-term demand as well as significant availability in some of our submarkets, we are carefully evaluating on a project-by-project basis the $4.2 billion of land subject to capitalization during the first 9 months of the year.\nWith preconstruction milestones in April 2026 on average, we continue to evaluate whether to progress preconstruction or construction efforts beyond the current milestones and in various cases will likely pause or curtail activity. If we decide to pause on a project as it reaches the next milestone, capitalization of interest, payroll and other required costs would cease on that project.\nWhile these ultimate decisions have not yet been made, we would like our funding program for next year to include a significant component of land dispositions which help us achieve one of our strategic objectives over the near to intermediate term to significantly reduce the size of our land bank. Sales of land could result in a significant reduction in capitalized interest and potential impairment charges. We expect steady to slightly lower capitalized interest in 4Q '25 and lower capitalized interest beginning in the first quarter of 2026.\nDespite positive recent activity for the biotech XBI Index, private and public biotech companies continue to remain challenged given the 5-year bear market for the sector. Given these and other factors unique to our venture investments, we did revise our guidance down to a range of $100 million to $120 million. It's important to point out that for the first 9 months of 2025, we realized $95 million of gains from our venture investments, which were included in FFO per share as adjusted or about $32 million per quarter. Based upon the midpoint of our revised guidance for realized investment gains of $110 million, this implies $15 million for the fourth quarter, or a $17 million decline over the average quarterly run rate for the last 3 quarters.\nWe continue to stand out as our corporate credit ratings rank in the top 15% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs. We have the longest average remaining debt maturity among all S&P 500 REITs at 11.6 years and tremendous liquidity of $4.2 billion. We updated our guidance for year-end leverage to 5.5 to 6.0x for 4Q '25 net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA. The increase from our prior target of 5.2x was primarily due to two factors: first, a reduction in our disposition guidance to a midpoint of $1.5 billion related to $450 million of potential dispositions expected to be delayed into 2026; and second, a projected reduction in annualized EBITDA in the fourth quarter from lower same-property net operating income and lower realized investment gains.\nWe've completed $508 million of dispositions to date, which leaves $1 billion to complete in the fourth quarter, all of which are subject to non-fundable deposits signed LOIs or purchase and sale negotiations. In connection with our disposition program, we recognized impairments of real estate of $323.9 million during the quarter, with approximately 2/3 of that coming from an investment in our Long Island City redevelopment property.\nThree items to highlight here. First, we acquired the site in 2018. That submarket suffered a substantial setback when Amazon abandoned its plan for new HQ in that location in 2019 and it never recovered. Second, despite the lower rental rate price point and our dominance in that submarket, it has been challenging to get a critical mass of life science tenants to go to this location. And ultimately, we don't view it as a life science destination that can scale. And third, this location has become more of an industrial flex and cinema submarket rather than life science.\nUltimately, at the end of September, we decided future capital needs and the sale proceeds related to this project would be better recycled into our mega campuses where we have greater conviction long term.\nLooking forward, we have a number of assets under consideration for sale either by the end of this year or sometime in 2026 that have estimated values below our carrying values ranging from 0 to $685 million. Although these potential impairments have not been triggered and final decisions to proceed have not been made, we updated our guidance range for 2025 to reflect these potential additional impairments in the fourth quarter. We anticipate an end to the large-scale non-core asset program by the end of 2026 or early 2027. We also expect dispositions to provide the vast majority of our capital needs for next year.\nTurning to capital allocation, two points here. First, we are continuing to evaluate some of our development and redevelopment projects expected to stabilize in 2027 and 2028 for opportunities to pivot. Second, we estimate our 2026 construction spending to be similar to slightly higher than the midpoint of construction spending for 2025 of $1.75 billion, which includes the recently announced build-to-suit in San Diego and higher CapEx and repositioning costs necessary to lease vacant space related to our operating properties. But the goal is to continue to reduce non-income-producing assets and other development pipeline -- and our development pipeline over time.\nNext, on dividend policy. The Board's approach has been to share cash flows from operating activities with investors as well as to retain a meaningful amount for reinvestment and which has allowed us to retain $475 million at the midpoint of our guidance range for 2025. In addition, the cumulative growth in dividends and FFO has been highly correlated since 2013. Given the factors that we described in our press release that are expected to impact 2026 earnings and cash flows, we anticipate that our Board of Directors will carefully evaluate future dividend levels accordingly.\nWe provided updated guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted for 2025, which was reduced by $0.25, or about 2.7% to a midpoint of $9.01 per share. This change was primarily due to lower investment gains and lower same-property performance driven by lower occupancy.\nLooking ahead to 2026, as is our long-standing practice, we will provide detailed guidance at our Investor Day on December 3. And in advance of that, we've shared five important trends that will impact earnings for 2026, including core operations and occupancy, capitalized interest, realized gains on non-real estate investments, G&A and our disposition program. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for more information.\nGiven the various factors impacting 2026 earnings, it's important to recognize the tremendous intrinsic value of our highly differentiated mega campus assets included in consensus NAV, which is significantly above our current trading price today with that consensus NAV coming in at around $117 per share. To be clear, we continue to be the dominant leader for life science real estate with the best assets in the best locations and the best tenants. Our focus in irreplaceable world-class mega campuses will continue to set us apart and give us an opportunity to capture premium economics for the long term as the demand and supply picture improves over time.\nNow I'll turn it back to Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nExecutive Chairman & Founder, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nOperator, please start questions."

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2025 Aecon Group Inc. Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Borgatti, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Borgatti\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Gigi. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for participating in our second quarter results conference call. This is Adam Borgatti speaking. Joining me today are Jean-Louis Servranckx, President and CEO; Jerome Julier, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Alistair MacCallum, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nOur earnings announcement was released yesterday evening, and we posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll refer to during this call. Following our comments, we'll be glad to take questions from analysts, and we ask that the analysts keep to one question and a follow-up before getting back into the queue.\nAs noted on Slide 2 of the presentation, listeners are reminded that the information we're sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements and that these statements are based on assumptions, subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Although Aecon believes the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the expectations will prove to be correct.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Jerome.\n\nJerome Julier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nGood morning, everyone. I'll now speak to Aecon's consolidated results, review results by segment and address Aecon's financial position before turning the call over to Jean-Louis.\nAdditional information has been provided to help clarify the underlying results, excluding impacts from the fixed price legacy projects and divestitures. Detailed reconciliation tables are included on Slides 13 through 15 in the conference call presentation.\nTurning to Slide 3. On a reported basis, revenue for the 3 months ended June 30, 2025, of $1.3 billion was $448 million or 52% higher compared to the same period in 2024. Revenue grew across all operating sectors with strong performances in industrial, nuclear and civil operations. Revenue growth also benefited from the impact of the acquisitions of Extreme power line construction, gains growth power construction and [indiscernible] shares and constructors that occurred in the second half of 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $41 million compared to a negative $154 million last year and operating profit of $2 million in the quarter compared to an operating loss of $166 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA and operating profit in the second quarter of 2024 were negatively impacted by $237 million and legacy project losses versus $39 million in losses on legacy projects in the second quarter of 2025. Excluding the impacts from the legacy projects and divestitures, as adjusted revenue for the 3 months ended June 30, 2025, of $1.3 billion compared to $975 million in the same period in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA as adjusted of $80 million compared to $78 million last year, driven by stronger contribution from core construction activities, which more than offset the anticipated normalization in Concessions EBITDA, which benefited from incremental proceeds from the partial sale of Skyport and additional management and development fees in the prior period.\nAdjusted diluted loss per share in the quarter of $0.09 compared to a loss of $2.03 last year.\nAecon's reported backlog of $10.7 billion at the end of the second quarter was the highest reported backlog in its history, surpassing the previous record of $9.7 billion said in the last quarter. The increase in backlog is a result of significant efforts through collaborative models with our clients and Aecon anticipated a moderation in backlog growth given current levels.\nNew contract rewards of $2.4 billion were booked in the quarter, primarily from Alliance contract awarded for the execution phase of the Darlington new nuclear project in Ontario, where Aecon is leading the construction of North America's first commercial grid-scale small module reactor or SMR for Ontario Power Generation.\nNow looking at results by segment. Turning to Slide 4. Construction revenue of $1.3 billion in the second quarter was $447 million or 52% higher than in the same period last year. Revenues higher in industrial operations, driven primarily by an increased volume of field construction work in Western Canada and the impact on revenue of the Coastal Gaslink Pipeline project settlement agreement in 2024. And nuclear operations from an increased volume of refurbishment and engineering services work at nuclear-generating stations in Ontario and the United States. Revenue was also higher in civil operations from a higher volume of major projects, roadbuilding construction and foundation work. In urban transportation solutions, primarily from an increase in mass transit project work in Ontario, and utility operations from a higher volume of gas distribution work in Canada and electrical transmission work in the U.S. following the acquisition of Xtreme in the second half of 2024, partially offset by a lower volume of telecommunication work.\nOn an as-adjusted basis, construction revenue was $1.3 billion compared to $973 million in the same period last year, representing a 31% increase. New contract awards of $2.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025, more than doubled the $764 million in new awards booked in the same period last year.\nTurning now to Slide 5. Adjusted EBITDA of $40 million compared to a negative $173 million last year, and operating profit of $15 million compared to an operating loss of $185 million last year. On an as-adjusted basis, adjusted EBITDA for the 3 months ended June 30, 2025, of $79 million compared to $64 million in the same period in 2024, with improved performance driven by higher volume and gross profit margin in nuclear and utility operations and higher volume in industrial operations, offset in part by lower operating profit in civil from western operations. And urban transportation solutions from lower gross profit on mass transit projects that are now nearing completion.\nTurning to Slide 6. Concessions revenue for the second quarter was $2 million compared to $2 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the Concessions segment of $16 million in the quarter compared to $30 million last year and operating profit of $3 million compared to $17 million last year. Lower adjusted EBITDA and operating profit in the quarter were primarily driven by last year's gain on sale related to incremental proceeds from the partial sale of Skyport and last year's onetime recovery in Skyport. Otherwise, the adjusted EBITDA of the Concession segment was aligned with expectations.\nOn Slide 7, we brought together the as-adjusted information to exclude impacts of the legacy projects and divestitures to provide insight into the underlying performance of the business. On an as-adjusted basis, revenue for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2025, was $4.7 billion compared to $3.8 billion for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA was $351 million in the trailing 12-month period compared to $337 million in the prior period. For the Construction segment, on an as adjusted basis, adjusted EBITDA was $321 million for the trailing 12-month period, representing a 6.8% margin. As adjusted EBITDA margin was impacted by weaker gross profit in Western Civil projects and in urban transportation solutions from lower gross profit on mass transit projects that are nearing completion.\nOver 3 quarters of Aecon's record backlog at June 30 is non-fixed price. This compares to 50% nonfixed price last year and just 30% nonfixed price in the second quarter back in 2021. Aecon has continued to shift the nature of our backlog and our business over time, including to more collaborative and progressive procurement models, while seeking to reduce risk in our performance and target greater profitability and margin predictability.\nTurning to Slide 8. At the end of the second quarter, Aecon held core cash and equivalents of $123 million, which excludes $339 million of cash, representing Aecon's proportionate share held in joint operations. In the second quarter of 2025, Aecon received both its committed revolving credit and performance security guarantee facilities. At June 30, 2025, Aecon had a committed revolving credit facility of $600 million, an increase of $150 million from its previous credit facility and a separate committed credit facility for Aecon Utilities of $400 million. $336 million was strong across both facilities and $8 million was utilized for letters of credit. Both revolving facilities now mature in June 2029.\nAecon has no debt or working capital credit facility maturities until 2029, except equipment loans and leases in the normal course.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Jean-Louis to address our business performance and outlook.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 9. Aecon continues to build resiliency through a balanced and diversified work portfolio. Over the trailing 12-month period, 26% of Aecon's Construction revenue was generated from the Utilities and Nuclear sectors compared to 41% for the comparative period in 2024. In the second quarter, the Oneida Energy Storage project officially commenced commercial operations, becoming the largest grid scale battery energy storage facility in operation in Canada and one of the largest globally.\nBalancing growth and opportunity with proper risk management is key to Aecon's future success. We continue to maintain balance in our Construction and Concession segments as we embrace new opportunities to grow in areas linked to the energy and power sectors and in U.S. and international markets.\nTurning to Slide 10. Demand for Aecon services across our markets continues to be strong with record backlog of 10.7 billion at June 30, 2025, recurring revenue programs continuing to see robust demand and a strong bid pipeline. Aecon believe it's positioned to achieve further revenue growth in 2025. And over the next few years, we focused on achieving improved profitability and margin predictability.\n76% of our backlog was nonfixed price at June 30, 2025, compared to 50% at the same time last year. Additionally, our trailing 12 months revenue at June 30, 2025, was 65% nonfixed price, up from 58% in the same period last year. Trailing 12 months recurring revenue of $1 billion was comparable to the previous period. Recurring revenues are typically executed on a non-fixed price basis with the majority being over and above our reported backlog figures.\nTurning to outlook on Slide 11. Development phase work is ongoing in consortiums, in which Aecon is a participant to deliver several significant long-term progressive design build projects of various sizes. These projects are being delivered using collaborative, progressive design-build models with the majority expected to move into the construction phase in 2025 and 2026.\nAecon is focused on achieving solid execution on its projects and selectively adding to its record backlog through a disciplined bidding approach that supports long-term margin improvement in the Construction segment.\nRevenue in 2025 is expected to be stronger than 2024 due to a record backlog of $10.7 billion. The impact of business acquisitions completed in the second half of 2024, solid recurring revenue and a strong bid pipeline. Revenue growth is expected in most of the construction sectors.\nIn the Concessions segment, there are several opportunities to add to the existing portfolio of Canadian and international concessions in the next 12 to 24 months.\nThe 3 remaining legacy projects are expected to reach substantial completion by the end of 2025. And this is anticipated to lead to improved profitability and margin predictability. The remaining backlog to be worked off on the 3 remaining legacy project was $76 million or less than 1% of total backlog at June 30, 2025.\nWe are now very close and are dedicating all necessary resources to drive the remaining legacy projects to completion. While pursuing fair and reasonable settlement agreements with the respective clients in each case. Until the 3 remaining projects are complete and the related claims have been resolved, there is a risk that profitability could also be negatively impacted in future periods. As such, as a completion and satisfactory resolution of claims on this project with the respective clients remains a critical focus for Aecon and its partners.\nWe are excited about the momentum we have built and remain focused on executing our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value. We thank our dedicated team members for their contributions and for reflecting our safety always culture.\nThank you. We'll now turn the call over to analysts for questions."

[Operator Instructions].\nPlease note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz. Please go ahead.\n\nPaula Schwartz\n\nManaging Director\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nExecutive Chairman & Founder, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our first quarter call with me today are Hallie, Peter and Mark. And let me begin by a quote from Robert Browning who once said, \"Great things are made of little things.\" And needless to say, our profound thank you to the entire Alexandria family team. It is the little things, each of us do -- each and every day that create the great things Alexandria is doing day in, day out. We are a unique one-of-a-kind mission-driven company.\nAlso, I want to mention our continued thoughts, prayers and assistance, go to many of our team members impacted by the L.A. wildfires in January of 2025, a really shocking start to this year.\nI want to mention, I think, something that we probably don't say enough about, and that is Alexandria has been and will continue to be one of the most consequential REITs in the sector's history. We have pioneered the life science real estate sector. We are the first and only pure-play life science REIT, and we have invented the complex principle of clustering for the life sciences -- we own and operate the top quality portfolio in life science real estate, almost 40 million rentable square feet with 25-plus mega-campus ecosystems in AAA locations with quality -- high-quality, top-quality assets. And now 75% of our annual rental revenue is generated by the mega campus platform, which is actually a cluster in itself within the broader ecosystem cluster. Alexandria is the brand of choice to the life science sector and has built brand loyalty with our sector-leading client base and has accomplished that with our deep knowledge of our client base, the medicines, cures, therapies and technology that continue to save and improve human life.\nInnovation is speeding to patients. Alexandria has scale, access to capital, low leverage and the best-in-class credit rating. Alexandria is best positioned to continue to reinforce the bedrock of the biotech sector which actually will celebrate its 50th anniversary next year on the founding of Genentech. This sector is the crown jewel and the broader biomedical sector, life science industry of not only this country, but the world's best and the underlying science and technology has never been as advanced as it is today or has ever been held as much promise as it does today. Alexandria's balance sheet is in the top 10% of all REIT credit ratings and never has been as strong. Alexandria has the longest weighted average remaining debt term among all S&P 500 REITs at 2x the average. Alexandria is one of the strongest and safest dividends in the REIT sector with a very low payout ratio. Alexandria's world-class development expertise, coupled with our best-in-class industry leasing capabilities have enabled our near-term development pipeline for '25 and '26 to report 75% leased or negotiating.\nAlexandria has an industry-leading client base of over 750 tenants, 89% of which were the source of our first quarter leasing, which came from this cherished tenant base. And our average lease duration is 9.6 years, almost 10 years from our top 20 tenants and over 7.5 years from all of our tenants. And proudly, in the first quarter, we collected 99% of our tenant rents and receivables. Moving to the macro issues, which have garnered a huge amount of attention, and let me list them and give our take on them.\nImmigration, very good progress to date. Deregulation, similarly, very good progress to date. Tax and budget based on meetings with key insiders in the Senate and the House recently, I've been told that July 4 is the most likely date for this big bill to emerge. On the international side, tariffs and wars overseas have created chaos and a key focal point for many folks, both domestic and foreign. The Fed and interest rates, the Fed is being stubborn in moving interest rates down when the impact would be very, very helpful to in -- Street.\nCenter for Medicare Services. Dr. Oz has recently taken over that and based on insider conversations that we've had, CMS is stable. The NIH, that agency, which is now run by Dr. Bhattacharya is going to see and is incurring restructuring based on a very inefficient structure of many different institutions, several institutions, which the head of those institutions actually have budget and Command and Control authority, not the Director of the NIH. And this has led to a substantial decentralization of control and certainly got a bit out of control during COVID and funding some of the experiments and the Wuhan lab through a third party. My guess is the private sector will pick up some slack in some of the applied research and the NIH under the new leadership, hopefully, will emerge, learning and focused on its mission with an organizational charge, which will make good sense.\nOn the FDA, the comp, which is the Crown Jewel regulatory agency, both for the United States and the world and the bedrock of our best-in-class biomedical industry. We've seen a loss of some quality senior people and some have -- we've seen returning. Most staff are in place and drug reviews are moving forward. And on a personal basis, we have a company that we're deeply involved with that has just got review comments this past week who has an industry partner and seeing relatively normality at that level. [ Dr. McCarrey ], who now heads the FDA is going to see to it that great science and regulatory skills continue and focused on their mission. The life science industry is delivering innovative products. The demand for innovation is strong. drug approvals are moving forward.\nJune will be a big month for ripples. There's 4 big ones coming up, including [ RSB ], hereditary angioedema, COPD and a rare skin disorder, and that may be a bellwether for the FDA's continued urgency -- mentality and approving drugs. But when it comes to the FDA, 3 things could make a huge difference. One is to curb the burdensome regulations and accelerate development. Meaning [ SAVI ] has become so overwhelmingly important that they have, in some cases, lost sight of a proving drugs where there are no other choices and choosing a relevant population that may be too large. So that could make a big difference if they could impact and also on the manufacturing and medical resilience side, things can be done to improve on that level. M&A is ongoing in the industry and that's been a positive.\nWhen it comes to the 15% institutional net cost limitation, which was under executive order, that's under judicial stay at the moment. It's causing lots of concerns for institutions. Congress may soften the act by legislation, but the variance of indirect costs among institutions is huge, and a lot of inefficiencies remain. Our history at Alexandria demonstrates that in very times like these, the dot com bubble, first and the great financial crisis, we've emerged better and stronger. Our fortress balance sheet emerged over the last decade out of the lessons of the GFC. And we see this as a time for important strengthening of all of our levers to continue to manage and grow the company.\nOut of the last 2 severe market corrections came 2 of our most important clients, Alnylam in 2003 and Moderna in 2011. And remember, the biggest and most consequential investments and ultimately gains are made when investors and operators do the right thing at the worst time. And these are perceived by many people as the worst of times.\nAnd then finally, I just want to say a couple of comments about Alexandria brand is about trust. Our brand is more than a logo on a sign. It's a shorthand for consistency, reliability and expectations. We said every time we deliver space, mission-critical space that performs, endures and elevates the people and science who use it. And with that, let me turn it over to Hallie Kuhn.\n\nHallie Kuhn\n\nSenior Vice President of Science & Technology and Capital Markets\n\nThank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Life Science and Capital Markets. Amid choppy macroeconomic conditions, the fundamental thesis driving the life science industry and Alexandria remains firmly in place.\n3 key points. First and foremost, is that the foundation of this industry is massive unmet medical need. 9 out of 10 diseases have no approved therapies and chronic conditions impact 129 million people in the U.S. That's nearly 40% of Americans living with diseases like hypertension and heart disease and driving more than $4.5 trillion in annual health care costs.\nSecond, innovation. The life science industry is fueled by new discoveries and the United States and Alexandria have the best substrate in the world to continue to drive new discoveries and development well into the future. U.S. headquartered companies account for 55% of global biopharmaceutical R&D investment and 6 out of every 10 FDA-approved therapies.\nThird, biotechnology is critical to maintaining a safe and secure nation, and we strongly support the recent slate of biopharma announcements committing billions of dollars to manufacturing in the United States. As emphasized by the bipartisan National Security Commission on emerging biotechnology report published earlier this month, Biotechnology is key for the U.S. to remain dominant and secure future economic growth in a new era of global competition.\nNow let us turn to Alexandria's diverse 750 strong tenant base. The diversity of our tenant base is important as each of the segments draw on multifaceted sources of funding, derisking the possibility of a singular funding shock. Our tenant base is also a critical embedded source of demand with 89% of leasing originating from our existing tenants this quarter, and our tenant base remains resilient. 51% of our tenant base is investment grade or large-cap as is 87% of our top 20 tenants, 17 of the top 20 multinational pharmaceutical companies and 4 of the largest tech companies in the world are Alexandria tenants.\nPivoting to 1Q '25 specifically, we are sharing for the first time on this call, quarterly leasing by RSF across our life science tenant segments to illustrate how the diversity of our tenant base contributed to 1Q 25's solid leasing activity. First, biomedical institutions accounted for 10% of life science leasing by RSF. Represented by 6 different private and public institutions. Across this segment, our tenants have over 7.5 years of average remaining lease term and approximately 80% are investment grade.\nNext, private biotech, with 12% of Life Science leasing. Venture funding remains steady and was deployed at a similar rate to 2023 and 2024. We capturing strong, well-capitalized private biotech tenants remains a core focus as these companies form the next generation of demand and the next wave of ingenuity.\nMoving to multinational pharma at 13% this quarter. As farmer requirements tend to be larger and take a longer time to mature, this number can vary meaningfully from quarter to quarter. Importantly, we continue to see requirements across multiple markets. Public biotech had a strong quarter at 27% of Life Science leasing, led by our 400 Tech Square lease with Intellia, a leading gene therapy company developing the next generation of treatments for rare disease. Public biotech continues to be a story of haves and have nots, and our mega campuses continue to attract the haves as the Intellia lease and 4Q's lease expansion with backlight and San Carlos demonstrate.\nLast is life science product service and devices at 38% and with a significant direct lease to a commercial contract research organization in research triangle. Over time, this segment may see increasing tailwinds in the U.S. as companies move onshore manufacturing and other capabilities due to recently announced tariffs.\nAltogether, we continue to monitor the impact of regulatory and economic conditions closely and remain cautiously optimistic with respect to positive announcements. Including onshoring and biomanufacturing, a newly proposed FDA approval pathway for rare disease, steady venture funding and breakthroughs in new potential medicines such as 10 Eli Lilly's recently announced clinical data on a new type of weight loss medicine that would come in a pill.\nIn the 30 years since Alexandria's founding, the life science industry and our company have shown tremendous resilience and traversed multiple economic cycles. And some of the strongest biotech companies have been found during times like this, as Joel mentioned. Our focus remains on capturing and retaining the strongest tenants and deepening relationships with our current tenants. To continue to position the portfolio for future growth.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Moglia\n\nCo-Chief Executive Officer & Co-Chief Investment Officer, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hallie. The life science industry is a national treasure and critical to a stronger, safer and healthier country. High interest rates and government disruption are not tempering and will not temper the demand for a better quality of life and the life science industry will always be here to meet that demand. Alexandria was created to enable it, and we will always be here to support it. I'm going to discuss our development pipeline, inclusive of the potential impact of tariffs, leasing and supply and update you on the progress of our value harvesting asset recycling program.\nIn the first quarter, we delivered approximately 309,500 square feet of 100% leased Class A plus laboratory space into a high barrier to entry submarkets which will contribute approximately $37 million in incremental net operating income, an additional 1.6 million square feet currently 75% leased or subject to a signed letter of intent, is expected to add another $171 million in annual NOI by the end of 2026. The initial weighted average stabilized yield for this quarter's delivery was 6.6% and driven by the solid stabilized yield of 7.5% from our key 285,000 square foot delivery at 230 here at [ Tuban Way ] in Millbrae which is located in the San Francisco Bay market. This high-quality project with adjacent access to both Caltrain and Bart is fully leased to Icon Therapeutics, a highly disruptive company at the intercept of science and technology founded by prolific drug hunter [ Roger Peter ], who has been a strategic Alexandria relationship for decades. Roger is a highly accomplished industry and academic leader who has directed foundational research at Amgen and Merck and served as a professor at the University of Washington and Caltech. Icon under Roger's leadership is integrating the disciplines of data science, engineering, chemistry and biology to discover the next generation of drug candidates. They are working with super high resolution microscopes living cells, algorithms and robotics so they can observe therapeutically relevant biology in a way no one has before. Roger knew what he needed robust building infrastructure, coupled with world-class operational excellence to house icon and wanted Alexandria to develop it in closely coordinated fashion.\nTurning to the impact of tariffs on our active development and redevelopment pipeline. Spoiler alert, they are not expected to have a material influence on our yields. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $2.4 billion of remaining cost to complete of which $1.3 billion is not subject to a fixed price contract as of the end of quarter. We estimate that 30% to 40% of those costs are for construction materials, such as steel, drywall and HVAC equipment. Assuming 100% of those materials were subject to tariffs we estimate that for every 10% tariff on such materials, our yields would decline by 2.5 to 3.5 basis points.\nTransitioning to leasing and supply. Alexandria's superior quality location, scale and sponsorship enabled the leasing of 1,030,553 square feet in the first quarter at solid rental rate increases for renewed and release space of 18.5% and 7.5% on a cash basis and the weighted average lease term was very strong at 10.1 years. This is the fifth straight quarter where we've exceeded 1 million square feet of leasing and despite elevated concessions, net effective rents on releasing and renewal space remain positive. We have a solid list of prospects for our development and redevelopment projects, but activity for this leasing segment, which is typically driven by expansion requirements remains muted for the moment due to continuing conservatism from life science company management teams and boards.\nWith respect to competitive supply, it peaked in 2024, and we expect far fewer additions in 2025 and 2026. In Greater Boston, we anticipate 900,000 square feet to be delivered in 2025. Currently, it's 0% pre-leased, and we expect 2.4 million square feet in 2026, that is 46% pre-leased. San Francisco has 1.1 million square feet of competitive supply scheduled for 2025, and it's currently 21% pre-leased and has no scheduled deliveries in 2026. San Diego expects 700,000 square feet to be delivered in 2025, currently 80% pre-leased and 40 -- I'm sorry, 400,000 square feet to be delivered in 2026, which is 100% pre-leased.\nAlthough availability in these markets ranges from 20% to 30%, and a meaningful portion of it is what JLL term zombie buildings and their Greater Boston overview from last quarter. Described is likely never to be leased as laboratory because the buildings are either a bad office conversion in an undesirable location and/or building an inexperienced owner, location, quality and sponsorship matter to tenants for their mission-critical infrastructure, and that is why those numbers should be discounted. Much of what is in those numbers is going to be office, not laboratory inventory in the future.\nTo conclude this section, we would like to report on lease in Cambridge, we feel, reinforces that quality location, scale and sponsorship matter to tenants. During the first quarter, [ Matemco ] secured a 580,000 square foot 15-year laboratory office leased with Biogen at their large-scale Volpe site in East Cambridge. The reported rental rate was $136 triple net with 3% annual increases and a tenant improvement allowance of $310 per square foot reminiscent of economic achieved at the peak of the cycle and illustrative a high-quality tenants' willingness to pay significant rents for high-quality buildings in great locations.\nI'll conclude with our value harvesting asset recycling program. The team continues to be strategic and opportunistic in identifying noncore asset dispositions, including land partial interest sales. To self-fund our high-quality development and development pipeline that is transforming our asset base into predominantly mega campuses, a strategy that positions Alexandria for the long term to capture an even greater share of future demand from the secular growing life science industry. As of the end of the first quarter, we've completed $176 million in dispositions and have another $434 million subject to nonrefundable deposits or letters of intent, aggregating to nearly $610 million or approximately 31% of our updated dispositions guidance.\nHighlighting this quarter's value harvesting efforts is the disposition of 13.2 acres of land in the University Town Center submarket of San Diego to a residential developer, which provides $124 million of accretive equity and contributes to rightsizing our land bank. Here are the takeaways. We continue to deliver transformative projects and incremental NOI from our pipeline. Tariffs will not create material dilution to our current pipeline projects. We continue to execute solid leasing. Competitive supply deliveries are winding down, and we're making good progress on our asset harvesting and recycling program.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Mark.\n\nMarc E. Binda\n\nChief Financial Officer & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Peter. This is Mark Binda, Chief Financial Officer. Hello, and good afternoon to everyone on this call. First, congratulations to the entire Alexandria team for outstanding execution during the quarter and for delivering solid operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2025. Total revenues were up 4% and adjusted EBITDA was up 5% for 1Q '25 over 1Q '24 after removing the impact of dispositions completed since the beginning of 2024. FFO per share diluted as adjusted was $2.30 per 1Q '25. As expected, bottom line results were impacted in the short term by the cost of our recently completed noncore asset sales to fund our development and redevelopment pipeline. And our investment in the long-term ground lease at our Alexandria Technology Square campus, both of which we expect to provide significant long-term value for our tenants and our shareholders.\nOur solid operating results for the quarter continue to be driven by our highly disciplined execution of our mega campus strategy, tremendous scale advantage, long-standing tenant relationships and operational excellence by our team. [ 75% ] of our annual rental revenue comes from our collaborative mega campuses, and we expect to increase this steadily over time. We have high-quality cash flows with 51% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade and publicly traded large-cap tenants collections remained very high at 99.9%, and adjusted EBITDA margins were strong at 71% for the quarter and represents the third highest quarterly margins reported since 2019.\nAs Peter highlighted, our leasing volume continues to be solid with over 1 million square feet leased during the quarter and represents the fifth consecutive quarter over 1 million square feet. We continue to benefit from our tremendous scale, high-quality tenant roster and brand loyalty with 89% of our leasing activity in the quarter coming from our existing deep well of approximately 750 tenant relationships.\nWe also continue to dominate in our core submarkets, getting more of the deals in many of our submarkets than the next several landlords combined. Rental rate growth for lease renewals and re-leasing of space for the quarter was a solid 18.5% and 7.5% on a cash basis, which is at or above the high end of our guidance ranges for the year. We continue to achieve very healthy lease terms on completed leases with 10 years on average for the quarter, which is above our historical 10-year average. Tenant improvement and leasing commission costs on renewals and leasing space for the quarter was elevated on a per square foot basis due to 1 large long-term lease executed at our Alexandria technology square mega campus in Cambridge, excluding this 1 leasing cost on a gross basis and as a percentage of total rent of the lease term were in line with our 5-year quarterly averages.\nOccupancy at the end of the quarter was at 91.7% and which was down 2.9% from the prior quarter. About 2/3 of the decline was related to the 768,000 square feet of lease expirations that were known vacates spread across 4 submarkets. We discussed these spaces at our Investor Day last year, and it includes both Moderna's move-out of Alexandria Technology Square to the new HQ R&D campus we developed for them at 325 Binney and our single tenant building 409 Illinois and mission-based San Francisco. The remaining 1/3 represents several smaller spaces spread across multiple markets, of which the 2 largest spaces in that bucket have been released and are expected to be delivered later in 2025.\nOverall, for the full 2.9% reduction in occupancy, we're making very good progress on resolving these with about 1/4 of this amount leased with a future delivery date around the end of this year. Based upon our current outlook, we reduced the midpoint of guidance for our year-end 2025 occupancy by 70 basis points from 92.4% to 91.7% driven by lower-than-anticipated re-leasing and lease-up of space. Same-property NOI was down 3.1% and up 5.1% on a cash basis for the quarter. As we have highlighted over the last few earnings calls, our 1Q '25 same-property results were impacted by the key [ 125 ] lease expirations, which became vacant in 1Q '25, aggregating 768,000 square feet spread across 4 submarkets. Excluding these properties, our property results would have been flat and up 9% on a cash basis.\nAlso important to note that these spaces expired at the end of January on average. So we would expect an additional decline to the quarterly results next quarter as the impact becomes fully included. The strong cash same property performance for the quarter included the impact of summary rent in 1Q '24 from development and redevelopment projects completed in 2023, and we expect that benefit to go away over the next quarter or 2. Our outlook for full year '25 same-property growth has been reduced by 70 basis points and 20 basis points on a cash basis to reflect impact on occupancy over the balance of the year.\nTurning next to general and administrative expenses. At our Investor Day, we outlined a plan to achieve significant savings in G&A costs through various corporate cost-saving initiatives in 2025. G&A costs over the last 2 quarters have averaged around [ $30 million ] per quarter, which represents a 30% savings over the preceding 3 quarters. In addition, our trailing 12 months G&A cost as a percentage of NOI was 6.9% for 1Q '25, which is the best percentage in the last 10 years, Alexandria and is significantly better than the health care index average for last year, which was around 10%.\nGiven the great progress that we've shown over the last 2 quarters and based upon our current outlook, we've updated the midpoint of our 2025 guidance range for G&A costs to reflect an additional $17 million of cost savings, which now represents an expected $49 million total savings in 2025 G&A compared to 2024. Our updated guidance also implies a run rate for G&A, similar to the first quarter for the balance of the year. With projects under construction and expected to generate significant NOI over the next few years, coupled with our future pipeline projects undergoing important preconstruction activities adding value and focused on reducing the time from lease execution to delivery, we are required to capitalize a significant portion of our gross interest cost. Capitalized interest as a percentage of gross interest cost was [ 61% ] for 1Q '25 and has declined significantly compared to the 2-year average of 74% for 2024 and 2023, driven by the completion of our in-process development and redevelopment projects.\nOur outlook for capitalized interest for the full year 2025 was reduced by $20 million and primarily relates to future development projects, which are expected to see capitalization in the second half of this year. In addition, there are a few active construction projects, which may no longer qualify for capitalization of interest as construction work, which is critical milestones and may subsequently resume in the future when we advance final construction for delivery of space to prospective tenants. In total, the change to capitalized interest represents approximately $1.4 billion of basis for approximately 4 months.\nTurning next to share buybacks. We updated our sources and uses guidance for acquisitions and other opportunistic of capital, including share buybacks to $250 million at the midpoint to reflect the $208 million purchases completed during the first quarter, with the potential to do more in the future under the right market conditions. As of today, we have approximately $242 million remaining under the plan. authorized by the Board of Directors.\nOne of the important areas to highlight in this quarter is that we have spent many disciplined years shaping and refining our strong balance sheet to provide flexibility and challenging macroeconomic times like these. Our balance sheet continues to stand out amongst all publicly traded U.S. REITs, and as our corporate credit ratings rank in the top 10% of all publicly traded U.S. REITs, Indeed, the balance sheet is in great shape. We are targeting year-end leverage of 5.2x for net debt to adjusted EBITDA, consistent with the average of our year-end leverage for the last 5 years. We have tremendous liquidity of $5.3 billion, and we have the longest debt maturity profile among all S&P 500 REITs with the average remaining debt term of 12.2 years and very low debt maturities over the next 3 years.\nTransitioning next to funding, we are pleased with the execution of our bond deal in February for $550 million of 10-year unsecured bonds at an attractive pricing of 5.5%. We continue to focus on our disciplined funding strategy to recycle capital from dispositions and to minimize the issuance of common stock. Since 2019, we've completed more than $9.6 billion of dispositions and partial interest sales. As Peter highlighted, we've made good progress for 2025 with $609 million completed or in process, which represents 31% of the midpoint of our guidance for dispositions and sales of partial interest of $1.95 billion. Land sales and user sales continue to be an important component of the deals completed and in process. In addition to dispositions, we also expect to fund a meaningful amount of our equity needs in 2025 with retained cash flows from operating activities after dividends of $475 million at the midpoint of our guidance for '25. Our high-quality cash flows continue to support our common stock dividends with a conservative FFO payout ratio of 57% from 1Q '25 and an attractive dividend yield of 5.7% as of the end of 1Q.\nOver the last 5 years, realized gains from venture investments included in the FFO per share as adjusted, have averaged approximately $29 million per quarter and our outlook for '25 remains unchanged with a range of $100 million to $130 million, which implies about $29 million per quarter at the midpoint.\nTurning to guidance. The details of our guidance are included on Page 4 of our supplemental package. Our guidance for FFO per share diluted as adjusted was reduced by $0.07 to a midpoint of $9.26 and which puts the revised midpoint at the low end of our initial range for FFO per share results and represents a change of 75 basis points from our initial guidance. Even with this change, our estimate for 5-year growth in FFO per share diluted as adjusted through 2025 is 27% and which puts us near the top end of the range among the peers and the NAREIT equity health care REIT Index.\nNow I'll turn it over to Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nExecutive Chairman & Founder, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you. And operator, can we go to questions, please?"

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for participating in our year-end 2024 results conference call. This isÂ Adam BorgattiÂ speaking. Joining me today are Jean-Louis Servranckx, President and CEO; Jerome Julier, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Alistair MacCallum, Senior Vice President, Finance.Â Our earnings announcement was released yesterday evening, and we posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll refer to during the call. Following our call, we'll be glad to take questions from the analysts and ask that the analysts keep to one question and a follow-up before getting back into the queue.Â\nÂ\nAs noted on Slide 2, listeners are reminded that the information we're sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements, and these statements are based on assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Although Aecon believes the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that the expectations will prove to be correct.Â\nÂ\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to Jerome.\n\nJerome Julier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone.Â\nBefore we move into the financial discussion, I'll briefly touch on recent actions on the trade front. Aecon is carefully monitoring the developments and assessing the potential effects on our procurement and purchasing. We're taking a cautious stance here given the impact these measures and countermeasures may have on the cost of materials, the financial picture of our clients and the decisions to advance projects.Â I'll now speak to our consolidated results, review the results by segment and address Aecon's financial position before turning the call over to Jean-Louis. Consistent with prior quarters, we provided additional information to help clarify the underlying results, excluding impacts from fixed price legacy projects and divestitures.Â\nWe have detailed reconciliation tables included on Slide 15, 16 and 17 in the conference call presentation. Turning now to Slide 3. On a reported basis, revenue for the year of $4.2 billion was $401 million or 9% lower compared to 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of $83 million compared to $143 million last year. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA in 2024 was negatively impacted by $273 million in legacy project losses compared to $215 million in 2023. Operating loss of $60 million compared to an operating profit of $241 million in 2023.Â\nIn addition to the items just noted, lower year-over-year operating profit was driven by a decrease in other income of $186 million, primarily due to a lower year-over-year gain related to the sale of 49.9% interest in Skyport of $133 million and the lower gain on the sale of Aecon Transportation East, or ATE, of $28 million.Â\nExcluding the impact of the legacy projects and divestitures on an as adjusted basis, revenue for the year was $4.2 billion compared to $3.8 billion in 2023 and adjusted EBITDA of $349 million compared to $355 million last year. Diluted loss per share for the year was $0.95 compared to diluted earnings per share of $2.10 in 2023. Reported backlog of $6.7 billion at the end of 2024 compared to backlog of $6.2 billion a year ago. New contract awards of $4.7 billion were booked in the year compared to $4.5 billion in the previous year. The reported 2024 awards include $275 million of backlog acquired at the time of acquisitions of United, Ainsworth Power Construction and Xtreme closed.Â\nÂ\nNow looking at results by segment. And turning to Slide 4, Construction. Revenue of $4.2 billion in 2024 was $352 million or 8% lower than the previous year. The largest decrease in revenue occurred in industrial operations, driven by a decreased activity on mainline pipeline work following the achievement of substantial completion on a large project in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a higher volume of field construction work at wastewater treatment and industrial facilities in '24.Â Revenue also decreased in urban transportation solutions as three LRT projects near completion and in civil operations largely from a decrease in road building construction work after the sale of ATE in the second quarter of 2023.Â\nPartially offsetting these decreases were higher revenue in nuclear, driven by an increased volume of refurbishment work in Ontario and in the United States, and in utility operations, primarily from an increased volume of electrical transmission work in the U.S. and an increase in battery energy storage system work, partially offset by a decreased volume of telecommunication and gas distribution work. On an as adjusted basis, Construction revenue was $4.1 billion in 2024 compared to $3.8 billion last year. New contract awards of $4.7 billion in 2024 compared to $4.4 billion in the previous year. Backlog at the end of 2024 was $6.6 billion compared to $6.1 billion at the end of 2023.Â\nTurning to Slide 5. Adjusted EBITDA of $34 million compared to $99 million last year. The largest driver of the decrease was negative gross profit on the four fixed price legacy projects of $273 million in 2024 compared to negative gross profit of $215 million in 2023.Â\nOther than the impact of fixed price legacy projects in 2024, lower operating profit in the balance of the Construction segment was largely driven by lower gross profit margin in civil operations and urban transportation solutions and partially offset by higher operating profit in nuclear operations from higher volume and gross profit margin and in industrial due to higher gross profit margin.Â\nÂ\nOther items contributing to the reduction in operating profit include an increase in acquisition-related transaction costs that were expensed in the year, an increase in amortization expense related to acquisition-related intangible assets from the Xtreme, Ainsworth Power Construction and United transactions in 2024 and a decrease in other income, driven by lower gains on the sale of property, buildings and equipment, primarily in utility operations.Â On an as adjusted basis, adjusted EBITDA was $307 million in 2024 compared to $326 million in 2023.Â\nTurning now to Slide 6. Concessions adjusted EBITDA for the year was $87 million compared to $90 million last year and operating profit of $24 million compared to $174 million last year. 2024 adjusted EBITDA in the Concessions segment benefited from greater activity on certain progressive and collaborative projects as well as higher fees on major transit and transportation projects nearing construction completion. Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to be impacted in 2025 as these projects begin to shift to early stages of their respective operations and maintenance and concession phases and as new projects start to ramp up.Â\nLower operating profit in the quarter was primarily due to the Skyport transaction, as previously mentioned, which resulted in gains on sale of $133 million. On Slide 7, we brought together the as adjusted information to exclude the impact of legacy projects and divestitures to provide insight into this underlying performance we've been discussing. As previously mentioned, on an as adjusted basis, revenue in 2024 was $4.2 billion compared to $3.8 billion in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $349 million in 2024 compared to $355 million in the previous year. For the Construction segment on an as adjusted basis, adjusted EBITDA was $307 million in 2024, representing a 7.4% margin.\nÂ\nTurning to Slide 8. At the end of 2024, Aecon held cash and cash equivalents of $123 million, excluding the cash held in joint operations. In addition, at December 31, 2024, Aecon had committed revolving credit facilities of $850 million, of which $153 million was drawn and $4 million was utilized for letters of credit. Drawn credit is entirely at the Aecon Utilities level. Aecon has no debt or working capital credit facility maturities until 2027, except for equipment loans and leases in the normal course. Aecon's next quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share will be paid on April 2, 2025, to shareholders of record on March 21, 2025.Â\nÂ\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Jean-Louis to address our business performance and outlook.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jerome.Â\nTurning to Slide 9. Aecon continues to build resiliency through a balanced and diversified work portfolio while enhancing execution capabilities and project selection to play to our strengths. In 2024, roughly 45% of Aecon's Construction revenue was generated from the utilities and nuclear sectors compared to 39% in 2023.Â Our self-performed capabilities and One Aecon approach helped to maximize value for clients through improved cost certainty and schedule while offering a broad range of services from development, engineering, investment and construction to longer-term operations and maintenance to cover the full infrastructure value chain.\nWe are embracing new opportunities to grow in areas linked to the energy sector and in U.S. and international markets. These opportunities are intended to diversify Aecon's geographic presence, provide new growth vectors and deliver more consistent earnings through economic cycles.Â Turning now to Slide 10. Demand for Aecon services across our markets continues to be strong. With backlog of $6.7 billion at the end of 2024, recurring revenue programs continuing to see robust demand and a strong bid pipeline, Aecon believes it is positioned to achieve further revenue growth in 2025 and over the next few years and is focused on achieving improved profitability and margin predictability.Â\nOf note, year-end backlog excludes the recently announced award for the Scarborough Subway Extension transit project and the design phase for the refurbishment of four units at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station, comprising $3.3 billion in total, which will be added to our backlog in the first quarter of 2025. Remaining backlog to be worked off on the three remaining legacy projects was $121 million or 2% of total backlog at December 31, 2024. We remain focused on driving this project to substantial completion with two currently expected to be substantially complete in midyear 2025 and the final project by the end of the third quarter of 2025.Â\nTrailing 12 months recurring revenue was $1 billion in 2024 comparable to the previous year and up over 30% versus two years ago, taking into account the divestitures of ATE and the 49.9% interest in Skyport in prior periods on a like-for-like basis. Recurring revenues are typically executed on a non-fixed price basis with the majority being over and above our reported backlog figures. Turning to Slide 11. Development phase work is underway on a number of major projects in which Aecon is a participant, including the GO Expansion On-Corridor Works Project, the Darlington New Nuclear Project, the Contrecoeur Terminal Expansion, the U.S. Virgin Island Airport redevelopment project, the Winnipeg North End Treatment Plant project and the Howard Hanson Dam project.Â\nThese projects are being delivered using collaborative, progressive design build models with the majority expected to move into construction phase in 2025.Â As a reminder, all of the anticipated work from this progressive design build project is yet reflected in backlog.Â\nTurning to Slide 12. Aecon is focused on achieving solid execution on its projects and selectively adding to backlog through a disciplined bidding approach that supports long-term margin improvement in the Construction segment. Revenue in 2025 is expected to be stronger than 2024 due to an opening backlog of $6.7 billion, combined with recent new awards in the first quarter, the impact of business acquisitions completed in the second half of 2024, solid recurring revenue and a strong bid pipeline.Â\nRevenue growth is expected in most of the construction sectors as progressive design build projects move into the construction phase in 2025 and 2026. In addition, capital expenditure in 2025 are expected to be modestly higher than in 2024. In the Concessions segment, there are a number of opportunities to add to the existing portfolio of Canadian and international concessions in the next 12 to 24 months. Results in recent years were negatively impacted by the four legacy projects. However, the recent Coastal GasLink Pipeline settlement, along with the additional write-downs of the fixed price legacy project in 2024 are anticipated to lead to improved profitability and margin predictability, especially as the remaining three projects move closer to substantial completion.Â\nÂ\nUntil the remaining three projects are complete and the related claims have been resolved, there is a risk that this could also occur in future periods. As such, the completion and satisfactory resolution of claims on the remaining three legacy projects with the respective clients remains a critical focus for Aecon and its partners.Â Finally, turning to Slide 13. The year 2024 was a period of significant progress for Aecon marked by several positive developments. As previously mentioned, we successfully reached a settlement for Coastal GasLink Pipeline project while continuing to make steady progress in completing and satisfactorily resolving claims on the three remaining legacy projects.Â\nAt the same time, we further derisked our business by adding new collaborative projects into our development pipeline while transitioning the Scarborough Subway Extension project from the development phase into the implementation phase under a target price contract. We also strengthened our operation through three key strategic acquisitions, Xtreme Powerline, Ainsworth Power Construction and United Engineers & Constructors,\nallowing us to capitalize on significant opportunities in the utilities, nuclear and conventional power sectors across North America. With that, we are pleased to once again welcome the teams fromÂ Xtreme, Ainsworth Power Construction and United as we work together to safely drive future growth. We are excited about the momentum we have built and remain focused on executing our strategy to drive long-term shareholder value.Â\nThank you. We will now turn the call over to analysts for questions."

Welcome to the Q2 2024 Aecon Group Inc. Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Borgatti. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Borgatti\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for participating in our second quarter results conference call.\nThis is Adam Borgatti speaking, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Joining me are Jean-Louis Servranckx, President and CEO; Jerome Julier, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Alistair MacCallum, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nOur earnings announcement was released yesterday evening, and we posted a slide presentation on the Investing section of our website, which we'll refer to during the call. Following our comments, we'll be glad to take questions from analysts and we ask that analysts keep to one question and a follow-up before getting back into the queue.\nAs noted on Slide 2 of the presentation, listeners are reminded that the information we're sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements.

So, we've added additional information to help clarify the underlying results. Detailed [Technical Difficulty] tables are available on Slide 16 and 17.\nTurning to Slide 3. On a reported basis, revenue for the 3 months ended June 2024 of $854 million was $313 million, or 27% lower compared to the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA of negative $153 million compared to $17 million last year, and operating loss of $166 million in the quarter compared to an operating profit of $56 million last year. Adjusted EBITDA and operating profit in the second quarter were negatively impacted by the previously disclosed $127 million non-recurring charge related to the achievement of a global settlement for the Coastal GasLink Pipeline project, and the additional aggregate charge of $110 million related to the 3 remaining legacy projects.\nExcluding the impacts from the legacy projects and the divestitures, which we will describe as as-adjusted, revenue for the 3 months ended June 30, 2024 of $975 million compared to $978 million in the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $78 million compared to $93 million last year and operating profit was $46 million compared to $64 million last year. Diluted loss per share in the quarter of $1.99 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.38 in the same period last year. Our reported backlog of $6.2 billion at the end of the quarter compared to backlog of $6.2 billion at the end of December 31, 2023 and $6.9 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023. New contract awards of $766 million were booked in the quarter compared to $2 billion in the prior period.\nNow, looking at results by segment. Turning to Slide 4. Construction revenue of $851 million in the second quarter was $288 million, or 25% lower than the same period last year. Revenue was lower in industrial operations, primarily due to decreased activity on mainline pipeline work, following the achievement of substantial completion on the Coastal Gaslink Pipeline project in the third quarter of 2023, which offset a higher volume of wastewater treatment facilities work.\nRevenue was lower in the urban transportation solutions from a lower volume of LRT work in Ontario and Quebec as a result of the sale of Aecon Transportation East in the second quarter of 2023 and from a lower volume of major project work following completion of a large hydroelectric project in 2023. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher revenue in nuclear operations, driven by an increased volume of refurbishment work and in utility operations from a higher volume of electrical transmission and battery energy storage system work, partially offset by lower volumes in telecommunications and gas distribution.\nOn an as-adjusted basis, construction revenue was $973 million, flat to last year. New contract awards of $763 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $2 billion in the same period last year. New awards in the second quarter of 2023 were bolstered by significant adjustments in nuclear operations. Backlog at the end of the second quarter of $6.1 billion compared to $6.8 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023, which included roughly $200 million of pipeline-related backlog at the time.\nTurning now to Slide 5. Adjusted EBITDA of negative $173 million compared to negative $4 million last year. As previously noted, the decrease was largely driven by negative gross profit on the 4 legacy projects of $237 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to negative gross profit of $81 million on these projects in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter on an as-adjusted basis was $64 million compared to $78 million last year, with the variance being driven by lower gross profit in urban transportation solutions from rail electrification work, increases in corporate costs and partially offset by improving performance in our nuclear operations.\nTurning now to Slide 6. Revenue for the second quarter was $2 million compared to $27 million in the same period last year. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by the sale of a 49.9% interest in Skyport, the Bermuda Airport concessionaire, and commencement of the equity method of accounting for Aecon's retained 50.1% interest in Skyport. Adjusted EBITDA in the Concession segment of $30 million compared to $28 million last year. Operating profit related to the Skyport asset was higher in the second quarter, driven by one-time recoveries of $5.9 million in 2024, and an incremental gain on sale of $5.9 million reported in 2024 related to additional proceeds earned in the 2023 partial sale of Skyport. On an as-adjusted basis, operating profit in the Concession segment in the second quarter was $5 million compared to $9 million last year, reflecting lower development fees and higher costs associated with pursuits on energy transition endeavors.\nOn Slide 7, we've brought together the information to exclude the impact of the legacy projects and divestitures to provide insight into the underlying performance of the business. Adjusted revenue for the trailing 12-month period ended June 30, 2024 was $3.8 billion compared to $3.7 billion for the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA, including the previously noted adjustments, was $344 million in the trailing 12-month period compared to $343 million in the same period last year. For the Construction segment, on an as-adjusted basis, the EBITDA was $305 million for the trailing 12-month period, representing an 8% margin.\nTurning to Slide 8. At the end of the second quarter, Aecon held cash and cash equivalents of $131 million, excluding cash and joint operations. In addition, at June 30, 2024, Aecon had committed revolving credit facilities of $850 million, of which $98 million was drawn and $4 million was utilized for letters of credit. Netting the cash position against our drawn revolver results in a net cash position of $33 million at the end of the quarter prior to the inclusion of other debt items noted below. Aecon has no debt or working capital credit maturities until 2027, except equipment loans and leases in the normal course. In addition, Aecon's Board of Directors has authorized a normal course issuer bid, or NCIB, to purchase for cancellation up to 5% of the issue now to any common shares or approximately 3.1 million common shares of Aecon, subject to the approval of the TSX. Aecon intends to file a notice of intention with the TSX in this regard and if accepted, NCIB shortly thereafter.\nTurning to Slide 9. I'll now provide an update on our legacy projects. On June 28, SA Energy Group, in which Aecon is a 50% general partner and Coastal GasLink Pipeline LP, reached an amicable and mutually agreeable global settlement to resolve their dispute fully and finally over the construction of Sections 3 and 4 of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline Project in BC. The settlement agreement is not an admission of liability by either party, and the parties have mutually released their respective claims in the arbitration, thereby avoiding the expense, burden and uncertainty associated with the arbitration.\nThe terms of the settlement agreement are expected to result in no cash impacts to Aecon. As noted previously, from an accounting perspective, Aecon recognized a non-recurring charge of $127 million in the second quarter of 2024 related to the settlements. The Coastal GasLink settlement allows Aecon to close the chapter of one of the most technically and financially challenging projects in its history, and we want to thank our team for delivering the project safely and with incredible resiliency through to completion.\nProgress continues on the 2 LRT projects in Ontario, including signaling and train control systems testing, and advances in driver training for the operator. Physical work is nearly complete with the most station and structure of occupancy permits received. Full vehicle testing is also ongoing across the projects. However, forecasted substantial completion dates have been delayed due to setbacks and meeting necessary testing, commissioning and additional training and coordination requirements with the operator.\nAs seen on the cover of the presentation, the deck on the Gordie Howe International Bridge between Windsor and Detroit is now connected. This is a significant accomplishment, creating the longest cable stayed bridge span in North America. Work is progressing on the main bridge and on the Michigan Interchange, as well as on the 2 international port of entry facilities and their core systems. However, additional costs have been incurred related to the bridge and Michigan Interchange structures and finishes, as well as other areas such as the finishes in the mechanical and electrical systems of the port of entry facilities.\nAs a result of these impacts, Aecon recognized an aggregate charge of $110 million in the quarter from the remaining 3 legacy projects, reflecting our current estimates on the cost of completion for these remaining projects. Aecon believes our estimates to be accurate as of today, and the majority of the risks for the remaining 3 legacy projects are largely behind us. However, additional risks exist if assumptions, estimates and circumstances change until the projects are substantially complete.\nTo that end, we are providing a risk analysis that reflects negative changes to our assumptions, which could potentially impact our cost to complete on these projects. Based on the information currently available, Aecon believes the potential for future additional financial risks to Aecon, if any, through to completion of the remaining 3 legacy projects should not exceed $125 million through the end of 2025. We remain focused on driving the remaining legacy projects to completion, while pursuing fair and reasonable settlement agreements with their respective clients in each case.\nOf the remaining 3 projects, one is currently expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2024, another in early 2025, and the final project by the end of the third quarter of 2025. At June 30, 2024, the remaining backlog to be worked off on the legacy projects was $269 million compared to backlog of $420 million at December 31, 2023 and $699 million at June 30, 2023.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Jean-Louis to address our business performance and outlook.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jerome.\nTurning to Slide 10. Aecon's goal is to build a resilient company through a balanced and diversified work portfolio, while enhancing critical execution capabilities and project selection to play to our strengths. We continue to leverage our self-perform capabilities and One Aecon approach to maximize value for clients through improved cost certainty and schedule, while offering a broad range of services from development, engineering, investment and construction to longer-term operations and maintenance to cover the full infrastructure value chain.\nWhile we pursue and deliver the majority of our work in established markets, we are embracing new opportunities to grow in areas linked to decarbonization and the energy transition and in U.S. and international markets. Our acquisition of Xtreme Powerline, which we will discuss further aligns with this approach. These opportunities are intended over the long term to diversify Aecon's geographic presence, provide further growth opportunities and deliver more consistent earnings through economic cycles.\nTurning to Slide 11. Demand for Aecon services across Canada continues to be strong, with backlog of $6.2 billion at June 30, 2024. Recurring revenue programs continuing to see robust demand and a strong bid pipeline. Aecon believes it is positioned to achieve further revenue growth over the next few years and is focused on achieving improved profitability and margin predictability. We are pursuing a balanced portfolio of work delivered through both fixed and non-fixed price contracting models, with the goal of reducing fixed price work to balance risk with acceptable returns.\nTrailing 12-months recurring revenue of $1.1 billion was comparable to the prior period and up 38% versus 2 years ago. Contribution from the GO Expansion On-Corridor Works and Scarborough Subway Extension projects during the respective development phases increased in the quarter, which offset a lower volume of gas distribution and telecommunications works in utilities operations and impact from the sale of ATE last year. Adjusting for the impacts of the sale of ATE and the 49.9% interest in Skyport, recurring revenue increased 9% on a like-for-like basis over the trailing period last year.\nTurning now to Slide 12. Development phase work is underway in 5 consortiums in which Aecon is a participant to deliver the GO Expansion On-Corridor Works project, the Scarborough Subway Extension project, the Darlington New Nuclear Project, the Contrecoeur Terminal Expansion project, and the U.S. Virgin Islands Airport Redevelopment Project. These projects are being delivered using collaborative progressive design build models, and each project is expected to move into the construction phase in 2025. The GO Expansion project also includes an operations and maintenance component over a 23-year term, commencing January 1, 2025. As a reminder, none of the anticipated work from these 5 progressive design build projects is yet reflected in backlog, but could in aggregate increase our backlog in 2025 to approximately double the level of our current backlog.\nTurning to Slide 13. With strong demand, growing recurring revenue programs and diverse backlog in hand, Aecon is focused on achieving solid execution on its projects and selectively adding to backlog through a disciplined bidding approach that supports long-term margin improvement in the Construction segment. In the Concession segment, there are a number of opportunities to add a to the existing portfolio of Canadian and international concessions in the next 12 months to 24 months, including projects with private sector clients that support a collective focus on sustainability and the transition to a net zero economy, as well as private sector development expertise and investment to support aging infrastructure, mobility, connectivity and population growth.\nRevenue in 2024 will be impacted by the 3 strategic transactions completed in 2023, the substantial completion of several large projects in 2023, the 4 legacy projects and the 5 major projects currently in the development phase by consortiums in which Aecon is a participant being delivered using the progressive design build or alliance models, which are expected to move into the construction phase in 2025. The completion and satisfactory resolution of claims on the remaining 3 legacy projects remains a critical focus, while the remainder of the business continues to perform as expected, supported by the strong level of backlog and the strong demand environment for Aecon services, including recurring revenue programs.\nFinally, turning to Slide 14. On July 2, Aecon Utilities Group acquired a majority interest in Xtreme Powerline Construction, an electrical distribution utility contractor headquartered in Michigan for a base purchase price of approximately $73 million, with the potential for additional contingent proceeds. Xtreme is a full-service powerline constructor with approximately 300 employees, specializing in overhead distribution line repair, maintenance, expansion and emergency restoration services throughout the Eastern United States for over 20 utility clients.\nThe acquisition of Xtreme creates opportunities to harness our collective utility infrastructure expertise and drive continued growth in priority markets. Xtreme's experienced team and strong client relationships are aligned with our business and we, along with our strategic partner, Oaktree, are pleased to welcome the Xtreme team to help advance our continued growth across North America with a focus on the energy transition.\nAs a final comment, I would like to thank our team members for their enduring efforts and ongoing focus on safety and consistent execution. I would like to call specific attention to our Kingstown Port team in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines who are leading a fundraising effort to support the recovery from Hurricane Beryl.\nThank you. We will now turn the call over to analysts for questions."

Welcome to the Q1 2024 Aecon Group Inc. Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand this over to our first speaker today, Adam Borgatti. Adam, please go ahead.\n\nAdam Borgatti\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for participating in our first quarter results conference call. With me today are Jean-Louis Servranckx, President and CEO; Jerome Julier, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Alistair MacCallum, Senior Vice President, Finance. Our earnings announcement was released yesterday evening, and we posted a slide presentation on the Investing section of our website, which we'll refer to during the call. Following our comments, we'll be glad to take questions from analysts. And we ask that analysts keep to one question and a follow-up before getting back into the queue to ensure others have a chance to contribute.\nAs noted on Slide 2 of the presentation, listeners are reminded that the information we are sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements. These statements are based on assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Although Aecon believes the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct. Now before I turn over the call, I'm pleased to welcome Jerome Julier as Aecon's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective April 8, 2024.\nWith nearly 20 years of finance, strategy and capital markets experience, particularly in construction, engineering and utility services, Jerome has been a trusted adviser to us and many of our clients and partners. Notably, he played key advisory roles in some of Aecon's Mall's transformative transactions, including the divestiture of Aecon Transportation and the strategic investment by Oaktree Capital Management and Aecon Utilities last year. With that, I'll hand the call over to Jerome.\n\nJerome Julier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to have joined Aecon. This is Dave [indiscernible] for me, and I've already found the passion, dedication and innovative spirit that defines this business. A huge thank you to the team for the warm welcome and strong support during my onboarding. It's been critical for me. I am meter to collaborate with the leadership team and the balance of the business to develop and excite our strategies that are going to optimize our financial performance and create value for shareholders.\nWith that, I'll now touch briefly on Aecon's consolidated results, review results by segment and then address Aecon's financial position before turning the call over to Jean-Louis.\nTurning to Slide 4. Revenue for the 3 months ended March 31, 2024, of $847 million was $261 million or 24% lower compared to the same period in 2023. The table has been included on Slide 16 of the conference call presentation to help contextualize our Q1 revenue performance. Adjusted EBITDA of $33 million, a margin of 3.9% compared to $25 million or a margin of 2.2% last year and operating loss of $4 million in the quarter compared to an operating profit of $6 million last year. Lower operating profit was attributed primarily to gain on sale of property plant equipment of $11 million recognized in the same period. Diluted loss per share in the quarter of $0.10 compared to diluted loss per share of $0.15 in the same period last year. Reported backlog of $6.3 billion at the end of the quarter compared to backlog of $6 million at the end of the first quarter in 2023. New contract awards of $963 million were booked in the quarter compared to $812 million in the prior period. We now look at the results by segment.\nTurning to Slide 5. Construction revenue of $844 million in the first quarter was $247 million or 23% lower than the same period last year. Revenue was lower in industrial operations, primarily due to decreased activity on mainline pipeline work following achievement of substantial completion on the project in the third quarter of 2023. And Urban Transportation Solutions from a lower volume of white rail transit work, civil operations from a lower volume building construction work as a result of the sale of Aecon Transportation East in the second quarter 2 and utilities operations from a decreased volume in telecommunications and oil and gas distribution work, partially offset by an increased volume of high-voltage electrical transmission and battery storage system work. Partially offsetting these decreases was higher revenue in our nuclear operations, driven by more volume of refurbishment work at nuclear generalizations in Ontario and the United States.\nNew contract awards of $960 million in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $795 million in the same period last year. Backlog at the end of the first quarter was $6.2 billion compared to $5.9 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Turning now to Slide 6. Adjusted EBITDA of $28 million emerged of 3.3% compared to $22 million or margin 2% last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $6 million due to higher volume and gross profit margin in nuclear operations and higher gross profit margin in Urban Transportation Solutions and utilities. These increases were offset by a decrease in gross profit in industrial operations.\nHigher operating profit in civil operations was primarily due to a lower seasonal operating loss contribution from our road building, construction work following the sale of a [ Contranspertation ] East in the second quarter of last year and partially offset by lower gross profit margin from major projects in Western Canada.\nNow over to Slide 7. Concessions revenue for the first quarter was $3 million compared to $17 million in the same period last year. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by the sale of 49.9% adjustment [ Skyport ] the Bermuda International Airport Concessionaire and use of equity method of accounting on a prospected basis for Aecon to retain to 50.1% interest in [ Skyport ]. Adjusted EBITDA in the Excess segment of $18 million compared to $50 million last year, primarily due to improved results from the Bermuda Airport and an increase in management and development fees. Passenger traffic Bermuda continues to improve, with an average of 81% in the first quarter of 2024 versus the pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2019 and compared to an average traffic in the first quarter of 2023 of 72% of the pre-pandemic level.\nTurning now to Slide 8. At the end of the first quarter, Aecon held cash and cash equivalents of $123 million, excluding cash and joint operations. In addition, at March 31, 2024, Aecon and committed revolving credit facilities of $850 million, of which $76 million was drawn and $7 million was utilized letters of credit. Aecon has no debt or working capital credit facility maturities until 2027, except equipment loans and leases in the normal course.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Jean-Louis.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Gerald. I'll speak first to the full legacy projects before addressing our business performance and outlook. Aecon and its joint venture partners remain focused on driving those legacy projects to completion, while pursuing fair and honorable settlement agreements in each case. The most recent interim settlement reached between the relevant joint ventures and the respective clients on each of the 4 projects and the cumulative adjustments made to forecast to date reflect the progress we are making toward completion.\nEvery day, we are getting closer to the end. However, we acknowledge that despite the progress made today, risk remains if assumptions, estimates or circumstances change. At March 31, 2024, the remaining backlog to be worked off of this project was $330 million compared to backlog of $420 million at December 31, 2023, and $81 million at March 31, 2023. The 4 legacy projects comprised 9% of consolidated revenue in the first quarter of 2024 and 5% of backlog at March 31, 2024 compared to 16% of consolidated revenue in the full year 2023 and 7% of backlog at December 31, 2023.\nTurning to Slide 10. Aecon's goal is to build a resilient company through a balanced and diversified work portfolio while enhancing critical execution capabilities and project selection to play to our strengths. We continue to leverage our self-perform capabilities and one Aecon approach to maximize value for clients through improved cost certainty and schedule while offering a broad range of services from development, engineering, investment and construction to longer-term operations and maintenance to cover the full infrastructure value chain.\nWhile we pursue and deliver the majority of our work in established markets, we are embracing new opportunities to grow in areas linked to decarbonization and the energy transition and in U.S. and international markets. These opportunities are intended over the long term to diversify Aecon's geographic presence, provide further growth opportunities and deliver more consistent earnings through economic cycles.\nTurning now to Slide 11. Demand for Aecon services across Canada continues to be strong with backlog of $6.3 billion at March 31, 2024, recurring revenue programs continuing to see robust demand and a strong bid pipeline. Aecon believes it's positioned to achieve further revenue growth over the next few years and is focused on achieving improved profitability and margin predictability. We are pursuing a balanced portfolio of work delivered through both fixed and fixed price contracting models with the goal of reducing fixed price work to balance risk with acceptable returns. Trailing 12 months recurring revenue of $1.1 billion was up 30% versus the prior year period and 54% versus 2 years ago. Contributions from the Go expansion on corridor works and Scarborough subway expansion projects during the respective development phases were the primary drivers of this growth.\nTurning to Slide 12. Development phase work is underweight in 5 consortiums in which Aecon is a participant to deliver the Go expansion on corridor works project, the Scarborough subway extension stations, rail and system projects, the Darlington new nuclear project, the contractor terminal expansion in Waterworks project and most recently, the U.S. Virgin Islands Airport redevelopment project, which is under a collaborative design, build, finance, operate and maintain model. These projects are being delivered using progressive design build models, and each project is expected to move into the construction phase in 2025.\nThe Go expansion project also includes an operations and maintenance component over a 23-year term commencing January 1, 2025. The loan of the anticipated work from those 5 progressive design build project is yet reflected in backlog. Turning to Slide 13. This week, Aecon released its fifth sustainability report, advancing the energy transition. -- showcasing our unwavering commitment to sustainability in our projects and the innovative methods we use.\nThis report highlights Aecon's initiatives to embed sustainable innovations and work towards net 0 construction throughout its operations. Aecon\\n is pleased to report continued progress towards its target to achieve a 30% reduction in direct CO2 emissions by 2030 with a reduction of 20% to date in open and 2 emissions since 2020 based on revenue intensity. Sustainability is part of our [ DNA ] at Aecon and a key consideration in every decision we make as we continue to focus on building what matters to enable future generations to strive and transition to a net 0 economy.\nTurning now to Slide 14. With strong demand, growing recurring revenue programs and diverse backlog in hand, Aecon is focused on achieving solid execution on its projects and selectively adding to backlog through a disciplined bidding approach that supports long-term margin improvement in the Construction segment. In the Concessions segment, there are a number of opportunities to add to the existing portfolio of Canadian and international concessions in the next 12 to 24 months, including projects with private sector clients that support a collective focus on sustainability and the transition to a net 0 economy as well as private sector development expertise and investment to support aging infrastructure, mobility, connectivity and population growth.\nOur revenue in 2024 will be impacted by the 3 strategic transactions completed in 2023, the substantial completion of several large projects in 2023, and the 5 major projects currently in the development phase by consortium, in which Aecon is a participant being delivered using the progressive design build models, which are expected to move into the construction phase in 2025.\nThe completion and satisfactory resolution of claim on the full legacy project with the respective clients remains a critical focus for the company and its partners. -- while the remainder of the business continued to perform as expected, supported by the strong level of backlog and the strong demand environment for Aecon services, including recurring revenue programs -- thank you. We will now turn the call over to analysts for questions."

Welcome to the Aecon Group Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Adam Borgatti. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Borgatti\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Abigail.\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for participating in our year-end 2023 results conference call. This is Adam Borgatti speaking, Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations.\nJoining me today are Jean-Louis Servranckx, President and CEO; and Alistair MacCallum, Senior Vice President, Finance.\nOur earnings announcement was released yesterday evening, and we have posted a slide presentation on the investing section of our website, which we will refer to during this call.\nAs noted on Slide 2 of the presentation, listeners are reminded that the information we are sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements. These statements are based on assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Although Aecon believes the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct.\nI'll touch first on highlights from Aecon's year-end review and Alistair will then review our consolidated and segment results for the year, and address Aecon's financial position. We would normally then turn the call over to Jean-Louis for our operational review and outlook, but unfortunately, he's lost most of his voice at this time, so I'll read his prepared remarks, and we'll save what voice he has left for your questions following the presentation.\nOn that note, following our comments, we'll be glad to take questions from analysts and ask that analysts keep one question before getting back into the queue to ensure others have a chance to contribute.\nNow turning to Slide 3. 2023 was a transformational year for Aecon, driven by 3 strategic transactions, which allowed us to capture unlocked value for shareholders, partner with respected institutions with significant experience to help Aecon grow in alignment with our strategy, and strengthen Aecon's balance sheet and capital position. Through the tremendous efforts of our teams, we were able to realize over $0.5 billion in proceeds through the sale of Aecon Transportation East, a 49.9% sale in Skyport, and Oaktree's investment in Aecon Utilities, all at attractive and accretive valuations.\nThe transactions strengthened Aecon's capital position, including through the repayment of $184 million in convertible debentures at the end of the year, and will provide financial flexibility to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities ahead. Aecon's free cash flow in 2023 of $123 million improved by $258 million compared to a negative $135 million in 2022. And we continue to focus on derisking our business with 58% of 2023 revenue on a non-fixed price basis compared to 49% non-fixed price work in 2022.\nFinally, interim agreements were reached on the 4 legacy projects with one reaching substantial completion in 2023, 2 expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2024, and the final one expected to be substantially complete during 2025.\nThe 4 legacy projects represent 7% of backlog at December 31, 2023, compared to 17% at the end of 2022. We would be the first to acknowledge that despite the progress made to date, risk remains if assumptions, estimates, and/or circumstances change, but we and our joint venture partners are focused on project completions, pursuing further recoveries, and putting these legacy projects behind us. Every day, we are getting closer to the end.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Alistair.\n\nAlistair MacCallum\n\nSenior Vice President of Finance\n\nThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone.\nTurning to Slide 4. Revenue for the year of $4.6 billion was $52 million or 1% lower compared to 2022. The lower revenue is largely attributable to the sale of Aecon's Transportation East business in the second quarter of 2023, which generated $51 million of revenue in 2023 compared with $326 million of revenue in 2022. Adjusting for the sale of Aecon's Transportation East business, revenue increased on a like-for-like basis by $223 million or 5% in the year. Adjusted EBITDA of $143 million, a margin of 3.1% compared to $219 million, a margin of 4.7% last year, and operating profit of $241 million compared to an operating profit of $97 million in 2022.\nExcluding the impact of the 4 legacy projects on results in 2023, adjusted EBITDA on the balance of the business was $359 million, a margin of 9.1%. Diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.10 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.47 in 2022. The improvement in operating profit and diluted earnings per share was largely due to a gain related to the sale of 49.9% interest in the Bermuda International Airport concessionaire of $139 million, including a fair value remeasurement gain of $80 million on Aecon's 50.1% retained interest in the concessionaire, a gain of $37 million from the sale of ATE and higher gains on the sale of property, buildings, and equipment of $39 million.\nReported backlog was $6.2 billion at the end of 2023 compared to backlog of $6.3 billion at the end of 2022. Backlog at the end of 2022 included $391 million from Aecon's Transportation East business. New contract awards of $4.5 billion were booked in the year compared to $4.8 billion a year ago. As announced yesterday, Aecon's Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.19 per share from $0.185 per share previously with the next payment to occur on April 3, 2024.\nNow looking at results by segment. Turning to page -- turning to Slide 5. Construction revenue of $4.6 billion in 2023 was $48 million or 1% lower than the previous year. The largest decrease in revenue occurred in civil operations driven by lower volume of roadbuilding construction work as a result of the sale of ATE discussed earlier, and partially offset by a higher volume of major projects work. Revenue was also lower in nuclear operations, driven by a lower volume of refurbishment work, and in industrial operations, driven by a lower volume of work, primarily at chemical facilities in Eastern Canada and partially offset by increased activity on mainline pipeline work.\nIn the utilities operations, lower revenue resulted primarily from a decrease in gas distribution work. Partially offsetting these decreases were higher revenue in urban transportation solutions, primarily from an increase in rail expansion and electrification work in Ontario. New contract awards were $4.4 billion in 2023 compared to $4.7 billion in the previous year. Construction backlog at the end of 2023 was $6.1 billion compared to $6.2 billion at the end of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 6. Adjusted EBITDA of $99 million, a margin of 2.2% compared to $193 million, a margin of 4.2% in 2022. The largest driver of the decrease was negative gross profit of $215 million in 2023 from 3 of the 4 fixed-price legacy projects versus a negative gross profit of $120 million last year or a negative year-over-year impact on operating profit of $95 million. Other than the impact of fixed-price legacy projects in 2023, higher operating profit in the balance of Construction segment was driven by higher volume and gross profit margin in urban transportation solutions, higher gross profit margin in industrial operations, and higher gains on sales of property, plant and equipment and utilities operations.\nHowever, these gains were partially offset by lower operating profit from roadbuilding construction work due to the sale of Aecon's Transportation East business and lower volume and gross profit margin in nuclear operations. At the end of 2023, the remaining backlog to be worked off on the 4 legacy projects was $420 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of 2022. These projects comprise 16% of consolidated revenue in both 2023 and 2022 while comprising 7% of backlog at the end of 2023 compared to 17% at the end of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 7. Concessions revenue for the year was $74 million compared to $76 million in 2022. The decrease in revenue was largely driven by the sale of a 49.9% interest in the Bermuda International Airport concessionaire and the use of equity method of accounting on a prospective basis for Aecon's retained 50.1% interest in Skyport. In 2023, passenger traffic levels in Bermuda averaged 75% of 2019 pre-pandemic traffic compared to 58% in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA in the Concessions segment of $90 million compared to $71 million in 2022, primarily driven due to improved results from the Bermuda Airport and an increase in management and development fees.\nAs noted previously, operating profit in Concessions reflects a gain in the sale in the year of $139 million.\nTurning to Slide 8. At the end of 2023, Aecon held cash and cash equivalents of $259 million, excluding cash in joint operations. In addition, at December 31, 2023, Aecon had committed revolving credit facilities of $850 million, of which $112 million was drawn and $6 million was utilized for letters of credit. On December 29, 2023, convertible debentures with a face value of $184 million were repaid in cash. Aecon has no debt or working capital credit facility maturities until 2027 except equipment loans and leases in the normal course.\nAecon plans to maintain a disciplined capital allocation approach focused on long-term shareholder value through acquisitions and divestitures, organic growth, dividends, and capital investments. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be similar to previous years.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call back over to Adam.\n\nAdam Borgatti\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Alistair.\nTurning to Slide 9. Aecon continues to build resilience through a balanced and diversified portfolio of work while enhancing critical execution capabilities and project selection to play to our strengths. Moving forward, we remain focused on leveraging our self-perform capabilities and One Aecon approach to maximize value for clients to improve cost certainty and schedule while offering a broad range of infrastructure services from development, engineering, investment, and construction to longer-term operations and maintenance.\nWe will continue to pursue and deliver the majority of our work in our established markets while embracing new opportunities to grow in areas linked to decarbonization and the energy transition as well as in the U.S. and international markets. These opportunities are intended over the long term to diversify Aecon's geographic presence, provide further growth opportunities, and deliver more consistent earnings through economic cycles.\nTurning to Slide 10. Demand for Aecon services across Canada continues to be strong. With backlog of $6.2 billion at the end of 2023, recurring revenue programs, seeing robust demand, and a strong bid pipeline, Aecon believes it is positioned to achieve further revenue growth over the next few years and is focused on achieving improved profitability and margin predictability. Revenue from recurring revenue programs increased to $1.1 billion in 2023 from $896 million in 2022, representing growth of over 27% over last year and 67% versus 2 years ago.\nIn addition, development work is ongoing in consortiums in which Aecon is a participant to deliver the GO Expansion On-Corridor Works project, the Scarborough Subway Extension, Stations, Rail and Systems project, and the Darlington New Nuclear project, all in Ontario. These projects are being delivered using progressive design-build models, and each project is expected to move into the construction phase in 2025.\nThe GO Expansion project also includes an operations and maintenance component over a 23-year term commencing January 1, 2025. As a reminder, none of the anticipated work from these 3 progressive design-build projects is yet reflected in backlog.\nTurning to Slide 11. Aecon continues to support the energy transition to build and operate sustainable infrastructure. Projects such as the Oneida Energy Storage project, GO Expansion, the Scarborough Subway Extension, and the Darlington SMR demonstrate the path Aecon is on to embrace the opportunities linked to decarbonization, sustainability, and the energy transition.\nRevenue tied to sustainability projects represented 64% of 2023 revenue versus 60% in 2022.\nTurning to Slide 12 and in conclusion, 2023 was a transformational year for Aecon, driven by significant transactions aligned with our strategy and the strengthening of our capital position, all paving the way for growth. We want to thank our employees for their contributions to the achievements this year, and we look forward to the years ahead as we continue to build resilience through a balanced and diversified portfolio of work.\n2024 revenue will be impacted by the 3 strategic transactions completed in 2023, the substantial completion of several large projects in the year, and the 3 major projects currently in the development phase being delivered under progressive design-build models, which are expected to move into the construction phase in 2025.\nThe completion and satisfactory resolution of claims on the 4 legacy projects with their respective clients remains a critical focus for Aecon and our partners, while the remainder of the business continues to perform as expected, supported by the strong level of backlog and new awards during 2023 and the strong demand environment for Aecon services, including recurring revenue programs.\nThank you. And we'll now turn the call over to analysts for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Adam Borgatti. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Borgatti\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. This is Adam Borgatti speaking. Presenting to you this morning are Jean-Louis Servranckx, President and CEO; and David Smales, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nOur earnings announcement was released yesterday evening and we posted a slide presentation on the Investing section of our website, which we will refer to during this call. Following our comments, we'll be glad to take questions from the analysts and we ask that analysts keep to one question and a follow up before getting back into the queue to ensure all have a chance to contribute.\nAs noted on Slide 2, listeners are reminded that the information we're sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements. These statements are based on assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Although Aecon believes the expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid Smales\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. I'll touch briefly on Aecon's consolidated results, review results by segment and then address Aecon's financial position before turning the call over to Jean-Louis.\nTurning to Slide 3, revenue for the third quarter of $1.2 billion with $81 million or 6% lower compared to the same period last year, primarily due to the impact of the sale of Aecon Transportation East, or ATE, in the second quarter of this year. Adjusting for the sale of ATE, revenue increased on a like-for-like basis by $46 million or 4% in the quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA of $32 million, a margin of 2.6% compared to $93 million, a margin of 7% last year. And operating profit of $140 million compared to an operating profit of $61 million in the third quarter of 2022. Excluding the impact of the 4 legacy projects on results in the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA from the balance of the business was $123 million, a margin of 11.6%. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter of $1.63 compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.45 in the same period last year.\nImprovement in operating profit and diluted earnings per share was largely due to a gain related to the sale of 49.9% interest in the Bermuda International Airport concessionaire of $139 million, including a fair value remeasurement gain of $80 million on Aecon's 50.1% retained interest. A reported backlog of $6.2 billion at the end of the quarter after removing $447 million of backlog in Q2 related to the sale of ATE compared to a backlog of $6.3 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2022. New contract awards of $591 million were booked in the quarter compared to $991 million in the prior period.\nNow looking at results by segment, turning to Slide 4. Construction revenue of $1.2 billion in the third quarter was $83 million or 6% lower than the same period last year. This was due to lower revenue in civil operations driven by lower volume of road building construction work in Eastern Canada as a result of the sale of ATE in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by an increase in major project work in Western Canada.\nAfter adjusting for the impact of the sale of ATE, Construction revenue was $41 million or 3% higher than the same period last year. New contract awards of $563 million in the third quarter compared to $966 million in the same period last year. Backlog at the end of the quarter of $6.1 billion compared to $6.2 billion at the same time last year.\nTurning to Slide 5, adjusted EBITDA in the Construction segment of $17 million with $65 million unfavorable compared to the third quarter of last year. The decrease was driven by a negative gross profit of $42 million from a fixed price legacy project in civil operations versus a gross profit of $1 million in the same period last year from the same project, and by a negative gross profit of $50 million from one of the 4 fixed price legacy projects in Urban Transportation Solutions compared to a negative gross profit of $23 million in the same period last year from the same project.\nOther than the impact of fixed price legacy projects in the quarter, lower operating profit in the balance of the Construction segment was driven by lower operating profit from road building construction work due to the sale of ATE in the second quarter of this year and was largely offset by higher gross profit margin in nuclear operations and urban transportation solutions and lower MG&A in utilities operations.\nAt September 30, the remaining backlog to be worked off on the 4 legacy projects was $528 million compared to $1.1 billion at the end of 2022. These projects comprised 14% of consolidated revenue in the third quarter compared to 16% in the full year 2022 and 9% of backlog at September 30 compared to 17% at the end of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 6. Concessions revenue for the third quarter was $26 million compared to $22 million in the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in airport operations at the Bermuda International Airport. Bermuda continues to operate at a reduced volume compared to pre-pandemic levels, but continued to recover in the first 9 months of 2023 from the more severe impacts experienced in 2020, 2021. This recovery was evidenced by the fact that traffic in the third quarter averaged 75% of the pre-pandemic level in the third quarter of 2019 compared to average traffic in the third quarter of 2022 being 63% at the pre-pandemic levels.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Concessions segment of $27 million compared to $21 million in Q3 last year, primarily due to results from the Bermuda Airport and an increase in management and development fees. As noted previously, operating profit in Concessions reflects a gain on sale in the quarter of $139 million.\nTurning to Slide 7. At the end of the third quarter, Aecon had net cash of over $400 million, including cash in joint operations. On December 31, 2023, convertible debentures with a face value of $184 million will mature and we expect to repay these debentures at maturity or before.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Jean-Louis.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning all. The impact of the 4 fixed price legacy projects being performed by joint ventures in which Aecon is a participant was felt again in our third quarter results. However, we have made significant progress during 2023 on driving these projects towards completion. One of the 4 projects reached substantial or mechanical completion in the third quarter as committed with our client, with 2 of the remaining 3 projects currently expected to be substantially complete by date between late 2023 and mid-2024, and the final one currently expected to be substantially complete during 2025.\nAecon and its joint venture partners remain focused on dedicating all necessary resources to complete those 4 legacy projects, and in the meantime, continue to pursue fair and reasonable settlement agreements with the respective clients in each case. In this respect, we have also made progress in recent quarters. The most recent settlements reached and agreed to between the relevant joint ventures of the respective clients on each of the 4 projects, including one in the second quarter and 2 in the third quarter of 2023 have brought additional clarity on schedule, compensation, construction costs and other potential liabilities.\nWe would be the first to acknowledge that despite this progress and the adjustments we've taken in recent quarters, the risk remains in the event that assumptions, estimate and also circumstances change. But we and our joint venture partners are fully focused on completion, pursuing further recoveries and putting those legacy projects behind us. Every day we are getting closer to the end.\nTurning to Slide 9. Demand for Aecon services across Canada continues to be strong. While volatile global and Canadian economic conditions are impacting inflation, interest rates and overall supply chain efficiency, those factors have stabilized to some extent and have largely been and will continue to be reflected in the pricing and commercial sales of Aecon's recent and prospective project awards and bids. Despite results having been impacted by the 4 legacy projects in recent periods, there are positive revenue and profitability trends in the balance of Aecon's business that reflect the underlying demand dynamics in the market and strong execution across the balance of our projects.\nTurning to Slide 10. With a backlog of $6.2 billion at September 30, 2023, and recurring revenue programs continuing to see robust demand, Aecon believes it is positioned to achieve further revenue growth over the next few years. As a reminder, the major scopes of the GO Rail Expansion On-Corridor Works project, the Scarborough Subway Extension project and the Darlington New Nuclear project will only be reflected in backlog at the successful conclusion of the lengthy development phases. Aecon, including joint ventures in which we are a participant, is also prequalified on a number of project bids due to be awarded during the next 12 months and have a considerable pipeline of opportunities to further add to backlog over time.\nTrailing 12 months recurring revenue of $1.1 billion was up 40% versus the prior period and 69% versus 2 years ago. Utilities operation and contributions from the GO Expansion On-Corridor Works and Scarborough Subway Extension project during the respective development phases were the primary drivers of this growth. Utilities operation and further advancement from this project as we continue through the development phases are expected to contribute to future growth in recurring revenue. The Concessions segment is also expected to see airport traffic in Bermuda continue its recovery in 2023 and '24.\nTurning to Slide 11. Aecon continues to support the energy transition to build and operate sustainable infrastructure. In the second quarter of 2023, the Oneida Energy Storage project achieved financial close with Aecon Concessions as an 8.35% equity partner. Earlier this year, Aecon was awarded the $141 million EPC contract by Oneida Limited partnership to build this 250-megawatt 1,000 megawatt hour advanced stage grid-connected battery storage project, representing the largest clean energy storage project in Canada.\nProjects such as Oneida Energy Storage, GO Expansion, Scarborough Subway Extension and Darlington SMR demonstrate the path Aecon is on to embrace the opportunities linked to decarbonization, sustainability and the energy transition.\nTurning to Slide 12. With strong demand, growing recurring revenue programs, diverse backlog in hand, Aecon is focused on achieving solid execution on its projects and selectively adding to backlog through a disciplined bidding approach that supports long-term margin improvement in the Construction segment. In the CONCESSIONS segment, in addition to expecting an ongoing recovery in travel through the Bermuda International Airport through the remainder of 2023, there are a number of opportunities to add to the existing portfolio of Canadian and international concessions in the next 12 to 24 months, including projects with private sector clients that support a collective focus on sustainability and the transition to a net zero economy.\nThe GO Expansion On-Corridor Works project and the Oneida Energy Storage Project noted above are examples of the role Aecon's Concessions segment is playing in developing, operating and maintaining assets related to this transition.\nFinally, on Slide 13, as disclosed on October 23, Aecon announced a strategic investment by Oaktree Capital Management in Aecon Utilities. The investment closed on October 24. Oaktree acquired a 27.5% ownership interest in Aecon Utilities by way of a net $150 million investment. This equates to a valuation of $750 million and a trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA multiple of 9.3x.\nThe investment positions the business to address attractive industry growth opportunities across utility end markets in Canada and in the U.S., provides financial flexibility to accelerate Aecon Utilities acquisition strategy, introduces a recognized value-added partner in Oaktree with a successful track record in utility infrastructure investing and strengthens Aecon's balance sheet, providing Aecon the financial flexibility to fund our strategic growth initiatives. We are delighted to partner with an experienced and value-added investor in Oaktree to continue to grow Aecon Utilities across North America.\nThank you. We will now turn the floor over to analysts for questions."

Thank you for attending today's Q2 2023 Aecon Group Inc. Earnings Call. My name is Lauren, and I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to pass the conference over to our host, Adam Borgatti, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Mr. Borgatti, please proceed.\n\nAdam Borgatti\n\nSenior Vice President of Corporate Development & Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Lauren. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for participating in our second quarter results conference call. Presenting to you this morning are Jean-Louis Servranckx, President and CEO; and David Smales, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nOur earnings announcement was released yesterday evening, and we have posted a slide presentation on the Investing section of our website which we'll refer to during this call.\nFollowing our comments, we'd be glad to take questions from analysts, and we ask that the analysts keep to one question before getting back into the queue to ensure others have a chance to contribute.\nAs noted on Slide 2 of the presentation, listeners are reminded the information we're sharing with you today includes forward-looking statements. These statements are based on assumptions that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. And although Aecon believes these expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid Smales\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Adam, and good morning, everyone. I'll touch briefly on Aecon's consolidated results, review results by segment and then address Aecon's financial position before turning the call over to Jean-Louis.\nTurning to Slide 3, revenue for the second quarter of CAD 1.2 billion was CAD 44 million, or 4%, higher compared to the same period last year and is 8% higher on a year-to-date basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA of CAD 17 million, a margin of 1.4%, compared to CAD 39 million, a margin of 3.4%, last year, and operating profit of CAD 56 million compared to an operating profit of CAD 5 million. Diluted earnings per share in the quarter of CAD 0.38 compared to a diluted loss per share of CAD 0.10 in the same period last year.\nThe improvement in operating profit and diluted earnings per share was largely due to an increase in other income of CAD 70 million, driven primarily by a CAD 38 million gain on the sale of Aecon's Transportation East business, or ATE, and a CAD 31 million gain on the sale of certain property and equipment, which more than offset the CAD 53 million negative impact of larger period-over-period margin adjustments related to legacy fixed-price projects.\nReported backlog of CAD 6.9 billion at the end of the quarter, after removing CAD 447 million of backlog in Q2 related to the sale of ATE, compared to backlog of CAD 6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2022. New contract awards of CAD 2 billion were booked in the quarter, compared to CAD 1.3 billion in the prior period.\nNow looking at results by segment, turning to Slide 4. Construction revenue of CAD 1.1 billion in the first quarter was CAD 35 million, or 3%, higher than the same period last year.\nRevenue was higher in civil operations, driven by an increase in major projects in both Eastern and Western Canada and road-building construction work in Western Canada, partially offset by a lower volume of road-building construction work in Eastern Canada as a result of the sale of ATE in the quarter. In industrial operations, higher revenue was primarily due to increased activity on mainline pipeline work in Western Canada. And in utilities operations, higher revenue was driven by an increase in telecommunications and high-voltage electrical transmission work.\nPartially offsetting these increases was lower revenue in nuclear operations from a lower volume of refurbishment work and in urban transportation solutions, primarily from a decrease in LRT project work.\nNew contract awards of CAD 2 billion in the second quarter compared to CAD 1.3 billion in the same period last year. Backlog at the end of the quarter of CAD 6.8 billion compared to CAD 6.5 billion at the same time last year.\nTurning to Slide 5, adjusted EBITDA in the Construction segment of negative CAD 4 million was CAD 38 million unfavorable compared to the second quarter of last year. The decrease was driven by negative gross profit of CAD 31 million in the second quarter from a fixed-price legacy project in civil operations, versus a gross profit of CAD 4 million in the same period last year from the same project, and by a negative gross profit of CAD 50 million from 1 of the 4 fixed-price legacy projects in urban transportation solutions, compared to a negative gross profit of CAD 33 million from one of the other fixed-price legacy projects in urban transportation solutions in the same period last year.\nOther than the impact of these fixed-price legacy projects in the quarter, higher gross profit in the balance of the Construction segment was primarily driven by improved results in urban transportation solutions.\nAt June 30, the remaining backlog to be worked off on these 4 projects was CAD 699 million, compared to CAD 1.1 billion at the end of 2022. The 4 legacy projects comprised 13% of consolidated revenue in the second quarter and 10% of backlog at June 30, compared to 16% of consolidated revenue in the full year 2022 and 17% of backlog at December 31.\nTurning to Slide 6, Concessions revenue for the second quarter was CAD 27 million, compared to CAD 19 million in the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in airport operations at the Bermuda International Airport. Bermuda continues to operate at a reduced volume compared to prepandemic levels, but continued to recover in 2022 and into the first half of 2023 from the more severe impacts experienced in 2020 and 2021. This recovery was evidenced by the fact that traffic in the second quarter averaged 73% of the prepandemic level in the second quarter of 2019, compared to average traffic in the second quarter of 2022 being just 43% of the prepandemic level.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the Concessions segment of CAD 28 million compared to CAD 17 million in Q2 last year, primarily due to results from the Bermuda airport and an increase in management and development fees.\nTurning to Slide 7, at the end of the second quarter Aecon had a committed revolving credit facility of CAD 600 million, of which CAD 188 million was drawn and CAD 11 million utilized for letters of credit.\nOn December 31, 2023, convertible debentures with a face value of CAD 184 million will mature, and we expect to repay these debentures at maturity or before.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Jean-Louis.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dave. The significant impacts on the 4 large fixed-price legacy projects being performed by joint ventures in which Aecon is a participant continue to be felt in our results. Aecon and our partners are working towards resolution and compensation for the impacts of these projects [indiscernible] with the respective project owners, focused on reaching fair and reasonable settlement agreements as we move towards project completion in each case.\nAs I've said before, this will take some time, but we are on it constantly and making progress. 3 of the 4 projects are currently expected to be substantially complete by dates between late 2023 and the middle of 2024, and the fourth is currently expected to be substantially complete during 2025.\nTurning to Slide 9, demand for Aecon's services across Canada continues to be strong. While volatile global and Canadian economic conditions are impacting inflation, interest rates and overall supply chain efficiency, those factors have stabilized to some extent and have largely been and will continue to be reflected in the pricing and commercial terms of Aecon's recent and prospective project awards and bids. However, results have been negatively impacted by the 4 legacy projects in recent periods, undermining positive revenue and profitability trends in the balance of Aecon's business.\nTurning to Slide 10, with backlog of CAD 6.9 billion at June 30, 2023, and recurring revenue programs continuing to see robust demand, Aecon believes it's positioned to achieve further revenue growth over the next few years.\nIn the second quarter, Aecon was awarded a number of projects that were added to backlog, including delivery of the Deerfoot Trail Improvements Project in Alberta and\n[Technical Difficulty]\n\nOperator\n\nApologies. It appears we have lost connection with Jean-Louis' [indiscernible] line. Please stand by while we try to reconnect him.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThe Scarborough Subway Extension Project and the Darlington New Nuclear Project will only be reflected in backlog and a successful conclusion of the lengthy development phases.\nAecon, including joint ventures in which we're a participant, is also prequalified on a number of project bids due to be awarded during the next 12 months and has a considerable pipeline of opportunities to further add to backlog over time.\nComing back, [ sorry for this ], trailing-12-months recurring revenue of CAD 1.1 billion was up 40% versus the prior period and 74% versus 2 years ago. Utilities operations and contributions from the GO Expansion On Corridor Works and Scarborough Subway Extension Project during the respective development phases were the primary drivers of this growth. Utility operations and further advancement from these projects as we continue through the development phases are expected to contribute to future growth in recurring revenue.\nThe Concessions segment is also expected to see airport traffic in Bermuda continue its recovery in 2023 and 2024.\nTurning to Slide 11, Aecon continues to support the energy transition to build and operate sustainable infrastructure. In the second quarter, the Oneida Energy Storage Project achieved financial close, with Aecon Concessions as an 8.35% equity partner. Earlier this year, Aecon was awarded a CAD 141 million EPC contract by Oneida Limited Partnership to build this 250-megawatt, 1,000-megawatt hour, advanced-stage, grid-connected battery storage project, representing the largest clean energy storage project in Canada.\nProjects such as Oneida Energy Storage, GO Expansion On Corridor Works, Scarborough Subway Extension and the Darlington New Nuclear Project demonstrate the path Aecon is on to embrace the opportunities linked to decarbonization, sustainability and the energy transition.\nTurning to Slide 12. In addition to large-scale energy projects, we continue to expand our portfolio with Aecon's green energy services through residential and commercial renewable energy projects. This also includes strategic partnerships with companies to provide electrification and charging infrastructure that enables municipal transit agencies and other corporate fleets to power their vehicles using clean energy.\nWe continue to work towards reducing our own emissions and have been switching our operations to more sustainable fuels and piloting new technologies such as the use of hydrogen generation, renewable power on construction sites and electric equipment.\nTurning to Slide 13, with strong demand, growing recurring revenue program and diverse backlog in hand, Aecon is focused on achieving solid execution on these projects and selectively adding to backlog through a disciplined bidding approach that supports long-term margin improvement in the Construction segment.\nIn the Concessions segment, in addition to expecting an ongoing recovery in travel through the Bermuda International Airport through 2023, there are a number of opportunities to add to the existing portfolio of Canadian and international concessions in the next 12 to 24 months, including projects with private-sector clients that support a collective focus on sustainability and the transition to a net zero economy.\nThe GO Expansion On Corridor Works Project and the Oneida Energy Storage Project noted above are examples of the role Aecon's Concessions segment is playing in developing, operating and maintaining assets related to this transition.\nThank you. We will now turn the call over to analysts for questions."

I'll touch briefly on Aecon's consolidated results, review results by segment and then address Aecon's financial position before turning the call over to Jean-Louis. Turning to slide 3; revenue for the first quarter of CAD1.1 billion was CAD121 million or 12% higher compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA of CAD25 million, a margin of 2.2% compared to CAD21 million, a margin of 2.1% last year and operating profit of CAD6 million compared to an operating loss of CAD10 million. Diluted loss per share in the quarter of CAD0.15 compared to diluted loss per share of CAD0.29 in the same period last year.\nReported backlog of CAD6 billion at the end of the quarter compared to backlog of CAD6.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2022. New contract awards of CAD812 million were booked in the quarter compared to CAD1.2 billion in the prior period. Now looking at results by segment; turning to slide 4; Construction revenue of CAD1.1 billion in the first quarter was CAD119 million or 12% higher than the same period last year. Revenue was higher in each sector, with the largest increase being in civil operations primarily from an increase in major projects in both Eastern and Western Canada.\nIn Industrial Operations, higher revenue due to increased activity on mainline pipeline work and higher field construction work at mining and wastewater facilities in Western Canada, partially offset by a lower volume of field construction work at chemical facilities in Eastern Canada. Higher revenue in nuclear operations was driven by an increased volume of refurbishment work in Ontario and the U.S. In Utilities from an increased volume of telecommunications and electrical transmission work, partially offset by a lower volume of oil and gas distribution work and in Urban Transportation Solutions, driven primarily by higher volume of work related to rail electrification in Ontario.\nNew contract awards of CAD795 million in the first quarter were CAD398 million lower than the prior period. Backlog at the end of the quarter of CAD5.9 billion compared to CAD6.3 billion at the same time last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the Construction segment were CAD22 million, a margin of 2% compared to CAD19 million, also a margin of 2% in Q1 last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased by CAD3 million, primarily from higher volume and gross profit margin in Industrial and Urban Transportation Solutions and from higher volume in Nuclear Operations. Turning to slide 6; Concessions revenue for the first quarter was CAD17 million compared to CAD14 million in the same period last year, primarily due to an increase in airport operations at the Bermuda International Airport.\nBermuda continues to operate at a reduced volume compared to pre-pandemic levels but continue to recover in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 from the more severe impacts experienced in 2020 and 2021. This recovery was evidenced in the first quarter of 2023 by the fact that traffic averaged 72% of at the pre-pandemic level in the first quarter of 2019 compared to average traffic in the first quarter of 2022 being just 43% of the pre-pandemic level. Adjusted EBITDA in the Concessions segment of CAD15 million compared to CAD14 million in Q1 2022, primarily due to results from the Bermuda Airport.\nTurning to slide 7; at the end of the first quarter, Aecon had a committed revolving credit facility of CAD600 million, of which CAD240 million was drawn and CAD10 million utilized for letters of credit. On December 31, 2023, convertible debentures with a face value of CAD184 million will mature and the company expects to repay these debentures at maturity or before.\nAt this point, I'll turn the call over to Jean-Louis.\n\nJean-Louis Servranckx\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Dave. I would like to take a brief moment to address the four large fixed-price legacy projects laid out in our latest disclosure documents. As a reminder, these four projects entered into in 2018 or earlier by joint ventures in which Aecon is a participant are being negatively impacted due to additional costs, for which the joint ventures assert that the owners are contractually responsible, including four among other things and foreseeable site conditions, third-party delays, COVID-19, supply chain disruptions and inflation-related to labor and materials.\nIn the first quarter, Aecon recognized an operating loss of CAD2.8 million related to these four projects, which comprise 25% of consolidated revenue in the quarter and represented CAD801 million or 13% of backlog at March 31, 2023. Aecon and our partners continue to work towards resolution of compensation for these impacts with the respective project owners, and we are focused on pursuing all avenues for adequate and timely compensation with the objective to reach fair and reasonable settlement agreements and to move towards project completion in each case.\nAs I've said before, this will take some time, but we are on it and constantly. Turning to slide 9; demand for Aecon Services across Canada continues to be strong, particularly in smaller and medium-sized projects. While volatile global and Canadian economic conditions are impacting inflation, interest rates and overall supply chain efficiency these factors have stabilized to some extent and have largely been and will continue to be reflected in the pricing and commercial terms of our recent and prospective project awards and bids.\nTurning to slide 10; with backlog of CAD6.0 billion at March 31, 2023, and recurring revenue programs continuing to see robust demand, driven by the utility sectors and ongoing recovery in airport traffic in Bermuda, Aecon believes it is positioned to achieve further revenue growth over the next few years. As a reminder, the major scope of the GO Rail Expansion On-Corridor Works Project, the Scarborough Subway Extension Project and the Darlington New Nuclear Project will only be reflected in backlog at the successful conclusion of the [indiscernible] development phases. Aecon, including joint venture in which we are a participant is also prequalified on a number of project bids due to be awarded during the next 12 months, another considerable pipeline of opportunities to further add to backlog over time.\nTrailing 12 months recurring revenue of CAD895 million was up 24% versus the prior period and 69% versus two years ago, primarily from growth in utilities operations. Recurring revenue is expected to continue to grow, driven by demand in the utility sector and the Concessions segment is expected to see airport traffic in Bermuda continue its recovery in 2023 and '24. Turning to slide 11; Aecon continues to support the energy transition to build and operate sustainable infrastructure. In February 2023, Aecon announced that the Oneida Energy Storage L.P. executed an agreement for the Oneida Energy Storage Project to deliver 250 megawatt 1,000 megawatt hour energy storage facility in Ontario.\nAecon Concessions will be an equity partner in the Oneida L.P. upon financial close and Aecon was also awarded an EPC contract by Oneida L.P. to construct the facility. Projects as Oneida Energy Storage, GO Expansion On-Corridor Works, Scarborough Subway Extension and the Darlington New Nuclear Project demonstrates the path Aecon is on to embrace the opportunities and the increasing focus on energy transition, decarbonization and sustainability present. This is very much the future direction for Aecon, and we are excited by the progress made to-date in establishing ourselves in this space.\nTurning to slide 12; Aecon released its fourth Sustainability Report building a sustainable future last week, outlining our progress and key accomplishments in responsible ESG practices. This report highlights Aecon initiatives to embed sustainable innovations and work towards Net Zero construction throughout its operations. Aecon is pleased to report continued progress towards its target to achieve a 30% reduction in direct CO2 emissions by 2030 with a 14% direct reduction already achieved to-date by the end of 2022 on an intensity basis.\nSustainability is part of our DNA at Aecon and a key consideration in every decision we make as we continue to focus on building what matters to enable future generations to thrive and transition to a Net Zero economy. Turning to slide 13 with strong demand, growing recurring revenue programs and diverse backlog in hand, Aecon is focused on achieving solid execution on this project and selectively adding to backlog through a disciplined bidding approach that supports long-term margin improvement in the Construction segment.\nIn the Concessions segment, in addition to expecting an ongoing recovery at the Bermuda Airport through 2023 there are a number of opportunities to add to the existing portfolio of Canadian and International Concessions in the next 12 to 24 months, including projects with private sector clients that support a collective focus on sustainability and the transition to a Net Zero economy. The GO Expansion On-Corridor Works project and the Oneida Energy Storage Project are example of the role Aecon Concessions segment is playing in developing, operating and maintaining assets related to this transition.\nAs previously announced on March 1, Aecon announced that it has entered into a definitive purchase agreement with Green Infrastructure Partners, under which Aecon has agreed to sell its ATE Road Building Aggregates and Materials business in Ontario for CAD235 million in cash. In addition, on March 15, Aecon announced that it has entered into an agreement with CC&L Infrastructure to sell a 49.9% interest in the Bermuda International Airport Concessionaire for $128.5 million in cash. Closing of these sales transactions is expected in the second quarter of 2023. Upon closing, Aecon expects to use the net proceeds from the transactions to pay down debt on its revolving credit facility.\nThank you. We will now turn the call over to analysts for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz as the Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaula Schwartz\n\nMD, Rx Communications Group LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. With me today are Hallie Kuhn, Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga. Want to thank you for joining Alexandria's fourth quarter and year-end 2022 earnings call and wishing you a safe and healthy New Year. And thank you to our Alexandria family team members for their continued operational excellence across all facets of our unique business platform, a truly mission-driven, one-of-a-kind company.\nWe have truly exceptional fourth quarter and 2022 year-end results and by any and all metrics. We're very proud, thankful and humbled, while many public reporting companies have really struggled mightily during this past year. Like to take a moment to tick off what I consider to be some of the most notable news for Alexandria, truly amazing that Alexandria has delivered approximately 8.5% FFO per share earnings growth while continuing to strengthen our fortress balance sheet, the strongest in our history, and Dean will give you more details on that, against the backdrop of a very deleterious macro market in this 2022 year and really, again, nothing short of operational excellence to the team.\nWith our highly leased development pipeline and continued strong leasing, and Peter will comment on that, Alexandria is well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth again in 2023. We have continued to create long-term shareholder value with a total shareholder return from IPO through the end of the year, December 31, 2022, of 1,673% compared to the MSCI REIT Index of 684%, S&P 500 to 628%, NASDAQ 838%. So a wide margin of beat. Alexandria continues to produce stable, increasing long-duration cash flows and an increasing dividend. We're very proud of our approximately 1,000 client tenant base, a one-of-a-kind treasure that continues to generate remarkable demand for our Alexandria lab space, and Peter and Dean will highlight more on this. But again, 2 million square feet leased in fourth quarter, over 8 million for the year and almost 18 million for the last 2 years, with rental rate increases last year of about 22% on a cash basis, pretty amazing stats. And we're very proud of our own tenant base, which is generated, by far and away, the majority of that lease space.\n4Q '22 and year-end 2022 was another strong quarter by all fundamental financial metrics and a few others, and Dean will highlight some of this. Almost 100% on collections from a very strong and durable tenant base and very proud of almost 95% occupancy. And a -- we put in, I think, a very strong same-store performance, both for the quarter and the year.\nInnovation in medicine is, but must continue to be a national imperative. One in 4 of us will develop a neurodegenerative disease. Nearly 40% of adult men and women will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. 1 in 5 in the nation's population suffers from mental illness, and we're continuing to see over 100,000 deaths due to overdose last year despite all of the efforts that certainly this company has made with our Dayton project. But just a -- literally a war out there, which does not seem to be in check and governments at the federal state and local level need to double down with the vast amount of resources that have been appropriate over the last few years and really focus on this mental health issue.\nA comment about our successful and continuing value harvesting and recycling of our precious capital. Peter will detail that, but amazingly, stellar 2022 with $2.2 billion successfully harvested and then reinvested in a highly disciplined manner, And Peter and Dean will also comment on the excellent and steady progress we've made year-to-date, just 1 month in to our 2023 business plan for value harvesting and capital recycling, and we're very optimistic about that.\nAnd then before I pass it over to Hallie I want to particularly call out and thank our finance team and all those who had a hand in the impressive balance sheet accomplishments set forth on Page XV of our supplement, and very proud that we, once again, have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Hallie for further comments.\n\nHallie Kuhn\n\nThank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to provide a recap of the life science industry coming out of 2022 and now into 2023, and how our highly unique approximately 1,000 tenants remain resilient through the volatility of the current macroeconomic environment. As Joel mentioned, and as we often talk about, the 90% of 10,000 diseases remains an incredible opportunity and unmet need. And the fact is, many of these that do have treatments are far from solved. Take type 1 diabetes. While it was a death sentence before the discovery of insulin over 100 years ago, it still carries an immense burden. A person with type 1 diabetes makes on average 180 health-related decisions a day, some of which have life or death consequences.\nNow looking back at 2022, the stats truly speak for themselves regarding the enduring strength of the life science industry, of which I'll highlight 3. First, despite widespread commentary that VC funding hit the pause button in 2022, life science venture deals totaled nearly $58 billion. Other than 2021's record year, it was the second highest amount of capital ever deployed. Of note, over 70% of VC dollars deployed went into an Alexandria cluster, and with VC funds across tech and life science raising nearly $160 billion in 2022, a record eclipsing 2021 is $150 billion, significant dry powder is on hand to deploy over a multiyear time horizon.\nSecond, large pharma continues to be 1 of the best performing sectors in the market. In a year where total returns for market indices such as the NASDAQ and Dow ended the year down 10%, the top 20 biopharma ended the year up an average 12%, with 8 of the top 20 pharma ending the year with total returns over 20%. With historic levels of cash on hand, over $300 billion to deploy into R&D and M&A, biopharma has the firepower to continue to innovate and grow.\nAnd last, the pipeline of early innovation to commercialization continues to deliver to patients, with 37 novel FDA small molecule and biologic approvals, 3 gene therapy approvals and a novel cell therapy approval, of which nearly half were developed by Alexandria tenants.\nMoving to Alexandria's unrivaled life science tenant roster. We wanted to provide additional color on our business segments and some examples of Alexandria's tenants at the forefront of life science innovation. Starting with large pharma, $260 billion was reinvested into R&D in 2021, and analysts estimate that, including leverage, pharma has over $600 billion to deploy into M&A and partnerships. The next several years, indeed decade are going to be framed by large pharma's continued pursuit of innovation as product patents expire and new types of medicines such as mRNA and cell therapies transition from large preclinical and clinical pipelines to commercial stage.\nAlexandria tenant Pfizer is a great example, with preclinical and clinical -- sorry, with over 110 programs spanning early to late clinical developments, and an estimated 19 products launching in the next 18 months. The company also noted in their 4Q earnings this morning, they are targeting an additional $25 billion in revenue to come from M&A activity by 2030.\nTransitioning to public biotech, our tenant base includes the majority commercial stage companies, which brought in nearly $150 billion in revenue in 2021. Tenants such as Amgen, Vertex have large diversified pipelines, driving long-term growth. As a note, Vertex is also leading the next generation of type 1 diabetes treatment with a novel clinical stage cell therapy that addresses the root cause of diabetes.\nFor clinical-stage biotechnology companies, data is king. And those that have met and will meet clinical milestones in 2023, continue to see stock recovery and ability to access capital through follow-on financings. While the public markets are still recovering, life science follow-on financings reached nearly $17 billion in 2022, which is right on par with the average life science follow-on financings over the past decade.\nWith respect to life science products, service and devices, this segment largely consists of commercial stage tenants. While not immune to higher interest rates and supply chain challenges, this is a big business segment that both drives and responds to the needs of researchers across academia, biotech and large pharma, which continue to grow and innovate. A notable development in the space is the rapid drop in the price of genome sequencing, driven by a healthy increase in competition. Costing $100 million to sequence a genome in 2001 and diving to $1,000 per genome in 2020, we are now looking at the $200 genome, enabling access to critical sequencing data that saves lives.\nSo where are we headed in 2023? In the face of persistent economic headwinds, all industries are forced to double down on the areas of greatest value. As part of the reset, there are companies that won't make it, and we'd argue that this in the long run, is healthy as capital is deployed more efficiently. There will continue to be further separation of have's and have nots, but companies like those on Alexandria's tenant roster with differentiated technologies, a clear road map to key inflection points such as generating clinical data and tenured management teams will continue to raise capital.\nAs history has shown time and time again, some of the most successful companies are those created in the depths of a financial downturn. Ultimately, the life science industry is not built on technologies looking for a problem, but instead thousands among thousands of devastating problems, i.e. diseases that this incredibly innovative industry is poised to address over decades to come. To end on a note of hope from former FDA Commissioner, Scott Gotland. Our ingenuity drives our hopeful innovation, but it's our compassion for each other that inspires us to apply these advances to the purpose of reducing human suffering.\nWith that, I'll pass it off to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Moglia\n\nCEO & Co-CIO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hallie. 2022 was quite a volatile year in the macro markets, a reminder that all businesses are subject to cycles, some more than others. The pruning we see in the tech industry today is not a surprise to anyone who's been around since the turn of the century. However, much like a broken bone, it will come back stronger after it heals. Unlike tech, developing products and services to address disease is hard and takes a lot of time, much harder and more time consuming than creating the next app to book a reservation or share recipes.\nBecause of that, there is more discipline in life science investment, a discipline Alexandria has mirrored in our real estate strategy, which is why through the dot-com burst to the financial crisis, to whatever you want to label today's conditions, our business remains sound, as you can see in our results this quarter and during those historic down cycles.\nDespite the macro headlines, we remain optimistic and excited for our business as we are in the early innings of the Golden Age of Biology. We have only had the blueprint of the human genome for 20 years. And in that time, we've developed more new modalities to attack disease than in the previous 100. It's going to be hard, and it's going to take time, but the industry is going to have options for people with Alzheimer's. It's going to perfect technology to detect pancreatic cancer in time to save lives and much, much more. So let's all remember, it's hard, it takes time and patience, and then you will understand why life science research and development continues through the proverbial thick and thin of economic cycles, making our business resilient and essential.\nWith that said, I'll briefly touch on our development pipeline progress, update you on construction trends, discuss our leasing and update you on investor demand for life science real estate.\nIn 2022, our best-in-class development teams continue to deliver high-quality, purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget in a very challenging construction environment, which I'll touch on in a moment. During the fourth quarter, we delivered just shy of 500,000 square feet, with $28 million in annual NOI commencing during the quarter. For the year, we delivered 1.77 million square feet spread over 15 development and redevelopment projects, with annual NOI of $119.2 million commencing during the year. Initial stabilized yields for recent deliveries averaged 6.8% and 6.3% on a cash basis, reflecting the healthy contractual annual increases embedded into our leases.\nAs of year-end, projects under construction and near-term projects expected to commence construction over the next 4 quarters totaled 7.6 million square feet and are 72% leased. Approximately 77% of that leasing has come from our approximately 1,000 existing tenant relationships. New projects added this quarter include 1450 Owens, which is approximately 213,000 square feet and will be 100% funded by our joint venture partner; and 10075 Barnes Canyon Road in Sorrento Mesa, which will be 50% funded by our joint venture partner. Both projects are under active leasing negotiations.\nDeliveries primarily commencing from the first quarter of '23 through the fourth quarter of '25 are expected to add $655 million in annual incremental NOI, reflecting a strong pipeline driven by consistent demand even in this volatile time.\nTransitioning to leasing, the fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our unique one-of-a-kind company, with leasing volume of 2,322 square feet leased in the quarter, the fourth highest total in company history. The 8,405,587 square feet leased for the year is the second highest annual total in company history. And as you can see in the supplemental, the -- our guidance for strong mark-to-market growth remains unchanged from Investor Day with a range of 27% to 32% on a GAAP basis and 11% to 16% on cash.\nThese results are certainly reflective of Hallie's commentary on the strength of VC funding and the stellar 2022 performance of large pharma. With $300 billion in cash on hand, we anticipate further investment in growth from this high-credit tenant sector in 2023 and the successful conversion of early innovation to commercialization reflected in the 37 FDA approvals in 2022 will incentivize continued investment in new and existing companies that have sound business models and underlying science, a cohort of companies Alexandria has a unique ability to identify.\nThe highest quality life science tenants always consider occupancy in the best assets as an imperative. Their facility and campus are not only used for research and development, but is a critical tool for them to recruit and retain the best scientific and management talent in the world, which is by far their greatest asset. Therefore, demand for Alexandria facilities and our unrivaled mega campuses remains healthy as the facilities are A+, and our operational excellence is highly sought after.\nMoving to construction cost trends. At a high level, it appears the construction industry is on the cusp of slowing down. One of the leading economic indicators of the industry is the AIA Architectural Billings Index that leads nonresidential construction activity by 9 to 12 months. Design work is at the front end of projects, so architects are the first consultants to slow down. Recent numbers show the 3% moving average heading towards no growth in billings, and commentary from the AIA was that fewer clients are expressing interest in starting new projects. For the first time since the post-pandemic restart of construction projects, which was the genesis of significant cost inflation and supply chain problems, we're starting to see some signs of materials pricing flattening out and general contractors and subcontractors looking for work.\nThat said, there are still items such as aluminum, rebar, copper and glass of 16% to 21% over this time last year, and it's still very difficult to obtain electrical switchgear, emergency generators, building controls and smart air handling units because despite an improvement in availability of chips, there are more products using chips than ever before so demand for them is still ahead of supply. Laboratory buildings are heavy consumers of these hard-to-get items so to keep a laboratory construction project on time and on budget is a difficult task. Alexandria has the intel and experience needed to make quick decisions and relationships with critical vendors to ensure we have access to the materials and labor needed to meet our schedule and budgets.\nDespite the continued construction market pressures, as mentioned, we do believe the industry is on the cusp of slowing down, and we do expect cost escalations to reflect that in 2023, reducing from 9% to 10% -- from the range of 9% to 10% experienced in 2022 to 4% to 6% in 2023. However, the $2.3 trillion infrastructure spend over the next 8 years will continue to put pressure on costs and labor so we will continue to conservatively underwrite and manage our value creation projects. As of the end of the year, 81% of our active development and redevelopment projects, aggregating 5.6 million square feet, are under GMP or other fixed contracts, which is consistent with the run rate we have maintained during these volatile times.\nAnticipating year-end volatility in the real estate investment markets, we completed our 2022 value harvesting and asset recycling efforts in the third quarter with impeccable execution as we laid out at Investor Day. Overall, we completed $2.2 billion of value harvesting, with the improved properties achieving a weighted average cap rate of 4.4%, realizing a total gain of $1.2 billion and a value creation margin of 107%. This is a tremendous achievement considering the volatile interest rate environment in 2022 with many real estate investors on the sidelines. It speaks to the desirability of our assets, which are in the best markets with high-quality tenants and managed with operational excellence.\nHigh-quality life science assets are scarce, and that is reflected in the pricing. We have started working on, and are making good progress on 2023 value harvesting and asset recycling, and we'll update you on that next quarter. But in the meantime, we'd like to report on 3 notable non-Alexandria sales that illustrate that there is still strong demand for life science real estate product. The first is the sale of 1828 El Camino Real in Burlingame in the Bay Area. Anchored by 3 noncredit life science tenants, the property is 98% leased, but is extremely low quality, with limited window line, no shipping and receiving, no backup power and venting through the windows to get adequate HVAC.\nDespite this, an investor paid $902 per square foot for this asset at a cap rate of 5.8%. The second trade was in the Route 128 submarket of Lexington Mass, where a single non-credit tenant occupied 101,310 square foot manufacturing building at 20 McGuire Road sold in October for $878 per square foot at a 6.2% cap rate. The third comp, which closed last week, is an R&D campus known as the Gauge and Center Point in the Route 128 submarket of Waltham. It traded for $983 per square foot and a 5% cap rate. It was reported that some of that -- some vacancy existed at that property and that the stabilized return is likely to be in the high 5s.\nAs the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative basis to other product types, and thus we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among other sources.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\n\nDean A. Shigenaga\n\nPresident & CFO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We'll jump right in here. Our team is very pleased to have the strongest balance sheet in the company's history as of December 31. And this really is a result of disciplined execution of liability management year-to-year over the past decade. Our key highlights include, we really have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry today. We ended the year with tremendous liquidity of $5.3 billion that provides us important flexibility in this macro environment. No debt maturities until 2025, a statement only a small handful of REITs can make today, and a weighted average remaining term of debt of 13.2 years. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 5.1x on a quarter annualized basis, 5.2x on a trailing 12-month basis. The fixed charge coverage ratio was very strong at 5.0x, and 99.4% of outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates.\nOur team had outstanding execution in 2022 on our strategic capital plan. Key highlights include $1.8 billion of 12-year and 30-year bonds, with a weighted average rate of 3.28%, the term of 22 years completed in February of 2022. Outstanding execution by our team, as Peter had highlighted, on outright dispositions, partial interest sales, aggregating $2.2 billion, with an amazing $1.2 billion in gains or consideration in excess of booked value, a 4.4% cap rate on cash NOI, all exceptional statistics and significant value creation tap for reinvestment.\nWe had disciplined issuance of common equity with proceeds aggregating $2.5 billion at an average price of $189 per share, including $105 million sold under forward equity sales agreements in December of 2022. On a blended basis for the year, we felt comfortable executing on the modest $105 million under the equity under forward equity sales agreements in December at roughly $150 per share.\nNow briefly on the bond market, the beginning of 2023 has been positive for high-quality issuers like Alexandria. Overall pricing for 10-year bonds for Alexandria has significantly improved, and as of yesterday, was in the upper 4% range or just below 5%. For 2023, we will continue to focus on execution of real estate dispositions and partial interest sales or joint ventures for a significant component of our 2023 capital plan. Two transactions are under executed LOI to bring in a partner on a portion of each asset. These transactions will provide approximately $370 million of equity-type capital in 2023, and there are other transactions that we expect to complete this year.\nTurning to operating and financial results, really, congratulations to our entire team for outstanding execution this year or in 2022 during a very challenging macro environment. We reported total revenues of $2.6 billion, up 22.5% over 2021, with FFO per share as adjusted of $8.42, up 8.5% over 2021, and outperforming our initial outlook for 2022 of $8.36 by $0.06, and ahead of consensus, both for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2022.\nNow diving into key highlights from our truly amazing operating and financial results for 2022, strong rental rate growth, leasing volume and occupancy growth drove record same-property NOI growth in 2022 of 6.6% and 9.6% on a cash basis, exceeding our 10-year average same-property NOI growth prior to 2022 of 6% and 2.9% on a cash basis. The last 4 years of rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space have been the highest in the company's history, including rental rate growth of 31% in 2022. Over the last 2 years, cash rental rate growth has been the highest in the company's history, including 22.1% for the full year of 2022.\nLeasing volume in the fourth quarter was robust relative to the quarterly average volume in recent years in the range of 1.1 to 1.3 rentable square feet per quarter, highlighting the continued demand from our client tenants. Now the last 2 years have generated the 2 highest annual periods of rentable square feet leased, including 8.4 million rentable square feet in 2022. 3 out of the last 4 quarters represented the highest quarterly periods of rentable square feet leased, including 2 million square feet in the fourth quarter.\nNow turning to occupancy, occupancy was up 80 basis points since the beginning of 2021 to 94.8% as of December 31. Now looking forward into 2023, we expect a slight decline in occupancy in the first half of the year, with recovery expected in the second half of the year. We had a similar dip in occupancy in 2022, specifically overall strong occupancy in the year, but we did have a 40-basis-point decline from the first quarter of '22 to the third quarter of '22. For 2023, we expect temporary vacancy beginning in the first quarter related to spaces that, on average, are expected to generate significant rental rate growth, greater than 60% on a cash basis. Now these spaces are forecasted for occupancy over the next 5 quarters. This includes a mix of small redevelopment space, i.e., the first time conversion to lab space, normal lease expirations and a few early tenant departures.\nImportantly, consistent with our general quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share for many years, we expect quarter-to-quarter growth in FFO per share in 2023.\nNow a few other key highlights. 90% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or large-cap publicly traded companies within our top 20 tenants, highlighting the high-quality list of client tenants that our team has curated over the years. 99.4% of collections of January rent through January 27, just highlighting the continued strength of rent collections. And we had a very strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69%, highlighting execution of operational excellence by our team.\nCash flows from operating activities after dividends for 2023 is expected to be very strong at $375 million at the midpoint of our guidance, and will continue to support growth in our annual common stock dividends per share. Our FFO payout ratio was very solid at 58% for the fourth quarter. And at this pace, cash flows from operating activities after dividends, over the next 3 years, should generate over $1 billion and that's an amazing statistic and very efficient capital for reinvestment.\nNow turning to a couple of important real estate highlights. Construction in progress, otherwise known as CIP is forecasted to peak in the first quarter, then declined slightly through 2023 as the dollar amount of deliveries are expected to exceed additions to CIP quarter-to-quarter, highlighting the significant volume of deliveries over the next couple of years. As Peter had highlighted, we have 7.6 million rentable square feet of projects that are 72% leased and projected to generate $655 million of incremental net operating income over the next 3 years. In the fourth quarter, we recognized impairments aggregating $26.2 million on real estate, primarily related to a few assets we plan to sell in 2023. Each asset is small and represents noncore assets no longer strategic for Alexandria to own. And to put this into perspective, the book value of assets held for sale was approximately $120 million as of December 31.\nThe key takeaway is that from time to time, we review our asset base and proceed with selective sales that continue to enhance the quality of the remaining asset base.\nBriefly on venture investments. FFO per share as adjusted over the last 2 years has included an average of $103 million of realized gains each year from venture investments, or approximately $26 million per quarter. Now quarterly gains from venture investments in 2023 are expected to be up slightly in comparison to this recent quarterly run rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had gross unrealized gains of $506 million on a cost basis of $1.15 billion, highlighting significant value in our venture investment portfolio.\nNow investments in our venture portfolio have been very modest, at less than $70 million in aggregate over the last 5 years, including $20.5 million that we recognized in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to guidance. We have reaffirmed guidance for 2023 that was initially provided in connection with our Annual Investor Day on November 30 with 1 minor update. We updated excess cash held from bond proceeds to $300 million, representing a $50 million increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance. Our 2023 guidance for EPS diluted is a range from $3.41 to $3.61, and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.86 to $9.06 with no change in the midpoint of $8.96. Now under the current common stock distribution agreement we have in place, otherwise known as our ATM program, we have approximately 142 remaining available. We expect to file a new program in the first quarter of '23. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our strong outlook for the full year of 2023.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you. Operator, you can open it up for questions, please."

(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz with Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaula Schwartz\n\nMD, Rx Communications Group LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'd now like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to the Alexandria's third quarter earnings call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Dean Shigenaga and Hallie Kuhn. First of all, thank you to our Alexandria family team for their continued exceptionalism in the face of a challenging macro environment, mostly self-inflicted by a really deleterious set of government actions and policies, coupled with the Fed, which has been slow to act. I think we -- I would characterize third quarter is really an exceptional quarter when you look at earnings in this challenging macro environment, delivering 9.2% and 8.3% FFO per share growth for the third quarter and then 2022 year-to-date is really exceptional especially, again, given the size and scope of the company with almost 75 million square feet in its total asset base. I'd say the health and resilience of the broad and diverse life science sector, the niche, which we pioneered remains strong, and there is a continuing strong R&D investment, Hallie will speak to this. But in general, we've seen life science R&D funding in 2021, approaching almost $500 billion. I think the number is actually about $480 billion, which is astounding and $1.8 trillion since 2017, and we expect totals in 2022 to be very strong continuation of that. I think it's also important to recognize that the strong life science sector employment trends remain positive, and the core strength of the life science industry and our key cluster markets remains resilient and continuing strong.\nAnd I think the overwriting macro observation would be the long-term health care needs of this country certainly aren't going away. Innovation in medicine is really a national imperative and just look at the mental health problem across this country as one simple example. And as I've said many times before, there are about 10,000 known diseases to human kind. And really that we've only addressed as a society about 10% with addressable therapies and very few real cures. Biotech, I think, remains resilient. Clinical data, regulatory updates and M&A can be idiosyncratic events that really are unaffected by economic trends, and Hallie will talk about that. I think demand continues very solidly for our high-quality and well-located assets, which are really powered by asset level operational excellence, second to none. Alexandria has the greatest knowledge, and I think this is a pretty unique experience and expertise by orders of magnitude with respect to life science real estate niche, which we created and informed by our over 1,000 client tenants were 87%, an important number to remember of our leasing comes from.\nWe have a level of knowledge and understanding of the true life science real estate demand that just isn't out there if you hang for lease sign and hire a broker. Alexandria continues to experience strong leasing spreads and rental rate increases. And I think we're very proud that we've got 99.9% collections this quarter, truly stellar. Our industry-leading roster of the 1,000 tenants create drives and create stable long-term duration cash flows and our high-quality and diverse industry mix is really unmatched. And I think one of the great stories of the day I'll talk about in a moment will be the balance sheet. But among industry-leading fundamental metrics for the third quarter which are notable and Dean will talk about some of the details there are a 10.6% same-store NOI growth increasing over the last few years and the significant strategic value creation harvesting of over $2 billion, which Peter will detail. And I think something we're very proud of having lived through the '08, '09, really financial crisis. And with this team steering the ship as an unrated REIT in those days, today, we have matured and really have a fabulous fortress balance sheet. We've worked very hard to put together over many years. I think it's important to note Alexandria out of 127 REITs as of June 30, has the second best debt maturity profile of all of them, and that's pretty amazing.\nDean will highlight our liquidity of over $6 billion. And I think we were both, I think, strategically informed, and I think executionally, aware when we timely executed both equity and debt transactions in both January and February of 2022 earlier this year before the Ukraine invasion. And again, almost coming to the end of my comments, the strong and flexible balance sheet in addition to, I think, fabulous liquidity, our remaining debt term is over 13 years. Our average weighted average interest rate is about 3.5%. And we've got almost 96% of our debt, which is fixed rate. And again, no debt maturities into 2025. And I think as many of you know and we're working on, we are crafting a well-thought-through set of alternative plans for 2023, which we'll unveil at Investor Day. And as you look out at the world today and you just look at what happened at the PRC meeting this past week, where the President actually had his former person who turned over the reins of power to him kind of ushered out a little bit in front of the entire party Congress there. It creates the impression that we might not only have a ground war in Europe, but we might have a friction over Taiwan in a kinetic sense. And so that's something to think about. And so we're planning hard about all eventual outcomes that could be very significant black swan events to the United States of America.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Hallie.\n\nHallie Kuhn\n\nThanks, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. This is Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. As Joel mentioned, today, I'm going to provide an update on the life science fundamentals driving the long-term growth of the industry, tenant health and how Alexandria proactively work with the vanguard of this highly dynamic industry in a challenging macro environment to continue to grow our one-of-a-kind and truly world-class company. First and foremost, while we are in a cyclical downturn, innovative medicines take on average over 10 years to develop, meaning that the life science industry is not cyclical, but is largely event and product driven. And the life science industry is still in its early innings and poised for growth. As the recent expansion of complex modalities such as cell, gene and RNA-based therapies reflect, the pursuit for new and better medicines is truly the growth industry of this century, and there still remains immense challenges to solve. Every day in the U.S., an approximate 1,670 people will pass away from cancer. Every 4 minutes today, an individual will die from a stroke. And every 37 seconds, someone will pass away from heart disease. Not to mention the 90% of known diseases that have no available treatment. While the macro market conditions are not to be taken lightly, the life science industry is on a steep long-term growth trajectory. So where do the fundamentals stand to drive and sustain this long-term growth? I'll start by walking through the multiple sources of life science funding. Notably, through the third quarter of 2022, venture capital funds have raised an all-time high of $149 billion, eclipsing 2021 historic year with $144 billion raised.\nGiven the average funds investment period is 4 to 5 years, this significant amount of dry powder will continue to translate into well-funded private biotech companies for years to come. Companies with the most innovative technologies and experienced founders and management teams continue to successfully raise capital and we continue to see healthy demand across this segment. Moving on to the equity market. While the IPO window largely remains closed, the market is responding positively to meaningful data readouts. As an example, 2 tenants in our San Francisco Bay Area region recently announced positive Phase I and Phase I/II clinical data, sending shares up 60% and 70%, respectively. And just as a reminder, within the public biotech tenant category, the majority of our ARR comes from tenants with marketed products, including many large-cap tenants with strong balance sheets such as Vertex and Moderna.\nNext, large pharma continues to outperform the broader markets with significant cash on hand to put towards internal growth and external M&A and partnerships, which is critical for biopharma as it looks to backfill their pipeline with innovative new products. Biopharma R&D spend totaled $262 billion in 2021, with the top 20 biopharma putting on average over 20% of revenues back into R&D. Notably, at the end of the third quarter, 17 out of the top 20 biopharma were Alexandria tenants. A stat that as of today has increased to 18 of the top 20 biopharma. While M&A has largely focused on bolt-on acquisitions, partnerships continue to be an important source of nondilutive funding for private and small to mid biocaps companies.\nWith respect to government funding, the NIH budget continues to increase year-over-year with broad bipartisan support. The proposed 2023 budget is $49 billion, a 9% increase over 2022. This base total does not include an additional $12.1 billion proposed for pandemic preparedness and an additional $1.3 billion for program evaluation, which would bring the total NIH budget for 2023 to $62.5 billion. With respect to notable clinical and regulatory developments, this quarter saw critical late-stage clinical readouts and an accelerated approval for indications in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and ALS, all of which are devastating diseases with limited treatment options. Tenant BioNTech also published promising early clinical data, demonstrating their novel mRNA therapies can train the body's immune system to identify and kill cancer cells. A testament to the opportunity of mRNA technology beyond COVID vaccines.\nOn the regulatory front, the FDA continues to approve new therapies at a sustained pace, including 28 new drug approvals from the FDA's drug division CDER this year. The FDA's biologic division CBER approved 2 gene therapies just this quarter, increasing the total U.S. gene therapy approvals from 2 to 4, and there are an astounding 500 cell and gene therapies in clinical development. The fundamentals remain strong, and it's the backdrop of a volatile and uncertain economic conditions. Switching to tenant health, as our 99.9% 3Q collections and historic 10-year occupancy of 96% at test, our asset base is in a great position. As you can see on Page 17 of our sup, our life science tenant roster is diverse, spanning multinational pharma; life science product, service and devices; public and private biotech and institutions and benchmarking ARE to just one of the segments does not capture the strength and depth of our asset base. Critically, maintaining the health of our over 1,000 industry-leading tenant roster is not a static process, but a highly proactive effort that incorporates our deep understanding of the life science fundamentals, intimate knowledge of our tenants work, pre-existing relationships and a dedicated and passionate team focused on best-in-class operational excellence.\nOur job is to engineer outcomes. This work comes in many shapes and sizes, whether it's creatively utilizing our over 40 million square feet operating asset base to provide critical space to a company ahead of a future delivery, or swapping a good but perhaps stagnant tenant with a fast-growing tenant and taking advantage of the nearly 30% mark-to-market rental increases across our asset base, all with the goal of continued optimization of leases to innovative high-credit tenants. I'll leave you with a quote from David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, who we have the pleasure of hosting for not 1, but indeed 2 ribbon cutting, celebrating new Eli Lilly spaces at Alexandria properties just last week. In regards to the life science industry, he said, the gains for winners are bigger than ever. Being nimble, fast and attuned to the outside world and having the right people, all these basics matter more than ever. Indeed, this is a sentiment that applies broadly beyond the life science industry and is one we hold deeply at Alexandria. With that, I'll pass it off to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Moglia\n\nCEO & Co-CIO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hallie. I'd like to start by thanking all the teams of the company for your never-ending dedication, high-quality work product and collaborative spirit that made Steve's transition to retirement seamless as we all expected it would be. Steve continues to be actively involved in certain projects, and we consider him an invaluable resource to the executive management team. Since Steve is no longer on the calls, I'll cover leasing as well as updating you on other key topics of the day, such as the development pipeline, construction costs and the harvesting of our value creation.\nAs we sit here today, Alexandria has an equity market cap and credit rating in the top 10% among all publicly traded U.S. equity REITs, a North American asset base of 74.5 million square feet, 431 properties in operation development or redevelopment and over 1,000 innovative tenants to inform our investment and operating strategies. We should note that it has taken over 28 years to reach these milestones. One cannot create such a dominant position in an industry overnight, and it takes far more than great real estate to do it. Our vast network, operational excellence and technical know-how are just a few of the many reasons we are one of a kind company in a class by ourselves. The life science industry has grown significantly in recent years, with the success of new modalities such as mRNA and cell therapy, and we have grown along with it by capturing the majority of investment opportunities that have come about from those inventions and others.\nWith the onset of market volatility, we are seeing a normalization of demand. And although in the near term, we don't anticipate seeing the same level of activity we saw in a record-breaking year of 2021. We continue to see healthy demand manifesting into solid leasing numbers. With respect to the leasing of our value creation pipeline, which is expected to add approximately $645 million in incremental annual rental revenue from 4Q '22 through the third quarter of 2025, we leased approximately 330,000 square feet in the third quarter. Although that total is approximately 1/3 of the record-breaking 2021 quarterly average, it is 18% higher than the previous 5-year average, indicating we have returned to a normal run rate of leasing. With that leasing, our 7.6 million square feet of projects under construction and pre-leased near-term projects leased -- reached 78% leased, up 4% over last quarter. During the quarter, we delivered approximately 330,000 square feet at a weighted average yield of 7.1%, which will add approximately $30 million in annualized NOI to our P&L.\nTransitioning to overall leasing. The third quarter results continue to demonstrate Alexandria's ability to outperform even in turbulent times due to our significant differentiation among all who seek to participate in life science real estate, which can be summarized with 4 unassailable attributes. Irreplaceable AAA locations adjacent or in close proximity to the country's best life science research institutions. Operational excellence in the running of our tenants' mission-critical facilities; mega campuses providing highly valued optionality, scalability and amenities; and a curated roster of over 1,000 tenants, including the most impactful and creditworthy research companies and entities in the world, providing unmatched industry insight.\nDespite current macroeconomic conditions, demand for Alexandria's best-in-class facilities continues to be at pre-2021 normal run rate. Examples of this include: in the third quarter, leasing volume was 1,662,069 rentable square feet which is above our 10-year quarterly average of 1.3 million square feet and well above our pre-2021 5-year average of 1.1 million square feet. Year-to-date leasing volume of 6.4 million square feet is above our 5-year average of 6 million square feet, and we still have the fourth quarter to add to these totals. In the third quarter, cash and GAAP increases continued to be very healthy, with 22.6% cash increase and a 27.1% GAAP increase. And our operating asset mark-to-mark continues to be healthy at approximately 30%. In our quarterly examination of construction costs, the theme that jumps out at us is that overall cost and supply chain issues are starting to ease, but contractors don't trust what may happen tomorrow. The disruption brought about by COVID in 2020 was exacerbated by the stimulus implemented to mitigate it, and as we all know, has led to inflation not seen since Jimmy Carter's presidency. This inflation caused serious losses to the construction industry as contractors were legally bound to deliver projects within lump sum or gross maximum budgets that had become grossly underfunded with every passing month as the economy opened and pent-up demand for construction materials and labor through the system violently out of equilibrium.\nThese losses have caused contractors to keep pricing high despite anticipated reductions in cost. Therefore, we need to remain cautious about projecting any easing of conditions until the construction market can be confident, another shoe is not going to drop, and that time has not come yet. It's easy to understand this mindset because evidence of an easing is only anecdotal at this point. Steel, copper, lumber and labor costs had shown signs of leveling off, but escalations from the third quarter of '21 to the third quarter of '22 totaled 12.3%, well above normal. And lumber just spiked again 2 weeks ago. That said, supply has started to catch up with demand. Inventories and materials are still low, but improving. Freight transportation is trending down. Contractor backlogs though strong through '23, are finding openings due to canceled projects and fewer new projects are starting. This opening up of capacity has slowly returned the ability for general contractors to get 3 bids from some subs. Grassroots to normalization, you could call it. But there are storm clouds on the horizon in the form of billions of dollars of work anticipated to build mega chip factories and the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act signed into law last November, which could roll back any easing of construction of supply chain conditions.\nOverall, we do expect construction costs to begin reverting to the mean due to the easing of contractor backlogs and relatively better availability of materials, but Alexandria will continue to conservatively underwrite construction cost escalations in our pro formas. We have a deep and experienced team that works in lockstep with our underwriters to ensure we are accounting for the latest trends in our current and future projects. Interest rates continue to wreak havoc on investment markets, and we feel fortunate that our scarce product type continues to be in demand during such a turbulent time. Evidence of this can be seen on Page 5 of the supplemental, where we present the results of certain asset dispositions, which have raised $2.2 billion in capital to date, including $1.26 billion in the third quarter. Included in those dispositions was the completion of the previously announced partial interest land sale at 1450 Owens in Mission Bay to a development JV partner for a land value of $324 per buildable foot.\nThe sale of a portfolio of assets spanning the submarkets of South San Francisco and Greater Stanford for a 5.2% cash cap rate. A one-off asset along the I-15 corridor for a 5.3% cap rate. 2 assets on Carroll Road in Sorrento Mesa, for a 4.6% cap rate, a partial interest sale of a campus in Sorrento Mesa, for a 4.6% cap rate and the partial interest sale of a high-quality asset in Merryfield Row in Torrey Pines for a 4.1% cap rate. The low 5 cap rates achieved in the San Francisco portfolio and the I-15 sale in San Diego are indicative of the age of the assets. Still attractive workhorse assets, they do not reflect the higher end profile of our core. The strong sub-5 cap rates for the partial interest sale of the Summers Ridge campus and the Carroll Road assets are more representative of our asset base. The Merryfield Row asset is purpose-built lab by Alexandria and like many of our other purpose-built assets is one of the best located and most attractive asset in submarket. In this case, Torrey Pines. The 4.1% cap rate was influenced by the growth in rents in Torrey Pines since the lease was signed, but the lease is almost 12 years of term remaining before the upside can be realized. So it's quality and location really drove the value.\nI'd also like to note that the scarcity value we talk about being a driver for keeping our cap rates lower relative to other product types can be seen in transactions by others. Just last month, Biogen completed a sale leaseback in Cambridge for $2,185 price per square foot value and the [Carlyle Group] sold a 77,000 square foot Blackstone Science Square building in Mid-Cambridge for a 4.1% cap rate at a price just short of $2,000 per square foot. As the Fed continues to pull levers to battle inflation, we expect we will see cap rates move up, but much less on a relative basis to other product types and thus, we remain well positioned to fund our value creation pipeline efficiently and at a relatively attractive pricing by harvesting our value creation among their sources.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Dean.\n\nDean A. Shigenaga\n\nPresident & CFO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team delivered on truly remarkable results for both the 3 and 9 months ended September 30. Total revenues were up 20.5% and 24.8% for the 3 and 9 months of 2022 in comparison to 2021. FFO per share diluted as adjusted for the 3 ending months was $2.13 and $6.28, up 9.2%, 8.3% over 2021 and importantly, beat consensus. The strong financial and operating results reflects the strength of our brand, our scale, high-quality and well-located properties and operational excellence, serving the mission-critical needs of some of the most innovative entities in the world. Congratulations to our entire team for truly outstanding executions over many quarters. This really stands out within the REIT industry, especially during this very challenging macro environment. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity management highlights truly awesome execution by our team over many years. Our team is very pleased to have earned our corporate credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. We are also very pleased to have further improved the strength of our balance sheet in the third quarter with a significant increase in liquidity.\nWe completed an amendment to our line of credit, increasing aggregate commitments to $4 billion, up $1 billion over the prior credit facility. A huge thank you to our important lending relationships for providing significant liquidity for our company. Our total liquidity as of September 30 is now very significant at $6.4 billion. We are one of the very few REITs with no debt maturities until 2025. 96% of our outstanding debt represents long-term fixed rate debt and the percentage of fixed rate debt is expected to be even higher by the end of the year. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA is on track to hit our 5.1x target by year-end. Our total outstanding debt has a weighted average rate of 3.52% and a weighted average maturity of 13.2 years. The execution of our capital plan this year was exceptional given the macro environment. We did $1.8 billion of 12- and 30-year bonds with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years, which was completed in February. Most of our common equity for 2022 was completed in the first quarter and entirely completed by June 30. And then we turn to continued execution of our strategic value harvesting through outright sales and partial interest sales of real estate. Through September 30, we've completed $2.2 billion in sales, including $1 billion in the third quarter with gains or consideration in excess of book value of $1.2 billion, which is really significant value creation.\nNow our focus on real estate dispositions for 2022 leaves us with an advantage at year-end with about $250 million of cash that will reduce our debt needs for 2023. As we look forward, we will remain disciplined and careful with our allocation of capital. Briefly on dividends. Our Board has been consistent over the past decade with growth in common stock dividends year-to-year, supported by strong growth in cash flows and our low FFO payout ratio, which is generally in the range of 55% to 60%. Cash flows from operating activities after dividends are projected at the midpoint to be about $300 million for 2022, and to put this into perspective, over an approximate 3-year period, this represents approximately $1 billion for reinvestment.\nNow ARE pioneered our favorable lease structure with contractual annual escalations approximately 3%, triple net leases that provide for the recovery of operating expenses and the recovery of major capital expenditures. Now our team also curated a tenant roster of high-quality tenants, including 49% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade and large-cap publicly traded entities. Occupancy is up 30 basis points since the beginning of the year and is expected to continue to increase by year-end, highlighting the strength of our brand and trusted partnership with our tenants. EBITDA margins, 69%, really reflects the operational excellence and operating efficiency of our business, and this also represents an industry-leading statistic. Leasing was very solid in the third quarter at 1.7 million rentable square feet with rental rate growth on lease renewals and re-leasing a space of 27.1% and 22.6% on a cash basis. TIs and leasing commissions on lease renewals and re-leasing the space for the 9 months were down about 20% in comparison to the full year of 2021. And the third quarter included 2 long-term lease extensions of roughly 10 years with a 47% increase in net effective rent. Now excluding these 2 long-term lease extensions with somewhat elevated TIs and leasing commissions in the third quarter, TIs and leasing commissions would have been relatively minor at approximately $25 per square foot. Same-property NOI growth has been very strong for the 9 months ended September 30 at 7% and 8.9% on a cash basis. And to put this into perspective, our 10-year average same-property NOI growth was 3.6% and 6.6% on a cash basis.\nThe outperformance in 2022 relative to this 10-year average was driven primarily by 110 basis point year-to-date growth in occupancy with about a 2x benefit to net operating income. And then really outsized benefit from significant early lease renewals that commenced very early in 2022, providing for a full year benefit this year. Now we continue to make excellent progress on leasing. Contractual lease expirations for 2023 represents only 6.6% of annual rental revenue down from 9% as of the second quarter. Now importantly, 2023 contractual lease expirations representing only 70% or 4.6% of our annual rental revenue remains in the category of too early to tell, meaning not already leased, not under negotiation or not targeted for redevelopment. Turning to venture investments. These investments have generated consistent gains averaging about $25.4 million, which is included in FFO as adjusted over the last 8 quarters. This is very solid and very consistent. Now it's important to highlight that on average over the last 6 years, only -- about only 30% of the realized gains included in FFO were generated from our investments in publicly traded securities, 70% were generated from investments in privately held entities.\nGross unrealized gains as of September 30 were $529 million, including $102 million and $427 million from publicly traded and privately held entities, respectively. Lastly, on guidance. We updated our guidance for 2022 and narrowed the range for EPS and FFO per share from a range of $0.06 to a range of $0.02 per share. Our '22 guidance for EPS diluted is a range of $5.70 to $5.72 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted is a range from $8.40 to $8.42 with no change in the midpoint of $8.41. As a reminder, we are about 4 weeks away from the issuance of our detailed guidance for 2023. And therefore, we are unable to comment on details for 2023.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dean. And if we could go to questions, please?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaula Schwartz\n\nMD, Rx Communications Group LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody. Thank you for joining Alexandria's second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Hallie Kuhn; Steve Richardson, Peter Moglia and Dean Shigenaga.\nIn a very challenging macroeconomic environment, for sure, we are very blessed and thankful to have a truly one-of-a-kind public company, which has a uniquely visionary mission to create and grow life science ecosystems and clusters that ignite and accelerate leading innovators to advance human health by curing disease, saving lives and vastly improving nutrition, our mission for sure.\nWe at Alexandria have worked tirelessly to earn the trust and have carefully and meticulously constructed our client tenant base within our best-in-class asset base. In 1994, we uniquely set out to be the trusted lab space real estate partner for life science companies. Today, 28 years later, we have earned the trust of over 1,000 diversified high-quality companies who have chosen our brand and rely on us to deliver on our reputation. Daily, they entrust us with their most precious assets, their talent, thousands of hard-working science, technology and business professionals reliant on our lab space and on the life science ecosystems we cultivate to attract and retain the best talent to advance their science. We provide them with a truly inspirational and healthy place to work.\nDaily, they entrust us with billions and billions of dollars of research and development platforms to be safe, secure and operational. Daily, they entrust us to be aligned with their mission to partner together at the highest level of operational excellence to improve human health. In this market, our results really stand out in the macroeconomic environment we're all experiencing, a slowing economy, the weakened consumer, higher interest rates and raising -- and raging structural inflation. Huge congratulations to our Alexandria family on a great 2Q '22 report.\nAs Dean will talk about in a while, we've updated guidance for the second quarter to $8.41, FFO per share, representing an almost 8.5% growth for this year and combined with a 3% plus dividend. We think that's an excellent combination of 11.5% in this macroeconomic environment. We've experienced very powerful continuing rental rate increases and leasing activity.\nIt's important to remember, 87% of our existing -- of our leasing comes from our existing tenants. We have uniquely crafted our own demand driver and our more than 1,000 tenants and 92% of the first half of 2022 leasing comes from this tenant base. 2.3 million square feet were signed in the second quarter, a third all-time high, with cash all-time high of 34% rental rate increase, highest ever, and a 45% GAAP rental rate, truly epic and historic.\nAnd then keep in mind, 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or big-cap companies -- public companies, and 80% of our tenants are not private or development-stage biotech companies. Peter will discuss in detail our outstanding progress in capital recycling to the tune of about $0.5 billion in the second quarter as we harvest great value, which we have created over the last decade.\nHe will also talk about strong external growth engine, which we fine-tuned in the new economic environment. Dean will discuss our fortress balance sheet and strong liquidity. More important now than ever with turbulent capital markets and fortunately, with our great team, we have no debt maturities until 2025. So no FFO dilution due to refinancings. Steve will discuss very strong internal growth and make sure to look at Page 33 of the supplement. And also Dean will mention the burn-off of free rent providing strong visibility for future growth.\nOur margin continued to be strong at 70%, and we're very proud of our tenant collections at 99.9%. So no real credit issues whatsoever. Hallie will speak to our awesome and non-replicable tenant base of over 1,000 tenants and the continuing health of the broader life science industry. The life science industry is not phenomonous with simply early-stage biotech. Alexandria and its best-in-class tenant base is very well positioned and prepared for this shifting environment. With our best-in-class assets, decades-long relationship, we, in fact, beat the so-called competitive product and much future theorized product, which will never be built.\nLast but not least, I want to make a couple of comments about Steve Richardson, our retiring Co-CEO. And I want to express on behalf of all the extended family here at Alexandria, our profound thank you for the last 22 years, the best ever. Your humble service leadership has set the bar for all of us. Queen Elizabeth recently talked about leadership at her birthday celebration in which -- and you exemplify these words precisely, finding ways of encouraging people to combine their efforts, their talents, their insights, their enthusiasm and their inspiration to work together. And if I may just finally make a quote from the famous movie Band of Brothers. Of course, it could be all genders, of course, and the Requiem for a soldier, we're all one great band of Brothers. And one day, you'll see we can live together when all the world is free, have you lived to see all you gave to me, you in fact have, you're shining dream of hope and love. We're all one great Band of Brothers.\nAnd with that, I want to turn it over to Hallie Kuhn.\n\nHallie Kuhn\n\nThank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm Hallie Kuhn, SVP of Science and Technology and Capital Markets. Today, I'm going to start by covering the bedrock of Alexandria's business. Specifically, as Joel mentioned, Alexandria's world-class and leading stable of over 1,000 tenants. As part of this review, I will cover the health of the life science industry and then pivot to a number of recent FDA approval that reflect the industry's collective drive to develop life-saving therapies. The life science industry is large, diverse and complex. Alexandria's tenant base reflects this diversity with over 1,000 tenants that span multinational pharma, public and private biotechnology companies, life science products such as enabling research tools and manufacturers of complex medicines and top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions.\nSo let's break this down segment by segment, starting with multinational pharma. Alexandria is proud to call 17 of the top 20 biopharma companies our tenants, including BMS, Eli Lilly, Sanofi, Takeda, Merck and Pfizer, just to name a few. Looking at large cap focused indices such as the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, you'll see that these companies continue to outperform broader indices, including the Dow, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Biopharma deployed over $200 billion into R&D in 2021 and the top 20 biopharma have an estimated $300 billion cash on hand to put towards M&A and partnerships as they look to bolster their pipelines with innovative new medicines.\nNext, public biotech companies. With small and mid-cap companies have gotten outsized focus over the past several months as indices such as the XBI have tumbled. This segment contains many of the most innovative and well-funded large-cap companies in the industry with names such as Alexandria tenants, Alnylam and Vertex. Indeed, the majority of our ARR across public biotechnology companies is from those with marketed or approved products. Across pre-commercial companies, we have a deeply technical and experienced science and technology team that employs a rigorous underwriting and monitoring process to select the fastest-growing and most promising companies. Our over decade-long relationship with Moderna is a great example. Just 3 years ago, Moderna was in this pre-commercial category and is now a leading global commercial stage biotech.\nOn to private biotechnology. While funding has slowed across all industries compared to 2021 due to macro market conditions, venture funds continue to raise historic levels of capital and deploy it at a sustained pace. $30 billion was deployed into private biotechnology companies in the first half of 2022 compared to a record-breaking $39 billion in the first half of 2021, and still up over 50% compared to the first half of 2019 and 2020. Indeed, companies like incoming New York and Bay Area tenants, Eikon Therapeutics, with a stellar management team and highly differentiated platform recently raised over $0.5 billion. This is not to say that investment thesis haven't shifted. With downward pressure on valuations and are refocusing towards the most innovative companies with experienced management teams, but market resets are ultimately healthy for a sector in the long run as companies are forced to double down in their core strength and talent is diverted to the most promising applications.\nNow for life science products, services and devices. This diverse set of companies enable breakthrough research from the bench to bedside. It is the companies like Illumina developing cheaper, faster and more efficient research tools to understand the genetic underpinnings of disease. If company is identifying diseases at the earliest stages when treatments can be more effective, and it's the contract manufacturers producing complex medicines for next-gen therapies.\nAs the picks and shovels, so to speak, of the industry, these companies' business models are not the same as those developing novel medicines with a quicker path to market and revenue. So while there is no simple index or measure that is a perfect proxy for the strength of our top-tier tenant base, from the beginning of the year through the second quarter, the Dow Jones U.S. Select Pharmaceutical Index, which captures many of our top 20 tenants, outperformed the Dow by 11 points, the NASDAQ by 25 points and the XBI by 29 points.\nMoreover, the life science industry is less cyclical than other industries as products are developed over a longer period with novel medicines taking an average 10 years from early development to commercialization. Developing new medicines is not easy and market dynamics aside, companies will experience challenges and even failures along the way. But with 1,000 tenants and over 87% of leasing stemming from preexisting relationships, our unique model and deeply experienced team positions us to proactively manage potential risks and bumps in the road.\nTo end, I'd like to take a step back and acknowledge the mission-critical nature of the life science industry to our society. Each approval from the FDA marks the potential for a healthier, longer life for each of us listening on the call today and our loved ones. New therapies improve and extend quality of life, prevent costly hospitalizations and ultimately, reduce long-term health care costs. We are proud and humbled that of novel therapies approved by the FDA in 2022, half are by Alexandria tenants, a stat that holds true for the past decade. Approvals from tenants this quarter include an RNA-based treatment of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, a small molecule treating obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting metastatic melanoma. To paraphrase Roger Perlmutter, former CFO of Merck and the CEO of the previously mentioned Eikon Therapeutics, novel medicines can change the world and most have yet to be discovered.\nAnd with that, I'll pass it over to Steve.\n\nStephen A. Richardson\n\nCo-CEO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Hallie. The second quarter of 2022 was an absolute blowout quarter in nearly every regard, the demand and really the intensity of the strong commitment to Alexandria's brand of highly differentiated mega campuses and operational excellence continue to provide for superior financial outperformance. I'd like to give a big shout out to the entirety of the Alexandria team as the following results are amongst the best in nearly every category. As Joel noted, Alexandria is truly a one-of-a-kind company and has definitively proven its ability to deliver excellent results throughout a wide variety of macroeconomic conditions.\nAs we've discussed and Hallie referred to as well a number of times over many years, the companies in the life science industry have a long-term horizon for their pursuit of commercial life-saving and life-changing novel medicines and therapies. Research and discovery in the laboratory, multistage clinical trials, commercial rollouts can and do take a decade or more. Alexandria's unique capabilities and team have successfully identified the most promising life science companies, and more recently attracted the world's leading (inaudible) pharmaceutical and big biotech companies to its mega campuses and AAA locations adjacent to the country's leading research institutions.\nThe second quarter exemplifies this powerful combination of trusted relationships with high-quality companies and their long-term horizons and so consider the following: 87% of the leasing activity overall was from Alexandria's existing relationship and absolutely essential and unique to Alexandria only enabling success during turbulent macroeconomic orders. And during Q2 88% of the leasing activity in the development and redevelopment pipeline was from Alexandria's existing relationships.\nConsider how powerful that statement is for successfully growing the company's high-quality on-balance opportunities, not only for a few quarters, but for many years (inaudible) stability and trusted nature of (inaudible) with Alexandria has become a bedrock and high-value consideration for our tenants.\nAs the company has grown to more than 1,000 tenants (inaudible), this presents an exceptionally powerful competitive advantage for the company's future growth and a substantial barrier for others (inaudible) in the highly sophisticated and technical nature of mission-critical life science real estate. Beyond the ground reality for Alexandria this quarter and a vigorous and highly productive effort from across the entire company, the leasing activity of approximately 2.3 million square feet is the third highest quarterly leasing volume in company history.\nRecord rate increases with renewal leasing spreads of 45% GAAP, 44% cash represent the second highest and the highest rental rate growth in the company's history, respectively.\nThe portfolio mark-to-market remains strong approximately (inaudible). And as we noted in the last 2 quarterly calls, this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of 2020, and in line with the end of 2021's 30.4%. Accounts receivable for the entire Q2 was 100%, including 100% from our publicly traded biotech tenants and that continues as we've achieved 99.9% so far during July.\nEarly renewals for this quarter were similar to Q1 at a rate of 50% of leasing. A strong validation again of the health of Alexandria's tenants in their long-term planning horizon that we noted at the start of my comments. We have exceptional health in our value creation pipeline with a total of more than 900,000 square feet of leasing, which contributes to a highly derisked nature of the pipeline as 78% of the 7.8 million square feet, which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue, is leased or negotiating. And Peter will provide additional detail and color (inaudible) as well.\nLet's move on to supply and demand. Demand is consistent with the past 3 years with no significant drop in our core services. We do see the demand in the more highly (inaudible) life science projects in the market, the actual (inaudible) capacity. Actual (inaudible) operational experience, an operator might have all (inaudible) of Alexandria. We continue to monitor supply at a very secular level, including the actual asset because of differences between purpose-built Class A facilities in Class B (inaudible) purpose-built. We also look at the other (inaudible) are any new (inaudible) one-off (inaudible) at capital sources, they will actually (inaudible) the decision to fully go forward the basis for this new (inaudible) asset class. So let's build up the specific reality in the field and (inaudible).\n(inaudible) current vacancy rates continue to be very tight with (inaudible) of [1% to 3%] in our core clusters. (inaudible) less than 1% to [2%], which is generally consistent with market conditions during the past several quarters. There is not a significant (inaudible) of leases in the market, which is a contrast general office (inaudible). And if they are of high, they're (inaudible) very quickly. As we look at the 2022, the unleased new supply is adding very incrementally 1% to 2% or (inaudible) key margin.\nIt is important to remember earlier comment on healthy demand, so we would expect the supply would be substantially leased by year-end. If we look ahead to 2023, again, we drill down on each and every project in our core markets and determine which projects are actually vertical and well underway. The unleased '23 deliveries will be at 3% to 5% availability to the total market size. And again, we expect these deliveries will be further reduced during the next 6 quarters. Beyond that 2024 -- and beyond, we do closely monitor handwaving and flyers in the market that indicate creative tech space for life science space alternatives. And as of today, we do not see a large disruptive set of Class A lab projects well underway in our core markets that are preparing to go vertical on a purely speculative basis.\nUltimately, Alexandria has significant differentiation in the market. And as I mentioned at the outset of my comments, this scrutiny of projects is only becoming more intensive and accelerating as companies need a trusted and imminently capable operator for the mission-critical operations. So we actually see the difference between Alexandria's Class A facilities as part of our fully amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings in commodity locations becoming more highly valued.\nSo in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter, and now the historic strength of the second quarter continues to definitively highlight Alexandria's position for the near term and the long term. Life science companies intrinsically have a long-term horizon and the mission-critical laboratory facilities are essential for their success. Alexandria is a combination of a tenant roster that has built a long-term horizon in high-quality investment-grade credit portends a very bright future for the company. And as this is my last earnings call with the announcement of my retirement, I want to say, it has been the honor of my life to work shoulder to shoulder with the entire Alexandria family at this one-of-a-kind company.\nI have the highest regard and deep affection for this incredible team. Our unique culture of respect for one another, high expectations for one another, any passion for the company's mission is a rare blend that has enabled us to thrive and work as a trusted partner with one of the country's most strategic industries. I also want to thank the broader investment community for your deep engagement and support for the company over these many years we worked with one another.\nAnd finally, it has been an exceptional privilege in particular to work so closely during the past 22-plus years with the team and extraordinarily insightful and eminently capable leader, Peter, who is the ultimate co-CEO, providing the heart and soul of the company and perfectly complementing my shortcomings with his formidable talent. And Joel, an inspirational leader, genuine line of the industry and a once-in-a-generation founder in American business. I have been truly blessed.\nAnd with that, I will hand it off with energy and enthusiasm to my brother, Peter.\n\nPeter M. Moglia\n\nCo-CEO & Co-CIO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. I'd like to start by thanking you for teaching me so much about teamwork, managing people, operational excellence, the necessity of taking a deep breath every now and again, expanding my vocabulary and being a sounding board and confidante throughout our partnership. I started this co-CEO relationship with alacrity. The use of that word is an example of your influence, and I was not disappointed. I will greatly miss our regular chats, but I'm glad you will be around when a good talk is needed.\nWith that said, I'm going to update the audience on the progress being made on our value creation pipeline and related construction costs and supply chain trends, then conclude with remarks on the dispositions completed this quarter. As Hallie referenced in her overview, our 1,000-plus tenant base is of the highest quality as it includes 17 of the 20 biopharma companies, the most innovative and well-funded large-cap public biotech companies in the world and a stable full of the most promising and fastest-growing private companies in the industry, which have been rigorously underwritten by a deeply technical and experienced team.\nThis highly curated tenant base provides opportunities that have been consistently fueling our external growth for over a decade. And if you connect the dots, it's no coincidence that 87% of our leasing activity comes from it. The best companies are those that grow and we have grown along with them. The past quarter, we completed over 915,000 square feet of leasing in our development and redevelopment pipeline, which aggregates to in excess of 2.3 million square feet for only half a year. At a time when people are worried about the product type we invented because others pretending to be equals are struggling with their tenant base. Our results in the wake of others struggling should tell you something.\nLife science real estate is not for everyone. Success takes years of experience in designing and building the right product in the right location, deep relationships with the highest quality life science companies and company creators, operational excellence and most important, during times like these, a very deep understanding of the industry.\nWe delivered 375,394 square feet in the second quarter, spread among 6 projects, including the full deliveries of the 8 and 10 Davis. Part of our Alexandria Center for Advanced Technologies in the Research Triangle and 5505 Morehouse Drive in Sorrento Mesa. The weighted average yield of these delivered projects was a healthy 7.8%, and they will contribute over $20.6 million in net operating income moving forward. The remainder of the pipeline that is either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters has decreased by approximately 200,000 square feet from last quarter, but is still projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue over the same number of quarters, reflecting higher revenue per square foot developed.\nAs of quarter end, 78% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, meaning we have an executed LOI with 95% of the activity year-to-date coming from existing relationships, reinforcing the quality of our tenant base, given that this category of leasing is typically driven by consolidation necessitated by growth. It also highlights the extraordinary loyalty of our tenants and the trust we have earned through many years of high-quality service.\nI'm also pleased to report that despite continued volatility in construction costs and supply chain disruptions, our pro forma yields are neutral to slightly improving relative to last quarter, and there have been no adjustments to our delivery timing. That is a good transition to our construction cost and supply chain update, the bad news first. There are still upward pressures on construction and material prices stemming from high energy costs and now labor costs are becoming a bigger issue than in the past. As the U.S. exports more natural gas to Europe, it becomes more expensive here and one direct impact has been an increase in glazing costs of 20% to 40%. In addition to a 35% increase in aluminum over the past 12 months, glazing is impacted by the cost of natural gas as it's heavily used in its production.\nAs mentioned last quarter, elevated diesel prices have a significant impact on construction costs as earthwork machinery runs on it, and our contractors have been seeing fuel surcharges in the billings from these subs. Crude oil was up 71% from February '21 through February '22. And although pricing has slightly improved since then, it's not providing any significant relief. Other costs that continue to be overly elevated over the past quarter include construction machinery, which has doubled; Gypsum, which is up over 1,500%, one of our contractors blame this on elevated housing construction, which uses about 50% of the supply. Semiconductors are up 276% due to heavy demand by the automotive industry and switch gear and other industrial electrical equipment is up 73% due partially to demand and partially to elevated cost of components that go into that equipment.\nLabor, which accounts for approximately 60% to 70% of construction cost, has been relatively stable over the past couple of years due to prearranged wage increases negotiated into labor agreements, but many of those are now up for renewal and negotiations are reported to be intense. Due to career changes for many in the industry after layoffs caused by COVID-19 work stoppages, there is a smaller pool of labor and combined with the higher cost of living, wages are expected to be much higher in the future. Supply chain issues remain despite improvements in transportation, mainly due to the war in Ukraine and a ripple effect from shortages in components.\nOne of our surveyed contractors closely track supply chain-related impacts to their jobs nationally and found that from September of 2020 through February 23 of this year, supply chain impacts averaged 5.89 per day. But from the beginning of the war on February 24 through June 8 of this year, there have been 38.12 impacts per day.\nAs a result, extraordinary lead times remain for equipment used in our product type, including generators, building controls, transformers, switch gear, electrical panels, air handlers and chillers, all of which have lead times that are double what they normally are, many exceeding a year. Much of the delay is due to our ripple effectiveness in components. A generator can be 90% complete, but can take an additional 6 months to finish because of a missing component or 2 from a vendor with a huge backlog.\nThe good news is that despite the shortage in skilled labor, productivity is improving. Contractors are starting to see cancellations or projects being put on hold, lightening their backlogs, which will eventually reduce demand and ease both pricing and supply chain problems. This can be seen in expected escalations from one of our major GCs who projects them to be 6% to 8% this year with a bias towards the longer end, but a reduction to 4% to 5% in 2023. We continue to closely manage these conditions and approximately 80% of our costs for development and redevelopment projects under construction are subject to guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns. The other 20% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those projects include larger cost contingency allowances in their performance.\nMoving to our asset sales. Interest rates are certainly influencing real estate pricing broadly, and we've been told by our investment brokers that they are seeing a 25 basis point widening in other hot product types such as industrial. So we may see it with lab office assets as well. It is certainly reasonable to expect that may happen, but we do believe that the scarcity of well-located Class A lab office assets will help mitigate that. You can certainly find industrial product almost anywhere, but for-sale Class A lab product is still very hard to find. So despite the increasing interest rate environment, there continues to be strong demand for life science assets demonstrated by our partial interest sales in Cambridge and Mission Bay and our outright sale of 12 assets in the Route 128 and 495 suburbs of Boston.\nThe partial interest sale of 300 Third Street in Cambridge closed at the end of the quarter and was sold to an existing partner relationship for a 4.3% cash cap rate at a price per square foot of $1,802, a $113 million gain over book value. As of the sale date, we have achieved an 11.6% unlevered IRR on this asset. The partial interest sale at 1450 Owens in Mission Bay was also purchased by an existing relationship and is a development asset that included reimbursement for infrastructure and predevelopment costs. Parsing those reimbursements out yields a land value of $324 per buildable square foot indicative of the high value of our land bank.\nLastly, our 12 asset suburban portfolio sale in Greater Boston sold at a strong cash cap rate of 5.1% and a sales price per square foot of $542. Although these assets served our tenant base well for a number of years, we believe we can create more value long term with the capital from the sale by reinvesting it into our development and redevelopment pipeline focused on the creation and expansion of our mega campus platform. The great progress made on the construction and leasing of our high-quality value creation pipeline paired with our ability to realize strong exit cap rates during the quarter once again demonstrates our ability to create significant, long-term, enduring value for our shareholders.\nThanks for listening. And with that, I'm going to go ahead and pass it over to Dean.\n\nDean A. Shigenaga\n\nPresident & CFO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. Our team is very pleased for their seventh year of recognition as winner of the large cap NAREIT Communication and Reporting Excellence Award, 6 time Gold winter plus 1 Silver award, which is truly awesome. So congratulations team. At the end of June, our team published our annual ESG report, highlighting key areas of our leadership in ESG and our focus on making a positive and lasting impact on the world. Key topics included in our ESG report include, among many others: first, managing and mitigating climate-related risks, including continued development of our science-based targets to reduce emissions; two, highlights of the design of what is expected to become the most sustainable lab building in Cambridge and 2 future all-electric buildings in our San Francisco Bay Area market; and then three, our 8 unique and important social responsibility pillars.\nNow turning to the quarter and the first half of the year. Our first quarter and first half results were very strong and significantly beat consensus. We also raised our strong outlook since our initial guidance for 2022 by $0.05, including $0.03 with the second quarter results here. Our projected growth in FFO per share is very strong at 8.4% over 2021. Total revenues for the first quarter and the first half of the year were strong and up 26.3% and 27.2%, respectively, over the same periods for 2021. FFO per share for the second quarter was strong at $2.10, up 8.8% over the second quarter of '21. Now huge thanks to our entire team for truly exceptional execution in 2022. We have generated one of the most consistent and strong operating and financial results quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year within the REIT industry.\nNow as you've heard from us today, over 1,000-plus tenants and other life science industry relationships is really driving strong demand for ARE's brand. ARE is the go-to brand and the trusted partner to the life science industry. We have the best team, the highest quality facilities, the best locations and tremendous scale for space optionality to address demand. Our EBITDA margin was 70% and is one of the best in the REIT industry. This strong EBITDA margin also highlights the efficient execution of operational excellence by our team.\nWe had strong occupancy at 94.6%, up 60 basis points since 12/31/ 21. And our occupancy guidance range for 2022 from 95.2% to 95.8% highlights continued strength in occupancy growth. Record leasing volume and rental rate growth for the second quarter of 45.4% and 33.9% on a cash basis and really strong rental rate growth outlook for the entire year at 32.5% and 28.5% on a cash basis, highlighting the strength again of our brand and execution. We had very high collections of July rent at 99.9% as of July 22, which was about 3 weeks into July, and consistently low AR at $7.1 million as of June 30. These are pretty amazing statistics for one of the largest REITs in the industry and not surprising given the high credit and diverse tenant roster our team has curated over the years.\nOur strong -- same-property NOI growth for the second quarter was 7.5%, 10.2% on a cash basis. This strong performance highlights the strength of our brand and trusted partnerships that continue to drive strong demand for lease renewals and releasing the space and expansion of space with ARE. Now same-property occupancy was very exceptional for an asset base with consistently high occupancy, but it was up 140 basis points in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2021.\nNow turning to our strong and flexible balance sheet. We have one of the top overall credit ratings in the REIT industry, ranking in the top 10%. We've got no debt maturities until 2025. Over 98% of our outstanding debt is subject to fixed interest rates. We had $5.5 billion of liquidity. The weighted average remaining term of outstanding debt was 13.6 years and one of the highest in the REIT industry. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA was on track to hit 5.1x by year-end, really highlighting our focus on continuous improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile.\nForecasted cash at the end of the year of about $250 million is expected to reduce our incremental debt capital needs for 2023, and this is really important in this higher interest rate environment. And then we really have achieved really strategic execution in 2022 on our capital plan with only slightly above 10% of our overall gross sources of capital remaining for the rest of 2022. Now at the midpoint of guidance for this year on dispositions, we have $740 million remaining, and we have the potential to exceed the midpoint of that guidance. Our updated capital plan reflects a significant reduction in uses of capital for the second half of the year, aggregating about $635 million across both acquisitions and construction spend as we prioritize our allocation of capital. On acquisitions, it's important to recognize that activity has been and was expected to decline as a result of having a very attractive pipeline of land for future development in each of our key submarkets combined with the considerations for the overall challenging macro environment and capital markets.\nNow briefly on our dividend policy. Our Board has been very consistent with our policy and really has focused on sharing our high-quality growth and cash flows from operating activities with shareholders, while also retaining a significant portion for reinvestment into our highly released pipeline of development and redevelopment projects. We are on track to reinvest about $2 billion of cash flows from operating activities after dividends over a 10-year period ending on December 31, 2022. Now this includes about $300 million in cash flows from operating activities after dividends at the midpoint of guidance for 2022.\nTurning to our venture investments. This program and component of our business has really been consistently generating realized gains. Realized gains for the second quarter were $28.6 million and $51.8 million for the first half of the year, and we're on track with projected realized gains for 2022 that should be consistent with the $105 million in realized gains in 2021 or almost $26 million per quarter. Now the mix of realized gains is varied period to period. However, on average, over the last 5.5 years, gains from our investments in publicly traded securities represented only 30% of our total annual realized gains. Now historical gains over the years were most often triggered by traditional liquidity events, including M&A activity and IPOs.\nFrom a balance sheet perspective, we've got strong gross unrealized gains of about $565.5 million relative to our cost basis of $1.1 billion. Now our team has delivered very strong operating and financial results in the first half of 2022 and our improved outlook for the year remains very strong with EPS diluted ranging from $2.14 to $2.20 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range of $8.38 to $8.44. FFO per share is up $0.05 from our initial guidance provided at Investor Day on December 1 of '21, including the $0.03 increase with second quarter earnings here, and we expect strong FFO per share growth of 8.4% now for 2022 over 2021. Now we refined our capital plan for the back half of the year, including the following items, we're really just focused on real estate sales for the rest of the year. We have no equity required for the remainder of the year, and we significantly reduced our forecasted uses of capital by $635 million really on the back half of this year, which is a reduction of forecasted acquisitions and construction spending.\nPlease refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you very much. And I want to apologize. Steve was on cell phone and his line cut in and cut out. We'll work with the transcript providers and make sure the blanks are filled in. With that, I'd like to go to questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaula Schwartz\n\nMD, Rx Communications Group LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And now I would like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to today's call, April 26, 2022, previewing or highlighting our first quarter. And I want to also let everybody know with me today are Dean Shigenaga, Peter Moglia and Steve Richardson. I want to make a shout-out happy birthday to someone very special listening here today. I want to welcome and thank you for joining our first quarter earnings call, and want to wish everyone God blessings and just watching the war in Ukraine gives us pause to appreciate everything we have.\nThe good to great author, Jim Collins has spoken about Alexandria. We have achieved 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to congratulate the entire Alexandria family team on a first quarter earnings performance really by all metrics exemplifying Alexandria exceptionalism at its finest. Our -- in fact, as Jim Collins said, our superior performance. I want to thank the entire family team as well for what they do each and every day for this mission-driven company, profoundly committed to driving forward our distinctive impact approach to address some of society's most pressing challenges through our long-standing bedrock social responsibility pillars.\nAs Jim said, our distinctive impact, and we have worked in these pillars, accelerating groundbreaking research, medical research, harnessing the agro food ecosystem to combat hunger, empowering underserved students to achieve long-term success, bolstering the resilience of our military, conquering the opioid epidemic, building a model for comprehensive and sustainable solutions to address homelessness, one of our newest programs, addressing the mental health crisis with a focus on helping children cope with suicide loss, another new focus, and supporting museums to preserve our history and honor our greatest heroes, also a new focused pillar.\nI want to also share that next month, May 2022, we'll celebrate our 25th anniversary of Alexandria's initial public offering since our IPO in 1997, we've maintained the highest standards of excellence and continue to drive long-term value for our stockholders, significantly outperforming major indices and companies. With the total shareholder return through the end of the year from '97 of 2,532%, which has beat the NASDAQ average for that time of 1,291%, we'd beat Warren Buffett at Berkshire during that time at 953%, the MSCI REIT index, all REIT index at 939%, the S&P 500 for that time frame, 790%, the Russell 2000, 721% and the FTSE NAREIT Office Index at 552%. As Jim Collins said, Alexandria is lasting endurance.\nI want to move to the first quarter, characterized by Alexandria's preserving its very strong core, while stimulating strong and continuing future growth. Alexandria continues to have pricing power in each of our core markets. As Dean will talk about, our very strong NOI growth in the first quarter and out of a sense of conservative -- conservatism, we raised our midpoint of our guidance $0.02 given the macro environment. But on the other hand, we have very strong conviction for the coming 3 quarters of 2022 and the delivery of strong NOI growth, both internally and especially from our stellar external value creation pipeline. Steve will highlight our second highest leasing quarter in the company's history, and Alexandria continues to experience the strengths across each and every 1 of our markets here in our overall portfolio.\nDean will highlight our very strong same-store performance and increased guidance as we continue to see positive occupancy gains and strong rental rate growth. With our extreme attention to each and every detail of our unique and special life science real estate business, we're seeing modest increases in our development yields as well as we're highly focused on tightly managing all aspects of our business with a tough macro environment and with rising recession risks.\nToday reminds me of 1979 with government policies failing the American people. Alexandria has been very focused on tenant quality, and 50% of our annual rental revenue is from investment-grade or publicly-traded large cap tenants. I think it's pretty amazing that Alexandria's tenants have made an astounding -- have made astounding progress in developing groundbreaking medicines. 48% of FDA novel therapy approvals have been granted to Alexandria tenants since 2017, almost half of all approvals.\nThe life science industry has seen the explosion of biotech over the last -- over the past decade from 2013 to 2021, with funds flows up generally 5x historical averages, advancing broadly innovative pipelines for large unmet medical needs. And every one of us knows either a family member, a friend who suffers from some form of disease still not treatable effectively with today's medicines.\nThe move in inflation starting in the first quarter of '21. Now we're 5 quarters into it, coupled with the myriad of problematic U.S. policies and macro threats have ended that boom. And over the last 5 quarters, what has emerged are the haves and have not. The have nots are a range of small and mid-cap biotech companies with programs that are preclinical as well as many are in the clinic have seen their values drop and the open markets of the last 9 years, by and large, are closed. The haves are large biotech as well as biotechs that have reached commercial stage together with big pharma and are as flush with cash as ever being estimated to be over $500 billion of available immediate cash.\nAlexandria's tenant selection has been a cornerstone of our unique business model, and has enabled us to select and grow with the best and highest quality and most innovative tenants, one of the absolute bedrocks of our -- really our business model.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some details on the quarter on the growth side.\n\nStephen A. Richardson\n\nCo-CEO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everybody. Steve Richardson here. As we bring Q1 2022 to a close, I'd like to highlight 2 critical factors driving the continued momentum and success of Alexandria. One is the demand for Alexandria's unique and highly differentiated facilities. Operational excellence services and mega campus offerings continues at a very COVID and post-COVID level, with leasing during Q1 totaling 2.5 million square feet. And within that total, 1.4 million square feet in our development and redevelopment pipeline. This activity is the second highest quarterly leasing volume in company history in each of these 2 categories following historically high leasing during 2021 and particularly Q4 2021.\nAnd two, importantly, the exceptional quality and long-term nature of Alexandria's leasing results overall and especially this quarter, is truly noteworthy in 1 to double underline. We signed a long-term lease for a ground-up Class A laboratory office flagship facility comprising 427,000 rentable square feet with Bristol-Myers Squibb a company with a market cap of $164 billion as they chose Alexandria to design, build and operate their mission-critical innovative research hub at our Campus Point mega campus. Let me just say that this type of outcome is the result of Alexandria's historic pioneering efforts in establishing the life science asset class we started working with BMS during 1998, so it's 24 years ago and began building trust and confidence at every level of the organization.\nBristol-Myers Squibb is now our top tenant and present in 5 of Alexandria's core clusters, a truly unique partnership and a distinct and compelling competitive advantage. The entirety of Alexandria's brand value and BMS's decision to select Alexandria was crystallized with this inspiring achievement.\nFirst, a deep and meaningful trusted and mutually respectful historical relationship which further cemented. Second, the unique ability to scale any single mission critical facility featuring cutting-edge design and infrastructure was realized. And third, a marquee destination at campus point with a highly curated and first-class suite of amenities to meet BMS's imperative and to retain and recruit the absolute best talent sets a new mega campus gold standard. We also signed this quarter another Class A plus laboratory office facility comprising 334,000 rentable square feet at our Seaport campus with Eli Lilly, a company with a market cap of $280 billion, for their state-of-the-art institute for genetic medicine. Eli Lilly is a similarly exceptional story.\nOur teams first worked with Lilly during 2000, and embarked upon a journey together to create world-class laboratory office facilities in 5 of our core clusters as well as the Lilly's team pursues its cutting-edge research. The foundational work during these past 22 years provided a bedrock of trust, and enabled our teams to envision the profoundly positive impact upon Lilly's ability to compete for the best and brightest scientific and entrepreneurial talent in the greater Boston cluster, with a premier high-visibility waterfront site offering expansion optionality, adjacency to transit and unparalleled amenities in an iconic design certain to be a landmark for generations.\nThese are showcase examples of Alexandria's formidable and irreplaceable position deeply embedded within the life science ecosystem. The strength of our internal growth engine is unassailable. We have now more than 1,000, tenants providing us with unmatched insight into not only their current and future space needs, but more importantly, the ability to stay ahead of the curve to deliver sophisticated operational expertise for these mission-critical facilities and curate the precise amenity mix to drive the holistic recruiting and retention of talent platform essential to these innovative company's success.\nThese leasing accomplishments are a testament to the entirety of the Alexandria team's passion, commitment and unwavering work ethic towards our shared mission. And the continued demand for our facilities is also borne out by the following stellar results, growth within the core provides critical and immediate value to the company with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 23.2% cash and 39.8% GAAP when excluding the block of short-term swing space for BMS as we begin construction on their flagship facility noted earlier.\nThe portfolio mark-to-market remains strong at approximately 30%, and as we noted on the last quarterly call, this is significantly greater than the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. Accounts receivable for Q1 was at 99.9% and again, huge kudos to our best-in-class operations team. Early renewals for this quarter were 51%, somewhat below our historic rate, but a clear sign that our tenant base continues to actively seek to lock down their valuable laboratory office facilities.\nHealthy demand is also evidenced by the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline. As mentioned earlier, the 1.4 million square feet in the pipeline is the second highest total in the company's history and further contributed to the highly derisked nature of the pipeline as 77% of this 8 million square feet, which is projected to generate $665 million of incremental revenue, is leased or negotiating. Peter will provide additional detail and color on the pipeline during his comments as well.\nMoving on to supply and demand. Demand overall, as we highlighted during Investor Day back in December and again on the Q4 '21 earnings call and now on this call, for Alexandria's mega campus continues. And our irreplaceable set of relationships and central role in the life science ecosystem positions us very well to engage and secure the very best innovative companies in the country.\nMarket supply. We continue to monitor market supply in a granular level, including the actual assets, the operators and the capital sources behind potential projects. When we look at 2022, important to note that the vacancy rates are very low in each of our 3 largest clusters and the overall new supply is either leased or adding very incrementally, say, 1% or so in our key markets.\nIn 2023, projects that are actually -- and I want to emphasize actually under construction are much more modest, say 25% of what various broker reports might indicate as those reports include planned or proposed projects. The 2023 deliveries are again either leased or contributing just 3% to 4% of availability to the total market size, which will likely be further reduced during the coming quarters.\nAnd in 2024 and beyond, in these 3 markets, there are no projects actually under construction with delivery dates in this time frame. Yes, there are a number of planned or proposed projects or dirt being moved around, but we'll have to see if the operators, and more importantly, the capital partners behind these projects actually commit significant capital to the projects on a purely speculative basis to their often time inexperienced development operators.\nAnd let me finish the supply summary with a reminder of the significant difference and highly valued difference by quality life science tenants between Alexandria's Class A plus facilities as part of our fully amenitized mega campuses and one-off buildings in commodity locations.\nSo in conclusion, the first quarter of 2022 was a very strong quarter and positions the company very well to drive immediate and long-term value through our core operating base as well as our substantially lease negotiating 8 million square foot REIT-leading development, redevelopment pipeline.\nWith that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Moglia\n\nCo-CEO & Co-CIO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline, discuss the continuation of construction costs and supply chain macro issues and comment on the 100 Binney disposition. Leveraging our unique market industry insights and the proven expertise of our best-in-class team, our value creation pipeline is tactically broadening our core clusters to meet the needs of our world-class tenant roster. Reflecting the continuing strong demand referenced in Steve's comments, and our ability to capture it due to our trusted brand, AAA locations, inspiring aesthetics, operational excellence, curated amenities, and capability to elevate the tenant experience. Our value creation pipeline of projects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters has increased to 8 million square feet that is projected to add more than $665 million in annual rental revenue, primarily commencing from the second quarter of this year through the first quarter of '25, a $55 million increase over what was discussed last quarter.\nAs of quarter end, 77% of this remarkable pipeline was either leased or under negotiation, which means we have an executed LOI. With an astounding 94% of the activity coming from existing relationships, highlighting the incredible loyalty to our stellar brand. Our tenant base is an award for talent and recognize that space at an Alexandria's campus is mission-critical in that fight. Without question, our ability to offer our tenant-based scalability and comprehensive amenity offerings through our mega campuses is a truly unique differentiator and why Alexandria is the clear choice to provide mission-critical facilities to the life science industry's most innovative and successful companies.\nDuring the first quarter, we delivered 566,655 square feet from 10 projects located in 8 different submarkets, reflecting the diversity of our pipeline made possible by strong demand across all regions. The deliveries provide strong GAAP yields at approximately 6.7%, translating to approximately $36.1 million of annual NOI.\nAlexandria's tremendous execution on our value creation pipeline represents a key component of our compelling growth engine, and an example of this is the extraordinary job our highly seasoned development teams are doing in managing cost escalations and supply chain disruptions that continue to proliferate throughout the construction industry.\nApproximately a year ago, in our first quarter call for 2021, we included commentary on construction cost trends because construction cost inflation was anticipated to be outsized due to double demand for materials and labor caused by the simultaneous restart of paused and new projects, combined with shortages in materials and labor due to closing of mills and fabrication shops, weather events, and the loss of workers who migrated to different careers.\nIt was all expected to be transitory, and even last quarter, we noted expectations for things to start normalizing in 2023. However, war, COVID in China, and transportation issues have become the latest antagonist in the story and reversed any thoughts to the near-term stabilization.\nThe war in Ukraine's biggest impact on construction costs is an astronomical increase in fuel costs. Sustainability experts will tell you that the embedded carbon of constructing a building is equal to the carbons used to operate the building for 30 years, much of it coming from fuel earned by the trucks delivering materials to the site and the machinery that produces the earthwork on the build.\nIn addition to fuel, the war has reduced the supply of critical semiconductor materials such as palladium and nickel, exacerbating the chip shortage, which affects such things as building control systems and emergency generators, the latter of which can now take up to a year to deliver. Other raw materials that come from the area are used to make certain metals like aluminum and contributing to their inflation.\nTransportation issues proliferate throughout the economy and construction is no exception. If you spend any time on a construction job site, you will marvel at the amount of coordination that needs to take place as trucks come in and out of the job, delivering materials or hauling things away.\nIn addition to the cost of fuel, inflationary pressures coming from an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 trucker shortage emanating from outdated compensation models and the allure of last-mile delivery companies reducing the pool of candidates. In addition to trucking, we're keeping our eye on labor negotiations for over 22,000 dock workers on the West Coast. The deadline to reach an agreement is July 30. And if they strike, it could place pressure on alternative ports and further delay delivery of materials.\nSpecific material problems today include steel, copper and aluminum, roofing materials, elevators, HVAC equipment, switch gear, transformers and emergency generators. Materials and equipment are both expensive and tough to get. Many of these items take twice as long to get than in normal times and continue to go up in price by double digits. Rest assured, we are tightly managing these conditions.\nAs mentioned last quarter, the biggest asset we have to leverage is our decades of experience in developing purpose-built laboratory buildings, enabling us to mitigate delays. Currently, approximately 82% of our costs, or development and redevelopment projects, aggregating to 5.4 million square feet are subject to guaranteed maximum or other contracts that enable us to mitigate the risk of inflation. We have contingencies behind those contracts to account for scope creep and unknowns. The other 18% is from projects that are currently pending guaranteed maximum contracts that are in process, and those disclosures include larger contingency allowances.\nThe voracious demand for high-quality life science assets in key cluster markets led to a highly competitive bid for our 100 Binney asset. Our excellent execution led to our third asset sold with a valuation exceeding $1 billion, and the fourth to achieve a sub-4% cap rate. We sold a 70% interest in the 432,932 square foot lab office building anchored with long-term credit tenants for a purchase price based on a total valuation of $1.20 billion through which we received proceeds exceeding $700 million.\nThe cash cap rate was a record for our capital recycling program at 3.5% and enabled us to harvest a profit of approximately $410 million. The price per square foot of $2,356 exceeds the record price we set last quarter in the sale of 50 Binney to 60 Binney by 3.7%, which is meaningful considering the uncertain interest rate environment we were and continue to be in during the quarter and the disruption caused by Russia and Beijing of the Ukraine that happened on February 24.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\n\nDean A. Shigenaga\n\nPresident & CFO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Dean Shigenaga here. Good afternoon, everyone. We reported very strong operating and financial results for the first quarter of 2022, highlighting that we are off to a great start and on track for 8% plus growth in FFO per share. Now this is impressive considering the consistency of bottom line growth year after year and following the historic year in 2021 of operating and financial performance and significant achievement of historic milestones.\nWe reported first quarter 2022 revenues of $576.9 million or $2.3 billion annualized, up 24.4% over the first quarter of '21, and NOI was up 22.7% over the first quarter of '21, highlighting very strong growth and outstanding execution by our team. Bottom line, we beat consensus this quarter and raised our outlook for FFO per share growth to 8%. More on this in a moment.\nAlexandria has tremendous scale in key innovation cluster submarkets across the country that allows us to provide optionality for innovative life science entities looking for high-quality laboratory space from a trusted partner. We have a very high quality and diverse tenant roster consisting of over 1,000 tenants that provides Alexandria a unique and strong position to address current and expansion space requirements.\nWe continue to reap the benefits from these attributes as shown in our continued strong operating and financial results. We generated a REIT industry-leading adjusted EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting highly efficient execution by our team. Occupancy was up 70 basis points to 94.7% since December 31, and our team is on track to achieve our exceptional growth in occupancy by the end of 2022 of 150 basis points in comparison to 12/31/21.\nNow the key takeaway from our leasing activity in the first quarter beyond achieving the second highest leasing volume in the company's history, is that the strong rental rate growth in the first quarter of 39.8% and 23.2% was higher than the annual rental rate growth reported for the full year of 2021 and 2020. We are also on track to hit our very strong rental rate growth projections for 2022 ranging from 30% to 35% and 18% to 23% on a cash basis.\nSame-property NOI growth continues to benefit from strong demand from our tenants as they look to renew and expand with Alexandria. We reported same-property NOI growth of 7.6% and 7.3% on a cash basis. The primary driver of this exceptional performance was strong rental rate growth on renewals and re-leasing of space in recent quarters, a larger impact this quarter from a number of leases, and same-property NOI in the first quarter also benefited from 110 basis points in growth in occupancy. And for the full year of 2022, we expect a total of 150-basis-point increase in same-property occupancy.\nDuring the first quarter, $36 million of annual net operating income commenced on average on February 14 related to the 567,000 rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that were completed and placed into service, including a couple of projects that were completed earlier than projected. We completed acquisitions in the first quarter, aggregating 7.3 million square feet of development and redevelopment opportunities. Acquisitions in the first quarter also included some operating rentable square feet that added $75 million in annual net operating income that commenced on average on January 23.\nNow looking forward, our team has uniquely positioned Alexandria with excellent visibility of growth within the REIT industry with $665 million of incremental annual rental revenue to commence from the second quarter through the first quarter of '25. Now this represents significant year-over-year growth in net operating income for 2022, 2023 and 2024, from deliveries of development and redevelopment projects for the next 12 quarters. This represents 8 million rentable square feet that is 77% leased under advanced lease negotiation or subject to an executed LOI.\nWe are pleased to have a super strong and flexible balance sheet, with credit ratings that rank in the top 10% of the REIT industry. As of March 31, we had $5.7 billion of liquidity, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA is forecasted to be 5.1x by the end of the year, representing a slight improvement from 5.2x as of the beginning of 2022. And our fixed charge coverage ratio is expected to be very solid at greater than or equal to 5.1x.\nAnd we remain disciplined with our strategy for long-term funding our business, with a focus on maximizing bottom line growth, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and reinvesting capital from real estate dispositions and partial interest sales and intend to minimize the issuance of common stock. A typical operating property at stabilization of NOI for Alexandria would generally require long-term funding with 35% to 40% debt and 60% to 65% equity capital. Now the 60% to 65% amount of equity capital is much higher than Alexandria's average common equity issuances over the past 5 years, which has ranged roughly between 40% and 45% of our capital plan. The key reason for a lower amount of common stock issuances is due to the significant amount of value we monetize through real estate sales and partial interest sales for reinvestment into our business.\nImportantly, common stock issuances for 2022 is projected to be lower than the 5-year average of 45% of our capital plan due to the continued execution of real estate sales, both 100% outright sales and partial interest sales. Now as Peter Moglia highlighted, 100 Binney Street achieved a record $1 billion valuation based upon the partial interest sale of 70% of the property. We generated almost 140% profit on this development project that we built a handful of years ago, truly spectacular value creation and opportunity to reinvest capital back into our business. We also have another advanced negotiation for a sale of approximately $350 million range, plus up to an additional $1.5 billion plus in real estate sales and partial interest sales targeted for the remainder of the year. We are very pleased with our very proactive and opportunistic bond offering consisting of $1.8 billion in 30-year and 12-year unsecured notes, with a weighted average rate of 3.28% in a term of 22 years.\nNow to put this into perspective, if we had to issue 10-year and 30-year unsecured notes today, the rate would be in the low 4% and mid-4% range, respectively. Importantly, we remain on track for continued improvement in our balance sheet and credit profile.\nNow realized gains included in FFO from venture investments were $23.1 million in the first quarter, and over the last 4 quarters were $104.4 million or $26.1 million per quarter. Unrealized losses this quarter were $264.4 million, reflecting a decline in fair value of venture investments. Importantly, unrealized gains in our venture investments were $533 million as of March 31.\nOur team continues with their journey and leadership in ESG. Our next annual ESG report will be released in a couple of months in June. Key ESG leadership highlights since year-end include Alexandria's ranked the #5 (inaudible) [REIT in Barron's]. 685 Gateway located in our South San Francisco submarket, which is on track to achieve zero energy certification, was awarded and recognized for excellence in wood building design by WoodWorks. Alexandria earned the first ever fit well life science certification at 300 Technology Square located at the Alexandria Technology Square mega campus in our Cambridge submarket. We received LEED platinum certification at 9880 Campus Point Drive, which is home to GradLabs, a dynamic proprietary platform purpose-built to accelerate the growth of promising life science companies. And our team is executing on the construction of what has been designed to be the most sustainable laboratory building located at 325 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nNow strong operating and financial results for the first quarter supports our improved outlook for 2022, with EPS diluted ranging from $1.08 to $1.18 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted from a range from $8.33 to $8.43 up 8% plus over 2021 at the midpoint of guidance. Now we increased GAAP same-property NOI growth by 40 basis points to a range of 5.9% to 7.9%. Straight-line rent is up $4 million to a range from $154 million to $164 million, and we increased the upper range of guidance by $500 million for real estate sales and partial interest sales to a range from $1.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Please refer to Page 6 of our supplemental package for detailed underlying assumptions included in our outlook for the full year of 2022.\nThank you, and I'll turn it back to Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nSo with that, operator, if we could open it up to questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Paula Schwartz of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nPaula Schwartz\n\nMD, Rx Communications Group LLC\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. This conference call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. The company's actual results might differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in the company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Joel Marcus, Executive Chairman and Founder. Please go ahead, Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Paula, and welcome, everybody, to our fourth quarter and 2021 year-end call. With me today are Peter Moglia, Steve Richardson and Dean Shigenaga. And with that, welcome. I wanted to thank you for joining, and wish everybody a happy Chinese New Year starting today, the year of the Tiger.\nWe, at Alexandria, very honored and pleased to report on a truly historical -- historic and remarkable fourth quarter and 2021 year-end results, really demonstrating operational and strategic excellence by really each and every metric. And what I think is truly unique and audacious is that Alexandria has operated during this past 2 years that 2021 -- 2020 and 2021 will be known as the COVID era, really at the highest operational tempo ever and as the sophistication and scale that few REITs could ever accomplish. And in the words of Jim Collins, Alexandria has truly achieved 3 outputs that define a great company: superior results, distinctive impact and lasting endurance. And I want to thank profoundly each and every one of the extraordinary Alexandria family team members on a sensational performance during 2021.\nNapoleon I said, strength and growth come only through continuous effort and struggle. And over the last 25 years, we came public in May '97. So we'll have our 25th anniversary in May. We took this small company public 3 years after we started it with $19 million Series A. And as of the end of the year, December 31, 2021, we had reached a phenomenal total market cap of $44 billion.\nFor the period of COVID, the 2020 and 2021, Alexandria's TSR approximated 45-plus percent, exceeding by a wide margin the office index with a total return of minus 0.5%. And since our IPO 25 years ago in May '97, we've been proud and fortunate that our total shareholder return has exceeded 2,500%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and office REIT indices at 939% and 552%, respectively. And we're always playing the long game.\nSpeaking about fourth quarter and year-end, very robust results. Our life science markets, as evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year results, truly were a blowout in many respects and most of which in -- as clearly highlighted has been leasing. And that really sets us up nicely for a very strong 2022 and beyond.\nThe continued robust demand from really 1 of the most innovative and transformative industries in the United States, the life science industry, one which is not really cyclical, but which is event driven, I think, does set us up and enables us our brand and our talented and special operational lab space affords us a very strong pricing power in each of our cluster markets and really, in many ways, sets us up to have a very strong earnings growth year here in 2022 and into '23 and '24.\nWe continue to create highly accretive value creation opportunities to meet the current demand of over our 850 innovative tenants and importantly, provide a path for future growth. And although we've reiterated 2022 guidance, and Dean will speak more about that in a moment, the $8.26 to $8.46 FFO per share, we will clearly revisit and update that in the first quarter earnings release. We have very strong momentum at our backs.\nAs most of you know and we often comment, with 10,000 known diseases to human kind, less than 10% really have addressable therapies today, and we are truly in the early days of the golden age of biotechnology and biology. Advances in innovation are happening at unprecedented speed and driving human health and quality of life in a positive direction.\nSteve Jobs commented many years ago when he predicted he thought that the biggest innovations of the 21st century would be the integration of biology and technology. We've achieved historic milestones in many respects. And hopefully, you enjoyed the press release and supplement where we tried to highlight those in both graphical and word form truly. And others will speak about this in a moment, the highest leasing volume in the company's history, 9.5 million square feet, just an awesome achievement.\nDoubled annual revenues. At our 2017 Investor Day, we gave a framework that we would hope to double annual rental revenues in 5 years, and we exceeded that about 1.5 years ahead of time. We also concluded the largest acquisition in the company's history during 2021, our entry into the Fenway submarket and over 1 million square feet was leased to our longtime tenant and very close relationship Moderna.\nAnd I would say probably most importantly, and I think Dean, Peter and Steve will probably all comment on this, our historically high and strong leasing value-creation pipeline really foreshadows outside growth coming for the -- coming into the upcoming years, including 2022. Nearly 8 million rentable square feet under construction are expected to commence over the next 6 quarters to generate over $610 million of incremental annual revenue we think really sets us up in an extraordinary fashion.\nSo with that, let me turn it over to Steve for some important commentary.\n\nStephen A. Richardson\n\nCo-CEO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you, Joel, and good afternoon, everyone. Steve Richardson here. 2021 was indeed a year of historic demand, as Joel has just outlined in the life science industry. And for leasing milestones from the Alexandria team, the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing was a record shattering figure and the 4.1 million square feet during Q4 alone doubled the previous highest quarterly leasing run rate.\nThe highlight, however, may have been the 3.8 million square feet of leasing in the value creation, development and redevelopment pipeline with the emphasis on quality. We had 2 large-scale ground-up Class 8 plus facilities featuring long-term leases to credit tenants. The 462,000 rentable square foot facility at 325 Binney leased to Moderna for their lab headquarters and the 231,000 rentable square foot facility at 751 Gateway for Genentech Roche's lab facility were ably led by our teams on the ground in Greater Boston and the San Francisco Bay Area. And important to note, both Moderna and Genentech Roche are long-time lab tenants of Alexandria, and a hardy shout out as well to our teams for a superb year during 2021.\nWe also look to the metric we don't normally analyze but consider the following: the 9.5 million square feet of total leasing provides in excess of $6 billion of contractual triple-net base rents. $6 billion of contractual base rents are a significant financial metric, but maybe more important is the market reality of this leasing success, the meaningful expansion of the formidable moat the Alexandria team has carefully and strategically created since the company's inception 28 years ago.\nAlso, consider that this 9.5 million square feet of total leasing comprised 318 lease transactions with 280 different life science tenants in our core clusters. This dynamic activity could not be a starker contrast with other entities and random groups who may be leasing 25,000 to 50,000 square feet and occasionally 100,000 square feet here or there to a handful of life science tenants oftentimes outside of our core clusters.\nAs an investor, the value proposition offered by Alexandria is very clear. We are laser focused on the life science industry. This is not a side car or a new initiative for the company. And as we continue to execute on creative and long-standing relationships to drive growth in our core markets, the dominant presence of our brand and mega campuses provides a singularly compelling story in the life science real estate market with our stellar reputation for delivery of high-quality, on-time and on-budget infrastructure and incomparable complex lab operations.\nNow let me elaborate on a few additional highlights for a milestone late in 2021. The core continues to outperform with impressive renewal and re-leasing spreads of 22.6% cash and 37.9% GAAP during 2021. And we have significant embedded upside with mark-to-market now at 31% plus. This is nearly double the mark-to-market of 17% at the end of Q4 2020. AR for 2021 was 99.9%. Huge kudos to our best-in-class operations teams for their continued close relationships with our tenants throughout COVID, these past 2 years.\nEarly renewals during 2021 were 82% compared with our historical 71% rate. And the exceptional health of Alexandria's value creation pipeline at scale, 7.4 million square feet is 1 of the largest and highest quality pipelines amongst the REITs. We've increased the lease negotiating percentage to 83%, and Peter will comment on the details later, has significantly derisked the delivering of the incremental revenues of $610 million noted on Page 34 of the supp.\nLet me turn to supply and demand for a moment. On demand, as we've highlighted throughout the recent Investor Day presentation and these fresh statistics clearly indicate Alexandria's compelling by proposition for tenant base at our unique mega campuses has enabled us to capture not only a very large market share but also the highest quality tenants in our core clusters.\nAnd as we analyze supply, again, we do not foresee any major supply disruptions during 2022 and 2023, and the delivery of large-scale supply actually materializing is highly uncertain during 2024 and beyond for other potential new entrants. They face entitlement risk, operational risk for tenants considering unproven landlords, capital market risk with the recent increased volatility related to construction starts, supply chain risk as they consider plunging into a new technical and complicated product type and the very significant underwriting risk posed by the nature of the biotechnology in your street. So we are monitoring supply closely, but consider these risks to be very strong headwinds for others.\nSo conclusion, as we start 2022 with enthusiasm for the highly disruptive therapies for huge unmet medical needs on the horizon by our more than 850 innovative tenants, we look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.\nWith that, I'll hand it off to Peter.\n\nPeter M. Moglia\n\nCo-CEO & Co-CIO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Steve. I'm going to update you all on the value creation pipeline. I'm going to discuss what we're seeing with construction costs and supply chain issues and summarize our fourth quarter asset sales, which should bring to light the great opportunity investors have right now to benefit from the discount between our stock price and NAV due to overlooking the strength of our fundamentals and the reality on the ground in favor of macro themes.\nJust look at our quarterly and annual performance, even in volatile times, we've been able to post exceptional results. Less than a handful of REITs can operate at the scale of operational excellence, and even fewer have a dominant share in each of their major markets, a high-quality tenant base and own the vast majority of a scarce asset class. Investors seem to be missing this.\nProjects that are either under construction or expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters are projected to deliver greater than $610 million in incremental rental revenues, primarily from the first quarter of this year through 2024. What Joel and others termed as the Golden Age of biotech today and during Investor Day, due to the accelerating discovery and development of effective new modalities, such as cell gene and RNA and DNA therapies, continue to accelerate demand for life science real estate throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, resulting in Alexandria shattering a number of leasing records, including the total annual and quarterly leasing volumes of our development and redevelopment pipeline.\nIn addition to this outstanding leasing, our best-in-class development teams have done a tremendous job continuing to deliver high-quality purpose-built laboratory space to our tenants on time and on budget, even in challenging environments, which I'll touch on in a moment.\nDuring the year, we delivered a little over 2 million square feet in 14 projects with at least 1 project located in each of our core markets, illustrative of the depth and breadth of demand we see in all of our markets. During the quarter, we delivered 600,000 square feet, spanning 10 of those markets, which when fully delivered, will add approximately $34 million in NOI to our bottom line.\nStabilized yields for these projects averaged 6.2% on a cash basis, which is a very healthy spread to the cap rates we are seeing in our partial interest sales, which I will also discuss later. Our current projects under construction are largely pre-committed with 75% of the space leased and 82% leased or under negotiation. Near-term projects expected to commence construction in the next 6 quarters totaled 10.2 million square feet and are already 67% leased and 83% leased or under negotiation.\nThese projects include ground-up development at Arsenal on the Charles, a development in the Seaport submarket of Boston at 15 Necco, which is fully committed; 2 ground-up projects at Torrey Pines that will aggregate properties on North Torrey Pines Road and adjacent streets into our new 1 Alexandria Square mega campus; 2 fully committed ground-up developments at Alexandria Point mega campus in the UTC; and 3 ground-up developments at our Alexandria Center for Life Science mega campus that are 89% committed in aggregate. Truly a remarkable pipeline to fuel earnings growth for years to come.\nWe continue to monitor construction costs and supply chain disruptions with a laser focus. As reported in past calls, 2021 was a very challenging environment with overall cost indexes indicating a full year inflation of 13-plus percent, driven largely by materials costs and a lack of available labor. Conversations with general contractors and examination of industry reports are consistent in concluding that things are improving. And it's expected that as factories, ports and logistics issues settled down, materials pricing will become favorable.\nExpectations are things will remain elevated in 2022, but we will see a return to normal in 2023. For example, according to IHS Global Insight, steel increased by approximately 27% in 2021, but is expected to increase by approximately 14% this year before decreasing by 13% in 2023 and again by 9% in 2024. Almost every material line item tracked by IHS is expected to start decreasing in price by 2023, with the remaining items increasing at historic inflation rates.\nThe bigger risk we face is delay caused by supply chain problems. A poll of our project managers indicated that although we have some problems with items we typically include in our core and shell development, such as generators being delayed by 6 to 8 months, we are, by and large, able to mitigate delays by making early commitments on design and equipment specifications, a luxury we have because of our years of experience in developing life science buildings, enabling us to make quick decisions based on proven standards we have developed over 2 decades, a status few others have and the result has been no material delays in the core and shell delivery of our project.\nExperience matters. However, it's a different story with FF&E, which puts most of the burden on our tenants. Things like benches and other fixtures such as glass watching equipment are tough to get right now. Fortunately, we're able to leverage our scale and relationships for our tenants and ensure the advantages we have in nurture their benefit, so they can get up and running with little and convenience.\nIn the fourth quarter, we completed the previously disclosed recapitalization of 1,500 at 409/499 Illinois in Mission Bay and completed partial interest sales at 50-60 binding in Cambridge, 455 Mission Bay Boulevard and 1,700 in Mission Bay with the assets raising nearly $800 million in proceeds at a sub-4% cap rate, realizing a profit of approximately $450 million over cash invested and the Mission Bay assets raising nearly $400 million of capital while achieving a 3.8% cap rate.\nWe also sold our 49% interest in our Menlo Gateway Tech Office Project, generating almost $400 million in proceeds and achieving a profit of a little over $100 million in just under a 5-year hold period. Overall, these sales generated $1.97 million in proceeds at an average cap rate of 4.3% and a per square foot value of $1,497. When you put that into the context of yesterday's $194.84 closing price of our stock, which implies a per square foot value of our operating assets of only $906. It supports my earlier statement about a disconnect between the stock price and the reality on the ground. High-quality life science assets with high-quality tenants are scarce, and we have hundreds of them. We are a bargain right now.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Dean.\n\nDean A. Shigenaga\n\nPresident & CFO, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThanks, Peter. Dean here. Good afternoon, everyone. 2021 was a historic and record year of financial and operating performance for Alexandria. We are very well positioned for another exceptional year. We are the go-to brand. Our team delivers a very high level of operational excellence. We benefit from our important and strategic life science industry relationships plus over 850 tenant relationships.\nWe generate strong core growth through same-property NOI growth. We have tremendous visibility into future growth with $610 million of incremental annual rental revenue from our value creation pipeline. Our team has delivered consistent execution of bottom line FFO per share growth year-to-year, and we have 1 of the strongest sheets in the REIT industry.\nWe reported total revenues of $2.1 billion, up 12.1% over 2020 and FFO per share as adjusted per diluted share of $7.76 for the full year, outperforming our initial outlook for 2021 by $0.06 per share. 2021 generated many financial metrics that reflect outperformance relative to our initial guidance for the year, which I'll cover throughout my commentary.\nCore growth in key financial statistics were exceptional. Growth in cash NOI of $280 million to $1.4 billion for the fourth quarter annualized was supported by 1 of the highest quality tenant rosters in the REIT industry with 51% of our annual rental revenue from investment-grade rated or large-cap public companies.\nWe had an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 71%, highlighting efficient execution by our team. We had 100 basis points growth in occupancy for the full year of 2021, excluding the impact of vacancy from recently acquired properties. Now importantly, 48% of the 1.8 million rentable square feet of vacancy from recently acquired properties is expected to commence occupancy and rental revenue over the next 2 quarters. That's pretty amazing execution by our team.\nNow turning to 2022. The midpoint of our occupancy guidance is 95.5%, which is 150 basis points higher than occupancy of 94% as of 12/31/21. Now demand for space from our life science industry relationships and tenant relationships drove record leasing volume with over 9.5 million rentable square feet executed, double the rentable square feet of leases executed annually in recent years. And we achieved record rental rate growth of 37.6% and 22.6% on a cash basis.\nNow rental rate growth outperformed our initial outlook for 2021 by 740 basis points and 510 basis points above the midpoint of the range of our guidance, again, pretty spectacular results. And importantly, for 2022, we expect continued strong rental rate growth on lease renewals and releasing the space at roughly 32.5% and 20% on a cash basis at the midpoint of our guidance.\nSame-property NOI growth was very strong for 2021 at 4.2% and 7.1% on a cash basis. GAAP rental rate growth was about double and cash results were up about 40%, above the midpoint of our initial outlook for 2021. Our outlook for 2022 same-property NOI growth at the midpoint of our guidance is also very strong at 6.5% and 7.5% on a cash basis, above our strong performance in 2021 and reflects 170 basis point growth in same-property occupancy for 2022.\nNow leasing activity in the fourth quarter continued to reflect a very favorable environment for Alexandria. Occasionally, though, there is a lease or 2 that skews this particular statistic in the quarter. The fourth quarter included lease extensions with 2 tenants with higher tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions. But the key takeaway is that net effective rent, which is GAAP rent less the impact of tenant improvement allowances and leasing commissions, is up 50% on average for these leases.\nNow TIs and leasing commissions for lease renewals and releasing of space, excluding these leases, was about $34 per square foot and consistent with historical amounts. Now we are in an outstanding position today with tremendous visibility for future growth in annual rental revenue of over $610 million from 7.4 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment projects that are 80% leased or under executed LOI or advanced lease negotiations. Now what truly stands out as exceptional is that 94% of the 7.4 million rentable square feet that is leased or negotiating is from existing relationships, highlighting the strength of our brand, operational excellence, our mega campus offerings and many other features.\nNow during 2021, we completed a record level of leasing with 3.9 million rentable square feet of development and redevelopment space leased, including a whopping 1.8 million rentable square feet in the fourth quarter. We delivered about 2 million square feet of development and redevelopment projects in the year with about $1.6 billion in basis that was on average completed in July of 2021.\nNow looking forward, NOI from development and redevelopment projects is expected to increase significantly in 2022 in comparison to 2021, and we expect significant year-over-year increases in NOI from development and redevelopment projects to continue into 2023.\nTurning to venture investments. The investments performed really well in 2021 and generated $216 million in realized gains, including $106 million that was included in FFO per share. Now unrealized gains as of December 31 was almost $800 million, up about $44 million from the beginning of the year. And looking forward into 2022, venture investment gains, we expect to include an FFO per share, should be relatively consistent with 2021 at roughly flat to up 10%.\nTurning to our balance sheet. Looking back, actually, it was about 10 years ago that our team completed our debut investment-grade bond offering of tender notes at 4.66%. Now 10 years later, our team is very pleased with Alexandria's corporate rating that ranks in the top 10% of the REIT industry. So congratulations, team.\nNow thinking about where rates are today, we could issue 10-year bonds at an all-in rate just under 3% today, highlighting very attractive long-term fixed rate debt for our company. In October, S&P upgraded our credit rating outlook to positive, highlighting our unique and differentiated business model, strong brand and execution, high-quality cash flows and strong credit profile among many other items. Now we met or exceeded our strong balance sheet goals with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at 5.2x and our fixed charge coverage ratio at 5.3x, and we ended 2021 with over $3.8 billion in liquidity.\nNow turning to guidance. There were no changes in the detailed disclosures for 2021 guidance. We reaffirmed our strong outlook for 2022, included EPS diluted ranging from $2.65 to $2.85 and FFO per share as adjusted diluted ranging from $8.26 to $8.46. Now as a reminder, please refer to Page 8 of our supplemental information for detailed underlying assumptions included in our guidance for 2022.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Joel.\n\nJoel S. Marcus\n\nFounder & Executive Chairman, Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, and let's open it up for questions, please."

This morning. This is a transformative moment for our industry and I am proud that AEP is standing out among our peers as one of the fastest growing high quality pure play electric utilities.\n\nOver the last year and to ensure AEP is extremely well situated for unprecedented growth and value creation. We have welcomed several new proven leaders. We have made significant changes to the organization to grow our financial strength and deliver constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes, while at the same time driving accountability and operational.\n\nExcellence I believe this is a different AEP from the past.\n\nOur winning team is executing at an accelerated pace of play to grow this incredible company and deliver results for our customers and shareholders.\n\nWe invest significantly in infrastructure across high growth regions, and our impressive 11 State service territory.\n\nOur business with state and federal goals and achieve positive legislative and regulatory outcomes and leverage our size and scale to manage costs and supply chain pressures for.\n\nFor example, AEP is one of the best positioned utilities in the industry with $8 seven Gigawatts of gas turbine capacity currently secured from major manufacturers and a high voltage equipment agreement in place with a key industry player.\n\nAs a result of our tremendous progress in the rapidly growing opportunity in front of US. We are extremely excited to announce our new increased long term operating earnings growth rate of 7% to 9% for 2026 to 2030 with an expected 9% compounded annual growth rate over the five year period.\n\nThis impressive growth rate is driven by one of the largest capital plans in the industry 72 billion.\n\nWhich is underpinned by massive system demand and supported by our balance sheet demonstrating strong credit quality.\n\nThere's a lot to be excited about at AEP and in my remarks today I will provide an overview of our strong financial results and outlook before speaking to the drivers behind our growth trajectory, our recent regulatory and legislative progress and are focused on affordability for customers.\n\nOverview of our new financial plans and key messages can be found on slides six and seven of our presentation.\n\nWe are pleased to share that AEP reported third quarter 2025 operating earnings of $1 80 per share or $963 million.\n\nThese results in combination with our strong financial performance in the first half of the year and ability to execute gives us confidence in reaffirming our 2025 full year operating earnings range of $5 75.\n\n$5 95 per share while guiding to the upper half of this range.\n\nWe are also unveiling our 2026 operating earnings guidance range of $6 15.\n\nThe $6 45 per share, which is an approximate 8% increase based off the 2025 guidance range midpoint.\n\nFew minutes Trevor will walk through third quarter performance drivers and provide additional details surrounding our outlook for 2026 and beyond.\n\nElectricity demand growth is happening and we're seeing it play out across the country and real time regions with concentrated datacenter and industrial developments, including Aep's footprint.\n\nWe're emerging as clear winners large annual capital budgets from Hyperscale totaling hundreds of billions of dollars reinforces our conviction strength and staying power of this demand growth.\n\nAt a high level Adp's revised long term earnings trajectory has been updated to reflect the strong load growth we are experiencing across the communities we serve.\n\nWe project the system peak demand of 65, Gigawatts by 2030 within our diversified service territory, especially in Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas.\n\nThis growth is fueled by data centers re shoring of manufacturing and further economic development, which we expect to create jobs in local communities and maintain affordability as our load grows by almost 76% in the next five years.\n\nThe 65 gigawatt AEP system wide projections now includes 28 gigawatts of contracted load additions on top of our existing 37 gigawatt system.\n\nThese incremental 28 Gigawatts up from our formerly reported 24 Gigawatts are backed by electric service agreements or letters of agreement protecting us and our customers from changes in plans usage.\n\nI also want to emphasize that it is critically important that costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly and the right investments are made for the long term success of our grid.\n\nFor that reason, we have secured commission approvals for datacenter tariffs in Ohio, and large low tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky, and West, Virginia with pending tariff filings in Michigan, Texas and Virginia. These.\n\nThese baselines are designed to protect other customers from bearing the cost of grid improvements required to meet the energy demands of large load customers.\n\nAs you can see on slide eight we have unmatched transmission scale and expertise and large load customers are drawn to our footprint because of AEP has advanced transmission system.\n\nThrough innovation, we pioneered the modern 765 kv transmission system in North America.\n\nThese are the highest voltage lines that form the backbone of the transmission network. We have over 60 years of expertise and design construction and operation of assets like these and many current industry standards and practices for 765 kv transmission were developed by AEP.\n\nToday AEP owns and operates in excess of 2100 miles of these ultra high voltage 765 kv transmission lines across six states, representing 90% of the 765 kv infrastructure in the U S.\n\nAs more 765 kv lines than all other utilities combined uniquely positioning us with the biggest electric transmission system in the country to attract customers, who need large volumes of consistent and reliable power Bill.\n\nBuilding on this AEP was recently awarded 765 kv projects and the aircraft Permian basin through the PJM regional transmission expansion plan, setting us up well for future growth opportunities.\n\nThese transmission awards were included in our new $72 billion capital plan spanning over the next five years by.\n\nBy combining aep's vision for a modern reliable grid and our partnership with a major energy infrastructure equipment provider.\n\nIt can accelerate the development of 765 kv projects that are essential to meeting future reliability, resiliency and energy delivery needs.\n\nTurning to slide nine we are focused on operational excellence to advanced service and reliability interest in each of the states. We operate in while achieving constructive outcomes that are good for our customers and our shareholders.\n\nAdp's operating company leadership is changing how we run our businesses and we are working diligently with legislators and policymakers for a constructive outcomes.\n\nPersonally have been actively engaged in met with regulators and leaders across all 11 states that we have the privilege of serving to better understand each of their needs and priorities.\n\nIn addition to better serving our customers all of these efforts will help us to reduce regulatory lag and improve forecasted regulated Roe to nine 5% by 2030.\n\nThis will support operating cash flows as we drive forward with 72 billion.\n\nInfrastructure investment while maintaining affordability.\n\nIn 2025, we have been involved in the passage of constructive state legislation.\n\nSome of these positive legislative outcomes include Ohio House, Bill 15, which establishes a new regulatory framework with a multi year forward looking test period with terrific provisions for AEP, Ohio rate cases, Oklahoma Senate Bill 99, eight which authorizes the deferral of plant cost placed in service between rate cases.\n\nSo.\n\nAnd Texas House, Bill five to $4 seven that allows for a single annual unified tracker mechanism to recover depreciation and carrying costs associated with capital investments at a pretax loss.\n\nThe improvement in the customer experience and stakeholder relationships also results in positive regulatory outcomes as we put power in the hands of our local leaders to build financially strong utilities in the communities. We serve our operating companies continue to advance ongoing base rate cases, including AEP, Ohio, Kentucky power.\n\nSure and swept go in Arkansas, and Texas, we look forward to working with stakeholders to achieve positive and balanced outcomes that benefit both our customers and investors.\n\nAs an update on the case that filed late last year in West Virginia.\n\nWe were pleased that the commission issued an interim order with full approval of the $2 4 billion securitization proposal.\n\nWhich will enable the redeployment of capital throughout our business while at the same time driving affordability to our West Virginia customers. However, we are not finished with the recent base case order in West Virginia.\n\nThere is more work to be done as evidenced by reconsideration finally made last month's centered around adjustments to the authorized Roe.\n\nCapital structure and rate base.\n\nWe continue to have conversations with state leaders regarding fair financial returns.\n\nThey desire to attract more capital and make west Virginia on energy hub moving.\n\nMoving onto resource adequacy electricity demand growth is putting pressure on reliability.\n\nThis new demand is driving the need for generation diversity, including significant generation additions our retirement delays.\n\nI will highlight several recent key developments that help support aep's generation resource adequacy needs.\n\nAnd reinforce grid stability for our communities.\n\nAugust parties reached a unanimous settlement on acquisition of the 870 megawatt combined cycle natural gas generation facility in Oregon, Ohio.\n\nThis follows commission approval of Green country.\n\nDSO at 795 megawatt natural gas fired facility in Oklahoma.\n\nIn September generation resource filings were submitted by for up to four one gigawatts and buy for approximately one three gigawatts and earlier this month filed an integrated resource plan in West Virginia for roughly five nine gigawatts of resource needs over the next 10 years.\n\nOutlining our strategic approach to meeting future energy and capacity requirements through a balanced approach.\n\nIn summary, additional capacity is needed to ensure the availability of continued reliable power for both current and future customer needs, while providing more efficient and timely regulatory approval processes.\n\nis well positioned to be a significant player in meeting these generation needs.\n\nBeyond these filings and in line with our history of innovation, we continue to explore generation solutions for the benefit of our customers. During this period of massive demand.\n\nWe previously announced our participation in the early site permit process for two potential small modular reactor locations.\n\nOne in Indiana, and another one in Virginia.\n\nAs we evaluate these exciting opportunities are moving forward with SM art considerations will require a strong capital investment protections safeguards for our balance sheet and credit metrics strength and clear regulatory and governmental support.\n\nAnd finally as seen on slide 10, I would like to reiterate that our team is keenly focused on customer affordability as we advance our 72 billion capital plan over the next five years.\n\nWe are mitigating residential rate impacts through affordability levers, including incremental load growth rate design continuous focus on O&M efficiency and financing mechanisms like securitization.\n\nEarlier this month ADP also closed on a loan guarantee from the U S Department of energy related to upgrading 5000 miles of transmission lines.\n\nThe loan backs projects that enhance reliability, while also supporting economic growth in our states and reducing bill impacts for customers.\n\nAs we ramp up our investments in this electric infrastructure Super cycle more of the incremental costs are assigned to commercial and industrial customers, who are driving the increased investment.\n\nWe forecast residential customer rates to increase on the system average by approximately three 5% annually over the five year period. This is relatively mild and below the five year historical average inflation rate of over 4%.\n\nWrapping up we had an extremely busy and productive year so far.\n\nWith the entire team working at an unmatched pace to deliver results for all stakeholders we.\n\nWe are investing substantially to meet an extraordinary moment in our industry engaging with our regulators and state leaders to deliver on their key policy objectives, and taking concrete steps to keep customer bills affordable.\n\nI have great confidence in our strategy and team and I am excited about the opportunities ahead, as we drive growth and create value for our investors.\n\nWith that I'll now turn the call over to Trevor who will walk us through the third quarter performance drivers and provide details surrounding our incredible financial growth outlook.\n\nThank you Bill and good morning, everyone.\n\nIm excited to share several key updates with you today I will begin with a review of our third quarter and year to date financial results followed by an in depth look at our newly established long term operating earnings growth rate of 7% to 9% Bill.\n\nBuilding on Bill's comments I will also highlight the exceptional load growth we are seeing.\n\nSupported by the updated 72 billion five year capital plan, and finally, I will wrap up with remarks on our financing strategy.\n\nThat's not walk through our financial results starting on slide 12.\n\nOperating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1 per share compared to $1 85 per share in the same period last year.\n\nThis change primarily reflects the impact of the prior year sale of the onsite partners distributed resources business within generation and marketing.\n\nTurning to slide 13 year.\n\nYear to date operating earnings totaled $4 78 per share up from $4 38 per share in 2024.\n\nYou will see that this represents an increase of 40 per share or approximately 9% year over year.\n\nThis strong year to date performance was mainly driven by favorable rate changes across multiple jurisdictions.\n\nStrong transmission investment execution and continued benefit from load growth.\n\nNotably, we saw significant commercial and industrial load growth of nearly 8% on a rolling 12 month basis as of September 32025 .\n\nCompared to the same period last year.\n\nRecall, a majority of our large load customers or undertake or pay contracts, which I'll address in more detail shortly.\n\nAdditional information on our sales performance can be found in the appendix.\n\nThese positive drivers were partially offset by increased spending on system improvements dupree.\n\nDepreciation tied to higher capital investments and interest expense.\n\nSimilar to the quarterly results our year to date performance and the generation and marketing segment reflects the prior year sale of the distributed resources business.\n\nWhile this transition led to a lower contribution from this segment. It was meaningfully offset by favorable energy margins, which helped support overall results.\n\nOur strong year to date results provide us with the confidence to guide to the upper half of our 2025 operating earnings range of $5 and 75.\n\nThe $5 95.\n\nPlease turn to the next slide.\n\nWe have established our 2026 operating earnings guidance range at $6 15 to $6 45 per share with a midpoint of $6 30.\n\nThis reflects nearly an 8% increase over our 2025 guidance midpoint and is fully aligned with our newly introduced long term operating earnings growth rate.\n\nAs Bill mentioned earlier, we are excited to announce our increased long term operating earnings growth rate of 7% to 9% annually from 2026 through 2030 with an expected CAGR of 9% over the five year period.\n\nWe anticipate growth to be in the lower half of the range for the first two years and at or above the high end of the range.\n\nIn 2028, 2029 and 2030.\n\nThis outlook is supported by our exceptional load growth fundamentals highlighted by 28 gigawatts of incremental and contracted load backed by electric service agreements or letters of agreement.\n\nThis unprecedented demand serves as the foundation of our expanded 72 billion capital investment plan.\n\nus to deploy the critical infrastructure needed today, while actively shaping the energy infrastructure landscape up tomorrow building, a more reliable resilient grid of the future.\n\nTurning to slide 15.\n\nWe are illustrating aep's strong load forecast for the period from 2026 through 2030.\n\nThere are three defining characteristics I'd like to emphasize.\n\nLoad growth forecast is big conservative and drives our capital strategy.\n\nFirst it is big.\n\nIn this quarter alone approximately two gigawatts of datacenter load came online roughly equivalent to two large scale nuclear power plants.\n\nFor the 28 Gigawatts of forecasted additions this is equivalent to almost doubling our current system.\n\nCustomers behind this growth are substantial with approximately 80% coming from data processors, including large hyper scaler, such as Google AWS and matter.\n\nThese are well capitalized global firms with sustained demand profiles.\n\nThe remaining 20% is driven by new industrial customers. These include major projects, such as Nucor steel mill in West, Virginia, and Cheniere LNG facilities in Texas.\n\nTogether these diverse customer groups form a strong foundation of long term partnerships and infrastructure development driving substantial energy demand and economic growth to the communities that we serve.\n\nSecond it's conservative.\n\nOur forecast is not a theoretical model, it's built on signed contracts.\n\nFrom roughly 190 gigawatts of customer interest, we have distilled us down to 28 gigawatts of executed financial commitments.\n\nWe have evolved our contracting strategy to sign full take or pay agreements earlier in the development cycle, helping us to filter out speculative load.\n\nCommission approved tariff reforms have strengthened these contracts, especially in our vertically integrated businesses, where generation investments must be tightly aligned with the real demand to protect customer rates.\n\nFinally, this load forecast is the foundation of our capital plan.\n\nServe this growth AEP must deliver more than 100 million megawatt hours of incremental power annually by 2030.\n\nMeeting this demand will require a scale of capital investment that sets a new benchmark for AEP.\n\nI will walk through the details of our large capital plan on slide 16.\n\nOur 72 billion five year capital plan represents a more than 30% increase over our previous plan.\n\nOver two thirds of this investment is directed towards transmission and generation supporting the extraordinary load growth I mentioned earlier.\n\nIn addition, nearly a quarter of the plan is focused on strengthening our distribution network, including system enhancement programs and other grid modernization efforts that are critical to improving reliability and performance for our customers.\n\nThis capital plan drives a five year rate base CAGR of 10% with nearly 90% of the investment recovered through reduced lag mechanisms, including formula rates forward looking test years and capital riders and trackers.\n\nImportantly, we are applying a ruthless capital allocation lens to every dollar we deploy.\n\nEnsuring that each investment is aligned with customer needs regulatory efforts and long term shareholder value.\n\nThis disciplined strategy allows us to prioritize high impact projects and maintain financial strength as we execute at scale.\n\nLet's turn to slide 17 to discuss our high growth transmission business.\n\nAs Bill mentioned earlier.\n\nLarge load customers are drawn to our footprint because of Aep's world class transmission system.\n\nParticularly our ultra high voltage 765 kv backbone.\n\nOur unmatched expertise in the design and construction of ultra high voltage transmission.\n\nContinues to secure major projects positioning AEP as one of the industry leaders best equipped to meet and capitalize on the accelerating AI driven demand.\n\nTransmission is a core engine of value creation for AEP.\n\nIn fact more than 50% of our projected 2026 operating earnings will come from this high growth business.\n\nLooking ahead, our transmission rate base is expected to exceed $50 billion by 2030.\n\nsubstantial shareholder value through highly constructive regulatory framework.\n\nNext I will cover our five year financing plan on slide 18.\n\nThis plan is built on strong cash flow from operations.\n\nDriven by disciplined investment execution phase.\n\nFavorable legislative and regulatory developments and a continued focus on cost management.\n\nIt supports robust liquidity with only about 25% of our outstanding debt maturing through 2030.\n\nIn addition, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through consistent dividend growth.\n\nA key component of the plan includes a modest amount of growth equity totaling $5 9 billion.\n\nIn fact, we have limited near term equity needs with over 80% of the growth equity projected to be issued during the back half of the five year plan. Thus.\n\nThis financing plan is designed with flexibility in mind.\n\nEnabling us to evaluate and deploy the most efficient financing tools to support our capital expansion.\n\nOver the plan horizon, we are targeting an to debt ratio of 14% to 15% for both S&P and Moody's weaker.\n\nWe currently exceed our to debt target with S&P at 15, 7% this quarter and comparatively we are above our 13% downgrade threshold at Moody's we expect to be near our 14% target with Moody's by the end of 2026 and in the targeted range for the remainder of the plan additional details.\n\nOn our third quarter to debt metrics can be found in the appendix.\n\nBefore we open the line for your questions, let's turn to slide 19, and recap the key takeaways from today's discussion each one reinforcing why we're so energized about aep's future as a high growth high quality pure play electric utility.\n\nFirst we have delivered exceptional financial performance year to date, which gives us the confidence to guide to the upper half of our 2025 operating earnings range of $5 75.\n\nTo $5 95.\n\nThis reflects not only disciplined execution as we leverage our size and scale, but also the strength of our streamlined organization, which is driving accountability operational excellence and results second we formalized our large $72 billion capital plan driving a 10 .\n\nfive year rate base CAGR of nearly 90% of investment recovered through reduced lag mechanisms where.\n\nWe're applying ruthless capital discipline to ensure every dollar deployed delivers on customer priorities regulatory alignment and long term shareholder value.\n\nThird today, we introduced and increase long term growth rate of 7% to 9% with growth expected to be at or above the high end of the range in the final three years of the plan.\n\nThis marks a strategic step forward.\n\nOur outlook grounded in real accelerating demand.\n\nFourth our earnings growth is underpinned by strong load growth.\n\nDriven by our ultra high voltage transmission backbone that continues to attract new customers into our footprint.\n\nThis growth outlook is not only substantial but it's also conservative and it forms the foundation of our 72 billion capital plan.\n\nFifth affordability and balance sheet strength remains central to our strategy as we execute our multibillion dollar capital plan with discipline.\n\nWe are forecasting average system residential customer rates to increase at approximately three 5%.\n\nAnnually through 2030, well below the five year average rate of inflation of 4%.\n\nThis reflects our commitment to ensuring cost stability for our customers as we invest in the system.\n\nAt the same time, our financing strategy is grounded in strong cash flow from operations with over 80% of growth equity projected to be issued during the back half of the plan.\n\nThis approach is intentionally designed to support disciplined capital expansion through efficient financing, while maintaining financial strength and flexibility.\n\nAnd finally, our momentum is further supported by constructive legislative and regulatory progress as we continue to empower local leadership and built financially strong utilities in the communities we serve.\n\nThese efforts are expected to reduce regulatory lag.\n\nTrimmed the gap between earned and authorized ROE.\n\nAnd support strong operating cash flows.\n\nI am truly excited to be part of this journey.\n\nI firmly believe AEP is one of the most compelling companies in our industry uniquely positioned to lead grow and deliver in today's transformative environment.\n\nWith a clear strategy the strength of our size and scale.\n\nDisciplined execution and unmatched infrastructure capabilities, we are well equipped to seize the opportunities ahead with confidence and create significant value for our stakeholders.\n\nWe appreciate everyone's time today and your interest in AEP we.\n\nWe look forward to seeing many of you at the EI conference in the next couple of weeks and with that I will now ask the operator to open the lines. So we can take your questions.\n\nYes.\n\nThank you we will now begin the question and answer session if.\n\nIf you'd like to ask a question. Please press Star then the number one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and entered the queue.\n\nIf you would like to withdraw your question at any time, Please press star one again.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Ross from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nMorning Bill.\n\nMorning Trevor.\n\nThanks for the great update today.\n\nJust a couple of questions if I'm looking at slide 14, it looks like a pretty big earnings step up as I look at the CAGR going out on the bars. In 2028 can you just kind of maybe try to walk through the drivers of that and as part of that maybe that schedule and timing of the Ohio rate case might linger under the new construct or how should I be thinking about.\n\nYes, Thanks, Ross and I appreciate you joining today.\n\nWe do see a.\n\nA lot of the earnings being driven by the capital plan and certainly in the middle part of the plan in 2007 and 28 is when the most capex gets deployed and so we're seeing about.\n\nThe capital plan, peaking at about $17 billion in the middle part of the plan and that's really what's driving a lot of the increase in the earnings call that step up in that period. The other thing is as you say, we've also gotten some positive legislative and regulatory outcomes.\n\nAnd that will manifest itself in that part of the planning cycle and that includes the forward looking test year in Ohio, certainly HB $52 47 in Texas is a huge benefit to attracting capital to the state and having us deploy capital which also is.\n\nIs helping to.\n\nNarrow the gap around Roe.\n\nAnd then also SB 909, eight in Oklahoma.\n\nIs another piece of legislation that also is helping narrow the gap and so those are where you see that little bit of a step change and I know, it's been a little unorthodox with regards to how we have put out.\n\nThe growth rate, saying that we would be at or below the midpoint of the growth rate in the first couple of years of the plan and in fact, you can see us going from the midpoint of the $5 85 to $6 30.\n\n25% to 26.\n\nBut then where we're pretty confident of being at or above the high end of the range in the back three years of the plan and that's why we also put that 9% CAGR out there for the overall earnings.\n\nYeah, that's very fair to us thank you for that detail.\n\nI guess as I look at slide 18, I'm talking about is $5 9 billion of equity into plan. How are you thinking about the composition of the business do you think there's more potential for minority stake sell downs or how should I think about addressing that equity need overtime.\n\nYeah, I'll take the equity and then I'll, let bill address where he thinks we are with regards to .\n\nA potential any other sell downs.\n\nBut what we've tried to do is recall that we've said.\n\nThat we anticipate between 30% and 40% .\n\nEquity with regards to increasing the capital plan and so when we laid out the $18 billion increase in the capital plan.\n\nThis is roughly call it 33% of growth equity. The good news is because we've been very proactive under the $54 billion of existing capital plan with both the asset sale in the Transco as this year as well as issuing the equity for the full five year plan.\n\nWe really have a situation where a lot of that growth equity is now in the back end of the plan and so what we will do is we're showing an ATM in 2026 of call. It roughly $1 billion and then we don't need equity.\n\nFor a period of time in the middle part of the plan and then as we get to the back end of the plan, we will either do an ATM or potentially a block equity deal and the back end of the plan, but again I think this is very indicative of US, saying, we will issue equity to fund growth and great growth at that.\n\nAcross the system and then Bill do you want to take the question on on any further sell downs, yes, thanks, Trevor and good morning.\n\nAs Trevor noted, we're very encouraged by very favorable legislative and regulatory developments across our states in our continued focus on disciplined cost management is.\n\nThis is going to continue to be a major effort of ours to support and so at this time were not planning any asset sales to fund the plan.\n\nGoing forward, but obviously, we'll continue to assess these as they come up.\n\nFantastic guys. Thank you I'll see you soon down in Florida.\n\nThanks Robert.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Shar from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nYeah.\n\nShar Your line is open for questions.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nYes, hi, thanks.\n\nAnd congrats.\n\nI guess, maybe Trevor on the.\n\nThe 28% to 30, the par where youre kind of 9% or better or is there like a .\n\nIs there.\n\nSome type of shaping to that over those periods like does it accelerate higher.\n\nOr.\n\nOr is it just pretty consistently.\n\n9% or better those years.\n\nYes, Steve I think.\n\nWhere we are is it kind of gets back a little bit too.\n\nRoss's question as we see the earnings step up in the mid part of the plan.\n\nAnd I would say, what what we feeling pretty confident about is that giving the guidance, where we said of 28 29 and 30, we will be at or above the high end of the plan I think you can assume that that is pretty flat.\n\nAs of this point now I will say the good news is we continue to see a lot of.\n\nOf growth and we're excited to rollout this new plan.\n\n129, and 30 are out quite a ways with regards to the plan and so it still gives us potential to see.\n\nIncremental deployments, we continue to sign and , but right now the way we've got it modeled and again this gets back to my mantra of make sure that we're very confident in the numbers, we put out and deliver on those numbers.\n\nSo this gets back to the under promise and over deliver.\n\nAnd from my perspective by saying that we are at at or above the 9%.\n\nYou can assume that that's pretty flat in those three years at or above that 9%.\n\nOne just clarification whats what could you just clarify what the differences between an and an Esa.\n\nYes, so really.\n\nAnd for the letter of agreement is generally a first step before you get to an Esa.\n\nBoth have financial obligations, but an Esa.\n\nOn energy service agreement it tends to be more binding now that being said I will say down in Texas in ERCOT, we only sign loayza not Esa and so from that perspective, we want to make sure that when we talk about that 28 gigs, we're very confident in that because theyre, all under or .\n\n.\n\nAnd in Texas, where there is no Esa we feel very good about those alloys that are getting signed down there I will say as we distill down from that 190 gigs and when we continue to scrub that that ultimately generates the 28 gigs of incremental load growth.\n\nI will say there are some.\n\nthat are executed that are not included in that 28, as we continue to negotiate and work through to ultimately get to an Esa. So again it gets back to my point in the prepared remarks, where I said.\n\nThat it's real and it's conservative on the 28.\n\nOkay and then last question maybe for Bill just you mentioned something about a partnership with our infrastructure provider.\n\nCould you maybe give more color there and just the turbine orders like that I think those are somewhat new kind of when do those come in and.\n\nAny update on Bloom, so just all your different.\n\nPartnerships and supply chain. Thank you sure. Thanks, Steve.\n\nSo we're in the process of putting in place.\n\nLong term supply framework agreements for the major equipment components that will need to deliver on the plan and.\n\nThe good news for US is that we have in place.\n\nSignificant agreements for four turbines and four.\n\nThe high voltage transmission transformer equipment that we need and so.\n\nI'm very comfortable with where we sit the team's done a nice job of positioning us well to deliver on this.\n\nAs I noted in my comments.\n\nAdded.\n\nLot of strengths into this management team, particularly from Berkshire, who are very skilled at delivering multibillion dollar capital programs and bringing them in to deliver and so again.\n\nQuite comfortable with where we sit both on.\n\nThe management talent and on.\n\nThe major equipment that we have on bloom.\n\nStill working.\n\nWorking with potential customers to deploy the additional megawatts that we have with them.\n\nAnd look forward to hopefully.\n\nHaving more to report on that perhaps by EI.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nYeah.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from Jpmorgan. Your line is open.\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nGood morning.\n\nJust wanted to walk through the planned roll forward, a little bit more as it relates to dividends I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more specifically on what you see the GPS CAGR.\n\nOver that time period being particularly in the back part of the plan.\n\nYeah. So Jeremy I appreciate that question, what we've really done here is we just got out of our board meeting and our board did recently raised the dividend by 2% going into this next year.\n\nAnd we're also signaling that we are going to be at a 50% to 60% payout ratio and the reason for this is because we have this robust capital plan and deploying capital is critical right now during this period of growth and so what we've done is in the plan. We have assumed that the dividends are really increasing by the.\n\nshares outstanding and then we would make recommendations to the board as you know this is a board discretionary item and the board would ultimately make the decision as to where we're going with the dividends that said certainly the discussion that we had with the board was they are supportive of us growing the dividend.\n\n.\n\nOver a period of time and I will say this marks a 115 consecutive years of AEP paying a dividend and we have had a continued dividend growth.\n\nThe last.\n\nI would call a decade or so and so this is something that we really.\n\nLook at as part of the overall total shareholder return and getting value back to our shareholders as both the dividends as well as the growing.\n\nGrowing earnings over that period of time, So again I would say in conclusion. The board is very committed to our dividend and getting.\n\nA dividend that it has a yield as well as a payout ratio that is well within the industry norms, but we.\n\nYou did moderate it a little bit and made that recommendation to the board given the the 30 plus percent increase in the capital plan.\n\nGot it that's very helpful. Thank you and then just wanted to come back to the EPS EPS CAGR, if I could one more time to put maybe a finer point.\n\nWhen you're referring to the high end of 28 to 30.\n\nThat year over year or CAGR. So basically this is a CAGR of 26 or is this year over year from 27 into 'twenty eight.\n\nIt's a year over year.\n\nGot it very helpful. I'll leave it there thank you.\n\nThanks, Jeremy appreciate it.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of.\n\nDavid Arcaro from Morgan Stanley Your line is open.\n\nOh, hey, thanks, so much good morning.\n\nGood morning, David I was wondering good morning, I was wondering if you could.\n\nCan you just give us.\n\nMore of a sense of how the conversations are going with Datacenters and constraints on the system that youre seeing.\n\nSo I guess I'm curious you know are you able to keep up with the transmission capacity needs for data centers to handle all of this load growth.\n\nWait time to connect that Youre, having to discuss with these customers and is it fair to characterize a lot of this transmission capex that youre, adding to the plan here.\n\nIs that opening up additional capacity to bring in these new customers wondering how that all kind of balances right now.\n\nYes. Thanks for the question really really excited about where we sit in this regard.\n\nAs we've noted in here the increased incremental load growth.\n\nProjected through 2030 is the 28 gigawatts up from the 24 that we talked about before.\n\nAnd that.\n\nDemand growth is roughly 80% tied to data centers and the commercial class in about 20% tied to the industrials.\n\n.\n\nBreaking it up a little more about 75% is related to transmission and distribution.\n\nWhile 25% is tied to the vertically integrated utilities and so as I look out across the .\n\nRoughly half ends up in ERCOT, 40% in PJM and about 10% then in the SPP.\n\nSo as we look at where we sit.\n\nConnect these customers.\n\nClearly, we're working with them to site, where we have available transmission today to help them with their ramps up their ramp ups.\n\nIn the manner in which they want to.\n\nRun their side of the business and then in other cases, we're working with them to put in place behind the meter solutions. Obviously blooms are part of that in certain cases.\n\nBut we also have other strategies that we're deploying to support the data centers and so.\n\nFor me.\n\nThis company is all about serving our customers and trying to figure out a way to get them connected as quickly as they can as we build out the transmission system of course, that's going to open up additional opportunities to perhaps bring on more of that 190 gigawatts.\n\nBut in the meantime.\n\nAs Trevor noted.\n\nWe're very.\n\nFocused on reporting what we have signed we're going to under promise and over deliver in this area, but I couldnt be more excited with where we sit across our service territory. We are in.\n\nI would say the cat bird seat and with regards to connecting data center load. The 765 kv transmission network that we have provides us with an extreme competitive advantage, where these folks are trying to site.\n\nSo I just see.\n\nAn amazing future ahead of us in this area.\n\nOkay excellent yeah that's helpful.\n\nAnd then I was wondering if you could characterize your at your strategy or your thoughts on the generation.\n\nThat as well for vertically integrated utilities, it's just how do you manage the balance between how you're thinking about renewables, serving this new load versus gas.\n\nYeah. That's basically the question just as you see you've talked about peak load for sure, but youre seeing energy demands across the entire system and then of course peak as well, but yeah, what's the balance there between renewables versus gas on the generation side.\n\nWell, we're focused on doing what our states want as their energy policy and so as we go across our major.\n\nStates in and work with the customers in those locales.\n\nWe will move forward with the types of generation planning that they want that of course gets sorted out generally through the integrated resource plans that we submit and if you look at our major states. Obviously, they are very much driven by.\n\nGas at this point in time that said.\n\nA number of our customers are still heavily interested in renewables, we have about .\n\nA little over $7 billion in our capital plan.\n\nFor the deployment of renewables to support those customers and so we're going to continue to go down that path.\n\nMake sure that we are balanced between what the states want and what our customers want and I feel very confident in our team that we have the capability to be able to deliver whatever approach those customers want to have in the states center located.\n\nUnderstood. Thanks, so much.\n\nYes. Thank you.\n\nYour next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nHey, good morning came in nicely done what what a difference a year makes huh.\n\nYes. Thank you thanks Julian.\n\nAbsolutely Wow Dream team here, let me, let me frame that two questions one going back to the direction C. With price you guys with respect to cadence I mean, if youre accelerating towards the end of the plan naturally you would ask how does that trend beyond the current plan.\n\nAnd if I can cite evidence here your peers in Indiana put out a growth rate that extends beyond 2030 at this point, how do you think about what you're seeing shape up whether its commitments for further ramp beyond 2030, , just being able to process some of that load in the longer term rate and I know that folks are trying to get in the queue quickly, but certainly some of that is just.\n\nTake longer to process and drive growth beyond that period of time, how do you think about that 31 32, if if there was anything let's say preliminarily.\n\nYes, so Julian I appreciate the question and I would tell you. This kind of gets back again to what Ive said earlier and what we want to do is be very confident in the numbers that we put out and deliver on those numbers and that's why I think this 9% CAGR and saying that in 2008% to 29% and 30 will be at or.\n\nThe high end of the range, we have a great deal of confidence in that.\n\n.\n\nWhat I want to do is ensure that we are.\n\nGoing to deliver on what our commitments are over the next five years and then as we continue to see opportunities roll in we will revise that on an annual basis.\n\nThat being said I did intimate that of the 28 gig that we say, we see and are under firm in Esa is that there is some additional opportunity to see continued load growth on.\n\nOn the system as we convert some of the that are currently being discussed and signed before they get to Esa to come on but what I don't want to do is.\n\nPut something out there that I don't feel very confident that we can deliver in and Thats why I'm I'm very.\n\nPositive and comfortable with where we are on the five year.\n\nAnd again, saying that we're at or above that 9% and then I don't want to kind of try to sculpt that.\n\nBeyond or where that is in that 28, 2009 period and Thats why I told you that where we're going to be fairly flat in that area at the.\n\nThe 9% or above.\n\nBut again, what we're seeing is just incredible growth across the system right now.\n\nAnd that has been accelerating and I think that will carry into the years beyond.\n\nAnd again, if I can come back to it and ask it in a slightly different manner with respect to the current five year outlook. Obviously, you have a lot of folks knocking on your door right. You've got this 28 as you described that you've got under contract to what extent could you actually see positive revisions further as you convert some of the interest into more of those low aes.\n\nTerm sheets.\n\nIs that people or do you think given what you understand about your system that.\n\nLook this is pretty locked in and we frankly have a pretty rigid ability to accommodate more in this five year period.\n\nYes look Julian I think.\n\nWe're excited about just like you said at the very opening comments here, what a difference a year makes and what we've been able to do within this one year as we continue to see this massive amount of growth on the system and I know that some people say that we should be somewhat cautious in talking about the 190 gigawatts that are backing the 28.\n\nGigawatts and those are in various stages of discussion, but again, we feel very good about that 28 because of the 190 gigs behind it and so I think that really could color.\n\nYour view as to where we are on the the growth for the system as a conservative given that you've got 190 gigs in various stages of discussion and even if only a fraction of that were to come online, it's still a pretty compelling story.\n\nFrom where we are today.\n\nYeah, absolutely alright, guys I appreciate it very much I'll leave it there. Thank you.\n\nThanks Julien.\n\nOkay.\n\nYour next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nHey, good morning, Thank you for taking the questions and for all the updates today, just a follow up on some of the condensate, making on the versus Esa is Arthur Loa's outside of Texas that are in the plan and then is there a defined term or gating factor for the alloys that are included in the 28 gigawatts versus those that are not.\n\nYes, so there are some .\n\noutside of Texas, So again in PJM, what we have is 100% of the increase is under LOI and then.\n\nAlmost 80% is under Esa.\n\nLikewise in SPP.\n\n100% is under LOI and then there is a piece of it is under the and then an archived of course everything is under LOI.\n\nAgain, what I want to emphasize though is these loa's do have financial commitments associated with them and Thats why we have so much confidence in the 2008 Gigawatts Charlie.\n\nGot it great. Thank you for the clarity on that and then just on the new transmission budget.\n\nCurious what that assumes on the PJM open window opportunities is the most recent window sort of baked in there or is that a source as you think about potential upside opportunities on the transmission piece of the business.\n\nYes, currently I would say we've taken into consideration into the five year capital plan everything that we know with regards to.\n\nExisting transmission.\n\nWe feel pretty confident about.\n\nBut again, we continue to see opportunities around incremental.\n\nInvestments in the transmission system, maybe not under new transmission lines, but certainly the continuation of the rebuilding of some of the infrastructure.\n\nBut the PJM opportunities are built into this five year capital plan.\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nThanks Karli. Thanks.\n\nYour next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nHey, good morning, Thanks for taking my questions.\n\nMaybe.\n\nA lot of good questions have been asked but just.\n\nMaybe just on the earned ROE improvement 2006 through 2030, just what are you kind of holding your team too in terms of improvement.\n\nImprovement year by year.\n\nSupposed to happen linearly through the plan I know you have some big rate cases, like Ohio that will be filed which can kind of help catalyze that but just maybe you can kind of comment on the cadence of ROE improvement between now and 2030 and what you expect to hear by year.\n\nYeah. Thanks, Thanks for that question and first and foremost I want to make sure that.\n\nEveryone knows row is front and center with us and we've been spending an incredible time with.\n\nThe states and our regulators to look for improvements in this arena and as I look back at where we were a year ago.\n\nhave shown steady improvement and.\n\nThe drivers of that were constructive regulatory outcomes in pretty favorable legislative developments.\n\nAnd so I know that.\n\nAs we look forward, we're going to continue to drive.\n\nBetter outcomes, but I really like where we're at just in the recent past we've had a lot of success.\n\nIf you look at AEP transmission AEP, Ohio, A&M all of those are posted ROE is near or above their authorized AEP, Texas is going to continue to improve their Roe.\n\nRising to 9% in quarter three from $8 six last quarter and again, that's due to our great legislative outcome and HPE $52 47, and then in Kentucky power, while those are impacted by regulatory lag, we expect to see good improvements in.\n\n.\n\nReally better outcomes due to the new base cases, and the generation filings, we're making there and then I want to address West Virginia right upfront it was obvious.",
    "content2": "There are are we was affected by the most recent regulatory order, we got but we're fully engaged in west Virginia. We have filed for reconsideration, we're working with all the stakeholders there and that continues to be a major focus of mind I'm spending a significant amount of time in west Virginia to try and .\n\nThe port of .\n\nBetter outcome, there and so.\n\nWhen I when I add all that up and I think about where we're at.\n\nOverall from from where we were just a year ago with the.\n\nThe focus that we've had on ROE I feel very good about what we put in the plan.\n\nNo were 20 basis points off where we thought we might be but for me when I look at the significant improvement we've had across all of our states I'm very excited about what the team has done and it just really sets us up very strongly for moving forward from here.\n\nOkay. Okay. Thank you for that.\n\nI'm, sorry, if I'm not understanding it fully but just on the seven to nine.\n\nBecause of this dual communication here.\n\nAnd 28 should we be growing that 9% plus off of 'twenty seven or should we look at that as a CAGR from 2006.\n\nAnd what 9% would imply for 28. Thank you.\n\nYes, So I think what you want to do is we've kind of bifurcated it into the two piece this year and we've said.\n\nFor the first two years of the plan, we will be growing at below the mid point of this.\n\nThe 7% to nine.\n\nAnd really on the back three years, we will be growing at or above the 9% and so from our standpoint, that's why I gave the 9% CAGR over that five year period, starting from the midpoint of 2025.\n\nAnd so I think what that does is it really allows you to kind of.\n\nwalked out the EPS numbers almost on an annual basis year, because I'm, giving you the midpoint of the 2026 and then you can assume that the 2027 is kind.\n\nKind of consistent with that growth and then once we go up to 28 29, and 30, we will be growing at that.\n\n.\n\nHigh end of the range at or above that high end of the range for an overall CAGR over that five year period of 9%.\n\nThank you I'm, sorry to make you repeat yourself and looking forward I don't know.\n\nNo problem. Thank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nAre you there Colby we have time for one last question.\n\nOperator.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nWell it sounds like the calls coming to a close.\n\nReally appreciate all of you joining us on today's call.\n\nAnd I'd like to close with just a few summary remarks, so I'm very excited about when I think.\n\nAbout the opportunities ahead at AEP as we advance on our long term strategy to drive growth and create value while enhancing the customer experience I'm also extremely proud of the entire AAP team and particularly all of the strong support received from our board of directors.\n\nWe're putting in a robust $72 billion capital plan to work as we continue to grow the business across our large footprint and deliver on our commitments for the benefit of our customers our communities and all of our other stakeholders and investors.\n\nFinally, if there are any follow up items. Please reach out to our IR team with your questions and we look forward to meeting with many of you at in a couple of weeks. This concludes our call. Thank you.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay."

In addition, we have other members of our management team in the room to answer questions if needed, including Kate Sturgess, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer.\nWe will be making forward-looking statements during the call. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent SEC filings. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. We will take your questions following opening remarks.\nPlease turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Bill.\n\nWilliam J. Fehrman\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nThank you, Darcy. Good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. I'm extremely proud of the effort and dedication that our team has put forward, resulting in significant progress on our strategic objectives of delivering reliable and affordable service to our 5.6 million customers. Before we begin, I'd like to first recognize 3 seasoned executives who have recently joined and solidified our leadership ranks. In May, Doug Cannon was named President of AEP Transmission to lead all aspects of our best-in-class largest in the nation transmission business, which contributes to 55% of AEP's total operating earnings. Doug comes to EP after being CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy's NV Energy. He understands the pace of play and disciplined leadership I want as we grow this segment of our company. We look forward to benefiting from Doug's deep industry experience and strong leadership as we prepare the business for significant growth and meeting the future demands of our customers.\nAnd this month, Rob Bernsten, was named General Counsel. Rob comes to AEP after serving as General Counsel at Xcel Energy. But before that, he worked with me at Berkshire Hathaway Energy for many years. He understands the direction I want to head and how we need to get there. This is a pivotal time for AEP and Rob's legal expertise, deep business and utility background, coupled with his disciplined leadership and commitment to excellence, will serve as well as we continue to navigate complex operational, financial and regulatory landscapes. Finally, Johanna Eckert was named Chief Information and Technology Officer. He joins us after a very successful career at Cox Communications, where he led an expansive role was incredibly focused on the customer, both internal and external. Johannes will lead our continuing efforts to build an efficient, innovative organization that supports the right technology to meet the ever-changing needs of both our customers and the business. We are proud to welcome these leaders who will report directly to me and support the execution of our long-term strategy.\nToday, I'd like to discuss the ways in which we have advanced on our commitments to grow financial strength, drive operational excellence and deliver constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes. Each is a key priority that our team and I are laser focused on. We have continued to leverage our size and scale to ensure AEP is extremely well positioned for unprecedented growth and value creation. I will begin with the key financial highlights for the quarter, cover the low growth opportunities ahead and provide additional insight into both federal and state level regulatory and legislative successes that we have delivered since the last earnings call. Trevor will walk us through second quarter performance drivers and provide additional details surrounding AEP's financial position. Please refer to Slide 5 of our presentation for a summary of today's remarks.\nStarting with our financial results. AEP delivered the strongest ever second quarter operating earnings in our 100-year history. This team delivered operating earnings of $1.43 per share or $766 million. I am seeing significant improvement in execution and regulatory outcomes that is fueling this performance. With added strength to the management team, as previously discussed, I fully expect us to continue building on these levels of results. My confidence in this management team and workforce across AEP is incredibly strong. I see the culture changing to one of accountability performance and trust in each other, and we are fortunate to all support from our Board of Directors. Our future is very bright and with strong results halfway through the year.\nWe are now guiding to the upper half of our $5.75 to $5.95 per share operating earnings range. Additionally, with the robust capital plan, we are seeing a continued path and are reaffirming our long-term operating earnings growth rate of 6% to 8%. My confidence in our ability to execute is very high. This is critically important as we look to the future and the growth that is in front of us. Specifically, we are executing on our $54 billion capital plan and expect to announce a new 5-year capital plan this fall of approximately $70 billion. The incremental capital can be allocated with approximately 50% to transmission, 40% to generation and 10% of distribution. As we have previously highlighted, there have been several announcements on some 765 kV transmission projects that we will incorporate into our third quarter capital plan update and look forward to providing a robust outlook later this year to support our incredible growth.\nMoving on to AEP's significant expansion opportunities, we are experiencing transformative load growth across our sizable 11-state footprint. We are excited about the substantial customer interest in AEP service territory, and our team has taken a very disciplined approach when thinking about this new load. We have increased our firm customer commitments and now expect to have 24 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade from our previously reported 21 gigawatts, driven primarily by data centers, reshoring of manufacturing and further economic development. I want to emphasize these 24 gigawatts are all backed by signed customer agreements, protecting us from changes in usage-driven volatility. We believe this amount of committed capacity is differential compared to almost any other utility and we are well prepared to deliver on this for our customers and our states.\nBeyond the 24 gigawatts, customers are also actively seeking to connect approximately 190 gigawatts of additional load to our system. This is 5x our current system size of 37 gigawatts. Potential customers are drawn to AEP's footprint because of our advanced transmission network capable of delivering consistent large load power. Recall that we own and operate more ultra-high voltage 765 kV lines than all other utilities combined, uniquely positioning us with the largest electric transmission system in the country.\nPlease turn to the next slide. There is a long list of accomplishments we have achieved this quarter outlined on this page. And to be very clear, we are aligning our business with the goals of our state and federal regulators, legislators and policymakers. As previously noted, we see some opportunities to invest in generation, transmission and distribution across our footprint and beyond. In connection with these investments, customer affordability remains top of mind as we consider how to fairly allocate costs related to critically needed infrastructure. Let's walk through a couple of noteworthy accomplishments.\nFirst, Ohio has become a recognized hub for data centers, and we are actively participating in this growing economic development. Earlier this month, the Ohio Commission established enhanced financial obligations that data centers will need to undertake to fund necessary infrastructure. This approved data center tariff provides assurances that there will be reliable electric grid infrastructure to deliver the power we all count on while keeping costs as low as possible for all customers. This approval joins other large low tariffs previously secured in Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky. AEP has been at the forefront of securing these tariffs that bring down system average costs as we add data center customers promote certainty around build-out while providing customer protections and are a powerful risk mitigation tool for us.\nMoving on to Oklahoma. Following commission approval in June, PSO purchased the Green Country power plant, a 795-megawatt natural gas fire generation facility located in Jenks, Oklahoma. As customer energy demands rise in the region, this facility will play an important role in delivering reliable power while ensuring grid stability for the communities we serve and supporting the state's economic growth. This plant has been successfully integrated into PSO's operations and is performing well, showing AEP's strength of execution. And finally, we continue to explore innovative ways to bring tailored power solutions to our customers during this period of massively growing power demand.\nAt AEP, we are at the forefront of innovation in small modular reactors or MRs and are just 1 option we are considering to provide our customers with safe, reliable and clean baseload energy. We have already shared our plans with you to begin the early site permit process for 2 potential SMR locations 1 in Indiana and the other in Virginia to support significant load growth in our service territory. While this represents an exciting opportunity for us, we will continue to be extremely prudent in our capital allocation protection of our balance sheet and credit metric strength. We are also continuing to pursue deployment of balloon fuel cells. This is a low-risk approach to bridging data center load from first power to ultimate grid connection.\nWe are excited about this innovative solution and are in discussions with various customers about this energy supply option. Demand for power is growing at a pace I have not seen in my 45-year energy career. This was reinforced just last week with PJM capacity prices clearing above the $325 per megawatt day price cap as we continue to see the need for capacity and energy materially rise. With AEP's generation requirements increasing to support capacity, this gives us confidence in our growing capital plan. A fundamental and core priority of mine is to continually demonstrate to our regulators and customers that we will be highly focused on safety, service, reliability and deliver balanced and constructive regulatory outcomes. I'm proud to say we've made great strides on this front.\nFor example, AEP Texas was recently granted in ERCOT Permian Basin 765 kV transmission project opening the door for future 765 kV projects. In addition, system resiliency plans at AEP Texas and SWEPCO Texas received the green light. AEP Ohio secured approval for its Phase III grid smart rider Kentucky was authorized recovery of advanced metering infrastructure. And as previously mentioned, AEP Ohio received the data center tariff approval, while PSO was granted authority to purchase the green country natural gas facility in Oklahoma. These important developments reflect collaborative efforts with our regulators as we find solutions that support existing and future customers. Additionally, in the second quarter, FERC issued orders agreeing with AEP's proposed treatment of NOL Cs within its transmission formula rates, which Trevor will go into more detail shortly.\nA couple of our operating companies recently filed new base rate applications, including SWEPCO, Arkansas in March and AEP Ohio in May. We look forward to working with all stakeholders of these cases to achieve constructive and balanced outcomes that benefit both our customers and investors. In West Virginia, late last year, APCo filed a base case and offered the option for securitization of up to $2.4 billion as a means to help mitigate rate impacts on the proposed base rate increase. We expect a commission order in the third quarter and appreciate the stakeholder feedback we have received during this process as we all continue to focus on customer needs and affordability.\nTurning now to AEP's legislative efforts. We have also been working diligently with federal policymakers and state legislatures to deploy large amounts of capital while reducing regulatory lag. Our team has been actively engaged throughout the legislative process leading into the federal budget reconciliation bill signed into law on July 4. The bill contains several tax provisions impacting utilities primarily centered around tax credits for generation assets. To be very clear, the legislation currently supports 100% of AEP's $9.9 billion 5-year capital plan for wind and solar generation maintaining the required criteria to capture the full tax credits. We are also closely monitoring the July 7 executive order to assess potential impacts on tax qualification.\nEven if the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued new guidance under the order that redefines the beginning of construction criteria, we currently expect that only a few projects at the back end of the plan may need to be reassessed for tax credit eligibility. Keep in mind that while our generation mix may vary, the load growth remains robust, and we will need future generation to service the forecasted demand. So any impacted capital would just be reassigned to alternative forms of generation assets at the back end of the plan. Texas House Bill 5247, which became law in June, is an incredibly constructive piece of legislation for AEP Texas. This unified tracker mechanism allows utilities that meet certain criteria to submit a single filing each year instead of multiple filings for distribution and transmission investment, essentially eliminating lag, further streamlining the regulatory process and substantially improving the earned ROEs.\nThis is highly supportive of increasing our capital allocation to Texas as we participate in the massive infrastructure buildout needed to drive the economic growth date. With Ohio House Bill 15 taking effect in August, the new legislation eliminates electric security plans or ESPs, and introduces a multiyear forward-looking test year with a true-up mechanism, which promotes timely and efficient recovery of investments. AEP Ohio's transition from ESPs to this new construct in 2028 will proceed seamlessly without any gap in timing since the current ESP expires concurrently when the forward-looking test year rate case will take effect. This is very positive for AEP Ohio. For Oklahoma and Senate Bill 998, PSO views the impacts of this legislation also is very constructive. The ability to defer 90% of all distribution and general plant that goes in service between rate cases as a regulatory asset is intended to encourage investment, reduce regulatory lag and increase earnings recognition. This legislation is also effective beginning in August.\nI'll close by emphasizing how proud I am of all we have accomplished over the past 12 months. This tremendous progress would not be possible without the unwavering dedication of the entire AEP team and our Board of Directors. We continue to push our strategic priorities forward and deliver for all of our customers and other stakeholders every day at a dramatically increased pace of play. This is only the beginning, and I believe we are just getting started. We will continue to work at a fast pace on our commitments while remaining focused on customer service, operational excellence, financial discipline sound execution and driving value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Trevor, who will walk us through the second quarter performance drivers and other financial information.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThanks, Bill, and good morning to everyone. Today, I'll review our financial results for the second quarter, build on Bill's comments regarding our exceptional load growth and then finish with comments on our commitment to the financial strength of the company.\nLet's start with Slide 7, which details our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment. For your reference, there is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter on Slide 24 of today's presentation. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.43 per share compared to $1.25 per share in 2024. This was an increase of $0.18 per share or about 14% year-over-year, highlighting the solid momentum we have heading into the second half of 2025. This momentum, coupled with our proven ability to execute, gives us the confidence to guide our operating earnings per share to the upper half of the 2025 range of $5.75 to $5.95.\nAs Bill briefly indicated, we have been working with each of the various regulators in our service territories to align our rate making for the tax net operating losses with the rulings we received from the IRS last year that we received a final decision from FERC affirming the appropriate treatment of NOLCs to our transmission formula rates resulting in a $480 million or $0.90 per share increase to GAAP earnings. The tax benefit related to prior years has been excluded from operating earnings. With the resolution of this issue by FERC, we have now transitioned substantially all of our rate making to the required regulatory approach.\nLooking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.56 per share, up $0.10 from a year earlier. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions and increasing load from data centers, which I'll get to in more detail shortly. These items were partially offset by the variance from last year's extremely favorable weather in the quarter and higher depreciation in the current year, driven by increased capital investment. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.42 per share, up $0.01 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment include rate changes driven by rider recovery of distribution investments in Ohio and the base rate case in Texas as well as continued gains in REIT sales from large loans. These items were partially offset by increased year-over-year O&M primarily driven from system improvements and spending on storm-related expenses.\nAs Bill mentioned, we had an incredibly impactful legislative session in Texas. Most notably, the passage of House Bill 5247 also known as the Unified Tracker Mechanism or UTM. This bill applies to AEP Texas, given its inclusion in the Permian plan, participation in ERCOT and the significant amount of capital we anticipate spending throughout the state over the next decade. The UTM basically eliminates regulatory lag and supports increased capital investment in AEP Texas in response to the legislatures goal of developing the electric infrastructure necessary to harden the grid, which is driven by the state's incredible economic growth. In late June, AEP Texas made a notification filing with the commission that they intend to use the UTM process going forward.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.42 per share up $0.03 from last year. Our continued investments in transmission assets as new loans are added on to the system remain the key driver in this segment. Generation and Marketing produced $0.17 per share, up $0.05 from last year. Favorable energy margins were partially offset by lower distributed generation margins due to the sale of the OnSite Partners business back in September of 2024. Finally, Corporate and Other was relatively flat over last year, demonstrating our focus on overall cost controls.\nMoving on to Slide 8. I'd like to speak to some of the significant increases in load that we continue to see across the system. The numbers you see here are the basis behind our existing $54 billion 5-year cap plan. Keeping in mind, we expect to increase the capital plan to a new 5-year spend of up to $70 billion. We are seeing great clarity into this capital growth and we will be ready to lay out the details of our revised capital and financing plans on the third quarter earnings call. The chart to the left depicts how our load story is impacting the second quarter growth. On a weather-normalized basis, we've added more than 4 gigawatts of incremental peak demand since this time last year, growing from 33.5 gigawatts to 37.6 gigawatts.\nThis increase is largely due to new data centers and other industrial customers coming online in Indiana, Ohio and Texas, resulting in a roughly $200 million year-over-year increase in revenues. This slide highlights the strong relationship between peak demand and revenue. That's because our C&I customer bills are based more on peak demand than megawatt hour sales. Higher peak demand, coupled with the contractual minimums built into the latest tariff provisions, predominantly in Indiana are driving up revenues. These demand minimums for large load customers are helping to more than fully offset revenue impacts from energy efficiencies among our residential customers.\nTurning to the graphic on the right and looking beyond the current quarter, our $54 billion 5-year capital plan is supported by 24 gigawatts of contracts that have already signed firm commitments for incremental load through the end of the decade. We will be taking this into consideration as we update our full forecast later this year. These contracts are a combination of letters of agreement or LOAs and long-term electric service agreements, or ESAs, depending on tariff provisions in the jurisdictions in which they are located. To put a fine point on this, we really want to be the only investor-owned utilities that not only has incremental load of 24 gigawatts backed by signed LOAs or ESAs but also has an incremental 190 gigawatts in the interconnection queue actively looking to connect to our system.\nThis represents an unprecedented growth opportunity that is largely unique to AEP given the size and technological profile of our transmission system. This 190 gigawatt queue consists of request at varying stages of development and is indicative of the fact that we have substantial unsigned load that is looking to connect. While we continue to see a lot of public speculation about data center load, we have developed detailed internal processes for executing on a firm pipeline of actual growth that we are already seeing come to fruition. Earlier, you heard Bill mention a few of our regulatory successes and several revolved around strengthening and lengthening those tariff provisions. Just this year, we've had large load tariffs approved in Indiana, Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky that provide financial protections for our existing customers as we invest to serve those new large loads.\nRelying on these signed contracts as opposed to more speculative forecasting methods, differentiates AEP and gives us confidence that these loads will materialize on our system. Again, now that we have some of the new tariff provisions in place, particularly in Indiana and Ohio, we are working towards getting more of those requests converted into signed agreements that can eventually be incorporated into the load forecast that we will be communicating later this year.\nLet's move on to Slide 9. On the left of the slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains very strong at above $5.6 billion and is supported by $6 billion of credit facilities. Our balance sheet is also healthy reinforced by the recent closing of the $2.8 billion minority transmission transaction in early June and our proactive $2.3 billion forward equity offering in the first quarter. As a result, S&P moved AEP's outlook to stable and reaffirmed our BBB flat credit rating. We remain committed to continued credit quality, and I want to reiterate that we have fulfilled our equity needs that supports our $54 billion capital plan from '25 through '29.\nAs previously mentioned, we expect to increase this $54 billion capital plan to a new 5-year investment plan of up to $70 billion. We are evaluating upcoming incremental capital spend opportunities and efficiently matching them with optimal financing strategies including items like growth equity and hybrids in support of this capital expansion. We do not have immediate equity needs and maintain near-term flexibility as we evaluate all options to efficiently finance our growth. We're also encouraged by favorable legislative developments, constructive regulatory outcomes and our continued focus of disciplined cost management. Together, these factors support operating cash flow growth and provide a solid foundation to fund incremental capital investment. On the top right table, S&P's FFO to debt metric stands at 14.8% for the 12 months ended June 30 and Moody's FFO to debt metric stands at 13.2% for the same period using their recently revised methodology.\nFinally, let's move to Slide 10 before we take your questions. I'll briefly summarize what you heard from Bill and me today. First, you heard how we delivered strong financial performance in the second quarter, substantially growing earnings at 14% quarter-over-quarter. We're guiding to the upper half of our 2025 operating earnings range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share, which is driven by strong year-to-date results and confidence in our ability to execute for the remainder of the year. Second, you heard that we continue to achieve constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes. This was highlighted by positive developments like House Bill 5247 in Texas and Senate Bill 998 in Oklahoma, alongside solid regulatory execution on several key filings like the approval to build a new 765 KV transmission line in Texas, the acquisition of the Green Country generation facility in Oklahoma and the approval of large load tariffs across several jurisdictions.\nThird, you heard how we've strengthened our balance sheet through the closing of the $2.8 billion minority interest. You heard how our remarkable low growth story continues to evolve and contribute to earnings. How our commitment to obtaining -- gives us great confidence that these projects will come to fruition. Also, you heard how those same contracts provide financial protection for our investors and other customers. Lastly, you heard about our continued commitment to execute on our capital plan and we expect to increase our capital plan to a new 5-year investment plan of up to $70 billion. As we mentioned earlier, we are looking forward to sharing our plan and the associated financing on the third quarter call later this year.\nIt's an exciting time to be in the electric industry, and I believe we are extremely well positioned to drive exceptional operational and financial results, value to our customers and shareholders. I'm now going to ask the operator to open the call so we can take some of your questions",

Fehrman\n\nPresident & CEO\n\nThank you, Darcy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to American Electric Power's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. We are off to an exceptional start to the year, where we delivered strong results and have advanced our long-term strategy to drive robust growth, enhance the customer experience and achieve positive regulatory outcomes.\nWe remain committed to investing $54 billion of capital over the next 5 years, an impressive amount close in size to our current market capitalization, to meet the needs of 5.6 million customers across 11 states. We are actively managing our supply chain to ensure we deliver on our commitments. Specifically related to current plant tariffs, we estimate that the direct tariff exposure on our $54 billion base capital plan for 2025 to 2029 is minimal at approximately 0.3%. We have a sizable generation portfolio and 1 of the largest transmission and distribution businesses in the nation. In fact, AEP owns and operates more 765 kV transmission lines than all of utilities in the United States combined, and we were recently awarded construction to build 1 of the first 765 kV lines in Texas.\nWe are enabling extraordinary economic development in high-growth states like Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and Texas and stand to benefit from these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities presented by the associated load growth. Trevor will go into this in more detail shortly. Our story continues to be one of consistency and commitment to delivering for our customers, states, regulators and investors as we center on execution and accountability. And we offer a compelling value proposition to our investors as we target 10% to 12% of total annual shareholder return.\nWe have a lot of exciting ground to cover today. I'll begin with a recap of our financial results at a high level before turning to strategic growth opportunities ahead and our recent regulatory and legislative successes. I'll then hand the call over to Trevor to walk through our financial results in more detail. Please refer to today's presentation for our quarterly business highlights and achievements, starting on Slide 5.\nThis morning, we announced first quarter 2025 operating earnings of $1.54 per share, or $823 million. With this strong performance, we are reaffirming our 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share and long-term operating earnings growth rate of 6% to 8%. This guidance is reinforced by a balanced and flexible $54 billion 5-year capital plan, with the potential for incremental investments of up to $10 billion over that same period. As we have communicated in the past, maintaining a strong balance sheet is vital to funding these capital spending needs. Later in the call, we'll go into more detail about AEP's commitment to credit quality and proactive actions we have taken in the first 3 months of 2025 to address AEP's equity needs.\nAs we move forward, we will remain disciplined in sourcing efficient forms of capital to manage our needs in support of incremental investment opportunities. We remain excited about the significant growth opportunities ahead, including the load growth in many parts of our service territory. This growth is not a show-me story. It is happening. AEP's total retail load growth has already been favorable over the past few years, primarily driven by commercial customers. In the first quarter of 2025, our commercial load grew 12.3% compared to the first quarter of last year.\nAs we look ahead, AEP is extremely well positioned to participate in future growth across our footprint. We see opportunities to invest in critically needed infrastructure to support increase in electric demand. Our current capital plan includes customer commitments for over 20 gigawatts of incremental load by 2030, driven by data center demand, reshoring, manufacturing and continued economic development. This incremental 20 gigawatts is about a 55% increase over 2024 system-wide summer peak load.\nAs we have consistently said, we are absolutely committed to fair cost allocation associated with this large load growth. To that end, we proactively filed the data center tariff in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia. In the first quarter, we received commission approvals in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia related to large load tariffs. The data center tariff here in Ohio also concluded in January, and we expect to have a commission decision in the second half of this year. These are all strong indications of our state's continuing commitment to attracting large loads with their economic impacts on local communities, while also protecting our existing customer base.\nAs we have previously discussed, meeting this incredible demand could require incremental investments of up to $10 billion, underpinned by 4 major drivers: large load in some of our bigger service territories, continued economic development in our states, investment across the system in our transmission and distribution infrastructure and new generation. One of the reasons we are seeing such growth now is due to investments we made over the past decade to build an advanced 40,000-mile transmission system that can help support current large loads. Our transmission system also includes the nation's largest network of 765 and 345 kV lines. These ultra-high voltage lines position us exceedingly well in attracting hyperscalers to our system who need consistent, large load bulk power.\nWe also continue to invest in our distribution system, which is one of the nation's largest at approximately 225,000 miles. This includes work to harden infrastructure, build or rebuild poles, conductors, transformers and other assets, as well as deploy automated technologies for enhanced operational performance. These efforts will help to increase customer satisfaction, strengthen our system's resilience to weather events and enhance the efficiency of our operations. As our generation needs increase to meet growing demand, we are engaging with key stakeholders and making thoughtful investments in new generation to align with their needs and state policies.\nOur team has worked diligently to develop creative energy solutions that keep our customers' needs top of mind. We have already shared our plans to begin the early site permit process in Indiana and Virginia for small modular reactors, or SMRs, that can generate clean, reliable energy to support significant load growth in our service inventory. And we recently filed Integrated Resource Plans, or IRPs, in both Arkansas and Indiana. These IRPs, in addition to other planned IRP filings over the next year in Kentucky, Michigan, Virginia and West Virginia, will help meet our customers' energy [ needs ] and support AEP's generating capacity obligations, reinforcing our incredible growth. The fact is that demand for power is growing at a pace not seen in decades, and our expansive footprint enables us to significantly participate in this electric infrastructure super cycle.\nNow let's pivot to some traditional regulatory and legislative updates. In my 9 months here at AEP, I have been actively engaged with stakeholders to underscore the importance of our customers and communities and how we work to meet their needs. Building on our meaningful progress in achieving positive regulatory developments in the second half of 2024, we are off to a great start in 2025, with approximately 80% of our rate related revenue already secured for this year. In fact, AEP's first quarter earned ROE for our regulated businesses was 9.3%, up from 9.05% at year-end.\nAs a reminder, some recent regulatory successes include: A recent commission decision approving construction in ERCOT's Permian Basin for one of the first 765 kV transmission lines in Texas, opening up tremendous investment opportunities for AEP Texas; PJM transmission system upgrades awarded to AEP affiliates, including Transource Energy and our transmission companies; system resiliency plans approved at AEP Texas and the unanimous settlement reached at SWEPCO Texas; base cases approved in Oklahoma and Virginia and recovery of annual transmission expense approved in Kentucky.\nIn late March, we also filed a new base case in Arkansas requesting a rate increase of $114 million. This ask is primarily to align regulatory recovery of certain wind projects, including rate implementation of the diversion and [ wag and wear ] projects. Our application includes an ROE request of 10.9%, and SWEPCO anticipates an order and new rates effective in the first quarter of 2026. Previously, APCo filed its base case in West Virginia, while offering securitization of up to $2.4 billion as a tool to mitigate the bill impact of a proposed $250 million base rate increase. The procedural schedule just kicked off last month, with intervener testimony and rebuttal testimony will follow later this month. [ Hearing ] this at the start in mid-June. We look forward to working with everyone in this case to achieve a positive and balanced outcome later this year.\nWe are intently focused on reducing regulatory lag and have made a number of other timely filings so far in 2025, including the AEP Texas TCOS and DCRF bi-annual filings, as well as SWEPCO's annual [ formula rate ] plan in Louisiana. For I&M, the team recently filed to acquire an 870-megawatt natural gas plant in 2026, which is located in Oregon, Ohio. That will help I&M customers continue to benefit from reliable and affordable resources. We are also working diligently at the legislative level in a number of jurisdictions to advance policy changes to improve both recovery and customer affordability. For example, in Ohio, the recent passage of House Bill 15 positively results in multiyear forward-looking test years for future rate cases and includes grandfathering language for 2 behind-the-meter fuel subcontracts. Trevor will go into further detail on the OVEC-related impacts. And in Virginia, we supported securitization legislation that will both reduce customer bills and support critical investments in the system.\nYou can expect to see us continue to work with federal policymakers, regulators and state legislators as we further modernize our energy [ revenue ]. We firmly believe that the best way to create value for our investors is by delivering safe, affordable and reliable energy to our customers and communities, and we are engaging with stakeholders to support efforts to do just that. I'm increasingly confident in our exciting growth potential as opportunities to benefit our customers, communities and investors come into focus. And I look forward to building on our track record of value creation in the months and years ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Trevor, who will walk us through AEP's first quarter performance drivers and other financial information.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Bill. Today, I'll review our financial results for the first quarter, build on Bill's remarks about our exceptional load growth, comment on our credit metrics, further discuss the recent successful $2.3 billion forward equity issuance that completes our anticipated equity needs through 2029 and address our thoughts on federal tax legislation.\nLet's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $1.50 per share compared to $1.91 per share in 2024. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter on Slide 26 of today's presentation.\nIn the quarter, due to the passage of Ohio House Bill 15, we recorded a charge of $28 million related to the write-off of previously deferred OVEC costs which we no longer believe are probable of recovery. From an operating earnings perspective and effective upon becoming law this summer, House Bill 15 removes AEP Ohio's ability to recover losses or record gains from the sale of OVEC Power.\nHistorical losses recovered from customers were approximately $40 million in 2024. However, we expect the earnings impact going forward to be significantly muted, given upcoming capacity prices in PJM. Prospectively, the impact is manageable and less than $10 million of earnings on an annualized basis.\nLet's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.54 per share compared to $1.27 per share in 2024. This was an increase of $0.27 per share or about 20% quarter-over-quarter, highlighting a strong start to the year and creating solid momentum for the rest of 2025. I would note that weather accounted for about $0.18 of the quarter-over-quarter variance. This was driven by the cold weather that most of our service areas experienced in the first quarter of this year, which was contrasted with the exceptionally mild weather seen in the same period of 2024.\nLooking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.66 per share, up $0.09 from a year earlier. Positive drivers included favorable changes in weather and rate changes across multiple jurisdictions. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.36 per share, up $0.07 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes driven by rider recovery of distribution investments in Ohio and the base rate case in Texas, favorable weather and higher transmission revenue.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.44 per share, up $0.04 from last year. Our continued investment in transmission assets as new loans are added to our system remain the key driver of the segment. Generation & Marketing produced $0.14 per share, up $0.02 from last year. Favorable retail and wholesale margins were partially offset by lower distributed generation margins due to the sale of the OnSite Partners business in September of 2024. Finally, Corporate and Other saw a benefit of $0.05 per share, primarily driven by the timing of income taxes, of which $0.03 is expected to reverse by the end of the year.\nMoving to Slide 9. I want to highlight the significant increases in load we continue to see across our system. As Bill mentioned, the increasing load growth coming to the system is providing the opportunity to add up to $10 billion of incremental capital over the next 5 years to our already sizable $54 billion plan. Since our last call, both Amazon Web Services and Google have connected hyperscale data centers to our system in Indiana, representing billions of dollars in customer investments. This comes on top of the existing data center customers in Ohio and Texas who continue to ramp up at a double-digit pace.\nWe also saw new large industrial load continue to come online in Texas across a variety of customers and industries. All of this puts us on track to nearly triple the pace of our retail sales growth from 3% in 2024 to almost 9% in 2025. That represents the largest acceleration of load at AEP since the late 1960s, a truly once-in-a-generation opportunity. In fact, we expect that step change in growth to be maintained well into the future. Our current forecast supports annual retail load growth of between 8% and 9% through 2027. That's equivalent to roughly [ 52 million ] incremental megawatt hours that we expect to serve relative to our current load of 182 million-megawatt hours, or nearly a 30% increase.\nMore than offsetting the decline in our residential sales is a massive and sustained increase in demand from our C&I customers. Based on our current contracted lows, our C&I sales mix will grow from roughly 2/3 of total retail to nearly 3 quarters over the next several years. There is a slide in the Appendix that shows a bit more detail on first quarter sales by class. Those growth rates are one of the best in the industry, and we have confidence that these loans are going to show up.\nWe have a significant amount of demonstrated and diverse demand across our system. But I think it's also important to highlight what that demand looks like and how we're incorporating it into our projections. You will see on Slide 10 a piece of that demand through some illustrative examples of the types of projects we're adding to our system. First and foremost, let's start with a number of overall requests to connect to the system. Across our 11-state operating footprint, we currently have more than 500 existing and potential customers actively requesting to connect almost 180 gigawatts of load to our transmission system. For context, our system-wide summer peak was just under 37 gigawatts last year. So we have nearly 5x that amount active in the queue.\nNow obviously, we know that not all of the requests will come online, which is why we take great care in using a probability-based approach to determine the likelihood of these loads as part of our annual load forecast. So far, we've committed to adding just over 20 gigawatts on to the system over the next 5 years, which in the context of our queue, is relatively conservative. Given the dynamic nature of AI driving the surge of data centers and large industrials coming online, we think it's vital to rely on demonstrated customer demand to build out our planning forecast. We believe the best mechanisms to demonstrate the demand are executed contracts backed by financial commitments, including electric service agreements, or ESAs, and letters of agreement, or LOAs, showing how firm these loads really are.\nEvery megawatt in the forecast you see here is supported by LOAs. In addition to LOAs in PJM, 80% of the load growth in this region is also backed by ESAs, which are take-or-pay contracts requiring customers to pay for power as of a certain start date, irrespective of their offtake. This not only helps confirm that customers' projects are real, but also incentivizes customers to stick to the schedule, reducing the risk to our existing customers and investors from a project not coming online. This is also why we've been very active in working with our regulators to strengthen and lengthen the tariff provisions in those contracts. Our contract terms, coupled with the queue that is nearly 10x the size of our current increased load forecast, gives us great confidence that this demand will show up, which, in turn, makes us confident in our $54 billion capital plan with incremental upside.\nShould any of these projects be canceled or postponed, in addition to the protective financial provisions in the contracts, our queue means that we have other active customers to slot right into place and take up that capacity. In addition to the demonstrating demand that we're seeing across the system, it is also important to note the diversity in that demand. While data centers are driving the majority of the load growth in the coming years, we are also contracted to add roughly 6 gigawatts of industrial load across a number of diverse industries, including steel, auto and energy. This diversity reassures us that the demand behind our capital plan is solid and can hold up across several different economic environments, including those with tariff impacts that we may find ourselves in over the next several years.\nLet's move on to Slide 11 to discuss AEP's liquidity and commitment to credit quality. Recall that AEP's funding plan supporting our capital spend through 2029 originally included $5.35 billion sourced from equity. In January, we secured a minority equity interest investment in the Ohio and I&M transcos with KKR and PSP Investments for $2.82 billion. This deal is value accretive at 2.3x rate base and 30.3x price to earnings. We expect to close in the coming months, and the only remaining item outstanding is FERC approval, which we filed for on February 3.\nIn March, we saw compelling opportunities to further derisk our funding needs through a $2.3 billion forward equity transaction, including the [ greenshoe ], that allowed us to capitalize on known market conditions and manage the timing of proceeds. In combination with the expected proceeds from the minority transaction, I'm pleased that we now have completed our anticipated equity needs through 2029 associated with our $54 billion capital plan. Those 2 transactions are equivalent to issuing common stock at approximately $140 per share, a 25% premium to our current share price.\nMoving on to federal tax legislation and specific to transferability impacting FFO. We believe a complete retroactive IRA repeal is unlikely, based on our many conversations with policymakers. If there is a repeal, we would expect any potential legislation to provide business certainty by protecting the qualifying tax incentives for existing projects, as well as safe harbor projects currently under construction. This would give us the ability to monetize tax credits in a timely manner and meet our financial commitments. You can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 13.2% for the 12 months ended March 31, which is a 0.2% decrease from the prior quarter. However, the minority interest transaction is expected to improve near-term FFO to debt by 40 to 60 basis points, which sets us up to be well above our credit threshold and put us on a path to be in the targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt window.\nFinally, let's move on to Slide 12. Before we take your questions, I wanted to summarize what you heard from us today. First, you heard that we have taken significant actions to derisk our financial plan through the highly attractive and accretive minority interest transmission transaction, which is expected to close in the coming months, coupled with the $2.3 billion equity offering completed in late March prior to the current market turbulence. These transactions combined complete our anticipated equity needs through 2029 to support our current $54 billion capital plan.\nSecond, you heard that we delivered strong financial results in the first quarter, growing earnings substantially compared to last year. Positive regulatory developments have set a strong foundation and are paving the way for a successful 2025. Third, you heard about our remarkable load growth story underpinned by major economic development activities across our footprint, providing significant investment opportunities in our utilities and creating an attractive growth profile for our investors. We highlighted the regulatory progress on retail tariffs that we've made to enable these load additions to result in a fair allocation of cost and protection for our existing customers. Fourth, you heard about our continued focus on the execution of our unprecedented $54 billion capital plan, with the potential for incremental investments of up to $10 billion.\nIn summary, our confidence in achieving our 2025 commitments remain strong, and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share, our long-term growth rate of 6% to 8% and targeted FFO to debt of 14% to 15%. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can take your questions.",

We will take your questions following opening remarks.\nWith that, please turn to Slide 4, and let me hand the call over to Bill.\n\nNicholas K. Akins\n\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Darcy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. Let me start by saying that after 6 months on the job, I continue to get more excited about the very strong and comprehensive AEP value proposition. Our future is extremely bright, and we are committed to delivering on our promises to customers, regulators and investors by putting our robust capital plan to work. We are building a platform of success by focusing on execution and accountability. These are exciting times at AEP, and I see incredible value in this company, which I'm confident we can further unlock by advancing our long-term strategy and providing safe, affordable and reliable service across our large footprint.\nBefore we jump into our results, I'd like to start by introducing our new CFO, Trevor Mihalik, who joined AEP last month and is on the call with me today. Trevor is a proven leader in an industry veteran. He's hit the ground running and is already considered a very strong disciplined and focused member of our senior leadership team. I've made a number of changes over the last 6 months to streamline our leadership structure by eliminating management layers, reorganizing and reducing the size and scope of the Service Corporation and improving procurement processes to drive much higher value from suppliers. The leadership team is coming together to make AEP a premium traded utility that is highly respected and trusted by our many stakeholders.\nLastly, I'd like to take a moment to thank Chuck Zebula for his more than 25 years of dedicated service to AEP. We're grateful for his steady hand during the transition and will continue to benefit from his expertise until his well-earned retirement in March.\nIn my remarks this morning, I will discuss our strategic focus and our results at a high level before passing it over to Trevor to walk through our financials in more detail. Today, we announced fourth quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.24 per share or $660 million, bringing our full year 2024 operating earnings to $5.62 per share. Recall, as part of our commitment of continuing to deliver value to our shareholders, last October, we increased the quarterly dividend from $0.88 to $0.93 per share. In addition, today, we are reaffirming AEP's 2025 operating earnings guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share and affirming our long-term operating earnings growth rate of 6% to 8%, all reinforced by our robust $54 billion capital plan from 2025 through 2029.\nAs we have talked about previously, I'm committed to a strong balance sheet, and I believe it is critical to funding our robust capital plan, we will responsibly finance the great opportunities ahead of us from a position of strength. Trevor will address this further in his remarks. We will also be disciplined around portfolio management. In fact, last month, we announced the Ohio and I&M minority interest transaction on the transmission business with KKR and PSP investments for $2.82 billion. The transaction is highly accretive at 2.3x rate base and valued at 30.3x price to earnings. To put this into another perspective, this is equivalent to issuing AEP common stock at $170 per share.\nMoreover, in the last couple of weeks, we filed for approval with FERC, and we expect to close in the second half of 2025 and at which time we'll still retain 95% of AEP's total transmission assets. The proceeds from this transaction allow us to rotate capital into investments that benefit our customers as we enhance reliability and deliver on growing energy demand. In addition to the minority interest transaction, we also recycled almost $0.5 billion in net cash proceeds in 2024 through the sale of the New Mexico Renewable Development solar portfolio and distributed resources business. We continue to work with federal policymakers, state legislators and regulators across our large service footprint to determine what their goals are, so we can relentlessly deliver on them.\nI would also like to spend some time this morning walking through AEP's future growth opportunities, which are underpinned by 4 major drivers. Large load in our service territories, including data center load that we appreciate having the chance to serve and are aggressively pursuing economic development efforts in our states, investment across the system in our transmission and distribution infrastructure, and new generation. Our capital plan includes customer commitments for 20 gigawatts of incremental load by 2030, driven by data center demand, reshoring and manufacturing and continued economic development. In fact, large load impacts are already being felt in many of AEP's service territories, especially in Ohio, Texas and Indiana.\nAs demonstrated in our fourth quarter results we experienced commercial loan growth of 12.3% over the fourth quarter and 10.6% growth on the full year compared to 2023. One of the reasons we are seeing such growth now that we have an advanced transmission system that can help support current large loads, which is a significant advantage for us versus our peers. As we execute on our $54 billion capital plan to support customer needs, Affordability remains top of mind, and we are committed to fair cost allocation associated with large loans. We proactively filed the data center tariff in Ohio and large low tariff modifications in Indiana, Kentucky and West Virginia and we look forward to commission decisions in Indiana and West Virginia on both states unanimous settlements in the near future.\nThe data center tariff hearing in Ohio concluded last month, and we should have a commission decision by the third quarter of this year. In addition to our efforts to support load growth, our current capital plan contemplates sustained and substantial investments across our distribution infrastructure to better meet our customers' energy needs and improve customer service. Since AEP's distribution system is one of the nation's largest at approximately 225,000 distribution miles. These efforts include work to harden or replace poles, conductors, transformers and other assets as well as deploy automated technologies like AMI meters and Grid smart for enhanced operational performance.\nIn total, we are investing more than $13 billion over the next 5 years in these areas to improve reliability and reduce both frequency and duration of outages by advancing these initiatives as well as an aggressive vegetation management program. We will increase customer satisfaction, strengthen our systems' resilience to weather events and reduce costs for operations and maintenance. Demand for power is growing at a pace not seen over my 44 years in this business. As we discussed last quarter, meeting this demand could require incremental investment of up to $10 billion, driven by additional transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure, not included in our current $54 billion capital plan. For example, in our 3 primary RTOs, we see an opportunity of approximately $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental transmission awards recently approved or expected to be approved in the near term with additional upside on other initiatives.\nThe remainder of the $10 billion of incremental capital upside is in transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure across the business. In addition, as you'll recall, in November, we announced a partnership with Bloom Energy related to fuel cells. Our current capital plan does not include any investment in this custom solution, which will enable our large customers to quickly power their operations while the grid is built out to accommodate further demand. Once the necessary infrastructure is connected to these large customers, they can use the fuel cells as backup generation, further adding resiliency to their operations.\nThis demonstrates our commitment to finding innovative customer solutions that let the empower up much quicker, allowing their business to deliver service to their customers, which will generate profits much sooner than waiting for a grid connection. As a matter of fact, just this week, AEP Ohio filed with the Ohio Commission for approval of the first 2 customer projects using this fuel cell technology totaling 100 megawatts. Not only is AEP working to bring solutions tailored to the current power needs of our states, but we are leading efforts in the industry on the potential that small modular reactors or SMRs, have to meet the growing needs of the future. We're looking to partner with the U.S. Department of Energy to support the early site permit process for 2 potential SMR locations, one in Indiana and the other in Virginia. We are laying the groundwork to find solutions to support large loads and are fortunate for the opportunity to build these SMRs but only with appropriate risk sharing. The tech companies are fast movers and AEP will be there to support them with whatever technology solution they want to deploy, but we need to ensure that we are protected and compensated.\nMoving on to regulatory. Over the last 6 months, I have visited 10 of our 11 states and have been actively engaged with various stakeholders, listening to their preferences as we invest more in resources at the local level. I firmly believe that by delivering for our states and the customers who live there, we can, over time, improve our earned ROEs and increase equity layers as states are more receptive for the need to attract capital. It is an absolute imperative that AEP listened closely to our states and then aggressively deliver on the agreed upon commitments. That's my promise to them. When I look at 2024 in review, our operating companies achieved a number of positive regulatory developments, including received constructive base rate case outcomes in Indiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia, obtained commission approval of the Ohio Electric Security Plan, updated formula rates in Arkansas and Louisiana and filed system resiliency plans in both of our operating companies in Texas.\nAs we discussed on our last call, APCo filed its base case in Wells Virginia, while offering securitization as a concept to help mitigate the proposed base rate increase. Intervenor testimony in this case is set for April with rebuttal testimony following in May and a hearing start in mid-June of this year. We look forward to working with everyone involved in this case to achieve a positive outcome for both our customers and our shareholders.\nShifting now to our generation fleet. We previously filed approval of PSO's Green Country 795-megawatt natural gas facility, SWEPCO's new Hallsville, 450-megawatt natural gas plant as well as WEPCo's well 1,053 megawatt natural gas conversion project. These facilities and RFPs, which are currently in progress at APCo, I&M and DSO, in addition to future integrated resource plan filings over the next couple of years in Arkansas, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Virginia, at West Virginia support our capacity obligations and will go a long way in meeting our customers' energy needs.\nIn summary, we're engaged with key stakeholders on the regulatory front as we keep affordability system reliability, resiliency and security top of mind. I'm excited to start the new year having made meaningful progress, and will continue these important efforts as we advance on our commitment to excellence and deliver on what our states want.\nI'll close by thanking everyone at AEP for their hard work and dedication in 2024. I'm energized as we enter 2025 with a strong team and a more streamlined structure that are significantly driving efficiencies, reducing bureaucracy and creating a much more nimble company that can quickly execute on opportunities. We're also having our employees who have been working from home returned to the office full time by June 1, to put all hands on deck with a renewed focus on execution and accountability that will serve us well as we advance our strategic priorities to enhance value for our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Trevor.\n\nTrevor Ian Mihalik\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Sempra Energy\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone on the call. I want to start today by thanking Bill and the Board for placing their trust in me to help lead this organization into a bright and exciting future. I am honored and grateful for the opportunity to join a dynamic team that is focused on positioning the company for future success, and I'm committed to building on our momentum to create value for all of our stakeholders.\nAs part of my transition, I have reviewed AEP's financial and capital plans, and I have confidence in executing on them with this team. Today, I will walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results for 2024 and expand on Bill's comments related to load growth and discuss what we expect to see in the years ahead. I will finish with commentary on credit metrics, liquidity and portfolio management as well as my focus on disciplined capital allocation.\nPlease turn to Slide 7. This slide shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP Earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.25 per share compared to $0.64 per share in 2023. GAAP earnings for the year were $5.60 per share compared to $4.26 per share in 2023. Detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings are shown in the appendix on Slides 25 and 26.\nNext, I will briefly cover fourth quarter operating results before moving on to a more detailed walk-through of our year-to-date results by segment. Fourth quarter operating earnings came in at $1.24 per share, which was $0.01 improvement versus the prior year. We saw $0.22 of incremental rate changes across multiple jurisdictions along with higher normalized retail sales at both the vertically integrated and transmission and distribution segments. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers were higher O&M and lower margins at the Generation & Marketing segment. For reference, the full details of our fourth quarter results are shown on Slide 22.\nMoving on to Slide 8. Let's have a look at our year-to-date results. Operating earnings for 2024 totaled $5.62 per share compared to $5.25 per share in 2023. This was an increase of $0.37 per share or about 7% year-over-year, adding to AEP's long track record of delivering on its financial commitments for investors. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.63 per share, up $0.16 from a year earlier. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions notable outcomes in Virginia and Indiana and a return to relatively normal weather in 2024 compared to the mild weather experienced in 2023. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation and higher O&M as we made investments to serve our customers.\nThe Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $1.51 per share, up $0.21 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included increased rates in Texas and Ohio, increased transmission revenue, a favorable year-over-year change in weather and higher normalized retail sales. Partially offsetting these items were increased property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and O&M. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.51 per share up $0.08 from last year. Our continued investment in transmission assets as the new loads are added to our system was the main driver in this segment.\nGeneration and Marketing produced $0.48 per share down $0.11 from last year. The reduced contribution from this segment was primarily driven by the sale of our universal scale assets in the third quarter of 2023, higher income taxes and lower retail energy margins. These items were partially offset by lower interest expense and higher wholesale margins. Finally, Corporate and Other saw a benefit of $0.03 per share, driven by lower income taxes and O&M which are partially offset by higher net interest expense.\nAs Bill mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range for 2025 of $5.75 to $5.95 per share. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall bridging our actual 2024 results to the midpoint of our guidance for 2025 on Slide 20. While some variances changed due to the 2024 actual results, there is no change to our 2025 segment or overall guidance.\nTurning to Slide 9. You can see more evidence of just how important load growth is to our financial story. Weather-normalized sales grew 3% in 2024, and we expect that to nearly triple in the years ahead. These are exciting times in the utility industry as we incorporate this tremendous growth. As Bill mentioned, the load growth that I'm going to talk about is providing the opportunity to potentially add up to $10 billion of incremental capital over the next 5 years to our already sizable $54 billion plan. We are continuing to evaluate the magnitude and timing of this spend to meet the growth opportunities across our footprint. The gains we are seeing from the data centers and industrial customers represent a once-in-a-generational opportunity to shape and grow the system.\nSo before I jump into the details, I want to emphasize a few key points about our confidence in the projections you see here. First, this isn't just a future story. This is a now story. We're already seeing these loads come online across our system. In December of 2024, we added almost 450 megawatts of hyperscale data center load in Ohio alone. Second, the load additions built into the forecast you see here are all backed by signed customer financial obligations, demonstrating their commitment to bring these projects online. In fact, nearly all of these loads are backed by take-or-pay contracts and have already been accepted by certain RTOs, including PJM. This means that our customers are committed to pay for a minimum amount of power over a period of time. What's more, we've achieved tariff settlements in Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia to strengthen and lengthen those commitments even further. Beyond those contracts, we have substantial interconnection queues waiting to sign additional commitments as well.\nDiving a little further into the details, you can see where the bulk of our growth is concentrated. New data centers drove double-digit growth in our commercial sales in 2024, and with system-wide data processing load hitting a new high in December of 1.3 million megawatt hours. The gains are expanding beyond the transmission and distribution utilities into our higher vertically integrated segment. Recently, we also connected the first of several hyperscale data center customers in Indiana, including AWS and Google. Across the entire system, we're contracted to see nearly 5 gigawatts of data processing load come online in 2025, representing almost a $0.25 increase from 2024.\nBeyond commercial load, our industrial sales are also set to accelerate after a resilient 2024. AEP's industrial load grew by more than [ 402,000-megawatt ] hours last year. This was punctuated by growth of almost 5% in Texas, highlighting the diversity of our service territory and giving us a lot of confidence going into the new year. We expect industrial sales growth to more than double in 2025 as several new large customers are contracted to come on to the system, like Cheniere in Texas. We also have several other large and well-publicized industrial projects set to come online in '26 and '27. More detailed load projections by class can be found on Slide 13.\nAs a reminder, we have more than 20 gigawatts of commercial and industrial load additions contracted to come on to our system through the end of the decade. Roughly half of those are in ERCOT and the other half are spread across our PJM companies. As a result, we expect these quarterly sales numbers to continue their rapid growth for several years to come.\nLet's move on to Slide 10 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity. Our financial performance and strong balance sheet provided good credit metrics for the last 12 months. Our debt to capitalization remained largely consistent with our historical range. Our FFO to debt metrics stood at 14% for the 12 months ended December 31, which was within our target range and well above our downgrade threshold of 13%. Available liquidity remained very strong at $4.6 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities. Our strong balance sheet and credit metric results coupled with ample liquidity and the outcome of the minority interest transaction expected to close in the second half of this year have enhanced our financial flexibility.\nWe can efficiently access the capital markets to support the capital needs in front of us. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and credit metrics as we evaluate the upcoming capital spend opportunities and match them with optimal financing instruments. On a similar note, last week, I spoke directly with all 3 rating agencies and conveyed this leadership team's commitment to a strong balance sheet focused on executing the regulatory and financing plans as well as disciplined allocation of O&M and capital to our companies.\nFinally, let's move on to Slide 11. Before we take your questions, I wanted to summarize what you heard from us today. First, you heard we had a strong year-over-year performance in 2024, growing our earnings roughly 7% with operating earnings coming in at $5.62 per share, we reinforced our commitments to stakeholders and built solid momentum heading into 2025. Second, you heard that we are absolutely focused on execution in 2025 to support one of the great load growth stories in our industry. We're executing on strategic investments and delivering on our regulatory strategy. giving us confidence in our financing plans.\nThird, you heard we have $10 billion of incremental growth capital that we are currently evaluating. And fourth, you heard that the $2.82 billion pending minority interest transaction on the transmission assets is an exceptional value proposition to our shareholders. The transaction further boosts our earnings and credit profiles and helps to reduce near-term equity needs.\nRecall that the value we transacted on this is comparable to issuing equity at $170 per share, and we're still retaining 95% of AEP's total transmission asset post close. These components are key to our future success and reinforce our confidence in reaffirming our commitments, including our 2025 guidance range of $5.75 to $5.95 per share, our long-term growth rate of 6% to 8% while targeting FFO to debt of 14% to 15%.\nWe really appreciate your time and attention today. I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can answer any of your questions that you may have. Thank you.",

My name is JL, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, JL. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks.\nI will now turn the call over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Shortly, Peggy will provide a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will review our financial results in more detail. A summary of our second quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. .\nBefore I dive into our results, I'd like to start by welcoming Bill Fehrman to AEP as our new President and CEO effective August 1. The -- Bill brings decades of utility operational leadership experience and in-depth knowledge of the energy industry, most recently serving as President and CEO of Century Holdings; and prior to that, President and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. With Bill's expertise and diverse background, you can anticipate a smooth transition and continuity of strategic direction, expect more focus on execution and Bill has the background to do just that, including capturing growth, listening and responding to our regulators and investors and using innovation to mitigate inflationary pressures.\nWhile I will be serving a senior adviser for several months to ensure a smooth transition, it's been an honor to lead AEP as Interim President and CEO, and I'm proud of what the team has accomplished so far this year.\nNow turning to AEP's financial results. Today, we announced second quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.25 per share, a 12% increase over 1 year ago. Our operational execution through the first half of the year, combined with our efforts to efficiently manage the business have put us well on track to achieve our targets. Today, we reaffirm our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73 and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%.\nThe -- regarding data center load, we have commitments from customers for more than 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of this decade, mostly driven by large load opportunities. To put this in perspective, AEP's system-wide peak load at the end of last year was 35 gigawatts. We continue to work with data center customers to meet their increased demand, while ensuring contracts and new initiatives are fair and beneficial for all of our customers.\nIn the fall, we will provide an update on what this large load opportunity means for our capital spend, including generation and transmission investment and on our plan to responsibly finance this growth initiative. While we certainly encourage innovation when it comes to meeting the energy needs of our customers, data centers included, I want to emphasize that it's critically important that costs associated with these large loads are allocated fairly and the right investments are made for the long-term success of our grid.\nFor this reason, we filed new data center tariffs in Ohio and large load tariff modifications in Indiana and West Virginia. And it's the reason why we filed a complaint with FERC related to a co-located load agreement. We will know soon what FERC decides, but this is the rationale we use. Given the co-located load agreement is an active case before FERC, I don't plan on making any further comments.\nI'd also like to note that large load impacts are already being felt here in AEP's service territories, primarily Ohio and Texas as our commercial load grew an impressive 12.4% over the second quarter of last year. Looking ahead, we expect the incremental load, I just mentioned, to move forward in these states and others including Indiana.\nMoving to another example of capital opportunities. PSO announced an agreement at the end of June to purchase a 795-megawatt natural gas generation facility conditioned on regulatory approval. The facility known as Green Country, is located in Jenks, Oklahoma, and will ensure PSO customers continue to benefit from reliable and affordable resources. For this resource adequacy driven capital, PSO plans to seek regulatory approval this fall, at which time the economics of this acquisition will be made public.\nAs you know, maintaining a strong balance sheet is critical to fund increased capital spend to support our growth initiatives. We will sensibly finance our capital needs, and we're open to incremental growth equity and equity-like tools in addition to portfolio optimization. On a similar portfolio of note, the sale of AEP OnSite Partners remains on track to close in the third quarter following FERC approval.\nNow let's move on to the Federal EPA's Coal Combustion Residual rule, or CCR, which was finalized in the second quarter and expanded the scope of the rule to include inactive impoundments at existing and inactive facilities. We continue to evaluate the applicability of the rule to current and former plant sites and have developed preliminary estimates of compliance cost.\nWhile we are working with others and looking at potential legal challenges to the revised rules, as appropriate, we do plan to see cost recovery through new and/or existing regulatory mechanisms. Chuck will have more information on this shortly.\nBefore I turn it over to Peggy for additional updates, I'd like to thank all of you for your support to my time as AEP's Interim CEO. It's been a privileged to serve AEP over the past 5 months and the Board and I are confident that Bill is the right person to build on the momentum underway and to lead AEP into its next chapter.\nOn a related note, we are planning an informal meet and greet in New York City soon, so analysts and investors can say hello to Bill in person. We are targeting something in August, so stay tuned for more information coming your way in the next couple of days. Finally, I'm excited about what the future holds for AEP as we execute on our strategic priorities and enhance value for all of our stakeholders. Peggy?\n\nPeggy I. Simmons\n\nExecutive Vice President of Utilities\n\nThanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's turn to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are engaged in our regulatory and legislative areas, continuing to strengthen relationships, including implementation of our investment in more people and resources at the local level. And as the utility industry is changing, now more than ever, AEP's operating company leaders are staying increasingly engaged with regulators amidst the dynamic environment.\nCustomer bills and affordability remain top of mind for AEP in addition to system reliability and resiliency. We are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate, which includes economic development, work across our service territory to bring jobs and create bill headroom from a larger load perspective and to ultimately achieve the regulatory outcomes that are good for AEP's customers, communities, investors and employees.\nWe continue to work through regulatory items with a focus on our authorized versus earned ROE gap, which remained flat at 8.9% for the past 12 months as of second quarter 2024.\nTurning to some positive rate case development. Let's start with I&M. I'm pleased to report that in May, we received an order in Indiana approving all key items in our settlement, including an improved 9.85% ROE. In June, we received a constructive order in Michigan, maintaining our existing 9.86% ROE with new rates taking effect in mid-July.\nJust last week for AEP Texas, parties filed a unanimous and unopposed comprehensive settlement with the ALJ, increasing our authorized ROE to 9.76% with rates effective in early October pending commission approval.\nAs you know, earlier this year, we filed an APCo biennial rate review in Virginia and a base rate case for PSO in Oklahoma where we received intervenor testimony in the PSO case last evening. We're at the beginning of the procedural schedules in both cases and expect commission orders in the fourth quarter. We look forward to sharing updates on our progress in the coming months.\nRelative to future cases, APCo plans to file a base rate case in West Virginia in the next week. While we have many tractors in place to help mitigate regulatory lag, we have not had a rate case here in a few years and look forward to working with the parties to achieve a balanced and fair result.\nLooking ahead, I am proud of the progress we continue to make on the regulatory front, and I remain excited about advancing our regulatory strategies in 2024 and beyond.\nLet's discuss AEP's recent fleet transformation activities and the progress we made on that important initiative. In May, APCo issued requests for proposals for 800 megawatts of wind or solar owned resources with regulatory filings anticipated in 2025. Finally, as Ben mentioned, PSO signed an agreement in June to purchase Green Country's 795-megawatt natural gas generation facility to help ensure resource adequacy. The agreement is conditioned on regulatory approval, and we plan to make the related filings with the Oklahoma Commission in the fall. This is an example of a proactive approach by the team in meeting ever-increasing resource needs, and we're enthusiastic about the opportunity as we advance our fleet transformation.\nTo wrap up, I'd like to thank Ben for his leadership and welcome Bill to the AEP team. This is an exciting time here at AEP. And when I think about the future, I'm motivated by the opportunities we have ahead of us, embracing large loads, advancing our regulatory strategy and driving overall long-term success.\nI'll now turn things over to Chuck, who is going to walk through second quarter 2024 performance drivers and details supporting our financial results. Chuck?\n\nCharles E. Zebula\n\nExecutive Vice President-Energy Supply, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our second quarter results. Slide 7 shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter, and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $1.01 per share in 2023. We -- year-to-date GAAP earnings are $2.55 per share for this year versus $1.78 per share last year. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings for the second quarter and year-to-date results on Pages 13 and 14, respectively.\nLet's briefly highlight a few of the nonoperating items for the quarter that mostly make up the difference between GAAP and operating earnings. First, as disclosed in an 8-K in May, an after-tax provision of $126 million for customer refunds was recorded based on recent developments in the reman proceeding related to the cost cap associated with the Turk plan that has been debated over the last decade.\nSecondly, we incurred a $94 million expense associated with the voluntary severance program that we completed in the second quarter.\nAnd finally, as Ben mentioned, the final revised EPA CCR rule became effective in May. We recorded a $111 million accrual for compliance costs largely related to our Ohio properties where generation is deregulated. We also updated our asset retirement obligations for sites in our regulated entities where we intend to seek cost recovery.\nLet's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.25 per share or $662 million, compared to $1.13 per share or $582 million in 2023. This results in an increase of $80 million or $0.12 per share, which is a 10.6% increase over last year.\nOperating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.46 per share, down $0.05. And -- Positive drivers included favorable year-over-year weather and rate changes across multiple jurisdictions with a 2022 PSO base case and the 2023 Virginia proceeding being the most significant. These items were offset by higher income taxes, which are largely a reversal of favorable income taxes in the first quarter, lower normalized retail sales and higher depreciation.\nNote the year-to-date results in this segment consolidate the income tax loss that is shown in this quarter, resulting in an immaterial year-to-date income tax variance versus last year. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.41 per share, up $0.11 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included favorable weather, increased transmission revenue, rate changes primarily from the distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and higher normalized retail sales. These items were partially offset by increased property taxes and depreciation.\nThe AEP Transmission holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share up $0.01 compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.12 per share, down $0.01 from last year. Recall that AEP Renewables was sold in the third quarter last year, which has 2 impacts: a negative earnings variance due to the business being sold and removal of the interest cost for financing these assets. Additional drivers were lower retail margins, offset by higher generation margins and lower taxes.\nFinally, Corporate and Other was up $0.06 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower income taxes and increased other operating income related to timing in the prior year. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income from the G&M segment.\nLet's turn to Slide 9, which shows the weather-normalized retail sales up 4% in the quarter from a year ago, headlined by a double-digit 12.4% increase in commercial sales, which is where our data processing customers are classified. I'll note that in our T&D segment, the increase in commercial load was over 20% for the quarter. This is a trend that will continue over the coming years based on already signed customer commitments.\nOur operating footprint and robust transition system position us perfectly to grow along AI and other technologies and industries in need of access to affordable and reliable power. Through the remainder of this year, data processing gains will remain mostly concentrated in Ohio and Texas. But beyond this year, we are seeing strong commitments from new customers looking to connect at some of our vertically integrated companies as well.\nOutside of data processors, our industrial sales have remained resilient in the face of a slowing economy. Industrial sales were strongest in Texas, driven by an influx of new customers mainly in the energy industry. Thanks to our success over the past few years on the economic development front, we expect to see our industrial sales continue to be resilient in the next few years, as several new large customers in steel, energy, renewable energy and semiconductors come online across our footprint.\nIn the residential segment, we continue to see growth in customer count and load in Texas, but residential load remains weak in most of our territories, likely due to the cumulative effects of inflation. Bottom line, the amount of demand from new large loads we're seeing across our system is unprecedented. We are excited, challenged and poised to embrace this opportunity.\nLet's move on to Slide 10. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 14.6% for the 12 months ended June 30, the -- which is a 40 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Our debt to cap decreased slightly from last quarter and was 62.6% at quarter end. We took credit supportive financing actions in the second quarter by issuing $400 million of equity under our at-the-market program, and by issuing $1 billion in junior subordinated notes at the parent, which qualified for 50% equity credit at all 3 rating agencies.\nIn the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $5.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status is near 99%.\nIn summary, our second quarter results provide additional momentum this year bringing year-to-date earnings up to $2.52 per share, an increase of $0.28 or 12.5% compared to the same period last year. We reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73 and remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And -- and as we move through the balance of the year, our focus is on providing reliable and affordable service to our customers, executing our plan and embracing the growth opportunities that we have ahead of us.\nAlso, a quick update on the sale of AEP OnSite Partners. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter and result in approximately $315 million in net proceeds to the company. I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the skilled leadership of Ben Fowke during this time of transition at AEP. Ben told you that this company would not be in neutral during the transition. And I can say that, that is absolutely true. Ben, well, I know you'll still be engaged as an adviser and Board role going forward, I want you to know that the AEP team appreciates your engagement and contributions over the past 5 months.\nFinally, the AEP team looks forward to the arrival of our new CEO and President, Bill Fehrman. We all look forward to build, bringing his accomplished leadership to AEP and working with him as we take on the exciting opportunities that we have before us. Thank you for your interest in American Electric Power.\nOperator, can you open the call so we can address your questions.",

My name is Abby, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Abbie. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks.\nI will now turn the call over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin Gwynn Stonestreet Fowke\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nWell, good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Shortly, Peggy will give a regulatory update, followed by Chuck, who will provide more detailed financial review.\nThe sum of our first quarter 2024 business highlights can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. Beginning with AEP's financial results, today, we announced first quarter 2024 operating earnings of $1.27 per share, a $0.16 increase over 1 year ago. We were also reaffirming AEP's 2024 full year operating earnings guidance of $5.53 to $5.73. And the long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%.\nI'm pleased to note, we achieved a 14.2% FFO to debt during this quarter, which is within our stated range. Let me assure you that AEP's direction and strategy remain on track as this team is fully engaged, energized and working well together to enhance the customer experience and investor value. I've reviewed AEP's financial targets, and I have total confidence in the plan's achievability.\nIt's hard to believe it's been just 2 months, since I stepped into the role of interim CEO, and it has been a busy and productive 60 days. I've had the opportunity to meet with many different stakeholders, including elected officials, regulators, community leaders, customers, investors and, of course, the team right here at AEP. All of these meetings have been very useful in helping shape the initiatives I will discuss shortly.\nBefore I dive into other business, I want to give you a brief update on the search for a permanent CEO. The process is well underway, and I am certain based on the talent pool that we're looking at that we will find the right person to lead AEP. As I mentioned, when we first talked at the end of February, the search will probably take between 6 to 12 months. We will take the time necessary to find the best candidate, and we're committed to keeping you informed.\nSo across the AEP system, I see the need to increase capital spend in the future, including incremental investment related to commercial loan growth from data centers and resiliency spend. Specific to low growth, the amount of service request is truly staggering and ranges between 10 to 15 gigawatts of incremental load by the end of the decade, in addition to many, many more gigawatts from hundreds of inquiries.\nThe key to capturing this commercial, industrial growth is to work with parties to make sure that commitments are real and secure the tariffs and contracts are fair to all customers and growth is self-funded. And of course, that the load can be met. A couple of great examples of new commercial commitments can be evidenced by last week's announcements from both Amazon Web Services and Google to build large data centers in I&M's Northern Indiana service territory.\nAt AEP, we have the largest transmission system in the United States with a high-voltage backbone in the Midwest. We expect more transmission investment possibilities driven by this data center growth, specifically in substations and customer connections. As a side note, I'd like to call attention to AEP's commercial load in the first quarter of 2024 and which grew at 10.5% over the first quarter of last year.\nIn addition, we will file our system resiliency plan in Texas, no later than the third quarter of this year, related to legislation passed in 2023, including investment related to hardening and modernizing the grid, expanding vegetation management and, of course, wildfire mitigation.\nClearly, a strong balance sheet is critical as we look to fund potential increased capital spend. And I believe incremental growth equity needed to fund smart capital is a positive thing.\nThat said, we are open to equity alternatives through portfolio optimization, looking at opportunities where price meets execution, while at the same time, staying focused on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes. On a similar note, I'd now like to provide a brief update on the sales of our AEP Energy Retail and AEP On-site Distributed Resources businesses, both of which are included in the Generation and Marketing segment.\nWe are working through final phases of the process and expect to conclude that process by our second quarter earnings call. Now let's move on to last week's newly published federal EPA rules on greenhouse gas standards, coal combustion residuals or CCR, Effluent Limitation Guidelines or ELG.\nAlthough our team is still reviewing the rules, we will likely pursue legal challenges, while working with others, including our states who are aligned with AEP's commitment to provide customers with reliable and affordable energy. These new regulations in some cases, require the use of unproven technologies are extremely expensive and established unreasonable compliance schedules.\nWe are at a time, when our nation needs to add dispatchable generation to support grid reliability and growth, and these rules have the potential to not only prematurely accelerate plant closures, but also discourage new dispatchable generation from being built.\nNow turning to Labor Management. We announced a voluntary severance program earlier this month, taking effect July 1. We expect this initiative will save labor cost of approximately $100 million and will assist us in managing our cost to better serve our customers, allow us to redeploy resources locally in our regulated footprint and finally, mitigate impacts from inflationary pressures and interest rates.\nOf course, we will do it so in a way that is fair and equitable to all of our valued employees. So as I mentioned, it's been a busy and productive couple of months, have confidence in our strategy and team. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead to drive growth and create value for our investors. We look forward to providing you even more positive updates as we move forward in the year further solidifying stakeholder confidence in our financial targets.\nBefore we turn to Peggy for additional updates, now that I am aware of AEP's regulatory successes and some of our challenges. We continue to review plans to strengthen our regulatory compacts as we work through the past and are ready for the future. Peggy?\n\nPeggy I. Simmons\n\nExecutive Vice President of Utilities\n\nThanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now let's go to an update on several of AEP's ongoing regulatory initiatives. We are currently focused on investing more in people resources at the local level, particularly in regulatory and legislative areas.\nThe utility industry is changing and more now than ever, it's critical that we enhance our engagement in this dynamic environment. More details of our related regulatory activity can be found in the appendix beginning on Slide 23. AEP's operating company leaders are running the business and engaged with our state regulators. Higher costs for materials and frequency of cases shines a spotlight on affordability and customer builds are top of mind for us.\nWe are focused on advancing interest in each of the states we operate to achieve outcomes that are good for our customers, our communities and our investors. This includes economic development work across our service territory, which brings jobs and creates headroom from larger load perspectives.\nWe continue to reduce our authorized versus actual ROE gap. We're doing the work and our ROE improved slightly this quarter to 8.9%. Even considering this measure is depressed by approximately 30 basis points from mild weather conditions. Staying with the recent positive developments, I'm pleased to report AEP Ohio's Electric Security Plan 5 settlement obtained last summer -- excuse me, last September was approved by the commission earlier this month.\nThis ESP covers a 4-year term of June 2024 through May 2028. As we shared previously, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the latter half of 2023. In Indiana, we reached settlement, which was filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year.\nIn Michigan, we completed the procedural schedule and expect a relief in that case in July. The team has been busy in 2024 so far, filing an Oklahoma base case for PSO in January and an AEP Texas case in February. Last month, we filed the APCo Virginia biennial rate review, required by statute from legislative changes attained in 2023.\nEarlier this month, in SWEPCO, Arkansas and Louisiana jurisdictions we filed the annual formula rate plan. Now on to the regulated resource additions. We continue to advance our 5-year, $9.4 billion regulated renewable capital plan and have a total of $6.6 billion approved by state commissions at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. As you can see, we're making great progress. We are also considering the renewables market local input, as well as evolving reserve margins and resource adequacy as we meet the needs of our customers.\nWe are advancing toward our fleet transformation targets, which are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M, Kentucky Power, PSO and SWEPCO with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo.\nThese generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets. Looking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers and details supporting our financials.\n\nCharles E. Zebula\n\nExecutive Vice President-Energy Supply, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Peggy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our financial results for the first quarter, build on Ben's comments about our service territory load and finish with commentary on our financial metrics and portfolio management activities.\nLet's go to Slide 7, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter, were $1.91 per share compared to $0.77 per share last year. There is a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 13 of the presentation today.\nOne significant item I want to highlight in our GAAP to operating earnings walk is the onetime positive adjustment of $260 million, primarily for the remeasurement of a regulatory liability for excess deferred taxes, due to guidance recently received from the IRS, related to the stand-alone treatment of taxes for ratemaking purposes.\nLet's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 8. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.27 per share were $670 million, compared to $1.11 per share or $572 million in 2023. This results in a quarter-over-quarter increase of $98 million or $0.16 per share.\nOperating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.57 per share, up $0.05. Positive drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions with the PSO base case and the Virginia proceeding being the most significant favorable year-over-year changes in weather and income taxes. These items were partially offset by higher interest, higher depreciation and other taxes.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.29 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year. Positive drivers in this segment included rate changes, primarily from the Distribution cost recovery factor in Texas, and the distribution investment rider in Ohio, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load and favorable year-over-year changes in weather. These items were partially offset by higher depreciation, other taxes and interest.\nPlease note that although weather was a positive variance quarter-over-quarter, in both the Vertically Integrated and T&D segments. Weather for the first quarter 2024 was very mild. Compared to normal weather, our estimate of the variance is roughly $80 million unfavorable, which is about $0.12 per share.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.40 per share, up $0.05 compared to last year, primarily driven by investment growth and favorable income taxes. Generation and Marketing produced $0.12 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Positive drivers included higher generation and retail margins, along with favorable interest expense. These items were partially offset by lower wholesale margins higher income taxes and lower distributed and renewable generation results compared to the prior year, largely due to the sale of the universal scale assets in the third quarter of 2023.\nFinally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 compared to the prior year, primarily driven by higher interest costs. Moving to Slide 9. Overall Retail Load continues to accelerate ahead of expectations. This is due to our ongoing success in economic development, as well as the rapidly increasing demand from the many data centers finding a home within our footprint.\nWeather normalized Retail Load grew 2.9% in the first quarter, highlighted by a remarkable 10.5% increase in our commercial load, which is where the data center load is classified. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the growth of AI and other technologies boost the need for additional data storage and processing. Driving the demand our existing and new projects that have ramped up more quickly than first anticipated, especially with some of our largest customers in Ohio and Texas.\nAs we refine our forecast for the remainder of this year and next, expect that those projections to move higher to reflect the rapidly evolving situation, as Ben had outlined in his comments. Outside of data centers, our economic development efforts are also helping us maintain growth in industrial load despite softness in manufacturing activity nationally. Industrial load grew 0.4% in the first quarter, roughly in line with expectations for the full year. This was driven primarily by increased activity amongst our plastics, tire and paper manufacturing customers.\nWe are keeping a close eye on our industrial customers, given the higher interest rates for longer environment. However, the number of large new loads anticipated to come online in the next 2 years, provides us with confidence that demand will remain steady in the face of any economic challenges for our existing customers.\nThe main takeaway on load, however, is the significant growth in large customers that we continue to bring online across our footprint. As I mentioned earlier, beyond the lookout for higher load projections, as we provide additional guidance later this year.\nLet's move on to Slide 10 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric, stands at 14.2% for the 12 months ended March 31, which is a 100 basis point increase from year-end and in alignment with what I discussed on the last 2 earnings calls.\nOur debt to cap decreased slightly from year-end and was at 62.8% at quarter end. In the lower left part of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary. Which remains strong at $3.4 billion and is supported by $6 billion in credit facilities that were recently renewed and upsized by $1 billion to support our liquidity.\nLastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status has remained relatively flat, since the end of the year and ended the first quarter at 100.6%. Let's go to Slide 11 for a wrap up of today's message. The first quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of the year with a $0.16 increase in earnings per share, compared to the first quarter of last year despite the mild weather conditions that we experienced this winter.\nWe remain focused on achieving our objective, which include improving the financial performance of our utilities, offsetting cost increases due to inflation to keep electricity affordable and embracing the opportunity to bring economic development to our communities by serving large loads.\nAs an update, we successfully closed on the sale of our New Mexico solar assets for $107 million in cash proceeds in February, and we continue to work through the final phases of the AEP Energy and AEP OnSite Partners process. We expect to announce the results of the process by our second quarter earnings call.\nOur first quarter results give us the confidence to reaffirm our operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73 per share. We remain committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and FFO to debt solidly in the 14% to 15% range. We appreciate your investment and interest in American Electric Power.\nOperator, can you open the call so we can address your questions?",

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese, vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Ben Fowke, our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; Chuck Zebula, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Peggy Simmons, our Executive Vice President of Utilities. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Ben.\n\nBenjamin Fowke\n\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, thank you, Darcy, and good morning, and welcome to American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. It's great to have a chance to reconnect with you, although I never thought it would be under these circumstances. As you know, the AEP Board of Directors made a decision to remove Julie Sloat from her duties as Chair, President and CEO. Taking this action was not easy, but the Board.\n[Audio gap]\neveryone that Julie's departure was not due to any unethical behavior, disagreements of financial policy or because of any violation of AEP's code of conduct.\nNow as many of you are aware, after my retirement from Xcel Energy, I joined the AEP Board in February of 2022. I was attracted to this Board because I was impressed with AEP's business model, its strong asset base and the quality of its leadership team and Board. I'm even more impressed 2 years later. In my tenure here, I've seen the AEP team rise to meet multiple challenges.\nLet me give you some examples, starting with earnings. For 14 years in a row, AEP has met or exceeded earnings guidance, and 2023 is no exception. Our operating earnings came in at $5.25. That's within our guidance range despite $0.37 of unfavorable weather and $0.45 of increased interest cost over the prior year.\nNow as you know, controlling O&M expense has been a challenge for the industry. And AEP has met that challenge, essentially keeping O&M flat for the last 10 years, while at the same time doubling its asset base. This team's continuous focus on O&M efficiency is nothing short of excellent. You may also recall that in early 2023, the Texas Commission denied a petition to be part of SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables project for $2.2 billion. But the team didn't miss a beat and put the project back on track with Arkansas and Louisiana ultimately stepping up to move forward with the full project. As a result, and including SWEPCO, today, we have commission approval of $6.6 billion of new renewable projects throughout AEP's service territory, representing a 70% achievement of our current 5-year $9.4 billion new generation capital plan. And I hope you would agree with me that that is really solid execution.\nInitiatives to simplify and derisk our portfolio are squarely the focus of the Board and the management team, and we are pleased with the great progress made. Last year, we completed the sale of our unregulated renewables portfolio, bringing in $1.2 billion of cash proceeds. We should be closing on our New Mexico Renewable Development solar portfolio within the next day or 2. This, in combination with the expected conclusion of our retail and distributed resources sales process in the second quarter, keeps us on schedule to achieve our 2024 asset sales targets.\nAs we move forward, AEP will continue to be a disciplined portfolio manager, and we will be willing to take action when price and the ability to execute intersect. To that end, we've made the decision to retain our ownership interest in both our Prairie Wind and Pioneer transmission joint ventures. We also completed the review of [ Transource ] and ultimately determined that owning this joint venture fits strategically within our portfolio. We like our remaining assets, and we'll focus going forward on doubling down on our efforts to achieve constructive regulatory outcomes that will allow us to provide the quality of service our customers need and expect.\nRegarding [ Icahn Capital ], our recent agreement came about from a culmination of a constructive dialogue between AEP and the Icahn teams. Like us, the Icahn team believes AEP shares are undervalued, and there's meaningful upside potential for our investors. The addition to AEP's Board will bring fresh perspective as we continue to execute on strategic priorities and enhance value for our stakeholders.\nLooking ahead, today, we are reaffirming our 2024 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.53 to $5.73 as well as our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%, which is underpinned by a $43 billion 5-year capital plan in addition to 14% to 15% FFO to debt target, which Chuck will expand upon shortly. You should know that I am committed to my role as Interim President and CEO, and I believe I can add value while the Board works to identify a permanent successor. So before I turn it over to Peggy for regulatory updates and Chuck for a financial review, let me also acknowledge that 2023 has been at times, a challenging year at AEP. There's certainly been some twists and turns and a few bumps in the road. But I would encourage all of you to focus on the key opportunities that lie ahead. I have tremendous confidence in our team's ability to achieve our objectives as we work every day to deliver safe, reliable and affordable energies to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Peggy.\n\nPeggy I. Simmons\n\nExecutive Vice President of Utilities\n\nThanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Now I'd like to turn to updates on our ongoing regulatory and legislative efforts. While we made important regulatory progress in 2023, it is clear that we can do even more to facilitate successful and constructive outcomes. Details of related activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 29 through 31.\nClosing the authorized versus earned ROE gap is a key area of focus for us. Our fourth quarter ROE came in at 8.8%, a slight improvement over the third quarter. This also reflects\n[Audio gap]\nour efforts to improve and bridge the ROE gap is supported by work we've done related to the recent passage of legislation that will help position us to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs and reducing regulatory lag. Most importantly, we obtained securitization in Kentucky, a biannual distribution cost recovery factor, or DCRF in Texas, and rate reviews every 2 years in Virginia.\nOn the regulatory front, we secured several important wins over the course of 2023, including achieving constructive base rate case outcomes in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Virginia, reestablishing formula rate plans in Arkansas and Louisiana and reaching a settlement in our Ohio ESP 5 filing, on which we're awaiting a commission order. Overall, in 2023, we secured $312 million in rate relief.\nWe also filed new base cases in Indiana, Michigan and Kentucky in 2023. In Indiana, we have already reached a settlement, which we filed in December, and we expect the commission decision by June of this year. In Michigan, we continue to advance through the process and currently expect a ruling in the case in July. In Kentucky, the base case and securitization application was approved by the commission earlier this year. Other upcoming cases include a new Oklahoma base rate case for PSO, which we filed last month. Additional filings in the first quarter will include an AEP Texas base rate case and the APCo Virginia biennial rate review that should have the benefits of legislative changes attained in 2023.\nWhile we reached many constructive outcomes in 2023, we are disappointed in a couple disallowances recently received. First, in Texas, the commission issued a decision disallowing capitalization of AFUDC related to our [ Tork ] plant in mid-December 2023. And we filed a motion for reconsideration a week later. In West Virginia, last month, the commission disallowed a portion of our March 2021 to February 2023 under recovered fuel, and we recently filed an appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court on February 8. We are also disappointed with the FERC order we received in January 2024 related to treatment of accumulated deferred income taxes associated with net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLC, mostly affecting our Transmission Holdco segment. We just filed for rehearing on February 20. Shortly, Chuck will discuss the related unfavorable net financial impact to 2023 operating earnings.\nLooking ahead, we know there is more work to be done as we advance our regulatory strategies in 2024 to achieve a forecasted regulated ROE of 9.1%. We are well on our way this year with almost 70% of rate relief either secured or related to mechanisms that are more administrative in nature. We look forward to continuing to engage constructively with our regulators and strengthening relationships at all levels.\nAs Ben mentioned, this year, AEP continued to advance our 5-year $9.4 billion regulated renewables capital plan and now have a total of $6.6 billion approved by various state commissions. More detail of resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34. As previously disclosed, we received approval for APCo's 143 megawatts of wind generation, totaling more than $400 million of investment. This is in addition to the previously approved 209 megawatts of solar and wind projects for approximately $500 million.\nIn 2023, we also received commission approval in both Indiana and Michigan for I&M 469 megawatts of solar projects, representing $1 billion of investment, PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewables portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables for $2.2 billion. Our fleet transformation goals are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plan. We have pending requests for proposals for a diverse set of additional generation resources at I&M in Kentucky, PSO and SWEPCO, with more to come from other operating companies, including APCo. These generation investments are an integral part of our broader capital program, which is 100% focused on regulated assets and the production tax credits that are generated from our renewable energy projects, our [ path along to ] and provide great value to our customers.\nIn addition to these projects, AEP is advancing an additional $27 billion in investments in our transmission and distribution systems to support reliability and resiliency. These combined investments underpin our 6% to 7% EPS growth commitment while mitigating customer bill impacts. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck to walk through the performance drivers in details supporting our financial commitments.\n\nCharles E. Zebula\n\nExecutive Vice President-Energy Supply, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThanks, Peggy, and good morning to everyone on the call. I'll walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results for 2023, share some updates on our service territory load, our outlook for this year and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity.\nLet's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.64 per share compared to $0.75 per share in 2022. For the year, GAAP earnings were $4.26 compared to $4.51 in 2022. As we have highlighted throughout 2023, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the gain or loss related to the sale of certain businesses, regulatory outcomes as well as our typical mark-to-market adjustments as nonoperating. Our team is committed to minimizing the variances between GAAP and operating earnings as we go forward. Detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings are shown on Slide 16 and 17 of the presentation today.\nLet's quickly cover the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter earnings came in at $1.23 per share, which was an $0.18 improvement over the same period in 2022. Note that we had $0.25 of favorable O&M and strong performance in our Generation and Marketing segment, partially offset by $0.06 of unfavorable weather, $0.09 of higher interest costs and lower performance in Transmission Holdco. December weather, in particular, was the 28th warmest out of the last 30 years. For reference, the full details of our fourth quarter results are shown on Slide 15 of the presentation.\nLet's have a look at our full year results for 2023 on Slide 10. Operating earnings were $5.25 per share compared to $5.09 per share in 2022. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for Vertically Integrated Utilities were $2.47 per share, down $0.09, mostly due to unfavorable weather, higher interest expense and higher income taxes. These items were partially offset by rate changes across various operating companies, increased transmission revenue, higher normalized retail load, favorable depreciation and lower O&M. Once again, depreciation is favorable at the Vertically Integrated segment, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utility segment earned $1.30 per share, up $0.14 from last year. Positive drivers in this segment included increased transmission revenue, rate changes in Texas and Ohio and lower O&M. Partially offsetting these items were unfavorable weather, higher depreciation and higher interest expense.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.43 per share, up $0.11 from last year. Positive investment growth of $0.09 and favorable income taxes of $0.05 were the main drivers in this segment. As Peggy mentioned, we received the FERC NOLC order in January, resulting in an unfavorable net impact to consolidated earnings of $0.07 per share, with the majority of that impact occurring at the Transmission Holdco. The impact of this order to our 2024 plan is approximately $0.03 per share.\nGeneration and Marketing produced $0.59 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to improved retail and wholesale power margins, the sale of renewable development sites and favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August. These items were partially offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable income taxes.\nFinally, Corporate and Other was down $0.09 per share, driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by a favorable year-over-year change in investment gains, largely due to investment losses that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2022. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2024. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall bridging our actual 2023 results to the midpoint of our guidance this year in Slide 24. While some variances changed due to last year's actual results, there is no change to our segments or overall guidance.\nTurning to Slide 11, I'll provide an update on weather normalized load performance. Overall retail load grew 2.5% in 2023. This was stronger than the 0.7% in our original guidance, thanks to an acceleration in data center growth and our commitment to economic development across our service territory. This is most apparent when looking at the incredible expansion in commercial load, shown in the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide. Commercial sales grew 7.8% for the year, and were again dominated by data centers. We are encouraged that the [ gains ] are becoming more geographically diverse.\nNew projects have come online in Michigan, Kentucky and Oklahoma to supplement the development of what we see in Ohio and Texas. This is a trend we expect to continue over the next several years as the global demand for data storage and processing accelerates through the growth of AI and other technologies. We expect commercial load to continue to grow from its new higher base this year as projects work their way through the queue and commitments for 2025 are exceptionally robust. I believe that some of the 2025 load is going to accelerate and bleed into this year.\nIndustrial sales grew at 1.6%, which you can see in the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide. This is mostly attributable to a number of large industrial loads we've recently added across our service territories, which are more than offsetting any economic challenges seen by our existing customers. We expect industrial load growth to continue to reflect the softness in manufacturing nationally, with only a modest increase this year. However, growth in industrial sales beyond this year should accelerate as borrowing costs moderate and several large loads currently under construction come online.\nIn the upper left-hand corner of the slide, you'll see that residential load declined slightly in 2023. Usage per residential customer has declined for the past 2 years, as homes have become more energy efficient and workers spend more time in an office instead of at home. The negative impact of inflation on household budgets may be influencing usage as well.\nOn a positive note, we've seen our residential customer base grow consistently in certain regions. In 2023, we added almost 31,000 net new residential customers across our footprint, resulting in a positive offset to this segment. Overall, we're optimistic about the positive trends in load over the next several years, especially from a commercial and industrial perspective. Our conservative approach to estimating large loads gives us a lot of confidence in the growth we forecasted. In our next update, however, I would expect to see some upside in this area.\nLet's move on to Slide 12 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. In the top left table, you can see the FFO to debt metric stands at 13.2% for 2023. Positive changes in FFO were as outlined on the third quarter call, and included favorable changes in cash collateral, fuel recovery and other various drivers. These positive changes were somewhat offset by an $830 million increase in debt during the quarter primarily due to the issuance of long-term debt to prefund our March 2024 AEP parent maturity. We are pleased that the team has overcome strong financial headwinds due to unfavorable weather and an unprecedented increase in interest rates to end the year above Moody's downgrade threshold of 13%. We expect our FFO to debt metric to continue to improve throughout 2024 as we progress towards our targeted range of 14% to 15%. This continued positive trend assumes normal weather for 2024 and continued growth in our cash flows through various regulatory activities, including recovery of our deferred fuel balances of approximately $425 million.\nOur debt to cap increased from the prior quarter by 60 basis points to 63%, and our parent debt to total debt is approximately 21.7%. In the lower left quadrant of this slide, you can see our liquidity summary, which remains strong at $3.4 billion, and is supported by our bank revolver and credit facility. Lastly, on the qualified pension front, our funding status remains unchanged from the prior quarter to end the year at just over 100%. While falling interest rates increased the liability during the quarter, this increase was offset by positive asset returns.\nTurning to Slide 13. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. We delivered on our commitments for 2023 despite the significant challenges we faced. Weather was one of the most mild years on record for the AEP system in the past 30 years, resulting in a negative $0.37 impact year-over-year and $0.21 versus normal weather. To put a little more context to those numbers, our heating degree days were down 36% compared to normal across the system. Also, interest expense was a $0.45 hurdle to overcome versus 2022 results. We work diligently throughout the year to reprioritize and balance our plan by adjusting the timing of discretionary spend while staying focused on meeting our core business needs. While admittedly facing some challenges on the regulatory front, we secured many rate outcomes that were critical in supporting our objectives to provide reliable service to our customers.\nLooking into this year, we are optimistic about the opportunities and prepared to face any challenges ahead of us. We reaffirm our guidance for 2024 of $5.53 to $5.73 per share, our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% and an improved balance sheet while continuing to implement our capital program, taking care of the customer, earning our authorized return and executing on our strategic priorities.\nI would like to take a moment and thank Julie Sloat for her 23 years with AEP. Julie has made a positive impact on AEP and will be missed by many. Ben, we welcome you to the AEP management team. Your leadership in the industry is well respected, and you will be embraced by the employees of AEP. The entire management team looks forward to working with you and the Board as we look to enhance value for all AEP stakeholders. Thank you for your time today. Operator, can you open up the call for questions.",

My name is Eric, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the American Electric Power Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Darcy Reese, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Eric. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2023 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at AEP.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.\nJoining me this morning for opening remarks are Julia Sloat, our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chuck Zebula, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julie.\n\nJulia A. Sloat\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Darcy. Welcome to American Electric Power's third quarter 2023 earnings call. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Before I discuss our third quarter performance, I would like to introduce our CFO, Chuck Zebula, who will walk us through the results today. Chuck has been with the company for 25 years and has a deep understanding of our business. He hit the ground running in his new role, and we're grateful for his leadership. Many of you are familiar with Chuck, and I'm confident that you enjoy working with him in the CFO role.\nI'm pleased to share that the execution of our strategy is on track. AEP is well positioned to deliver on a robust and flexible 5-year $40 billion capital plan with an emphasis on our generation fleet transformation and investments in our energy delivery infrastructure as we need our customer needs. While our industry continues to transform amid this dynamic environment characterized by more extreme weather, rising interest rates and supply chain constraints, AEP has continued to adapt and take thoughtful actions to stay our course. We're keeping the customer at the center of every decision we make, while also balancing and listening to our stakeholders who are critical to our success.\nThis quarter, we made progress on our ongoing efforts to simplify and derisk our business profile through portfolio management, directing all proceeds of those efforts to the regulated business and to balance sheet management, which I'll speak to in more detail in a moment. We've also been working hard on the regulatory front. I'll provide insight into our success in the addition of renewable store portfolio and the many positive developments on regulatory and legislative initiatives.\nA summary of our third quarter 2023 business updates can be found on Slide 6 of today's presentation. AEP reported strong third quarter operating earnings of $1.77 per share or $924 million. We have a flexible business plan that allows us to deliver on our financial commitments while taking into account mild weather in the first half of the year and the higher for longer interest rate environment. As we actively manage the business today, we're narrowing our guidance for 2023 full year operating earnings to a range of $5.24 to $5.34 while reaffirming the $5.29 midpoint and our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. Moreover, last week, we announced an increase in our dividend, which is consistent with our earnings growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%.\nIn a few minutes, Chuck will talk about the support we have for our narrow 2023 earnings guidance range, which includes O&M management and positive load outlook as we drive economic development within our service territory. While our FFO to debt was 11.4% this quarter, we expect that this metric will improve materially by year-end and fall within the targeted rate of 14% to 15% in early 2024. Chuck will also touch on the short path to this balance sheet target.\nWe continue to make progress in our efforts to simplify and derisk our portfolio. In August, we announced the completion of the sale of our 1,365 megawatt unregulated renewables portfolio to IRG acquisition Holdings, which resulted in after-tax proceeds totaling $1.2 billion. A summary of this sale can be seen on Slide 7.\nWe've also made headway on some of our other asset sales that we previously discussed. A summary of this can be referenced on Slide 8. In May, we announced the sale of our New Mexico renewable development solar portfolio, also known as NMRD. The book value of AP's investment as of September 30 was $119 million. We're currently on track with our 550 joint venture partner, PNM Resources, as we target to close on this transaction in the late fourth quarter of this year or early first quarter of next.\nWe expect to continue the noncore business sales processes we have underway as we enter 2024. The sales of our retail and distributed resources businesses were launched in August with book value of $244 million and $353 million, respectively, as of the end of the third quarter. We expect to reach a sale agreement in the first quarter of next year with an anticipated closing in the first half of 2024. In July, we announced the sales of Prairie Wind transmission and Pioneer Transmission, our noncore transmission joint ventures, as of the end of the third quarter, AEP's portion of rate base associated with these investments was $107 million. We expect to launch the sales process soon and close in 2024.\nFinally related to [ Transource ], while there are no new updates for now. We anticipate completing the strategic review by the end of this year. So please stay tuned. AEP portion of rate base for this particular investment joint venture was $348 million as of quarter end.\nLet me shift gears and provide you with an update on our regulated renewables investment plan. The teams remain focused and made solid progress. As you know, we have $8.6 billion of regulated renewables in our 5-year capital plan. We now have a total of $6 billion of the investment plan approved and an additional $800 million currently before commissions for approval with each of these projects providing valuable fuel savings for our customers. More detail on our renewable resource additions can be viewed in the appendix on Slides 32 through 34.\nAs we've previously disclosed, both PSO's 995.5-megawatt renewable portfolio for $2.5 billion and SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewable portfolio over $2.2 billion were approved earlier this year. At a collective $4.7 billion, these two portfolios alone comprise a large component of the approved $6 billion amount I just mentioned.\nAdditionally, in APCo service territory, we're also pleased to report a positive development. In September, Virginia approved 143 megawatts of owned wind for more than $400 million, building upon APCo's existing 29 megawatts of wind and solar projects that were approved last year, which totaled approximately $500 million.\nMoving across our service territory to I&M, we filed to seek approval for recovery of two investment -- of investment in two owned solar projects totaling 469 megawatts, which represents $1 billion of total investment. We're making progress on this front as we received commission approval last month in Indiana for both the 224-megawatt May Apple and 245-megawatt Lake Trout solar projects. In Michigan the Commission approved May Apple back in August, and we'll decide on Lake Trout in the first quarter of next year.\nWe also await a commission order expected any time now for the 154-megawatt rock balls wind farm at PSO for approximately $150 million. Importantly, our regulated renewables plants are aligned with and supported by our integrated resource plans. We have issued a request for proposals for additional owned resources at APCo and IM with more to come from other operating companies in the near future as we listen and learn and respond to state preferences.\nNow I'd like to turn to updates on our ongoing regulatory and legislative initiatives. We've been engaged in efforts across our service territory to close the authorized versus earned ROE gap. Our third quarter ROE came in at 8.7%, driven in part by the unfavorable weather in the first half of 2023 that I mentioned earlier, which depressed this measure by 40 basis points. While this is a modest improvement over the last quarter, we are aware that more can be done and more needs to be done on this front. Closing the gap will remain a primary focus into 2024 as we take federal state and customer preferences top of mind, along with meeting the needs of our communities.\nWe remain focused on reducing the gap going into year-end, while still meeting our earnings guidance. To that end, I'm happy to confirm that we have settlement in place for APCo Virginia's 2020 to 2022 triennial and APO Ohio's ESP5, both cases which were filed earlier this year. we're awaiting commission decisions in these states and Virginia's orders expected in the fourth quarter of this year and Ohio will likely be issued in the first quarter of 2024. In addition, we filed new base cases in Indiana and Michigan in the third quarter. Both filings we requested -- in both on we requested a 10.5% ROE and taste drivers included distribution investment in technology, enhanced reliability and grid modernization using 2024 forecast and test years. We anticipate the new rates will be an effective next year.\nThe team has been active on the legislative front in Texas -- with Texas legislation pass and June allowing utilities to file the distribution cost recovery factor mechanism or DCRF twice per year, sit of once per year. This legislation also allows the DCRF mechanism to be used by utility, even if it has a pending rate case for seating underway. Consequently, the legislation will help improve AEP's regulatory lag in Texas to the tune of approximately 50 basis points and earned ROE starting in 2024. In fact, our April 2023 DCRF filing was approved and rates went into effect in September.\nFor Kentucky Power, our June 2023 based base application incorporated the comprehensive rate review, a 9.9% ROE and a request to allow for the securitization of $471 million of regulatory assets, ensuring Kentucky Power is best positioned to provide safe and reliable service while managing costs. Constructive intervener testimony was filed in October, including support for securitization. By statute, implementation of interim rates is permissible in January 2024.\nMoving to PSO, you'll recall that in May, we reached a settlement with the commission staff, the attorney general and other parties in Oklahoma's PSO base case, which included a 9.5% ROE and provided for approval for more efficient cost recovery mechanisms. We implemented interim rates in June while we await a commission order, which is expected any time now.\nAs you know, the management of fuel cost recovery is a top priority with AP's deferred fuel balance across our vertically integrated utilities shrinking sequentially and totaling $1.2 billion as of the end of the third quarter of this year. We have worked with stakeholders to intentionally adapt our fuel cost recovery mechanisms across our jurisdictions with the objective being to balance cost recovery with customer impact. So West Virginia fuel proceeding is approaching resolution. Recall in our April 2023 fuel recovery application, we filed two options for consideration. One option amortizes the fuel balance over 3 years. In the second option, we have respectively set forth for the West Virginia Commission consideration, the use of the 2023 securitization legislation to manage our $553 million deferred fuel balance along with securitizing store cost balances and net plant balances of generation assets. The generation assets are currently embedded in rate and assume to operate through 2040 and securitizing those assets nearly fully offset the fuel cost recovery impacts to customers.\nWe appreciate the engagement with all the stakeholder parties as we work toward a conclusion in this case by year-end and a constructive path for West Virginia. More detail on regulated activities can be found in the appendix on Slides 35 through 38.\nI'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter and by the great work underway to actively manage the business, deliver on our commitments and create value for our investors, all while keeping affordability and reliability for our customers at the center of everything we do. We have a strong team in place, and I'm confident that we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities and advance our capital investment plan to deliver reliable, affordable power to our customers. I look forward to seeing many of you in person at the EEI Conference in a couple of weeks. At the conference in Phoenix will provide some additional color on our business strategy, share our 2024 guidance and other financial details, including our 2024 through 2028 capital plan and related 5-year cash flows. Now with that, I'll hand it off to Chuck, we'll walk through performance drivers and details supporting our financial targets. Chuck?\n\nCharles E. Zebula\n\nExecutive Vice President-Energy Supply, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Julie. It's good to be with you and everyone on the call this morning. As many of you know, I've been in many different roles at AP, but this is my first earnings call as the CFO. I'm truly honored to return to the exceptional finance team at AEP and lead this area as we embrace the opportunity to invest in our regulated utilities and serve our customers with affordable and reliable electric service.\nToday, I will discuss our third quarter and year-to-date results. share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as confirming our guidance financial targets and a recap of our commitments to stakeholders.\nLet's go to Slide 9, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.83 per share compared to $1.33 per share in 2022. Year-to-date GAAP earnings through September were $3.62 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2022. As was mentioned on the second quarter earnings call, our year-to-date comparison of GAAP to operating earnings reflects the loss on the sale of the contracted renewables business as a nonoperating cost as well as an adjustment to true-up costs related to the terminated Kentucky transaction. In addition, we have reflected our typical mark-to-market adjustment and the impact of capitalized incentive compensation in Texas as nonoperating earnings as well. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today.\nMoving to Slide 10. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.77 per share or $924 million compared to $1.62 per share or $831 million last year. The higher performance compared to last year was primarily driven by favorable rate changes and transmission project execution, increased retail load and favorable O&M across our segments. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $1 per share, up $0.03 from last year. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increases in retail load, depreciation, transmission revenue and O&M. These items were somewhat offset by higher interest expense and unfavorable weather year-over-year. the vertically integrated segment did see positive weather versus normal in the third quarter of about $0.04 per share, but this was compared to positive weather in the third quarter last year of about $0.06 per share.\nConsistent with our first and second quarter results, depreciation was favorable at the vertically integrated segment by $0.01 in quarter 3, primarily due to the expiration of the Rockport Unit 2 lease in December 2022. However, if we exclude the impact of the lease depreciation would have been about $0.02 unfavorable, which is consistent with incremental investment activity in our vertically integrated segment. INM should see an additional $0.02 favorable net depreciation in the fourth quarter as well.\nThe Transmission & Distribution Utility segment earned $0.39 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included increased retail load, transmission revenue, positive rate changes in Texas and Ohio and favorable O&M Partially offsetting these favorable items were higher depreciation and higher interest expense. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.39 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.02, coupled with favorable income taxes of $0.02 are largely driving the change here.\nGeneration and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.04 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to favorable impacts associated with the contracted renewable sale in August, along with higher generation margins and land sales. These favorable items were partially offset by lower retail and wholesale power margins.\nFinally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share, driven by unfavorable interest and partially offset by favorable O&M. Please note that our year-to-date operating earnings performance by segment is shown on Slide 16 in the appendix of our presentation today.\nMany of the positive drivers are the same for the year as for the quarter, and the negative year-to-date variance is driven largely by unfavorable weather and higher interest expenses. Before we move on, I want to add a few more comments on O&M, including our outlook for the remainder of the year. We saw favorable O&M in the third quarter compared to the prior year, which was consistent with our expectations. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting more than $100 million of favorable O&M versus the prior year, which would bring us to a net favorable position for the full year from a consolidated perspective. The favorable change anticipated in the fourth quarter is largely a result of the timing of O&M spending in the prior year, including employee-related expenses and a contribution to the AEP Foundation in the fourth quarter of last year, along with continued actions we have taken, such as holding employment positions open, reducing travel and adjusting the timing of discretionary spending.\nTurning to Slide 11. I will provide an update on whether normalized low performance for the quarter and our expectations through the end of the year. Overall, load has come in ahead of plan all year, and the third quarter was no exception. Looking to the bottom right-hand quadrant. Normalized retail load grew 2.1% in Q3 from a year earlier. You also noticed that we have updated our full year 2023 estimates based on the strong loan growth we've experienced year-to-date. Weather normalized retail load is now expected to finish this year 2.3% higher than 2022, an increase that is nearly 3x higher than our original expectations. This strength comes from exceptional growth in commercial load driven by data centers in Ohio, Texas and Indiana, but the third quarter also saw positive trends in our residential class, which is shown in the upper left-hand quadrant of the slide.\nResidential load increased for the first time in more than a year in Q3 with growth of 0.6% from a year earlier. The relationship between customer incomes and inflation is a key driver of residential usage and has begun to stabilize as expected in the second half of this year. This month's CPI data point was yet another encouraging sign that inflationary pressures on our residential customers are continuing to lessen. We note that residential usage per customer have seen slight declines this year as energy efficiencies increase, more workers return to offices and customers change behavior due to inflation.\nFortunately, we are seeing strong enough growth in our customer base, especially in Texas and Ohio to help partially offset these trends. Year-to-date, we have added nearly 30,000 residential customers across our footprint.\nMoving to the lower left-hand quadrant of the slide, our investor load declined in the third quarter, driven by a pullback in usage by some of our key manufacturing customers. namely chemical, plastic and tire producers as well as downstream participants of the energy industry. This reflects some of the softness in manufacturing nationally as producers have slowed activity in response to uncertainty around the economic outlook. We expect this to reverse itself in the months ahead as recent inflation and jobs data have reduced the probability of a recession occurring in the next year. We are forecasting industrial load to remain positive through the end of next year and beyond.\nMoving to the upper right-hand quadrant of the slide, we see another impressive quarter for commercial load. In the third quarter, commercial load was 7.5% higher than a year ago, driven by the addition of new data center customers, mostly in Ohio, Texas and Indiana. We expect the pace of year-over-year growth in our commercial load to moderate some in 2024 as new projects work their way through the queue. Many of the large projects currently underway within our footprint won't come fully online until 2025. However, there is upside if a few of these projects move forward earlier than expected. Many of these gains are directly attributable to our ongoing efforts to facilitate more economic development across our operating footprint. We know that working with local stakeholders to attract more economic activity is a key strategy to providing value to the communities we serve. It allows us to prioritize investments that improve the customer experience while also mitigating rate impacts on our customer base.\nMoving to Slide 12. In the lower left corner, you can see our FFO to debt metric stands at 11.4%, which is an increase of 30 basis points from last quarter but continues to be well below our targeted range of 14% to 15%. The primary reason for the increase is a $1.8 billion decrease in debt during the quarter due to long and short-term debt retirements, driven by proceeds received from our contracted renewable sale and the successful completion of our planned equity units conversion, both of which occurred in August. We expect this metric will continue to improve throughout the remainder of this year and anticipate reaching our targeted range in early next year as we see an improvement in FFO during that time.\nWe have included a table on the slide that shows the path to the targeted FFO to debt range early next year. These items -- these are items that impact both the 12-month rolling average as well as an estimated increase in the quarterly FFO. We anticipate a 180 to 190 basis point positive impact on FFO that enables the metric to be in the 13% to 14% range by year-end based on the following items: a roll-off of roughly $600 million in cash collateral, deferred fuel and other outflows from the fourth quarter of 2022 and continued cash recovery of deferred fuel balances in the fourth quarter of this year that total between $150 million and $200 million in accordance with the regulatory orders we have already received.\nMoving into 2024, the continued roll-off of prior year cash collateral outfall in the amount of $390 million in the first quarter of 2023 and a $90 million adjustment from unfavorable weather in the first quarter of this year to normal weather in our forecast for next year, will result in an incremental 100 basis point improvement put us within our target range of 14% to 15%. Also, please note that we have updated our 2023 cash flow, as shown on Page 29 in the appendix. An increase of $1.2 billion in required capital is shown versus the original forecast, mostly due to a decrease of $800 million in cash from ops largely due to fuel inventory and an increase of $300 million in capital expenditures. Please note that our equity needs for 2023 are unchanged. The remaining years 2024 to 2027, along with rebilling 2028, will be updated at the upcoming EEI conference. Expect that this update will be consistent with our prior equity meetings and disclosures.\nMoving to Slide 13. You can see our liquidity summary in the middle of the slide. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.5 billion. On a GAAP basis, our debt to cap decreased from the prior quarter by 220 basis points to 62.4%. This large change can be attributed to the large reduction in debt, driven by our contracted renewable sale and the completion of our planned equity units that I mentioned earlier.\nOn the qualified pension front, our funding status decreased 1.9% during the quarter to 100.3%. This is largely due to equity and fixed income losses in the third quarter as interest rates increased and equity indices fell in both August and September. These losses are partially offset by a decreased liability due to rising interest rates.\nLet's go to Slide 14 for a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter produced growth in earnings well above the prior year, driven primarily by favorable rate changes, increased load and favorable O&M offsetting milder weather and increased interest expense. As we continue to move through the fourth quarter, we are focused on cost management efforts with the goal of mitigating the headwinds we have faced this year, primarily unfavorable weather and higher interest costs. The strong third quarter results and low growth, coupled with our proactive plan for the balance of the year, allow us to confidently narrow our operating guidance range to $5.24 to $5.34 per share. We also continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. And as Julie mentioned earlier, our sales efforts to simplify and derisk the AEP portfolio remain on track. We really appreciate your time and our management team and I look forward to seeing you at the upcoming EEI Financial Conference in Phoenix. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear your questions or comments.",

At this time, all parties are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVP of IR, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2022 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Julia Sloat, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ann Kelly, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Julia.\n\nJulia A. Sloat\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm happy to be here with all of you this morning, and I'm pleased to be joined by our recently appointed CFO, Ann Kelly, who joined our team in late November. So here we go.\nWe're making great progress and have a lot to share with you today, starting with the financial performance of our fourth quarter and year. I'll provide update on our Kentucky operations sale, unregulated renewable sale and retail business strategic review. I'll also provide insight into our regulatory and legislative front, as we work to implement important new initiatives to ensure our customers and communities needs, which are met in turn, and drives our high-quality investment proposition.\nFinally, I'll include an update -- or I'll conclude with an update on our generation fleet transformation as we continue to invest in regulated renewables and our energy delivery infrastructure, a summary of 2022 highlights and our focus for 2023 can be found on Slides 6 and 7 of today's presentation. As you know, we have a long history of consistently delivering and exceeding our earnings guidance and 2022 is no exception.\nI'm very proud of the dedication and accomplishments of the entire AEP team over the past year. While we finished the year strong, I can promise you, we're just getting started. Our robust financial plan continues to yield results. We delivered strong fourth quarter 2022 operating earnings of $1.05 per share bringing our full year 2022 operating earnings to $5.09 per share. We're also -- we also increased our quarterly dividend from $0.78 to $0.83 per share, which we announced back in October. AEP's teamwork-driven performance in 2022 has established a strong foundation from which we can reaffirm our 2023 full year operating earnings guidance range of $5.19 to $5.39, all while mitigating inflationary cost pressures, supply chain pressures and higher interest rates as well as constructively navigating regulatory and legislative frameworks. Formula rates in several of our state jurisdictions and in our high-growth transmission business help us to manage increased interest expense and higher costs.\nImportantly, as we keep customer affordability top of mind, we are actively working with our states on the economic development front to drive expansion in our service territory, and we are incorporating efficiencies and expense containment into our rate recovery filings to continue to help offset the impact of increased cost pressures. As a matter of fact, the economic development efforts over the past several years are proving to be appreciably beneficial, and we'll talk about normalized load in a few minutes. But to illustrate my point, I can tell you that normalized industrial sales were up 4.5%, largely as a result of those efforts, not to mention the added benefit of attracting jobs, residents and other cascading upside to our communities, all of which helps to manage customer rates given the bigger denominator.\nWe value our stakeholder relationships, and we made steady progress on the regulatory front over the past year, including achieving constructive base rate outcomes in Arkansas and SWEPCO Texas and a favorable Supreme Court appeal related to Virginia's last rate case and the securitization of Winter Storm Uri costs in Oklahoma. Our resulting earned regulated ROE as of December 31 was 9.1%, which suggests we still have work to do on this front, and I'll talk about our regulatory activity that we have underway to address this. So hang with me for a few minutes, and I'll get there. AEP is leading the transition to a clean energy economy as we engage in one of the largest generation fleet transformations in our industry, in 2022, our 1.5 gigawatt North Central wind portfolio became fully operational with the completion of the Traverse wind farm project, which marked the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition. We'll continue to execute on our fleet transformation strategy with the opportunity to add approximately 17 gigawatts of new generation resources between 2023 and 2032, while mitigating fuel cost volatility and creating a more diverse resource portfolio to benefit our customers. This will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve our upgraded net zero goal by 2045.\nImportantly, the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act provides support for our clean energy goals, and this will extend our investment runway as we continue to address the needs of our generation fleet. Since assuming the role of President and now CEO, I prioritize simplifying and derisking our business profile, which has become a core standard by which we evaluate our business activity. By actively managing our portfolio and demonstrating a clear commitment to the successful execution of initiatives and transactions, we continue to deliver significant benefits to our stakeholders.\nAs you are very much aware, we are working diligently to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. You can find the related regulatory time line on Slide 8 in the presentation today. As an update, AEP and Liberty followed the blueprint provided by the FERC order and filed a new FERC 203 application on February 14 of this year, requesting a shortened comment period and expedited approval to meet the contractual April 26, 2023 transaction close date. Immediately after the filing was made, FERC issued a notice incorporating a shortened 45-day comment deadline related to the application. The shortened comment period is a good sign signaling the commission is open to considering our application on an accelerated basis. AEP and Algonquin are in regular communication discussing various aspects of the transaction, the path forward and our partnership. We're mindful of the April 26 date in the stock purchase agreement and are cognizant of the tight time frame given the March 31 comment period deadline.\nThe objective of both AEP and Algonquin remains clear, and that's to close the transaction. And both parties are firmly committed to moving forward and bringing forth the benefits of this transaction to customers. Related to our unregulated contract renewables portfolio, after strong buyer interest, we're pleased with our announcement made yesterday for the sale of our 1,365 megawatt portfolio to IRG Acquisition Holdings, which is a partnership owned by Invenergy, CDPQ and funds managed by Blackstone infrastructure. A summary of the sale can be seen on Slide 9 of the presentation today.\nWe're currently targeting a second quarter 2023 close. The utilization of the proceeds from the sale is now reflected in our updated multiyear financing plan on Slide 39, and the transaction proceeds will be directed to support our regulated businesses as we enhance the energy delivery infrastructure and transform our generation fleet. Our near-term focus remains closing on our 2 pending sale transactions, Kentucky and our unregulated renewables. Once both of these transactions are complete, we plan to revisit the equity needs in our current multiyear financing plan. As we've been clear in the past we will use the asset sales to responsibly eliminate equity while maintaining a strong balance sheet, no change in messaging on this.\nAnd that's important that I reiterate that. No change in the messaging. Finally, in October 2022, we announced the strategic review of our retail business. We're looking at this business to determine how or if it fits with the current AEP portfolio and we'll keep you updated on our progress. We're expecting to complete the strategic review in the first half of 2023.\nLet me touch on our regulatory and legislative initiatives that we have underway. We remain focused on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap. As I mentioned earlier, our 2022 earned regulated ROE 9.1% and our 2023 earnings guidance range assumes a 9.4% earned ROE, and we are already making progress in that direction. In January, we reached the settlement and gain commission approval for our Louisiana base case, which allows us to reestablish a formula rate plan. As we advance through the year, the team will be active in completing our current base case in Oklahoma and rider recovery of the 88 megawatts of the Turk Plant, which is not currently in Arkansas rates. We also filed an electric security plan in Ohio, which will take us into 2024.\nLet me shift gears and provide you with an update on our deferred fuel recovery efforts that are currently underway. As we've previously shared with you over the past several months, we have made adjustments to our traditional cost recovery methods in a number of our states to allow for recovery while spreading the cost out for our customers to make them more affordable.\nIn West Virginia, we continue to pursue approval of the pass-through of fuel costs under the fuel clause. We also intend to propose an alternative path to recovery of these costs under proposed legislation, if approved, that would allow us to securitize these costs and minimize customer impact. The West Virginia Commission recently instructed its staff to finish its prudence review of the 2021 and 2022 fuel costs. The state legislature continues to move the securitization legislation forward with the Commission Chair recently testify in support before the lawmakers.\nI'll conclude my remarks with an update on our regulated renewables strategy and execution. Our capacity needs continue to drive us forward on the regulated renewables front, and we continue to work with our regulators, policymakers and other key stakeholders to ensure a durable and sustainable transmission -- transition to a clean energy economy in our vertically integrated state.\nThe recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will help us advance our goals in this area and will provide additional value to our customers as we seek to acquire resources consistent with our plan. We've made considerable progress on SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables application, which represents a $2.2 billion investment for AEP. Parties filed a unanimous settlement in Arkansas on January 27 for a portfolio of owned wind and solar resources. A hearing was held in Texas in January, and we continue to have constructive settlement dialogue with parties in Louisiana, and the hearing date has been formally extended to March 21 to accommodate this. We look forward to receiving the commission's orders, which are expected in the second quarter of 2023 on Louisiana and the third quarter of 2023 for Texas.\nIn November of 2022, PSO made a regulatory filing in Oklahoma to own 995.5 megawatts of solar and wind projects representing a $2.5 billion investment. A procedural schedule was issued last month which includes a hearing date in April and an expected commission order in the third quarter of this year. Separately, we're also seeking to acquire the 154-megawatt Rock Hall wind facility in Oklahoma from EDF. FERC approved this acquisition on February 16, and we're pursuing rate recovery of this investment through the ongoing PSO base rate case.\nThe Rock Hall project is already in service and will provide immediate capacity for PSO's customers. Our regulated renewables goals are aligned and supported by our integrated resources plans. In accordance with those plans, we issued request for proposal in 2022 for wind, solar and other resources at APCo, I&M and once again at SWEPCO. We anticipate making the related regulatory funds to acquire additional resources under these RFPs throughout 2023.\nWe continue to see rapid changes in our industry and increasing need and demand from customers and communities across the United States. At the end of 2022, as I prepared to assume my new position at AEP, the team and I dedicated a considerable amount of time and energy to determining how AEP would continue to deliver safe, clean, affordable and reliable energy and how we could deliver this energy faster and more efficiently to our customers while generating enhanced value to our stakeholders. Our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7% is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 through 2027, which includes $15 billion in transmission and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.\nAs evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year 2022 performance, AEP has had a long-standing track record of consistently delivering on our strategic objectives, our transformation strategy is working and the investments we're making continue to support our positive earnings growth and results. Now please join me in welcoming Ann to her first AEP earnings call. I'll leave you in her very capable hands as she provides insight and perspective into our performance drivers for 2022 and the details supporting our financial targets. Ann?\n\nAnn P. Kelly\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Julia and Darcy. It's great to be with you all this morning and thanks for dialing in. I'll walk us through our fourth quarter and full year results, share some updates on our service territory load and our outlook for 2023 and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and portfolio management.\nSo let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. As Julia mentioned, we had a strong operating results in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.75 per share compared to $1.07 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.51 per share compared to $4.97 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'll mention that we have reflected additional charges related to the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as nonoperating costs. This is largely a result of the delay in the closing from the need to file a new 203 application with the FERC. There are detailed reconciliations of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today. Today, I'm going to focus more on our full year results, but I did want to provide a few highlights on the fourth quarter as we show on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $1.05 per share compared to $0.98 per share in 2021.\nThis is a $0.07 or 7% increase year-over-year. While we had a lot of puts and takes, our vertically integrated and T&D utility segments continued to perform well, resulting from rate changes, transmission revenue and some favorable weather. We did see a $0.03 decline in our normalized retail margin, but that was due to a change in sales mix as [low] as favorable for the quarter.\nI'll discuss load in more detail in a couple of minutes. We were also able to support an increase in our O&M expenses as a result of the strong earnings that we were seeing. Transmission Holdco was favorable by $0.03, even after factoring in the loss the Ohio RTO Adder as we continue to see the benefits of our investments. Generation and Marketing produced $0.16 per share, up $0.10 from last year, driven by increased retail energy margins and favorable generation performance, primarily driven by fewer average days year-over-year.\nAnd finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.05 per share driven by increased interest expense and investment losses, partially offset by favorable income taxes. Now let's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2022 totaled $5.09 per share compared to $4.74 per share in 2021. This was an increase of $0.35 per share or 7%. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.56 per share, up $0.30. Due to rate changes across various operating companies, favorable weather, increased transmission revenue and also increase normalized load. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M, increased depreciation expense and increased interest expense.\nOnce again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.23 of favorable O&M offset by $0.23 of unfavorable depreciation. In the Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment, earned $1.16 per share, up $0.06 from last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. With the favorable weather and other items that we experienced in 2022, we were able to responsibly deploy additional O&M in both utility segments to spend on items like increased vegetation management to improve system reliability.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.32 per share, down $0.03 from last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.12 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.04, the loss of the RTO Adder in Ohio and increased income taxes. Remember, our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up and some unfavorable comparisons for taxes and interest. Generation and Marketing produced $0.50 per share, up $0.24 from last year. The positive variance here is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites, improved generation performance in land sales in the generation business, improved retail margins and increased wholesale margins stemming from favorable market conditions.\nAnd finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.22 per share, driven by investment losses unfavorable interest in increased O&M, partly offset by lower income taxes. The investment losses continue to be impacted by the year-over-year comparisons for our ChargePoint investment that we exited in the third quarter. As we mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our guidance range for 2023. For convenience, we've included an updated waterfall on our actual 2022 results to the midpoint of our guidance for 2023 on Slide 36. While the variances changed due to the 2022 actual results, there is no change to our 2023 segment or overall guidance. We are confident that our regulatory actions to provide timely returns on our distribution and renewable investments, continued investment in transmission assets, the impact of economic development efforts and prudent O&M management will offset headwinds such as rising interest rates and inflationary pressures.\nNow turning to Slide 13, I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance. Overall, 2022 was a remarkable year for normalized load growth across the AEP service territory. Despite the Federal Reserve's intentional actions to slow down the economy, AEP experienced its strongest weather-normalized load growth in over 15 years with 2.8% annual growth. The most impressive part is that this is experience on top of a recovery year. As a reminder, 2021 was the strongest year for AEP's normalized growth in over a decade until 2022. The growth in 2022 was spread across nearly every operating company in every major retail class. Starting in the lower right corner of the slide, normalized retail sales increased by 1.9% in the fourth quarter and ended the year up 2.8% compared to last year. For the quarter, the growth in commercial and industrial sales will more than offset the modest decline in residential sales.\nLooking forward, you will see that we are expecting growth of 7% to 10% in 2023. The story is changing somewhat to further remove away from the pandemic. In 2022, the boost from fiscal policy overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's efforts to constrain the economy through monetary policy. In 2023, we expect the fiscal boost to date given the congressional changes after the election, while the Fed's efforts to tame inflation remain in place. We expect this to result in a slight moderation of economic growth for the balance of this year.\nMoving to the upper left corner, normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the fourth quarter but finished the year slightly above 2021. For the quarter, residential customer counts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather normalized usage.\nThis is not surprising when you consider the impact that higher inflation, energy costs and interest rates on customers' disposable income to end the year. You will notice that we now expect residential sales to decrease by 0.5% in 2023 for the same reason. Moving right, weather-normalized commercial sale increased by 5.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 4.2% compared to 2021. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company. Fastest-growing commercial sectors, professional scientific and tech services that includes data centers, which -- where load was up nearly 30% compared to last year for both the quarter and the year-to-date comparisons.\nThe outlook for 2023 is showing a modest 0.6% growth. While we do see momentum in this class driven by economic development, the sustained impact of the labor shortage, inflation, high interest rates and energy costs will act as a headwind in 2023. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner, you see the industrial sales growth moderated in the fourth quarter, up 1.5% and while the year ended 4.5% above 2021. Industrial sales increased at most operating companies in many of our largest sectors.\nWe continue to experience robust growth in the oil and gas sectors, which were up 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Outside of oil and gas, which tends to run countercyclical with the rest of the economy, we did notice softer industrial sales growth consistent with many of the economic indicators. As you know, the ISM manufacturing index fell below 50 in the fourth quarter, which is a sign of an industrial contraction. The combination of sustained inflation, supply chain disruptions, increasing borrowing costs, strong dollar and elevated energy costs have formed significant challenges for domestic manufacturing. Fortunately, AEP's past economic development activities are providing an offset and are keeping AEP's industrial sales growth in positive territory. You see that the outlook is showing industrial sales growth of 2.1% in 2023, which is largely attributable to the consistent economic development activities from the past. I'll provide additional detail on the impact of these efforts in the next slide.\nTo summarize, the AP service territory experienced a remarkable year for load growth in 2022 despite the inflationary pressures on wages and energy and a federal reserve that was intentionally trying to slow down the economy. We are finally seeing evidence that these measures are starting to have an impact, which will result in slower growth in 2023. Fortunately, AEP's disciplined commitment to economic development should keep our load growth in the black moving forward.\nFor example, absent economic development, our loan growth would have been essentially flat in the fourth quarter and up 1.1% for the year.\nTurning to Slide 14, I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why the strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth of gross regional product for the AEP service territory over the past year. You can see that it has been slowing over the period. And in fact, for the fourth quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was slightly negative compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the green bars here show our industrial sales growth over the same period. You'll notice they have been resilient throughout 2022 without any help from GRP. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we are seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years. And our focus on economic development is not just about the additional load that we report to you on a quarterly basis. We are also focused on attracting employers to the service territory. We know that adding new loading customers are a key strategy to providing value to all customers. This allows us to continue to prioritize investments that will improve the customer experience while mitigating the rate impacts on our customer base.\nBy making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn on our customers, communities and shareholders. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping to bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territories added over 141,000 jobs in 2022.\nLet's move on to Slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. Taking a look at the upper left quadrant on this page, you see our FFO-to-debt metric stands at 13.2%, which is a decrease of 1.3% from the prior quarter. The primary reason for this decrease is the impact on both FFO and short-term debt from a decrease in our mark-to-market collateral positions associated with the decline in natural gas and power prices as well as a continued increase in our deferred fuel balances.\nWe remain committed to our targeted FFO-to-debt range of 14% to 15%, and we plan to trend back into that range near the end of 2023 as we continue to work through the regulatory recovery process of our deferred fuel balances, which can drive some volatility in the metrics. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower left quadrant slide. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $2.6 billion. The $1.1 billion change from last quarter is mainly due to an increase in commercial paper outstanding for the reasons I mentioned earlier.\nOn a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased from the prior quarter by 1.5% to 62.9%. On the qualified pension front, our funding status remained strong, ending the quarter at 102.4%. While assets performed as expected during the quarter, the primary driver for the funded status decreased was due to an increase in the liability caused by changes in actuarial assumptions influenced by the rising interest rate environment in 2022.\nNow turning to Slide 16. I'll give a quick recap of today's message. First, we are focused on execution. The Kentucky transaction is back in front of the FERC and Liberty and AEP are committed to moving forward with this transaction. We just announced the agreement to sell our unregulated contract renewables portfolio and are working through the strategic review of the retail business. Each of these actions will help us to simplify and derisk our business. Even as we worked on these initiatives, we didn't take our eye off the ball of managing the business. We finished 2022 with solid earnings and made significant investments to support our customers even with the backdrop of supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures.\nWe continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%, continuing dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while derisking the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio. We really appreciate your time and attention today.\nI'm going to ask Brad to open up the call so that we can answer any questions that you may have.",

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, your conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVP of IR, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Luis. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the third quarter 2022 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking time today to join us. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.\nJoining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our President and Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks.\nI will now turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas K. Akins\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's Third Quarter '22 Earnings Call.\nWe continue to make significant progress on our commitments. We have leveraged our scale, our financial strength, portfolio management and transition to a pure-play regulated utility. Over the past 10 years, we've had a great record of consistently exceeding our earnings projections and raising guidance with this quarter being no exception.\nToday, I'll provide a brief recap of the key financial highlights for the quarter, followed by updates on our Kentucky sale process, our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio sale and the previously announced strategic review of our retail business, all of which are part of our strategy to simplify and derisk our business profile.\nI will then spend time discussing our carbon emission reduction goals in addition to our continued emphasis on regulated renewables execution and generation fleet transformation. I will conclude by providing insights into our other ongoing regulatory activities. All of this summarized information can be found on Slides 6 and 7 of today's presentation with supporting details in the appendix.\nSo off to the financials, we continue to build on our momentum, delivering strong third quarter 2022 operating earnings of $1.62 per share or $831 million. Today, we are reaffirming our 2022 narrowed full year operating guidance range as well as our newly introduced 2023 operating earnings guidance range, both of which we had announced at our recent Analyst Day.\nAs a reminder, we are going -- are guiding to a 2022 range of $4.97 to $5.07 with an increased midpoint of $5.02 per share. And our 2023 guidance range is $5.19 to $5.31 with a $5.29 per share at midpoint. Our long-term earnings growth rate guidance of [6% to 7%] is underpinned by a robust $40 billion capital investment plan for 2023 to 2027, which includes $26 billion in wires and $9 billion in regulated renewables investments.\nMoreover, our dividend growth is in line with our long-term growth rate and within our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%. We continue to derisk our platform and execute our strategy to ensure that we are best positioned for value creation in the face of global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. As part of this effort, we are continuing to work with states to drive reliability and resiliency in our service territory amidst customer bill considerations and other macroeconomic factors.\nIn order to lessen the impact on our capital investment plan, we have also diversified our mix of suppliers, which has minimized customer and business supply chain disruptions to date. Later in today's call, Julie will walk through our third quarter performance drivers and share thoughts on the positive load outlook in our service territory as well as on our targeted 14% to 15% FFO to debt range.\nSo now talking about some of the strategic reviews. True to our steadfast commitment to execution, we're in the final stretch to complete the sale of our Kentucky operations to Liberty. As we previously mentioned, FERC told their approval date to December 16, and we have, therefore, signed with Liberty to plan for a January 2023 closing date.\nThis date is keyed off of FERC's process and should give confidence to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities and shareholders. It also enables our transition teams to adequately and efficiently plan for the closing. While our sale timeline has shifted over the past year, we are not revising our earnings guidance or any of our equity needs. We are pleased to reach this point and are confident in our ability to close the transaction shortly after the start of the new year.\nRelated to our unregulated contracted renewals portfolio, we launched the sale process for this 1,365-megawatt portfolio in late August 2022 with strong buyer interest from both financial and strategic investors. We recently accepted bids for Phase 1 of the auction process and are proceeding into Phase 2 due diligence with selected bidders. We are on pace for closing -- for a closing date in the second quarter of 2023. Selling the portfolio will allow AEP to shift focus and rotate capital towards regulated businesses as we continue to transform our generation fleet and enhance transmission infrastructure.\nAs we announced earlier this month on our Analyst Day, we are pursuing a strategic review of our retail business as we adjust to how our interest in the competitive markets has changed over time. We'll keep you updated on our progress and expect to complete our review in the first half of 2023. We're always considering opportunities to enhance shareholder value, and we'll continue to evaluate potential value-additive opportunities for our regulated businesses against the backdrop of our goal to further simplify and derisk the business.\nNow regarding emission reduction goals, as we mentioned in the Analyst Day, AEP remains firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability, while recognizing the value of our diverse resource portfolio given today's world of energy-related volatility. We are undertaking one of the largest clean energy transformations in the country through our regulated renewable strategy, and we announced our enhanced and accelerated carbon emission reduction goals at our Analyst Day in early October, as I mentioned earlier.\nFirst, we have rebased our near-term emission reduction target of 80% by 2030 now pegged to a 2005 baseline instead of 2000; second, we upgraded our near-term reduction target. And as such, all Scope 1 emissions are now included in our carbon emission reduction goals. Lastly, we accelerated our net 0 goal by 5 years from 2050 to 2045. We are confident in our path forward and our ability to hit key milestones in a steady and timely manner.\nImportantly, these goals are aligned and supported by our latest integrated resource [lands] that are in the various states. We will continue our planned retirement and disposition of select fossil fuel units while adding renewables to our generation portfolio. Our 1.5 gigawatt North Central Wind portfolio, which became fully operational in March of this year, represents only the beginning of our clean energy fleet transition.\nIn addition, we have 17 gigawatts of potential generation additions across different resource types within our vertically integrated utilities over the next 10 years. Combined, this represents 18.5 gigawatts of new generation, which will significantly contribute to AEP's reduced carbon emissions profile and put us on a path to achieve net 0 -- our net 0 goal by 2045. As an update, on October 19, related to SWEPCO's 999-megawatt renewables totaling $2.2 billion of investment, the Arkansas staff filed support of these resources subject to conditions. Commission orders are expected in 2023.\nAs we look to the long term, we are committed to building a reliable and resilient grid to efficiently deliver clean energy to our customers, and we will continue to monitor new technologies that can help us close the gap to net 0, while maintaining the highly reliable and affordable delivery of energy that our customers expect.\nMoreover, newly passed provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act, which is foundational to our clean energy investment strategy should help bolster advancement of new carbon-free energy sources. The bill includes tax credits for technologies like clean hydrogen projection -- production and energy storage, in addition to the technology neutral tax credits for our carbon-free resources and we will continue to evaluate these resources through our integrated resource plans.\nWith regard to our ongoing regulatory activities, our regulated ROE as of September 30, 2022, is 9.3% and continues to improve as we work through regulatory cases and continue to make strides in reducing our authorized versus actual ROE gap.\nIn fact, as an update on SWEPCO on September 29, we filed notice to move the 88 megawatts of Turk Plant [into] rates in Arkansas. The full filing will occur within the [November-December] time frame, and we will seek a rider to place the 88-megawatt capacity in rates. With respect to our outstanding SWEPCO Louisiana rate case, we are expecting an order in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nWe've also made notable progress on APCo's 2020 Virginia case. As many of you likely recall, we successfully appealed the triennial rate order the day following the issuance of the order in November 2020, giving confidence in our position that the order was inconsistent with Virginia statute.\nWe are pleased that the court recently ruled in AEP's favor preserving our right to seek a retroactive adjustment in addition to the ongoing rate adjustment. Interim rates were implemented in Virginia on October 1 of this year.\nWe've also actively managed the implications of increased fuel costs as we focus on maintaining a balance between cost recovery and customer impacts. As part of this effort, our operating companies continue to work with commissions, regulators and other stakeholders to educate customers about price surges and put mechanisms in place to alleviate these pressures.\nFor example, we have 6-month and 2-month clauses in I&M and SWEPCO Louisiana respectively, to help ease the effect of longer-term fuel clauses. We also -- we were also able to lengthen the months of fuel recovery in Virginia and Oklahoma and are working with our customers and commissions to make sure we recover that over a longer period of time.\nAs you all know, this will be my last earnings call as I will be transitioning from CEO to Executive Chair on January 1, and Julie will become CEO of AEP. We're very excited to have an executive of Julie's caliber to lead our company. I'm confident in her deep knowledge of AEP as well as the emphasis she places on consistency, quality of earnings and dividends, and shareholder and customer value creation that will be instrumental to AEP's continued success.\nI'm also confident that she has the heart to be a strong leader. I'm reminded of the lyrics of Rush's Closer To The Heart that I have always related to as a CEO, and it goes something like this: and the men [and women] who hold high places must be the ones who start to mold a new reality closer to the heart.\nThe role of a CEO in the company, our communities and our country has changed during my tenure, Julie is the embodiment of the new CEO and will lead this company to even greater success. After 44 earnings call, my tenure will soon come to an end as CEO of this great company. So I'll end this call with lyrics from a great Led Zeppelin song: and so today, my world, it smiles. And song title is merely Thank You. Julie?\n\nJulia A. Sloat\n\nPresident & CFO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nOh my goodness, Nick. Thank you. Thank you. Well, yes, all heart and all in. Absolutely, absolutely. So thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I know you have a real busy morning with multiple companies reporting. So we'll try to be as efficient as possible.\nBut I'm going to walk us through the third quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and economy and finish with commentary on credit metrics and liquidity, as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our commitments to stakeholders.\nSo I'm going to start on Slide 8 which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $1.33 per share compared to $1.59 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through September were $3.76 per share compared to $3.90 per share in 2021. For the quarter, I'd like to mention 2 reconciling items. First, there's a write-off of a Virginia regulatory asset associated with previously closed coal plants. This is a result of the Virginia Supreme Court opinion that affirmed the company's original write-down of those plants in 2019 and allowed APCo to increase its Virginia rates on a going-forward basis.\nThe other reconciling item that I'd like to mention related to the sale of Kentucky Power. You'll recall that we announced on September 30, that we'd entered into an amendment to the stock purchase agreement with Liberty that among other items resulted in a reduced purchase price. We've reflected the additional loss on the expected sale of Kentucky Power and Kentucky Transco as a nonoperating cost. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 16 and 17 of the presentation today.\nLet's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 9. Operating earnings for the third quarter totaled $1.62 per share compared to $1.43 per share in 2021. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.97 per share, up $0.10. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the impact of the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to our APCo triennial review, which you'll see on the waterfall today is a $0.06 catch-up of the 2017 through 2019 under earnings, a positive weather on our Western jurisdictions and increased transmission revenue.\nThese items were somewhat offset by an increase in depreciation, lower normalized load and increased income taxes. Just as a reminder on O&M and depreciation, as I mentioned on last quarter's call and included in our 2022 guidance details, because of a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M, we're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. I'll talk a little bit more on load performance, but I'll get to that here in a minute, so bear with me.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes and positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M, depreciation and income taxes.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.33 per share, flat compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.02 was somewhat offset by unfavorable income taxes. Generation and Marketing produced $0.14 per share, up $0.10 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to higher retail margins, increased renewable wind production, higher market prices impacting generation margins and favorable income taxes.\nFinally, Corporate and Other was down $0.02 per share driven by unfavorable interest expense, mainly as a result of the increase in short-term debt rates and increased O&M partially offset by reduced investment losses. The reduced investment losses are largely related to [ChargePoint] losses that we had in the third quarter of 2021 that have reversed this year.\nI'll note that we exited our position in ChargePoint during the third quarter so aside from the year-over-year comparison, we will not have any new volatility in this particular aspect of Corporate and Other -- the Corporate and Other segment relating to our direct ownership of ChargePoint shares since the position has been liquidated.\nSo let's go to Slide 10, and I'll talk about our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings totaled $4.04 per share compared to $3.76 per share in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $2.15 per share, up $0.28. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, the resolution of the APCo triennial, positive weather in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and favorable normalized retail load. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales. Once again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.17 of favorable O&M offset by $0.17 of unfavorable depreciation.\nThe Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.95 per share, up $0.10 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, favorable weather and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M, property taxes and depreciation.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.95 per share, down $0.07 per share compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.06 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased income taxes. As I mentioned last quarter, this is entirely consistent with our guidance. Our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred last quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side.\nGeneration and Marketing produced $0.34 per share, up $0.14 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites, improved retail margins, increased wholesale margins and land sales in the generation segment. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.17 per share, driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains are largely related to ChargePoint gains that we had in 2021 that reversed this year.\nTurning to Slide 11. Let me provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Overall, AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first 3 quarters of the year despite increasing headwinds impacting the macro economy.\nStarting in the lower right corner, normalized retail sales increased by 2.6% in the third quarter compared to last year. Once again, every operating company experienced positive year-over-year growth for the quarter. Furthermore, the growth in the commercial and industrial sales this quarter more than offset the modest decline in residential sales.\nFor the year-to-date comparison, AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.1%, with growth spread across all major retail classes and operating companies. In fact, we're on pace to experience the strongest year for load growth since the mid-1990s. And that's on top of the recovery year we had last year when the load increased by 2.1%.\nMoving to the upper left corner, normalized residential sales decreased by 0.8% in the third quarter but remained up 0.3% through September compared to last year. For the quarter, residential accounts increased by 0.4%, but this was offset by a 1.2% decline in weather-normalized usage. This is not surprising when you consider that last year, many of our customers were receiving extra income from the fiscal stimulus that is not happening in 2022. While the results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth for the quarter was at SWEPCO.\nMoving right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 3.4% for the quarter and were up 3.8% for the year-to-date comparison. The growth in commercial sales was spread across nearly every operating company and 8 of our top 10 commercial sectors. The fastest-growing commercial sector is data centers, where loads up 33% compared to last year for the quarter and for the year-to-date comparisons.\nFinally, focusing on the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales posted another strong quarter, up 6% for the quarter and up 5.5% for the year-to-date comparison to last year.\nIndustrial sales were up at nearly every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We continued to experience double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, pipeline transportation, paper manufacturing and coal mining.\nTo summarize, the AEP service territory has maintained significant momentum through the first 9 months of the year despite the challenging headwinds of inflation, higher interest rates, supply chain disruptions and the labor shortage. We know the Federal Reserve's approach to address inflation is designed to slow down the economy, which will eventually work its way through our footprint. However, I'd like to remind you that there are things that we've done and will continue to do to help mitigate the impact of slowing economic conditions in our service territory. Specifically, we're talking about our economic development efforts.\nSo turning to Slide 12. I want to highlight how our commitment to economic development is helping to sustain load growth even in the face of challenging economic conditions. The chart on this slide illustrates why this strategy is so important to us. The blue bars on this chart show the growth in gross regional product or GRP, for the AEP service territory over the past year. So you can see that it has been slowing over the period. In fact, for the third quarter, growth in AEP's GRP was essentially flat. However, the green bars here show that our industrial sales growth over the same period. You'll notice that they've maintained their strength, even improving 6% without the help from GRP.\nHow does this happen? That's because of our consistent and disciplined approach to economic development over the years. A lot of the growth in industrial load that we're seeing today is a consequence of economic development projects from previous years that are coming online this year. Examples include a large steel plant and an LNG processing facility that are now online in the AEP Texas service territory, a new chemicals plant that is now operating in Tennessee or a paper plant that is now producing in Oklahoma. And these are just a few of the many examples that we could mention. But the key takeaway here is that AEP's commitment to economic development is what is allowing us to be on track to post our strongest year for load growth in decades despite an economy that is beginning to slow down.\nAnother key point to remember is that you cannot turn it on or off like a light switch. Economic development projects take time to materialize. And the results that we see here today are largely the result of activities that occurred years ago. By making this a key component of our strategy, AEP is helping to mitigate the impact of economic downturns on our customers, our communities and our investors. And AEP's economic development team has a proven track record of helping bring these new customers to our service territory with an emphasis on jobs and load. In fact, the AEP service territory has added over 106,000 jobs this year.\nSo let's move on to Slide 13 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. We're doing well in this regard. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio held constant from the prior quarter at 61.4%. Taking a look at the left upper quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 14.5% on both the Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 1.1% and 1.2%, respectively, the prior quarter.\nThe primary reason for the increase is attributed to the completion of the PSO securitization efforts, which increased cash from operations. As we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated trending toward our FFO debt -- FFO to debt targeted range of 14% to 15% as the year progressed, and we currently sit comfortably within that range.\nYou can see our liquidity (inaudible) in the lower left quadrant on the slide, our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility to support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.6 billion.\nOn the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.3% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.3%. Negative returns on the risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were primary drivers of the funded status decrease. However, rising interest rates cause plan liability to decrease, which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns. So we're in a good place in terms of funding.\nLet's go to Slide 14. So I can do a quick recap of today's message. The third quarter continues to provide a solid foundation for the rest of 2022 and allowed us -- at our recent Analyst Day, in narrow and raise our operating earnings guidance range to $4.97 to $5.07 with a midpoint of $5.02.\nAs you know, AEP offers steady and predictable growth driven by our low-risk regulated business, robust electric infrastructure investment pipeline and our proven track record of managing cost pressures over time while growing our rate base. This, along with the updated 2022 load forecast we provided at our October 4 Analyst Day and the Virginia Supreme Court ruling related to APCo's 2017 to 2019 triennial review, position us to navigate headwinds, remaining this year that you would expect, such as continued inflation, interest rates, weather risks, et cetera, which is why we maintained a $0.10 range when we recently lifted and tightened our 2022 guidance range. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%, continued dividend growth and a strong balance sheet while we are derisking the company, focusing on the customer and actively managing the portfolio.\nSo we really do appreciate your time and attention today. I know you guys are super busy with the all the earnings calls. So with that, I'm going to kick it over to the operator, so we can hear what's on your mind and take your questions.",

I'll now turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Darcy Reese. Go ahead.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVP of IR, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the second quarter 2022 earnings call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.\nJoining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas K. Akins\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. AEP continues to make progress on the strategic initiatives we announced earlier this year with strong execution against our plan, resulting in another solid quarter. Later in the call, Julie will walk you through our second quarter performance drivers, including the strong load increases we're experiencing in our territory as well as provide additional details surrounding our financial position.\nBut I'll start with the key financial highlights for the quarter. We'll then move to an update on our Kentucky operations sale process and timeline. I will also spend time discussing the progress we are making in our transition to a clean energy future as we simplify and derisk our business profile by divesting unregulated renewable assets, while maintaining focus on our responsible generation fleet transformation and regulated renewables execution.\nI will close by providing some additional insights into our ongoing regulatory activities, including our transmission business.\nWe are very pleased with our positive momentum this quarter, delivering operating earnings of $1.20 per share or $618 million. We are moving full speed ahead towards the increased operating earnings guidance range and long-term earnings growth rate we provided during our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, and we are reaffirming both financial targets of this quarter.\nAs a reminder, we are guiding to an operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07 per share for 2022 with a $4.97 midpoint and a long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%. We are also continuing to ensure we are best positioned for value creation as we navigate the macro trends impacting our industry and the broader economy. We are working with states to drive expansion in our service territory while considering global economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures and, of course, customer bills.\nWe're also diversifying our mix of suppliers to minimize supply chain disruptions for our customers in business while also lessening the impact on our capital investment plan. We know that timing of the closing of the sale of Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco to Liberty as top [of mind], and we have been working with Liberty to obtain the approvals necessary for closing this summer.\nA regulatory timeline of the sale can be found on Slide 7 of today's presentation. We are pleased to report the Kentucky Commission approved the key milestone in the transaction with an order approving the sales transfer in early May. As we have discussed previously, a prerequisite in our contract of Liberty for closing the sale is approving the approval of new Mitchell operating agreements by both the Kentucky Public Service Commission and the West Virginia Public Service Commission.\nWhile we receive the related Mitchell orders from the Kentucky Commission on May 3 and the West Virginia Commission on July 1, the 2 states approved the operating agreement with different formats and some divergent post 2028 plant provisions. However, through the 2 proceedings, both commissions have indicated an ability to use the existing agreement as a basis to operate the plant going forward and accomplish their differing expectations for investment in operations.\nFor that reason, on July 11, we made a compliance filing in West Virginia and filed an update with Kentucky providing an alternative way to move forward with Mitchell operations in the near term. We informed both commissions that we will operate under the existing agreement and manage the new operational focus of the 2 commissions through the operating committee.\nIn the absence of any new agreements, the existing Mitchell Operating Agreement is still in effect and we believe no additional regulatory approvals should be required. Since regulatory approval of the new Mitchell Operating Agreement is a prerequisite in our contract with Liberty for the closing. In the absence of such proposal, we are working with Liberty on the commercial solution for Mitchell-related operations, and both parties remain optimistic about reaching a resolution and closing the transaction.\nAt this time, the only regulatory matter currently pending is the 203 application at FERC related to the cell transfer, which FERC is currently considering. We are in the final stages of the Kentucky operations sale process and expect to close this summer.\nMoving to our unregulated renewable portfolio in May, we closed on the sale of 5 unregulated development sites located in the Southwest Power Pool area, marking the successful divestiture of the majority of our wind and solar development assets. As we mentioned last quarter, we have also signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio, with that transition close expected also in the third quarter.\nIn addition, we are in discussions with an interested party sale of our Flat Ridge II wind farm ownership consisting of 235 megawatts, simplifying the resulting portfolio for our upcoming auctions. These milestones demonstrate our commitment to continued execution. As we announced during our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we are selling our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in order to simplify and derisk the company and facilitate investment in our regulated businesses.\nWe are in the final stages of preparation of the marketing materials for the auction and expect an official launch of the process no later than early September. After the removal Flat Ridge II. The portfolio consists of 1,365 megawatts of contracted renewable assets consisting of 1,200 megawatts of wind and 165 megawatts of solar, geographically diversified throughout the U.S. There has been robust inbound interest in the portfolio, and we expect the process to proceed quickly.\nAs a reminder, utilization of contracted renewable sale proceeds is not yet reflected in our multiyear financing plan. We remain focused on maximizing transaction proceeds and directing additional capital to our regulated businesses, where we have meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers as we push toward a clean energy future and enhanced transmission infrastructure.\nAs always, we are open-minded and we'll evaluate all value-additive potential activities as we focus on our regulated businesses, where we see meaningful long-term opportunities for growth.\nAEP continues to make significant progress in our transition to clean energy resources through our regulated renewables execution. Details regarding the specific actions we are taking can be found on Slides 8 and 9 in today's presentation. We are also firmly grounded in our principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability while recognizing the increasing value of our diverse resource portfolio against the backdrop of energy-related volatility.\nSWEPCO is taking steps to secure renewable resources, making regulatory filings in May in Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas to own 3 renewable turnkey projects totaling 999 megawatts. This $2.2 billion investment is currently reflected in our 5-year $38 billion capital plan. SWEPCO expects to issue another RFP in the near term, consistent with its RFP for energy and capacity needs. APCo's 409 megawatts of owned solar and wind resources were approved by West Virginia and Virginia, marking an $841 million capital investment that is also included in our current capital plan. Request for a proposal are in process in APCo, I&M and PSO with expected in-service dates in the year-end 2024 and 2025 timeframe. We also expect to make regulatory filings to acquire additional renewable resources prior to year-end 2022.\nFinally, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling at the end of June related to the federal EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions will not require any changes to AEP's current generation and compliance planning. Our generation fleet transformation plans are well on track. We remain fully committed to our target of an 80% carbon reduction emissions -- emission reduction rate by 2030 and net 0 by 2050, and we are proud of the work well underway at AEP to help us achieve this goal.\nReaching these targets is foundational to our long-term strategy, and we believe we are on the right path toward prioritizing regulated investment opportunities and transitioning our generation fleet.\nTurning now to a brief update on our regulatory activity. Our regulated ROE as of the end of June 2022 is 9.2%. We continue to work through regulatory cases and maintain our focus on reducing our authorized versus actual ROE spreads. Additional regulatory activity in the quarter included a commission order received in May on SWEPCO's Arkansas rate case, including a 9.5% ROE, marking a net revenue increase of $28 million and a capital structure of 55% debt to 45% equity. We are also expecting a decision on SWEPCO's losing out a rate case in the third quarter. Oral arguments related to APCo's 2020 Virginia base case were held in March 2022 at the Virginia Supreme Court with an anticipated final decision later this year.\nFERC recently initiated several rule-making proceedings related to transmission planning, cost allocation generation interconnection to the transmission grid and extreme weather preparedness. We support the commission in these actions and are in full support -- a full agreement that reform is needed to build the infrastructure necessary to transition our generation fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible while also helping achieve our carbon reduction goals.\nThese proposed rules align with AEP objective of developing a more robust, reliable and flexible grid of the future that ultimately reduces cost to customers and strengthens economic development in our communities.\nBefore I turn it over to Julie, I want to take a moment to thank our team for the incredible work that they are doing as we execute against our strategic objectives and deliver for our stakeholders. What's going on today at AEP is a perfect blend of the execution of Bachman-Turner Overdrive's \"Takin' Care Of Business\", with the edge of Prince's, \"Let's Go Crazy\", in a good sense, of course. We have an incredible market position, a bold mission and the foundation in place to achieve our goals and deliver on our vision of further modernizing our energy grid in order to supply reliable, cleaner, low-cost resources for all the communities we serve.\nAs we think about the future and the next chapter of AEP, we're excited to share more about our plans at AEP's upcoming Analyst Day on October 4 in New York City. We will provide additional detail soon and look forward to seeing you there.\nJulie, over to you.\n\nJulia A. Sloat\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Good morning, and thanks for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through our second quarter and year-to-date results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on our credit metrics and liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and then recap our current portfolio management activities underway.\nSo let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $1.02 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. GAAP earnings through June were $2.43 per share compared to $2.31 per share in 2021. There's a detailed reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 18 and 19 of the presentation today, but I'd like to call out three of the reconciling items that do not affect operating earnings, but relate to our asset optimization activities underway.\nSpecifically, you'll see that we made an adjustment to arrive at our operating for the quarter and year-to-date periods, consisting of Kentucky sale costs and the write-off of one of the unregulated universal scale wind projects that's included in the portfolio. We're in the process of preparing for sale. The Kentucky sale charge reflects an anticipated reduction in the sales price as we work with Liberty to accommodate adjustments for costs that have been identified through the regulatory approvals that we've received.\nTurning to the renewable investment write-off, the Flat Ridge 2 projects specifically has continued to see deteriorating performance due to equipment issues and transmission congestions to avoid an otherwise necessary repowering investment to address the performance issues and complicate our portfolio sales process, we elected to write off the equity investment and are in discussions with an interested party for the sale of ownership interest in Flat Ridge 2.\nConsequently, this will remove the Flat Ridge 2 project from the portfolio, we're preparing for auction, which should help improve the valuation opportunity as investors engage in the sales process, which is scheduled to launch no later than early September.\nLastly, I'll mention that we monetize some mineral rights, which give rise to a benefit to GAAP, but non-operating earnings, which helps offset the charges I just mentioned. So while I would typically not spend time walking through the GAAP to operating earning reconciliation. I thought it was appropriate at this time given the milestones we're clearing on the asset optimization front. And while these charges and gains are things that we need to recognize, they are entirely driven by our efforts to derisk, simplify and bring cash in the door to support our continued investment in the regulated business.\nSo with that, let's go to Slide #11 and walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance. Operating earnings for the second quarter totaled $1.20 per share or $618 million compared to $1.18 million per share or $590 million in 2021. Operating earnings for vertically integrated utilities were $0.59 per share, up $0.14. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather, primarily in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation in O&M and lower off-system sales.\nThis is a reminder on the O&M and depreciation front. As I mentioned on the first quarter call and included in our 2022 guidance details because of a change in accounting related to the Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M, we're seeing approximately $0.05 of favorable O&M offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact.\nAnd so I'll have a little more to share on loan performance, and I'll get to that in a minute here. So just hang with me. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.32 per share, up $0.01 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, load, positive weather in Texas and Ohio and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M in depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.27 per share, down $0.07 compared to last year, favorable investment growth of $0.03 was more than offset by an unfavorable true-up of $0.07. As I mentioned last quarter, this is consistent with our guidance.\nOur 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 in year-over-year as a result of the $0.12 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that occurred this quarter and some favorable on comparisons on the tax and financing side. This segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth, as you well know.\nGeneration and Marketing produced $0.18 per share, up $0.09 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites as well as increased generation margins and land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.15 per share, driven by lower investment gains, increased income taxes and unfavorable interest. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the second quarter of 2021 that have reversed this year. The increased income taxes are related to the reduction of a consolidating tax adjustment at the parent.\nLet's turn to Slide 12 and our year-to-date operating earnings performance. Year-to-date operating earnings totaled $2.42 per share or $1.234 billion compared to $2.33 per share or $1.160 billion in 2021. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $1.18 per share, up $0.18. Similar to the quarter, favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, positive weather, mainly in our western jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and normalized retail load and income taxes. These items were somewhat offset by increased depreciation and lower off-system sales.\nOnce again, the change in accounting around the Rockport Unit 2 lease results in $0.11 of favorable O&M offset by $0.11 of favorable -- unfavorable depreciation. The Transmission & Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.62 per share, up $0.08 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio and increased normalized retail load and transmission revenue.\nOffsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.62 per share, down $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable investment growth of $0.05 was more than offset by unfavorable true-up of $0.07 and increased property taxes. The Generation & Marketing segment produced $0.21 per share, up $0.05 from last year. The positive variance is primarily due to the sale of renewable development sites and increased wholesale margins, offset by lower retail margins.\nFinally, Corporate and Other was down $0.16 per share, driven by lower investment gains, unfavorable interest and increased O&M. The lower investment gains, again, are largely related to charge point gains that we had in 2021 that have reversed this year.\nTurning to Slide 13. I'm going to provide an update on our normalized load and performance for the quarter. And in general sense, the AEP service territory has made significant momentum despite the well-publicized headwinds impacting the macro economy. Starting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by 1.2% in the second quarter and were up 1% year-to-date compared to 2021.\nThis growth was comprised of growth in both customer counts and weather-normalized usage for both comparisons. While the results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth was in the AEP Texas service territory, which consistently has the strongest customer growth across the AEP system due to favorable demographics.\nMoving to the right. Weather normalized commercial sales were up 4.1% compared to last year for both the quarter and year-to-date comparison. This consistent growth in 2022 is spread throughout the service territory. The growth in the commercial sales segment was spread across every operating company and 9 of our 10 commercial sectors, the only top commercial sector that is down versus last year's hospitals, which makes sense given that hospitalizations have dropped since early in the pandemic.\nOn the flip side, the fastest-growing commercial sector is data centers were loaded up 32% compared to last year. Finally, focusing on the lower left corner you see that industrial sales posted another strong quarter, up 5% for the quarter and up 5.3% year-to-date compared to last year. Industrial sales were up at every operating company in most of our largest sectors. We experienced double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing and oil and gas extraction. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, paper manufacturing, petroleum products and coal mining.\nTo summarize, we've experienced broad-based growth throughout the service territory on top of a recovery year. Every operating company has increased its sales in 2022 compared to last year. Growth is also consistent across every major retail class and most of the top commercial and industrial sectors served by AEP.\nWe know the headlines are full of messages about a pending recession, but our sales statistics through the first half of the year show our service territory is still firmly in the expansion phase of the business cycle. We're mindful of the difficult monetary policy, decisions being contemplated by the Federal Reserve to address inflationary pressures in the economy and recognize some of these decisions could impact our customers' growth opportunities going forward. But so far, we're seeing little evidence that has dampened the economic activity within our footprint through the first 2 quarters of this year.\nMoving to Slide 14. I want to provide additional context to the load we experience -- we've experienced so far in 2022 and how it compares to our pre-pandemic sales levels. Starting with the chart on the left, the bars show how the second quarter sales compared to the pre-pandemic baseline in the second quarter of 2019. You'll notice that the total retail sales are 3.6% above pre-pandemic levels. Furthermore, every class is showing higher sales than before the pandemic began. This means that every class is fully recovered and is in the expansion phase of the business cycle.\nThe chart on the right shows the same comparisons for the year-to-date period. You'll notice that while the numbers are slightly different, the message is the same. Through June, AEP's normalized sales are 2% above the pre-pandemic levels. And just like the quarter, every class has exceeded pre-pandemic levels on a year-to-date basis.\nLast year's strong growth numbers were expected, considering it was a recovery year from the pandemic shutdowns. This year's growth is perhaps even more impressive considering the growth as compared to a strong recovery year. We'll continue to monitor the economy and its impact on our load over the summer months, and we'll provide the results of our updated load forecast this fall.\nSo let's move on to Slide 15 to discuss the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio decreased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 61.4%. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see that our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.4% on a Moody's basis and 13.3% on a GAAP basis which is a decrease of 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, from the prior quarter. The slight decrease can be attributed to an increase in deferred fuel balances as well as a slight increase in balance sheet debt.\nAs we stated on our last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward our targeted FFO to debt range of 14% to 15% as the year progresses. You can see our liquidity summary on the lower right of the slide, our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and our 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $4.7 billion.\nOn the qualified pension front, while our funding status decreased 0.8% during the quarter, it remains comfortably strong at 105.6%. Negative returns on risk seeking and fixed income assets during the quarter were the primary drivers of the funding's status decrease. However, rising interest rates caused plan liabilities to decrease, which provided a favorable offset to the negative asset returns.\nSo let's go to Slide 16 for a quick recap of today's message. The second quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022, and we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range of $4.87 to $5.07. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7%. We continue to work through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and are on track for a closing later this summer, and we'll be launching the auction process for our unregulated contracted renewables business no later than early September.\nSo before I invite -- hand this over to the operator, I'd like to mention one thing. We had previously announced that we would be having an investor conference this year, and we've set a date for that. As Nick mentioned, we'll be hosting at our investor conference in New York City on October 4. So we really do appreciate your time and attention today. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and take any questions that you have.",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVP of IR, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Katie. Good morning everyone and welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides, and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com. Today, we will be making forward looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas K. Akins\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Darcy, and welcome everyone to American Electric Power's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm pleased to be able to share another strong quarter with you during which we have set a great foundation for the year with many exciting opportunities ahead. For the purposes of today's call, I will begin by providing a brief recap of our financial performance, highlighting the various refinements we have made to our strategic initiatives and financial targets since year end. I will then provide an update on our Kentucky sale process before turning to our contracted renewable asset sale and regulated renewables execution strategy and progress. Finally, I will end with a few insights into our other ongoing regulatory activities. Building off our momentum coming out of our fourth quarter, our direction and strategy remain well on track. We continue to focus on generation fleet transformation and making investments in our energy delivery infrastructure to support decarbonization and expanded electrification while simultaneously simplifying and derisking our business profile. On the heels of reporting our strongest ever fourth quarter, we are maintaining that momentum and delivering strong results for the first quarter of 2022, with operating earnings for the first quarter coming in at $1.22 per share or $616 million.\nEarlier this year, we made a number of refinements to our strategic initiatives and financial targets. We raised our 2022 operating earnings guidance range and increased our long-term earnings growth rate, and we have hit the ground running in 2022. Today, we are reaffirming 2022 full year operating earnings guidance. As a reminder, we are guiding to a range of $4.87 to $5.07 per share for 2022, with a $4.97 midpoint, and we also reaffirm our long-term earnings growth rate of 6% to 7%.\nAs you'll recall, we announced several significant developments in connection with last quarter's earnings. In addition to lifting our 14% to 15% FFO to debt targeted range, we announced the decision to sell all or a portion of contracted renewable assets within the unregulated business. The announcement of this strategic divestiture allowed us to recalibrate our 5-year capital plan of $38 billion with a $1.5 billion shift to transmission and the elimination of growth capital in the contracted renewables business.\nWe are already seeing the positive impacts of these initiatives in quarter 1, and we look forward to continue to execute in these important areas throughout the course of the year. We also expect to maintain positive momentum in our economic outlook as we work collaboratively with states to drive economic expansion in our service territory.\nThere is more to come on all of that, but I first want to take a step back and highlight some of the other proactive work our team has done. As macro trends continue to affect our industry and the economic landscape at large, we are focused on derisking our platform and elevating our strategy to enhance shareholder value.\nFor example, given lingering global supply chain issues, we are diversifying our mix of suppliers in order to reduce the impact on our capital investment plan. As a result, AEP has experienced minimal customer or business disruptions to date. With these significant initiatives underway and a track record of thinking creatively, it is truly a team effort, and we are lucky to have one of the most talented teams in the business.\nRegarding Kentucky, we expect to complete the sale of Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco to Liberty in the second quarter of this year. A regulatory timeline of the sale is on Slide 7 of today's presentation. In 2021, we announced a comprehensive strategic review of our Kentucky operations, resulting in an agreement to sell those assets for $2.846 billion enterprise value.\nBoth parties have been steadily working to obtain the necessary approvals to complete this transaction, which is in the public interest. The Kentucky Public Service Commission hearing was held on March 28 and March 29. We know that Liberty is well positioned to serve Kentucky customers and are confident our employees in Kentucky will continue to thrive within an organization that prioritizes safety and operational excellence. Based on the statutory requirements, we continue to expect to receive a decision from the commission on the sale transfer no later than May 4.\nFERC approval on the sales transfer is also in process. Earlier this week, FERC notified us of a need for more information in the 203 transfer application. This request is not unusual as FERC looks to ensure its record is complete by seeking additional information. We do not believe this request will impact the closing of the deal in the second quarter.\nOnce the decision is made by the state level next week, we will provide the requested information back to FERC. We'll plan to ask FERC to apply by the original approval time line to ensure Kentucky customers receive benefits from this transaction in a timely manner.\nAnother significant regulatory milestone for the transaction is gaining approvals on the Mitchell operating agreement, which are a condition of the final sale transfer. Both Kentucky and West Virginia are aware that updated (inaudible) operating agreement approvals are needed to put in place the commission orders on environmental compliance issued in 2021.\nThe Kentucky Public Service Commission hearings were held on March 1 and March 30, and the West Virginia Public Service Commission was held on April 7. Parties providing options allowing flexibility for both states to collaborate and reach a common agreement as Kentucky continues to wind down interest in Mitchell plant post-2028. We expect to receive commission decisions on the Mitchell agreements on an expedited basis in May of this year. We plan to file the related FERC application after state commission approvals.\nThroughout the process, we have established a strong record of benefits of this transaction, most notably the clear and measurable customer benefits that we see.\nOkay. Now moving on to the contracted renewable asset sales. During our fourth quarter earnings call in February, we announced the decision to sell all or a portion of our unregulated contracted renewables portfolio to simplify and derisk the company and allow us to focus on our regulated business.\nOur portfolio consists of 1,600 megawatts of unregulated contracted renewables, the sale of which will help facilitate the investment of 16,000 megawatts of regulated renewables through 2030. In the last couple of months, we have made significant progress on this opportunity, including working with an adviser, preparing outside consultant reviews of the technical and market aspects of our portfolio and evaluating our sales strategy and timing. Interest in the sale of the portfolio has been robust. The sale provides a unique opportunity to acquire large operating wind portfolio complemented with some solar operations as well.\nWe expect to launch the sales process sometime during the second half of 2022, likely in the August, September time frame and can be accelerated or deaccelerated as needed. Additionally, we are pleased to announce that we have signed a term sheet to sell most of our wind and solar development portfolio, including 5 sites, which are located in Southwest Power Pool. We have also executed an agreement to sell a solar development site here in Ohio. Financial details of these upcoming sales are confidential and will not be disclosed but demonstrate our commitment toward that execution.\nThe reallocation of contracted renewables capital is assumed in our guidance, but utilization of proceeds has not yet reflected in guidance or our multiyear financing plan. We will seek to maximize the transaction proceeds in the sale, avoid dilution and direct the proceeds to investments in our regulated business as we continue to enhance the transmission infrastructure and move forward with our generation fleet transformation.\nLooking ahead, we will continue our track record of optimizing the portfolio and reallocating capital to our regulated business, where we continue to see a meaningful long-term opportunity for growth.\nAEP is making significant progress as well in our transition to a clean energy future. In fact, we already have several initiatives underway in line with our sustainability goals and through our regulated renewables execution. Details can be seen on Slides 8 and 9.\nIn March, we commissioned our third and final North Central Wind site, Traverse Wind Energy Center, which is the largest single wind farm built at one time in North America and one of the largest wind facilities worldwide, completing the $2 billion trifecta investment that includes Sundance and the Maverick Wind energy centers. Combined, they are providing 1,484 megawatts of clean energy to our customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma. North Central will save customers an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years.\nIn March, we also issued a request for proposal at I&M for 800 megawatts of wind and 500 megawatts of solar. Additional RFPs are in process simultaneously at APCo, PSO and SWEPCO with expected in-service dates to 2024 to 2025. We expect to make a regulatory filing in the second quarter of this year related to the SWEPCO's June 2021 RFP. These are long-term investments, not just for our business and our local communities but for the global environment as well.\nThough our current state of coal retirements, we are progressing towards our target of an 80% carbon emissions reduction rate by 2030 and net 0 by 2050. Achieving this goal is an integral part of our long-term strategy to prioritize and regulate investment opportunities and transition our generation portfolio. Our plans are very well thought out: continue the movement to a clean energy economy, but remain firmly grounded in the principles of resiliency, reliability and affordability while recognizing the value of a diverse portfolio of resources, particularly given today's world of energy-related volatility.\nLast year, we set regulatory foundations in a series of rate cases across multiple jurisdictions. Regulated ROE as of March 31, 2022, is at a steady 9.2% as we continue to work through regulatory cases and focus on reducing authorized versus actual ROE spreads.\nI&M obtained commission approval in February on our Indiana base case settlement. Oral arguments of APCo's 2020 Virginia base case appeal were held in March at the Virginia Supreme Court with an anticipated final decision this year.\nWe expect to see commission decisions as well on SWEPCO's rate cases this year in both Arkansas and Louisiana and look forward to keeping you that progress, too.\n[Delay] the FERC. We commend the commission for moving forward with proposed reforms to transmission planning and cost allocation. First proposed rule making aligns with our goal developing a more robust, reliable and flexible grid of the future that ultimately reduces cost to customers and strengthens economic development in the communities in which we serve.\nWe believe many of these reforms are needed to build the infrastructure necessary to transition our generation fleet in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible and achieve our carbon reduction goals. We look forward to continuing to work collaboratively with the commission on this and any subsequent rule makings and with the RTOs on implementing any new requirements.\nAt the conclusion of our fourth quarter call, I told you all that AEP has been poised to make even greater headway in 2022. And I think it's fair to say, we are making good on that promise. Capitalizing on our momentum from 2021, we have continued to execute against our strategic objectives steadily and successfully. As we think about what's next for this year and beyond, we hope to further modernize our energy grid in order to supply reliable, cleaner, low-cost resources for all the communities we serve. We will also consider further asset rotation through the lens of derisking and simplification, and we'll evaluate any and all value-additive potential activities as we focus on our regulated business.\nAs I've said before, AEP is in a very unique position, the largest transmission system, one of the largest renewables buildout and a diverse territory to adjust from the risk of supply chain, load forecast, regulatory risks, et cetera, AEP is the very definition of consistency and opportunity. We, at AEP, as well as our shareholders and customers, hold ourselves accountable on the continual execution of all of these strategic objectives. To paraphrase a big hit by the Police, every breath you take, every move you make, every step you take, we'll be watching AEP.\nAnd as our CFO would say, we've got this. Julie?\n\nJulia A. Sloat\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be to you this morning. Thanks for dialing in, everyone. I'm going to walk us through our first quarter results, share some updates on our service territory load and finish with commentary on our credit metrics, liquidity as well as some thoughts on our guidance, financial targets and recap our current portfolio management activities underway.\nSo let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter. GAAP earnings for the first quarter were $1.41 per share compared to $1.16 per share in 2021. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Page 16 of the presentation today.\nLet's work through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the first quarter totaled $1.22 per share or $616 million compared to $1.15 per share or $571 million in 2021. Operating earnings for the Vertically Integrated Utilities were $0.59 per share, up $0.05. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, normalized load and O&M. They were somewhat offset by increased depreciation, lower off-system sales and wholesale load.\nI'd like to take a second to talk about O&M and depreciation, in particular, because of a change in accounting related to Rockport Unit 2 lease at I&M. We'll see approximately a $0.05 contribution of favorable O&M consequence, offset by $0.05 of unfavorable depreciation in each quarter of 2022, but no consequential earnings impact. And to be clear, this is entirely consistent with the 2022 guidance details we posted in our investor presentations earlier this year.\nMore to share on load performance here in a minute so hang with me on this. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.30 per share, up $0.07 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes in Texas and Ohio, normalized load and transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable O&M and depreciation. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $0.34 per share, down $0.01 compared to last year. Investment growth was favorable by $0.03, offset by $0.02 of mainly property taxes driven by the increased investment and $0.01 of income taxes.\nThis is in line with the guidance that we provided to you earlier this year. You'll recall that our 2022 guidance had this segment down by $0.08 year-over-year as a result of the $0.20 of investment growth being more than offset by the annual true-up that will occur in the second quarter and some unfavorable comparisons on the tax and financing side. As you know, this segment continues to be an important part of our 6% to 7% EPS growth.\nGeneration & Marketing produced $0.03 per share, down $0.03 from last year. The improvement in wholesale margins was more than offset by lower retail margins and reduced generation. You may recall that storm Uri had an unfavorable impact on wholesale margins in the first quarter of 2021.\nFinally, Corporate and Other was down $0.01 per share, driven by increased O&M, lower investment gains and unfavorable interest. These were offset by favorable income taxes. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the first quarter of 2021.\nTurning to Slide 12. I'll provide an update on our normalized load performance for the quarter. In a general sense, the AEP service territory is extremely fertile for economic growth right now. In fact, as of the first quarter, our load has officially fully recovered from a pandemic recession and has now transitioned into the expansionary phase of this business cycle.\nStarting in the upper left corner, normalized residential sales increased by 0.8% compared to the first quarter of 2021. This growth was composed of growth in both customer counts and weather normalized usage for the quarter. While results were mixed by operating company, the strongest residential growth was at the AEP service -- was in the AEP Texas service territory, which was partially influenced by the year-over-year comparison given the customer outages driven by Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021.\nA final data point to share regarding residential sales is that our first quarter sales were still 1.1% above their pre-pandemic levels over 2 years after the pandemic began. This is driven by a number of factors, including higher numbers of people who are able to work remotely that used to work in offices prior to the pandemic.\nMoving to the right, weather-normalized commercial sales increased by 4.2% compared to the first quarter of 2021. The growth in commercial sales is spread across every operating company in most industries. The largest increase in commercial sales is coming from data centers, whose load was up 33% compared to last year.\nIn addition, we continue to see strong recovery in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic, such as hotels, schools and churches. Real estate has been booming throughout the entire pandemic. AEP's normalized commercial sales in the first quarter were 2.5% above their pre-pandemic levels, which shows that we've gone beyond recovery and are now in full expansion mode across the territory.\nIf I can now focus your attention on the lower left corner, you'll see that industrial sales posted another very strong quarter, up 5.6% compared to last year. Industrial sales were up at most operating companies in many of our largest sectors in the first quarter.\nWe expect double-digit growth in a number of key industries this quarter, including chemicals, manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, petroleum and petroleum products. We also saw robust growth in primary metals manufacturing, coal mining and food manufacturing. Having said that, first quarter industrial sales are still 1.6% behind their pre-pandemic levels. However, we have a large number of customer expansions that are expected to come on later this year and still fully expect to eclipse our pre-COVID industrial sales levels in 2022. We continue to be confident in our full year 2022 guidance for normalized retail load.\nWhile we certainly did not anticipate the Russian invasion in Ukraine when we developed the 2022 forecast, I'd like to remind you that AEP service territory is uniquely positioned to benefit from higher energy prices given the concentration of energy production that is located throughout the AEP footprint. Energy producers in our footprint have responded to higher energy prices, which has resulted in increased economic activity throughout the service territory.\nFinally, when you pull it all together in the lower right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 3.2% for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, our load has gone beyond recovery mode and is in full expansion mode. For the quarter, every operating company posted a higher normalized sales than last year. Furthermore, our first quarter retail sales were up -- were 0.5% above their prepandemic level. So 50 basis points above pre-pandemic levels.\nTo use a sports analogy, I would say our load performance in the first quarter was in the zone. There are many factors outside of our control that could influence our results. I want to stress that the positive load story we shared with you today is largely the result of intentional efforts by our employees to promote economic development as a part of our long-term strategy to strengthen the communities that we serve. We're fully aware of the increased uncertainty that exists in the macro economy. But have put in work that it takes to ensure that we continue to see growth in our service territory going forward.\nSo let's go over to Page 13 to check on the company's capitalization and liquidity position. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-cap ratio increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter to 61.5%, primarily due to an increase in equity from our issuance of AEP common stock in March, which is consistent with our 2022 guidance as the $805 million -- or the $805 million of equity units we issued 3 years ago converted to equity.\nLet's talk about our FFO to debt metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant on this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric stands at 13.7% on both a Moody's and a GAAP basis, which is an increase of 3.8% and 3.9%, respectively, from the prior quarter. The metrics are calculated off of the 12-month rolling FFO total. So the increase in FFO to debt is mainly a result of the fact that the cash flow drag from February 2021, winter storm Uri has now dropped off the cash flow from operations calculations. This improvement has significantly narrowed the gap toward achieving our FFO to debt target range of 14% to 15%. As we stated on the last earnings call, we anticipate trending toward this target range as the year progresses.\nLet's take a quick moment to visit our liquidity summary on right side of Slide 13. Our 5-year $4 billion bank revolver and 2-year $1 billion revolving credit facility support our liquidity position, which remains strong at $3.8 billion.\nSwitching gears, our qualified pension funding increased 1.6% during the quarter to 106.4%. The rise in interest rates that decreased planned liabilities was a primary driver for this quarter's gain in funded status.\nLet's go to Slide 14. This quarter has provided a solid foundation for the rest of 2022, and we're reaffirming our operating earnings guidance range $4.87 per share to $5.07 per share. We continue to be committed to our long-term growth rate of 6% to 7% that we updated on our last earnings call. We're working through the Kentucky Power sale to Liberty and expect to close in the second quarter. And as Nick mentioned, we've signed an agreement to sell a solar development site in Ohio and have entered into a term sheet to sell 5 additional wind and solar sites in SPP on the unregulated side of the business.\nAdditionally, we're preparing to market the unregulated contracted renewables portfolio in the second half of this year and are receiving a significant amount of interest on this. Beyond the portfolio optimization, activity is underway. We remain focused on the fundamentals, which are executing on the regulated renewables plan, disciplined capital allocation and securing positive regulatory outcomes.\nBefore we break, I want to mention one last thing before we get to your questions. And that's to remind everyone that while we have not yet set the date, we will be doing an investor conference sometime in late September or early fall time frame to give you a broader AEP update.\nWe surely do appreciate your time and attention today. With that, I'm going to ask the operator to open the call so we can hear what's on your mind and to answer the questions that you have.",

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Darcy Reese. Please go ahead.\n\nDarcy Reese\n\nVP of IR, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cynthia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call for American Electric Power. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at aep.com.\nToday, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.\nJoining me this morning for opening remarks are Nick Akins, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Julie Sloat, our Chief Financial Officer. We will take your questions following their remarks. I will now turn the call over to Nick.\n\nNicholas K. Akins\n\nChairman, President & CEO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thanks, Darcy. Welcome, everyone, to American Electric Power's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm sure you all had time to read the earnings release and have seen all that we were able to accomplish in 2021. As we saw the results of several regulatory-related cases, it actually came in after the financial last November. AEP has come into 2022 flying high. The lyrics of a song by Lionel Richie and the Commodores actually the first concert or actually catered backstage when I was younger. Flying High says, I knew we could make it from the beginning.\nAEP has now moved from 4% to 6% to 5% to 7% to 6% to 7% long-term growth rate because of our purposeful steps to enhance growth opportunities and derisk the AEP portfolio. This process will continue. We so have so much to look forward to in 2022. But for the purpose of today's call, I'm going to start by providing a brief recap of our financial performance and then I want to talk about the evolution and the next steps we are taking in the execution of our business strategy as well as the impact on our financing targets as we hone in on both our regulated generation transformation and our energy delivery infrastructure investments.\nThese are continued refinements that we believe will not only allow us to better serve our customers, but will generate enhanced value for our investors as well. Finally, I will provide an update on the various strategic and regulatory initiatives that are already underway. Starting with the recap of financial highlights, we reported strong results for the fourth quarter, navigating difficult macro headwinds while maintaining our balance sheet and increasing our quarterly dividend.\nIn fact, this quarter was our strongest ever fourth quarter, coming in above consensus estimates with fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $1.07 per share and operating earnings of $0.98 per share bringing our GAAP and operating earnings to $4.97 per share and $4.74 per share year-to-date, respectively.\nOur strong financial performance in the quarter generated regulated ROE of 9.2% with improved equity layers and enabled us to increase the quarter's dividend from $0.74 to $0.78 per share as announced in October of '21. Our performance rests firmly on the regulatory foundations laid this past year with a series of rate case activity across our jurisdictions.\nSince EEI, we've received constructive base case orders in Ohio and Oklahoma and we reached a settlement in Indiana that the commission approved yesterday and we anticipate shortly finalizing our other base rate cases in SWEPCO and PSO. Our management team continues to make significant headway in our strategic growth plan and transformation.\nIn 2021, the comprehensive strategic review of our Kentucky operations resulted in an agreement to sell Kentucky Power and AEP Kentucky Transco for more than $2.8 billion. After receiving the necessary regulatory approvals, we expect this sale to close in the second quarter of 2022, notwithstanding the recent withdrawal of our FERC-related -- FERC filing related to the Mitchell operating agreement.\nThe completion of this transaction is expected to net AEP approximately $1.45 billion in cash after taxes and transaction fees, proceeds we will use to invest in regulated renewables and transmission. AEP is building on a strong record of actively managing our portfolio to support our growth as we invest in a clean energy future while delivering increased returns to shareholders. An integral part of our long-term strategy is the prioritization of AEP's regulated investment opportunities and the optimization of our assets. To that end, today, we are announcing the elimination of growth capital allocated to the contracted renewables in our 2022 to 2026 forecast and our intent to ultimately sell all or a portion of our contracted renewables portfolio in our Generation & Marketing business segment to help fund our growing capital requirements in our regulated portfolio.\nIn making this decision, our team carefully considered the renewable opportunities in the context of our competitive business, existing competition in the space, our ability to efficiently monetize the PTC's ITC tax credits as regulated opportunities come to fruition, the attention needed to manage the size of this business relative to our overall regulated business and the potential value this business represents to others who are committed to contracted renewable development and operations.\nWe are fully confident that the sale of this portfolio will both simplify and derisk our business while allowing us to allocate proceeds and assign additional capital to our regulated business where we see a meaningful pipeline of investment opportunities to better serve our customers and participate in the energy transition.\nThis shift in direction enables us to recalibrate our 2022 to 2026 capital plan shifting approximately $1.5 billion of investment capital to transmission and raising it to $14.4 billion of the $38 billion 5-year plan. The capital originally allocated to the unregulated generation in the marketing segment will drop from $1.7 billion of the $38 billion 5-year plan to $400 million. The remaining $400 million in the Generation & Marketing segment will be largely allocated to maintenance capital and distributed generation assets.\nOur investment opportunities remain dynamic. And AEP operating companies will continue to develop integrated resource plans and grid enhancement plans over the near and long term in collaboration with stakeholders. This process continues to make substantial progress as shown on Slide 43 of the earnings deck. Overall, we are targeting wind additions of approximately 8.6 gigawatts of solar additions of approximately 6.6 gigawatts by 2030. For which we have allocated $8.2 billion in our current 5-year capital plan. This -- the migration from contracted renewables to significant increases in regulated renewables will ensure that AEP maintains the talent and resources to execute this plan.\nThe capital plan also includes $24.8 billion allocated to grid investments. With the changes discussed and the expected completion of the sale of Kentucky Power, we plan on an Analyst Day presentation soon after the sale is completed to further update on all of these important initiatives. Now shifting gears to our regulated renewables opportunity. AEP has a positive record of actively managing its portfolio to support the growth of the company as we invest in our regulated business and renewable generation to transform and build a cleaner, more modern energy system, and we made significant progress on our regulated renewables opportunity in 2021. Our plan is to reduce carbon emissions by 80% by 2030 and achieve net 0 by 2050 is well underway.\nThe 998-megawatt Traverse project, the largest single wind farm built at one time in North America is in the final stages of commissioning, and we expect the facility to go on launch soon. The combined investment in the Traverse project along with Maverick and Sundance, which both became operational in 2021 represent investment in renewable energy of approximately $2 billion and will save PSO and SWEPCO customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma an estimated $3 billion in electricity costs over the next 30 years.\nThese 3 projects add 1,484 megawatts of regulated renewable energy to our portfolio, and we recently issued RFPs for renewable resources for 1.1 gigawatts at APCo and 1.3 gigawatts at I&M. We expect to make regulatory filings and obtain the necessary approvals for projects selected from RFP processes at APCo, I&M, PSO and SWEPCO. We are truly transforming the energy grid to better integrate renewable resources, delivering the low-cost, reliable energy that our customers rely on while simultaneously empowering positive social, economic and environmental change in the communities we serve, and we believe we can successfully enhance shareholder returns in the process.\nFinally and significantly, I'd like to speak to a few developments that highlight the economic vitality and prospects of the communities we serve. Our economic development team has been focusing on working collaboratively with our states to drive expansion within our service territory. As you know, in January, Intel announced plans to build 2 new leading-edge chip manufacturing facilities in Ohio for an initial investment of more than $20 billion. Over in West Virginia, Nucor announced in January they will build its new $2.7 billion state-of-the-art facility in Mason County, West Virginia. Further, TAT Technologies will be moving its thermal components activities from Israel to Tulsa bringing 900 jobs to the region. In total, our economic development team reported 1,900 megawatts of new load, supporting over 20,000 new jobs announced in 2021 and thus far in 2022.\nAs evidenced by these wins, we are proud to play a vital part in the infrastructure that enables job-creating projects of this kind in our service territories. Moreover, in today's environment, especially in today's environment, as companies in our country focus on energy and supply chain security, our service territory is primed to benefit. We are committed to remaining a good steward for the communities in which we operate as we transition to a clean energy future. Through our just transition effort, we support affected communities through coal plants retirement, by providing job placement services for displaced workers, fact-based replacement and funding sources to support diversification. This just transition program has been applied as a model for the country and enabling positive social and economic transitions for affected communities.\nAs I said at the outset, we have a lot to look forward to in 2022. As we recast our capital allocation and derisk the business, we feel confident in lifting and tightening our earnings growth target range from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%. It has always been my preference to be in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. And since we have demonstrated a track record of being able to deliver on these projections year in and year out, we are electing to revise the range to 6% to 7%. Accordingly, we will be lifting our 2022 operating earnings guidance range by $0.02 to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, with a midpoint of $4.97 to reflect the increase in growth rate target range.\nLastly, we are increasing our funds from operations to debt target to a range of 14% to 15% from 13.5% to 15%, which we mentioned at November EEI. Throughout this process and beyond, we will be committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We discussed this at November EEI and can confirm that our FFO to debt and credit metrics have improved markedly as we expected. Over the past decade, AEP has achieved impressive and sustained long-term growth, consistently meeting and exceeding earnings projections while continuing to raise guidance.\nOur highly qualified Board and management team are executing a strategic plan that leverages AEP's scale, financial strength, effective portfolio management and diversity of regulatory jurisdictions to deliver safe, clean and reliable services for our customers while creating significant value for all AEP shareholders. We are also committed to examining and looking beyond the traditional forms of equity to fund the growth going forward, and our track record since 2015 in asset sales have been active and produce accretive opportunities for our shareholders. Our transformation strategy is working, and the investments we are making will continue to support our solid earnings growth and results.\nAEP stands poised to make great headway in 2022. And continue to capitalize on this momentum. Our organic growth opportunities for the next decade and our consistent ability to execute against our plan, make it possible to set our sights high for this year and beyond. Before I hand things over to Julie, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the unwavering commitment and dedication of our employees. In the midst of another storm-filled winter, our employees have continued to prioritize the safety and security of our customers across all of our jurisdictions with significant ice storms impacting most of our territory in the past few weeks. I have been truly humbled by their tireless efforts to deliver on our initiatives and provide for our communities. Ultimately, their passion for the work we do is what makes our business so extraordinary.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Julie, who is going to walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Julie?\n\nJulia A. Sloat\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, American Electric Power Company, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Thank you very much. Thanks, Darcy. It's good to be with everyone this morning. Thanks for everyone -- thanks, everyone, for dialing in. I'm going to walk us through the fourth quarter and full year results and then share some updates on our service territory load and then finish with some commentary on our financing plans, credit metrics and liquidity as well, some thoughts on our revised guidance, financial targets and portfolio management.\nSo let's go to Slide 10, which shows the comparison of GAAP to operating earnings for the quarter and year-to-date periods. GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $1.07 per share $0.88 per share in 2020. GAAP earnings for the year were $4.97 per share compared to $4.44 per share in 2020. There's a reconciliation of GAAP to operating earnings on Pages 17 and 18 of the presentation today.\nLet's walk through our quarterly operating earnings performance by segment, which is on Slide 11. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $0.98 per share or $496 million compared to $0.87 per share or $433 million in 2020. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $0.39 per share, up $0.08. Favorable drivers included rate changes across multiple jurisdictions, increased transmission revenue and lower income tax. These items were somewhat offset by lower normalized growth and higher depreciation. I'll talk about load a little bit more here in a minute. The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment earned $0.25 per share, up $0.06 compared to last year. Favorable drivers in this segment included rate changes, normalized load and transmission revenues. Offsetting these favorable items were unfavorable December weather and increased depreciation.\nThe AEP Transmission Holdco segment continued to grow, contributing $0.33 per share, which was an improvement of $0.06 driven by the return on the investment growth. Generation and Marketing produced $0.06 per share, up $0.01 from last year, largely due to favorable income taxes, wholesale margins, offset by lower generation in land sales. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.10 per share, driven by lower investment gains and unfavorable income taxes. The lower investment gains are largely related to charge point gains that we had in the fourth quarter of last year.\nLet's have a look at our year-to-date results on Slide 12. Operating earnings for 2021 totaled $4.74 or $2.4 billion compared to $4.44 per share or $2.2 billion in 2020. Looking at the drivers by segment. Operating earnings for the vertically integrated utilities were $2.26 per share, up $0.05 due to rate changes across multiple or various operating companies, favorable weather and increased transmission revenue. Offsetting these favorable variances were higher O&M as we return to a more normal level of O&M, increased depreciation expense and lower normalized retail load primarily in the residential class. On the transmission and distribution utilities segment, they earned $1.10 per share, up $0.07 from last year. Earnings in this segment were up due to higher transmission revenue, rate changes and increased normalized retail load which is mainly in the residential and commercial classes.\nOffsetting these favorable variances were increases in O&M, depreciation and other taxes, essentially property taxes related to the increased investment levels. The AEP Transmission Holdco segment contributed $1.35 per share, up $0.32 from last year related to investment growth and a favorable year-over-year true-up. Generation and Marketing produced $0.26 per share, down $0.10 last -- from last year, largely due to favorable onetime items in the prior year associated with the downward revision of the Oklaunion ARO liability in contemplation of the plant shut down and the sale of the Conesville plant. Additionally, while we had land sales in both years, the level of sales was lower in 2021 versus 2020. Finally, Corporate and Other was down $0.04 per share. You'll notice that we aren't talking about investment gains in the year-to-date as we had a lot of timing differences across the quarters between 2020 and 2021, but net-net, we're flat for the year. The year-over-year decline in this segment was primarily driven by slightly higher O&M, interest expense and income taxes.\nLet's go to Slide 13 and I'll update you on our normalized load performance for the quarter. Let me begin by providing you with a couple of interesting stats that highlight the status of the recovery throughout the AEP service territory. The first is the fact that we ended the year within 0.2% of our pre-pandemic sales levels and fully expect to exceed those levels in 2022. AEP's normalized load growth in 2021 was the strongest we've experienced in over a decade driven by the historic economic recovery throughout the service territory. And to build on that, our current projection suggests that 2022 will be the second strongest year for load growth over the past decade following behind 2021.\nSo let's start in the upper left corner. Normalized residential sales were down 1.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, bringing the annual decrease in residential sales in 2021 to 1.1%. The decline was spread across every operating company. However, the decline in residential sales in 2021 was largely driven by the comparison basis of 2020 when COVID restrictions were at their highest levels even though residential sales were down compared to 2020, they were still 2% above their pre-pandemic levels in 2019. In addition, residential customer accounts increased by 0.7% in 2021, which was the second strongest year for customer growth in over a decade. Customer growth was nearly twice as strong in the West, up 0.9% when compared to the East territory, which was up 0.5%. The last item to point out on the residential chart is that you'll notice that we added the projected 2022 growth to the right of the chart. We're projecting a modest decrease in residential sales in 2022, recognizing that there will not be likely another fiscal stimulus to boost the economy in 2022, like we had in the past 2 years.\nSo moving over to the right, weather normalized commercial sales increased by 4.3% for both the quarter and the annual comparison. This made 2021 the strongest year for commercial sales in AEP history. 2021 included a strong bounce back in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic, such as schools, churches and hotels. But the strongest growth in commercial sales came from the growth in data centers, especially in Central Ohio. Looking forward, we expect a modest decline in commercial sales growth in 2022, recognizing the challenging conditions businesses are managing with inflation, the labor shortages and higher interest rates expected in 2022.\nSo if we move to the lower left corner, you'll see that the industrial sales also posted a very strong quarter. Industrial sales for the quarter increased by 2.4%, bringing the annual growth up to 3.7%. Industrial sales were up at most operating companies in the quarter and mainly -- in many of the largest sectors. Looking forward, we're projecting 5.7% growth in the industrial sales in 2022. This is mostly the result of the number of new large customer expansions that will be coming online as a result of our continued focus on economic development.\nFinally, when you pull it all together in the lower right corner, you'll see that AEP's normalized retail sales increased by 1.4% for the quarter and ended the year up 2.1% above 2020 levels. By all indications, the recovery from the pandemic has locked a year and our service territory is positioned to benefit from the future economic growth.\nLet's have a quick look at the company's capitalization and liquidity position beginning on Page 14. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio increased 0.1% from the prior quarter to 62.1%. When adjusted for the Storm Uri event, the ratio is slightly lower than it was at year-end 2020 and now stands at 61.4%. Let's talk about our FFO to debt metric. The impact of Storm Uri continues to have a temporary and noticeable impact on this metric. Taking a look at the upper right quadrant of this page, you'll see our FFO to debt metric based on the traditional Moody's and GAAP calculated basis as well as on an adjusted Moody's and GAAP calculated basis. On an unadjusted Moody's basis, our FFO to debt ratio decreased by 0.3% during the quarter to 9.9%. As you know, the rating agencies continue to take the anticipated recovery into consideration as it relates to our credit rating.\nOn an adjusted basis, the Moody's FFO to debt metric is 13.3%. As mentioned in prior calls, this 13.3% figure removes or adjusts the calculation to eliminate the impact of approximately $1.2 billion of cash outflows associated with covering the unplanned Uri-driven fuel and purchase power costs in the SPP region directly impacting PSO and SWEPCO in particular. The metric is also adjusted to remove the effect of the associated debt we used to fund the unplanned payments. This should give you a sense of where we are or where we would be from a business-as-usual perspective. As Nick mentioned, we're now targeting an FFO to debt metric in the 14% to 15% range, which is commensurate with the Baa2, BBB flat stable rating.\nWe expect to see this metric to begin to trend toward this new range of 14% to 15% in the latter half of 2022 as we make progress on the regulatory matters that are underway, including the recovery of Uri costs. As you know, we're in frequent contact with the rating agencies to keep them apprised of all aspects of our business and in the presentation today on Page 48, you'll see our financing plan. And aside from some modifications around the capital allocation and refinements on cash flows, everything remains intact as well as the general gist of the financing plan, including equity.\nLet's quickly visit our liquidity summary on the lower right side of this slide. Between our bank revolver capacity and cash balance, our liquidity position remains strong at $4 billion. And in the lower left, you can see our qualified pension funding continues to be strong, increasing 1.2% during the quarter to 104.8%.\nSo let's go to Slide 15. The initiatives that we talked about today set a strong foundation for 2022 and beyond, all of which I would submit to you include a commitment to a boost in our earnings power, credit position and high-grading of our asset portfolio while derisking and simplifying our business profile. So to quickly recap of particular interest to our investor community, our equity investor community, we are lifting and tightening our long-term earnings growth rate to 6% to 7%.\nConsequently, we're increasing our 2022 earnings guidance range to $4.87 to $5.07 per share, up $0.02 from the original guidance. Of particular interest to our fixed income lender and credit rating agency community in addition to our equity investors, we're lifting and tightening our FFO to debt target range to 14% to 15%, which is consistent with a Baa2 stable and BBB flat stable rating. And of interest to all of our financial stakeholders, we are committed to the active management, high-grading and simplification of our asset portfolio to support our growth and transition to a clean energy future as a regulated utility holding company.\nThe sale of our Kentucky operations is on track to close in the second quarter of this year and is reflected in our earnings guidance assumptions for 2022. And as we announced today, we've eliminated the growth capital in the contracted renewables area, moved that capital transmission and announced the sale process of all or a portion of the unregulated contract renewable portfolio with the goal of maximizing value. We've already begun to reflect a portion of this asset rotation in our 5-year $38 billion CapEx guidance as evidenced by the $1.5 billion increase in transmission investment and the $1.3 billion reduction in the unregulated generation and marketing segment.\nWhile the reallocation of capital is now assumed in the guidance range we have updated for you, the utilization of sales proceeds is not yet reflected in the multiyear financing plan. And therefore, what you can anticipate hearing or seeing from us is that we will operate within the increased earnings growth and credit metric financial targets we provided to you today, working within those targets, funds from the sale activities will be directed to our regulated business as we continue our efforts to enhance the transmission infrastructure and to effectuate our generation transformation.\nAdditionally, depending on the timing of the sale of our unregulated contract renewables portfolio or any future asset optimization activities, we will have a bias toward reducing and/or avoiding future equity needs. As you would expect, we'll update our guidance details once we have announcements so we can share with you. We're confident in our ability to deliver on our new and improved promises to you, given our focus on disciplined capital allocation, solid execution and positive regulatory outcomes. We really appreciate your time today.\nI'm going to hand it back to the operator now so we can get your questions.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone, to our call. Joining me to discuss our results and the momentum we're seeing across the business are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. As you can see, very strong third quarter results demonstrate the exceptional strength that we are seeing. We generated record combined fee and spread related earnings which drove adjusted net income of $1.4 billion or $2.17 per share, up 17% year-over-year. In addition to the rich commentary, we prepared for you on this morning's call, we'd like to announce that we will be hosting an extended fixed income call session for Athene this quarter on November 24.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Noah, and good morning. It's a pleasure to be here today and delivering good news is especially fun for me. Results in the third quarter were exceptionally strong. FRE of $652 million was up 23% year-over-year, management fee growth of 22% year-over-year, ACS fees of $212 million, our second straight quarter in excess of $200 million. SRE ex notables $846 million. And for those of you who are focused on SRE and like estimates, we estimate that SRE in Q4 will be approximately $880 million, which will drive estimated full year SRE on a comparable basis to $3.475 billion, approximately 8% year-over-year growth, which will be above the mid-single-digit target we provided earlier.\nFinancial results are the product of underlying good fundamentals. The most interesting and most important fundamental for us is origination. We believe origination is the lifeblood of our business. Origination for this quarter was very strong. $75 billion of origination led by platforms. It's our second strongest quarter following a record Q2. Average spread on our origination, 350 basis points over treasuries, which was stable quarter-over-quarter, average rating of BBB. The reward for good origination is people want to invest with us. Robust inflows of $82 billion for the quarter, led by asset management of $59 billion, retirement services of $23 billion.\nIn the asset management number is $34 billion from Bridge. So inflows ex Bridge, $26 billion. Record AUM at the end of the quarter, $908 billion, up 24% year-over-year. In short, the growth flywheel is spinning. Jim and I have a lot of opportunities to discuss why the growth flywheel is spinning. We like and we often say it's a result of good management. And I think this quarter, not by Jim and I necessarily, but by the team, team worked very hard and produced the results you've seen. But we are fortunate to be in an industry that is experiencing very strong demand.\nCompanies like ours and others in our industry do not get to be big unless we are attached to fundamentals in the economy and essentially are a source of secular growth for our country and for the world. We are fortunate to be driven by 3 incredibly strong fundamentals. Our business is financing the global industrial renaissance, whether it's infrastructure, energy, energy transition, data centers, defense, new manufacturing or robotics, the demand for capital has never been stronger, and it is not a U.S. phenomenon, it is a worldwide phenomenon. These facilities, these investments are long duration in nature and are perfectly appropriate for what we do. And I expect that this will continue for a reasonably long period of time.\nThe second -- we are facing a retirement crisis, a gap in retirement income almost everywhere in the Western world. We, through Athene, Athora and the other investments we've made as well as our third-party insurance business are helping to close that gap. This is among the fastest-growing sectors of our business, as I'm sure both Jim and Martin will touch on. And third, we provide an alternative to increasingly concentrated, correlated and indexed public markets. If you want to escape the MA 7, but still want to be invested, it is very difficult to do efficiently in public markets. These 3 fundamental goods are really the drivers of our business, and we are fortunate to participate in an industry that benefits from this. We are not the only ones to recognize this.\nIf you think about the history of our industry, the entirety of our industry up until the last few years was essentially powered by the smallest bucket of our institutional clients called alternatives. The first 35 years of this industry were funded out of this little bucket. More recently, we've been given a second market called individuals. That second market, we expect to be the size of the first market, and I don't think it will take 35 years to get there. We've now been given a third market called insurance. The industry watching what we've done at Athene now understands that insurance company balance sheets are the perfect place to take liquidity risk rather than credit or equity risk and insurance companies are increasingly large buyers of private assets as they seek to earn safe returns consistent with matching their liabilities.\nWe've also been given a fourth market, and that fourth market comes from our institutional clients who are now considering and actively investing in private assets out of their debt and equity buckets. As we watch total portfolio approach take hold in the asset management industry, we expect this to grow pretty significantly over the years. If that were not enough, I believe we've been given a fifth market. And that fifth market is traditional asset managers, and I think this has the potential to be among the largest sleeves of investors in private assets.\nI expect that we will see significant private asset exposure inside of mutual funds, inside of ETFs and inside of products of all types offered by traditional asset managers as there is a rethinking of what active management is, perhaps active management is not the buying and selling of individual stocks and bonds, but it is the addition of private assets to public portfolios. This will allow our industry to reach clients we would never on our own reach and who want exposure to private assets but will not get exposure to private assets directly.\nAnd as all of you on this call know, more recently, a potential sixth market has opened for us in the form of 401(k) and related retirement plans. In short, for an industry that has grown pretty large over the years, we are now anchored by 3 really powerful secular trends that serve a fundamental good, not just in our economy, but in the world. And we don't recognize this by ourselves.\nPrivate assets are becoming more and more acceptable and more and more in demand. What do we worry about? Well, we worry about the things that we've always worried about. I believe our industry will find that it is limited in its growth by its capacity to find good investments rather than by its capacity to raise capital. It is incumbent on us to focus on origination to make sure that we grow origination quarter-over-quarter and that we really do respect the fundamental principle of our industry, which is excess return per unit of risk. This is ultimately why private assets are in demand and why we, as a firm are in.\nI also worry about culture. We -- our industry and our firm, we have been preferred employers for the last 35 years. We work very hard day and night to make sure we do not lose the preferred employer status. What do I have the luxury of not worrying about? Well, I have the luxury of not worrying about credit. I thought yesterday's call by one of our competitors did, I thought, an adequate job describing the current credit regime. From my point of view, credit is credit, whether it's originated by a bank or an asset manager. It makes almost no difference to me. There are fundamentally good underwriters of credit, and there are less good underwriters of credit.\nThe observed outcome of the number of articles and the focus on a couple of isolated incidents in the marketplace is nil. 10 basis points of spread widening is essentially nothing. Jim, I'm sure, will spend some time on this, but I've encouraged him not to given this -- what I thought was a very successful discussion yesterday by one of our peers.\nLet me delve in a little bit to asset management. The quarter in Asset Management and the momentum we're seeing starts with performance. All buckets across our firm performed very well. In credit, up 8% to 12% over LTM, 3% to 5% in the quarter. Performance was achieved without reaching. We are at a really interesting juncture of time in asset management and one that we frame really simply for our clients.\nWe have them ask 3 questions: are things cheap? Resoundingly, no. Do we think rates that matter, long rates are going to plummet. We do not. We think most of what we're doing in the world is actually inflationary rather than contributing to lower rates. And finally, do we see enhanced sources of geopolitical risk, we do. The answer to those 3 questions is yes. The logical thing to do is to take risk down. That is what we are doing as a firm.\nThat is what we are doing for our clients, and we have been able to do this without reducing our need for return. ADS is a shining example of this. 9% annual return since inception, 2.1% for the quarter, 100% first lien, lower leverage, less PIK, less concentrated, 40% less exposed to software. In our asset-backed retail vehicle, we're now at $1.2 billion, up $425 million in the quarter. 70% of the portfolio is IG, 95% we originate on a proprietary basis. In debt, it's always been clear how one takes risk down. You move higher up in the capital structure. In equity, it is also possible to take risk down. Our hybrid franchise, which is now some $90 billion with nearly $12 billion raised year-to-date. 19% LTM return. The flagship vehicle within hybrid value is AAA, Apollo-aligned alternatives, which is now approaching $25 billion and no doubt will be our largest fund, although there's a healthy competition amongst the various fund managers.\nUltimately, that competition is not fundraising. It's based on performance. AAA now has 42 of 43 positive quarters with a fraction of the volatility of the S&P, roughly an 11% LTM rate of return and 12% inception-to-date return on the strategy. This is the kind of performance that attracts assets and that is consistent with our ethos in this sort of environment of getting returns without reaching. In our private equity business, the focus on cash flow and rational underwriting and avoiding fads and trends has served us very well over the long term.\nOur most recent fund, Fund X, 22% net IRR, already 0.2 DPI. Fund IX, the one before that, 15% net IRR, 50% higher DPI than the industry average. The franchise over our history, 39 gross and 24 net. We're excited for Fund XI, which will come beginning of next year. And we will continue to do what we have always done, which is try and produce excess return per unit of risk and be responsive to the environment and be good stewards of capital.\nOne of the things that we are increasingly hearing in our business is a divide in our industry between agents and principals. The notion of being a principal is that you underwrite a risk that you are prepared to hold. The notion of being an agent is that you underwrite a risk that you think you can distribute. Sometimes it doesn't matter. But when things are priced for perfection, we believe it matters more than ever. The thing that we have done as a firm is to align ourselves with our clients.\nThe amount of comfort that they take with us as the largest owner side by side in almost everything we do is unparalleled and has really set us apart amongst our peer group. So what does the future hold? The future in asset management is all about innovation. You're seeing plenty of innovation. And on our next call, I would expect that we will focus probably in an outsized way on innovation, whether it is what we're doing in market making, whether it is the new addition of leveraged share classes to many of our evergreen funds and leverage against private assets on a much more permanent and much more attractive basis or it is our reinvention of the CLO market -- and I expect innovation to take place broadly across the asset management franchise.\nThe outlook for asset management is indeed very bright. And as you will hear from Martin, we expect FRE growth of 20% plus in '26. On the retirement services side of our business, we're seeing the same sort of robust demand. It's very clear that we have a retirement crisis not just in our country but across the world.\nThe annuity market is a multiple of size versus a few years ago. And while rates are always important, secular demographics or demographics themselves are a driver of growth and everywhere we look, there is a need for guaranteed income. The inflows are literally off the charts. Through Q3 -- first, Q3, $23 billion, year-to-date, $69 billion. We're pacing toward a record year with the PGA market essentially closed for the entirety of the industry.\nNew business remains in line with our mid-teens ROE target, and we deployed $22 billion in the quarter at 220 basis points over treasuries, almost all IG, very little non-IG exposure on the totality of Athene. There's no secret that the market spreads for the kinds of assets that are appropriate for insurance companies are tight. And without the access to proprietary origination, this would not be the business that it is.\nThankfully, the team at Athene has done an unbelievable job, not just on the origination, but also on the sourcing of liabilities and the discipline to turn off various spigots when pricing does not make sense. And at the end of the day, running an efficient business from an overhead point of view and employing the latest technology allows you to keep ROEs up in periods of time when others are suffering. As I'm sure Martin will touch on and we will discuss on the 24th, the result of running this business over a really long period of time and not being a current period profit maximizer has given us tremendous amounts of flexibility.\nWhen rates are down, massive gains appear in our portfolio, which allow us to recycle securities, which does not produce SRE but frees up capital for investment. And if we are successful in creating origination, allows us to pick up spread. We have lots of tools at our disposal to achieve our SRE and ROE targets that others in our industry do not have.\nWhile the slope of the forward curve can change and as you will hear from Martin, we have significantly reduced our sensitivity to rates to the lowest in a decade. We are just a very tough competitor. And for those who, again, who are interested in SRE, we expect SRE growth year-over-year for next year at 10%, and we expect average growth over the 5-year plan to also be 10%. We become over time at Athene, since the rate of change in our volume is just not as significant going forward as it has been historically, we become a massive capital generator.\nOne of 2 things will happen with that pile of capital that we either we have been conservative on how much new business we will add at Athene, which is the challenge to the management team on the new product side or we will be able to redeploy that capital elsewhere in our business or to our shareholders. In short, Q3 was an exceptional quarter. We are seeing signs, not just for the current year of very positive things happening, but the seeds being planted for not just Q4, but also for next year. It's just a fascinating time in asset management and retirement.\nAnd with that, I want to turn it over to Jim Zelter.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President & Chief Investment Officer-Credit, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. Having navigated credit cycles for more than 4 decades, I can tell you we've seen this one before. Isolated incidents are nothing new, and they're rarely a signal of broader stress. As we remain vigilant in our underwriting and risk management efforts, what we're seeing is idiosyncratic, not systematic.\nOver the years, there has been a propensity to overemphasize short-term technical headlines and overlook the broader direction of travel within our industry. Broad secular forces such as the increasing economic activity generated by private companies, the global industrial renaissance as well as massive capital fueling the global industrial renaissance are driving increased demand for global private credit, in particular, investment grade.\nAt the same time, demographics and the expanding needs of retirees globally are driving the secular demand. This is the foundation of our business. We've leaned into senior secured top of the capital structure investments to serve a market that we believe exceeds $40 trillion.\nAs you can see from our growth, that has served us well, and we are just beginning to scratch the surface. Recent events give us a moment to step back and reflect on the marketplace. And I believe there is an important point to be made here, whether a particular transaction is public or private is simply the manner in which the risk is originated.\nUltimately, it is not the litmus test for credit quality. Our disciplined underwriting as an origination principle, not an agent or a tourist across both public and private markets has allowed us to be trusted stewards of our investors' capital through various market cycles and position us for continued success. We look forward to leading and performing in a marketplace with a dispersion of returns.\nOn origination, let me put the quarter and the origination engine in perspective. As Marc mentioned, we generated $75 billion in the quarter, a remarkable number and second only to last quarter's record. This brings origination volume to over $270 billion for the last 12 months, up more than 40% versus the prior period and effectively achieves our multiyear target about 3 to 4 years early. We're encouraged by the early momentum and the capacity we have to scale. Results like this can only be driven by the full breadth and diversity across our business, platforms, core credit, high-grade capital solutions, equity and hybrid. Within core credit, volumes were led by large-cap direct lending, commercial mortgage lending and residential mortgage lending.\nAcross our 16 platforms, origination volume increased more than 20% year-over-year, and MidCap was a standout, which continued to perform very well and generated more than 30% growth year-to-date. These are companies who we are providing real solutions at scale. This highlights and connects to our broader sponsor solutions ecosystem, which has more than tripled in recent years, growing from $20 billion in volume in 2022 to nearly $70 billion over the last 12 months.\nWe believe our offering is unmatched in its scale, speed and ability to deliver full firm solutions. with a toolkit that includes not only direct lending, both large and mid-cap, which is where many of our peers end, but also fund finance, asset-based finance as well as other capabilities. Taken together, our sponsor ecosystem is unmatched in scale and speed and the breadth of the solutions we deliver.\nLet me bring this to life with 2 recent examples of our origination leadership. First, in support of Keurig Dr Pepper's strategic objectives, we called a financing solution totaling $7 billion that was announced last week. This was yet another example of our leading position in the high-grade capital solutions and hybrid marketplace by providing flexible capital solutions. The second transaction I'd like to highlight is yesterday's announcement with Ørsted, where our funds will acquire a 50% stake in Hornsea 3, a 3-gigawatt scale offshore wind project for $6.5 billion.\nAlongside transactions we announced this year for ED&F, RWE and BP, this is the latest large-scale transaction in Europe, where we are investing behind energy, critical infrastructure and transition assets in the region. Our activity in providing IG capital solutions to large-scale companies in Europe is unmatched.\nLooking across all of our origination in the quarter, $69 billion was debt comprised of approximately 70% investment grade with an average rating of A- and approximately 30% sub-investment grade with an average rating of B. On the investment-grade origination, we generated excess spread of over 285 basis points over treasuries or approximately 200 over comparable rated corporate indexes. And in our SIG origination, we generated excess of 400 basis points over treasuries or approximately 220 basis points over comparably rated high-yield corporates. Importantly, we observed stable spreads on our origination quarter-over-quarter, and that's particularly notable in a period where public market spreads are near generational tights. Producing excess spreads at scale is a clear testament to the solutions we deliver.\nWhile our existing origination engine continues to scale and has driven incredible results, we're not standing still. In the past few months, we have added several new resources that will augment, grow and diversify these origination capabilities. Number one with Olympus Housing Capital is a new homebuilder finance strategy sitting at the nexus of multiple secular tailwinds between structural undersupply of single-family homes and demographics. Stream Data center strengthens our presence in digital infrastructure. 1050 is our new European CRE lending platform focused on structurally underserved small- and medium-sized CRE markets.\nAnd finally, we announced the launch of Apollo Sports Capital focused on the sports and live events ecosystem in a market that continues to exhibit strong uncorrelated growth and faces significant capital demands. This will be a permanent capital vehicle primarily focused on credit and hybrid opportunity, and ASC is designed to be a long-term value-added marketplace player, leveraging our infrastructure in credit and media and physical assets. In capital formation, momentum remains exceptionally strong this quarter. We brought in $82 billion, including $49 billion of organic inflows, nearly matching last quarter's record as well as $34 billion from our closing of the Bridge acquisition.\nBy channel, the institutional channel remains strong, and Global Wealth had another excellent quarter with Athene continuing its remarkable trajectory. Across institutional and global wealth within the $26 billion of organic inflows during the quarter, 80% were focused on credit-oriented strategies and 20% to equity-oriented strategies coming from a broad array of investor classes.\nThe $5 billion we raised in the wealth channel was the second best quarter on record, bringing year-to-date total over $14 billion, up 60% over the prior year period. And strength in this quarter was broad-based with 6 strategies raising more than $200 million and 10 strategies raising greater than $100 million. With that success, one strategy stood out, as Marc mentioned, ABC, which had its strongest quarter since launch, raising nearly $400 million.\nThe asset-based focused corporation has all the makings of our next flagship deep expertise, strong performance and accelerating demand. Again, this trajectory reminds us of ADS since ABC is a similar point, but with a major focus on investment-grade counterparty risk. Across wealth, our distribution continued to expand. We launched 3 new LTIPs during the quarter, expanding our lineup and broadening access to Apollo private market strategies across EMEA, Asia and LatAm. It's clear our offering continues to resonate with investors around the globe, and our partners are not simply looking for a good product, they are increasingly looking for a comprehensive holistic solutions provider in constructing portfolios.\nTurning to Athene. They had an excellent quarter with $23 billion of organic inflows. Inflows were driven by $10 billion from retail, $10 billion from funding agreements and $3 billion in flow reinsurance. Retail flows saw particularly strength in fixed index annuities and MYGA. Funding agreement issuance was the third strongest quarter on record as we continue to capitalize on the favorable issuance backdrop. While Athene's core products have been the foundation of its impressive growth trajectory, we expect emerging products to widen the funnel.\nProducts like RILA with over $1 billion of inflows year-to-date and the successful launch of stable value and structured settlements as well as tax advantage and guaranteed income will augment the growth and expand the opportunity set. Globally, the growing retiree population continues to drive significant demand for long-term income solution. And this is a durable secular trend that we're fortunate to have a significant leadership position with meaningful advantage will allow us to continue to grow. The opportunity ahead is massive, and our platform has never been stronger in execution.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results highlight clearly the accelerating momentum across our platform, reaffirming our ability to execute consistently on our long-term plan. I'll take a few minutes to walk through the quarter's financial performance and discuss the key factors supporting our progress as we close out the year. I'll then share more details on the outlook for 2026 to supplement Marc's comments.\nIn Asset Management, we generated an increase in both assets under management and fee-generating assets under management of 24% year-over-year to $908 billion and $685 billion, respectively. We generated fee-related earnings of $652 million in the quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date, up 20% year-over-year in each quarter this year versus the comparable period, evidence of the momentum across the platform and keeping us firmly on pace for a full year growth rate of 20%.\nIn the quarter, we delivered 22% year-over-year growth in management fees, driven by third-party asset management inflows and record gross capital deployment, particularly across our credit platform as well as strong growth from retirement services. Capital solutions fees of $212 million, as highlighted, represent our second strongest quarter on record. The breadth of origination capabilities was very clear this quarter, with 50% of ACS fees generated by our hybrid value, opportunistic equity, climate transition and real estate businesses, complementing the other 50% from our high-grade and global credit businesses, including Atlas. We generated 28% year-over-year growth in fee-related performance fees, reflecting sustained growth in spread-based income across a variety of our perpetual capital vehicles, led by ADS and complemented by Rating Ridge and MidCap among other platforms.\nGrowth in fee-related expenses reflects continued investment in hiring and infrastructure to support the firm's global strategic growth initiatives, compensation growth reflecting our performance this year and the inclusion of Bridge into our financial results.\nWe closed the acquisition of Bridge on September 2, which significantly enhances our existing real estate business, bringing to scale some of the most attractive areas in the market, including multifamily and industrial. Bridge also adds origination capabilities that are highly synergistic with existing asset demand from Apollo's ecosystem, in particular, Athene.\nBridge will initially contribute approximately $300 million of annual fee-related revenues across management fees and ACS fees and approximately $100 million of pretax FRE with expenses principally compensation-based. Bridge will also contribute to SRE growth as an originator of investment-grade spread products as well as principal investing income over time. Excluding Bridge, our FRE margin was stable quarter-over-quarter and expanded approximately 120 basis points year-to-date, demonstrating continued scaling of our business. Including Bridge, we expect our full year 2025 margin to be consistent with 2024.\nMoving to Retirement Services. Q3 delivered another strong organic growth quarter, supported by $23 billion of gross inflows. Athene's net invested assets grew by 18% year-over-year to $286 billion. We generated $846 million of SRE ex notables for the quarter with an additional $37 million or 5 basis points at our long-term 11% return expectation on the alternatives portfolio. The blended net spread ex notables in Q3 was 121 basis points versus 122 basis points in the prior quarter, reflecting the effect of roll-off of existing assets and liabilities, offset by new business growth.\nAthene's core earnings power is very strong and clearly evident in the third quarter. In a tighter spread environment, we continue to originate new business that meets our long-term ROE targets, and that is in line with historical averages. Athene's competitive positioning is unmatched, is trending higher than our first half average, reflecting the impact of higher new business volumes and our ability to originate attractive investment-grade investment opportunities. Importantly, we believe our spread-related earnings troughed in the first half of 2025.\nLooking across the asset and liability profile of the portfolio, we see asset prepayment headwinds peaking through Q1 of '26 and the spread drag from profitable COVID era business dissipating in 2026 relative to 2025.\nFor the fourth quarter, as Marc suggested, we anticipate SRE ex notables to be approximately stable to Q3 at an 11% return or approximately $880 million with an equivalent SRE spread of 125 basis points. Combined with year-to-date performance behind us, this result would drive full year growth of approximately 8%, ahead of our mid-single-digit target. Importantly, with the business executing at a high level, expectations that headwinds experienced in 2024 and 2025 are starting to dissipate and exposure to floating rates largely immunized, the exit velocity into 2026 is strong.\nTurning to our 2026 outlook. We expect 20% plus growth in FRE in addition to the earnings from Bridge. Momentum across our core business is building with management fees showing increasing growth each quarter on an LTM basis. Recent growth initiatives, including across wealth, credit and origination are translating into tangible results, evident in our strong quarterly and year-to-date performance. We expect that roughly 75% of our top line growth in fee-related revenue in 2026 will be attributable to fundraising and deployment from existing well-established businesses as well as the annualization of growth already in the ground coming out of 2025.\nThe remaining 25% of top line growth is expected to come from new initiatives already underway from Apollo Sports Capital to Athora's pending acquisition of PIC as well as a variety of other new strategies in the pipeline. And to clarify, we expect this 20% plus FRE growth next year is without any contribution from our next flagship private equity fund, Fund XI, which we currently estimate will turn on sometime in the first half of 2027, subject to our pace of PE deployment.\nFor SRE, we anticipate 10% growth in 2026, assuming 11% alt returns and including notables year-over-year. This outlook is underpinned by strong organic growth and our origination capabilities, which generate high-quality assets with spread. We expect prepayment headwinds to diminish as a result, both of our reduced purchases of CLO assets and the already high prepayment levels we are experiencing at today's very tight AAA CLO spreads. We further expect the headwind from the roll-off of profitable post-COVID business to have already peaked in 2025.\nAs Marc alluded to, we have various choices and management actions to help us navigate the path forward, such as managing our floating rate position, optimizing our back book of assets, utilizing sidecar capital and prudently managing crediting rates. Our 2026 outlook embeds the current forward rate curve, which contemplates 3 total cuts by year-end '26 and 9.5 total cuts over the cycle and assumes the current tight market spread environment persists. Acknowledging these growth expectations, we expect and caution that there will be normal quarterly deviation around the growth trend line, reflecting the scale of an approximately $400 billion balance sheet.\nLooking beyond 2026, we remain confident in our long-term FRE and SRE average annual growth targets of 20% and 10%, respectively, through 2029. We expect the earnings mix shift towards FRE will result in FRE equaling SRE sometime in 2028, a year ahead of our expectation and exceeding SRE thereafter.\nLastly, on capital, we executed over $350 million in share repurchases during the quarter, the majority being opportunistic. The sequential growth in our share count reflects this activity as well as the shares issued in connection with closing the Bridge transaction.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call back to the operator. We appreciate your time and welcome your questions.",

Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, operator, and welcome again to our call this morning. As usual, I am joined by Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. For those who tuned in early and enjoyed our pregame hold music, we played a Blues track called Take Out Some Insurance by Jimmy Reed. However, no insurance was necessary to protect against our performance this quarter as the results are simply outstanding. Strong execution like this is only made possible because of the tremendous efforts of our global team. We're all excited to discuss in further detail.\nSo I'll now pass it over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Noah. Appreciate it, and good morning to all. And again, thank you for your interest in spending time with us. As Noah suggested, second quarter was, in fact, very strong. Just to give the basic metrics, record FRE, $627 million, 22% year-over-year, management fee growth 21% year-over-year, record ACS fees of $216 million. With respect to SRE, $821 million, with most of the metrics we care about in the right place. And both Martin and I will discuss that.\nWhat makes this possible? It's always about team, but if I dissect the business and really talk about what's going on here, the power of what we do from originations was really on full display. $81 billion originated from our platforms and our business in the quarter, that excludes inorganic. With inorganic, it would be in the 90s. Spread over treasuries, 350 basis points. Jim will spend some time talking about the quality of origination. Buying something or originating something is not the secret here, buying something that has excess return per unit of risk is actually what creates value in our business.\nRobust inflows from $61 billion across the firm, record AUM, $840 billion, the flywheel of what we do of originating, raising capital, deploying was really in full force for the quarter. The business was strong and the business is getting stronger, and Martin will detail that and some expectations for the rest of the year.\nIn terms of first dealing with Asset Management, what matters in Asset Management is ultimately performance. All buckets of our credit business, the largest of our business performed the way they should whether you were core credit or opportunistic credit between 9% and 12% over latest 12 months, 2% and 3% quarter-over-quarter. A couple of things that I would call out. ADS 9% plus annual return since inception, 2.3% in the quarter now exceeds $20 billion in size. What's interesting in that for me is that it shows that you can grow a business and scale a business while adhering to the principles that we espoused in our investment business.\nTop of the capital structure, large company, lower leverage, no PIC, we can do this safely by originating the right risk and not trying to grow the business faster than it needs to grow. $20 billion, the team there is doing a great job and more to come. Performance without reaching, performance without trying to just grow AUM is really how we think about success in this business.\nIn the equity business, starting with private equity business. Fund X continues to perform well. Net IRR as of the end of the quarter, 23% DPI 0.2 versus on average 0 for the rest of the industry. Fund IX, net IRR of 16.6 DPI versus 0.3 for the rest of the industry. Since inception, 39% gross, 24% net over 3 decades. Alpha on the buy, alpha on the build and alpha on the exit. This is not a complex business, but it is a disciplined business that requires tremendous execution. Sometimes trends work for you. Sometimes the IPO window is open or it's closed. Sometimes the debt market is open or it's closed. If you have a fundamental view of value and how to execute over a very long period of time, you can produce outsized returns, and that's what we've shown in our private equity business.\nHybrid 17% across our franchise, latest 12 months, $75 billion as of the end of the quarter with $7 billion raised year-to-date. On a percentage basis, as you know, from our 5-year plan, we expect this to be our fastest-growing business segment. To give you a sense of our flagship vehicle, AAA Apollo aligned alternatives in the hybrid segment, we are closing in first 11.1% latest 12 months, 2.6% in the quarter with a fraction of the volatility of public equity markets. This is what the team is supposed to do, deliver better than equity market long-term performance with a fraction of the volatility. The reward for doing that is investor confidence. This vehicle will likely surpass $25 billion at year-end.\nFundraising is strong, particularly in the institutional channel, which now for this quarter exceeds the retail channel, which is a surprise for us as institutions begin really exploring the notion of equity replacement, something happening much earlier than we thought it was going to happen. The reward for good performance is strong inflows, better than $40 billion just in the asset management business in the quarter. Tim will take you through that. But the strength was across both institutional and the wealth business, and we continue to remain very well positioned with $72 billion of dry powder.\nMoving now to Retirement Services. We continue to observe very significant demand for retirement services product. The annuity market is a multiple of the size it was just a few years ago. High rates, certainly -- higher base rates certainly play a factor in that, but we expect demographics to contribute to a permanently higher level of retirement services product need on the part of consumers. And it is our job, as I have suggested not just to provide them with the product set that exists, but to anticipate where the product set might go. The challenge in front of the management team is to take the success they've had in the base business and really shake up the industry and have new products account for a very, very significant portion of their inflow over time.\n$21 billion of inflows in the second quarter second strongest organic quarter. We have a choice, given our size, scale, credit rating and breadth of distribution as to how to originate. We can originate in any 1 of a number of markets. In this particular market, fixed annuity or I should say, funding agreement was a very strong contributor in the quarter. In other quarters, other products will be a very strong contributor. Our job is to both serve the market demand as well as earn adequate spread for our equity investors and for ourselves. When we run this business for long-term profitability, it is supported with not just our capital, but with outside capital. It allows us to retain capital. It allows us to earn high returns.\nUltimately, in this industry, to grow and to get to scale, you need to produce reasonable rates of return. In our case, we produce those reasonable rates of return while allowing the asset manager to garner a market standard asset management fee. That is not the case with lots of people who are trying to enter this business where asset management fees are supplementing what they're doing. We continue to see an interesting spread environment after a brief respite following the initial tariff announcement where spreads widened out. We've seen spreads really contract. I would not want to be in this business without a very good source of origination.\nWhat you saw in the quarter and what we expect to continue in the third quarter is our origination machine responding to Athene and other institutional clients' desire for highly rated paper with spread. In the second quarter, we made a lot of progress. While things available to others in the public markets and in near adjacent markets like CLOs tightened extraordinarily, we were able to keep spreads where we needed them and to earn the returns we needed them by originating the kind of paper that very few, if any, have access to.\nThe pipeline for the third quarter looks equally as good. We had projected some $70-plus billion of new inflows for the year for Athene. We're in the 40s already. Whether we choose to exceed that or choose not to exceed it will depend on our ability to earn spread. Third quarter looks good, but we'll wait and see as we go, and Martin will have more commentary as to what he expects from an SRE development for the rest of the year.\nOne other thing that I think is worth noting is just again to go through the levers of profitability in the retirement services business. There is obviously the ability to earn spread on assets, mostly investment-grade assets. There is the ability to raise liabilities that have both good term structures, protection, but are also relatively low cost. But the thing we often overlook is the cost of doing business. In a spread-based business, the cost of doing business is a direct subtraction from your profitability.\nThe numbers this quarter were nothing short of extraordinary. Athene's cost of doing business this quarter was some 16 basis points. That is half of the amount of some of our larger publicly traded competitors and probably 1/3 the amount of some of the new entrants in this business. Imagine trying to run this business without a great source of liabilities, without a great source of assets and without a low cost structure. You can imagine it would be very difficult. One of the other trends that you will see us address over the quarter is the quality of origination and where that origination come from.\nIn the near future, we will put out some materials as we have historically to address origination, affiliation as well as other issues of interest to the marketplace. Stay tuned on that.\nIn Europe, we have more of a developing situation. The demand for retirement services products is strong as a result of demographics, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and Asia. In Europe, we are a strategic investor and capital partner to Athora. Athora's largest business to date is in the Netherlands. Athora, as many of you know, has agreed to buy PIC in the U.K. Athora views PIC as an incredibly attractive way to enter a very interesting U.K. marketplace.\nThe U.K. has many of the same demographic, corporate and pension trends and needs that the U.S. does. It does not have the same amount of capital. And the U.K. regulatory regime and the U.K. regulatory mood is one of encouraging private capital into its marketplace, particularly investment-grade private capital that supports the long-term projects that the U.K. and other, quite frankly, European governments want to do.\nAnd so while that transaction is subject to regulatory approval, and we would not expect it to close until after the turn of the year, we are very excited of what that could lead to and excited to enter the U.K. market in real size and scale. PIC is to the U.K. what Athene is to the U.S. market. It will be a sizable capital funding. We will need sizable amounts of funding of assets, which will incent us to generate the same kind of originated assets that we have generated in the U.S. to make available to the PIC management team to choose those assets that are best for their business.\nI think Europe is about to get more exciting. In terms of the industry, most of our peer set has now announced. And I think what you're seeing across the industry to varying degrees is a rising tide lifting all boats. Recall that our industry is some 40 years old, and we started a business that served the smallest bucket of our institutional clients called alternatives. We now have a significant number of other sources of demand.\nWe have -- right after we have the institutional alternative bucket, we now have this thing called individuals, which most of you ask about every quarter, and I expect and Jim expects to be as large as the institutional business over time. Second, we have another new market called insurance. Companies have seen what we have done for Athene by harnessing the illiquidity of our liabilities to be able to provide long-term capital and strategies like Athene's are being adopted not just in the U.S. but across the globe. We now have a third new source of demand. Institutions are now looking at private assets, not just in their alternative bucket, but in their fixed income bucket for fixed income replacement, and we expect over time in their equity bucket for equity replacement.\nA fourth new source of demand are traditional asset managers. Traditional asset managers have struggled with the rise of passive and the decline of active, active being the higher fee, more value-added business. I believe we are watching traditional managers begin to redefine what active management is rather than the buying and selling of stocks, the addition of private assets to heretofore solely public portfolios.\nThere are lots of examples out there of collaborations, and we are in the beginning stages of this, but this has the potential to be a very, very large market and most importantly, to serve a clientele that we historically, as an industry, have not had access to. Finally, I believe we are on the cusp of being able to serve the 401(k) and the defined contribution marketplace. I expect there to be significant proposed changes to the regulatory landscape to make this easier. This, to me, is common sense. This is among the largest pools of savings in the world, some $12 trillion to $13 trillion. This money is mostly invested in daily liquid index products for 50 years.\nA small change in the rate of return available to these investors over their retirement period is not about slightly better outcomes. It's 50% and 100% better outcomes. We face across the world a retirement income crisis. We believe we have a role to play in this. I don't expect this to take place all at once, but I do expect this to be a continuing source of demand. If you shape up our view of the world, -- our view of the world is we started as a business that was a perfectly nice business serving the alternative bucket of our institutional clients.\nWe now have 5 additional sources of demand. I continue to believe that over the long term, it is not going to be demand for high-quality private assets that determines how fast we grow. It will be our capacity to originate and therefore, the supply of those assets. Our focus continues to be squarely on origination, and each of these markets is going to require innovation. Innovation can be a partnering with State Street on their ETF. Innovation can be a partnering with Lord Abbott. Innovation can take place in target date funds, can take place with Empower.\nIt can take place with other providers of retirement products. Innovation can take place in stablecoins. Innovation can take place in the trading of private assets, which I think has the potential to turn our industry on its head. In every industry where transparency of pricing and daily price availability has taken place, the industry has grown massively. For those who resist this, it generally means that your fee is above where it's supposed to be and you don't want to shine a light on it.\nFor us, we believe that the growth of this market, the size and scale of this market, the creation of more demand for private assets will benefit those who are in a strong position from origination. We see this as a positive and a potential game changer. Innovation is the name of the game here.\nI think I've said enough. I actually think Noah got it right at the beginning of the quarter. This was a really strong quarter. Everything we want to do was working the way it was supposed to. We can always do better. The team is working as hard as I've ever seen the team. So just one metric that caught my eye yesterday, on an average week, we have, on a daily basis, 1,000 people in the office. In July and early August, we now have 1,200. I can't actually figure what's happening, but it is among the busiest July we have ever seen in our business and momentum is building rather than declining.\nIt's my pleasure now to turn it over to Jim Zelter.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President & Chief Investment Officer-Credit, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. Much has been written covering the second quarter in terms of macro events that led to periods of uncertainty followed by a resurgence of confidence and risk on mentality. For Apollo, the attributes of our model were on full display. As stated previously, our North Star is to be an all-weather equal opportunity investor, private and public, primary and secondary, combined with speed and scale across the entirety of the investment-grade and non-investment-grade ecosystem as well as the equity ecosystem. In the aftermath of liberation day, we deployed $25 billion in a condensed time frame and we're well regarded as the market leader in that period.\nAs the quarter progressed, confidence returned, markets reopened and risk assets recovered. In this environment, we continue to lead with scale, conviction and certainty of execution. In particular, I would highlight the performance of our high-grade capital solutions business, where we originated more than $8 billion across 4 transactions, including transactions for AES, BP, Mumbai Airport and EDF, which I will touch on shortly. In aggregate, as Marc mentioned, we originated $81 billion of assets during the quarter, representing nearly a 50% growth year-over-year.\nThis result was driven by activity across our diversified origination channels, platforms, core credit, high-grade capital solutions, equity and hybrid. Within platforms, volumes were led by Atlas and MidCap, which posted combined volume growth of approximately 30% quarter-over-quarter, while maintaining solid historical spread. Within core credit, volumes were led by CRE debt, large-cap direct lending and fund finance, which combined more than -- which in a combined basis doubled quarter-over-quarter.\nIt is very important to draw the distinction that all origination is not equal and we believe there is a fundamental difference and significant value capture between directly originated versus purchasing others originated assets. Of our total origination in the quarter, $75 billion was debt comprised of $60 billion of investment-grade credit with an average rating of A- and $15 billion of sub-investment-grade credit with an average rating of B.\nOn our investment-grade origination, we generated excess spread of approximately 290 basis points over treasuries or approximately 190 basis points over comparable rated corporate debt. On our sub-investment-grade origination, we generated excess spread of over 470 basis points over treasuries or approximately 200 basis points over comparably rated high-yield corporates. Overall, we observed stable spreads quarter-over-quarter and saw a modest widening in July.\nAchieving record origination volume while generating excess spread is particularly impressive, as Marc said, when considering we are in a market where many areas within credit, such as CLOs or BB crossovers have gravitated to decade-plus or even generational type spreads. Our origination activity continues to be broad-based with several diverse flows across channels. We had some excellent wins in the quarter. And as I highlighted, in particular, was our $4.5 billion financing for electricity [indiscernible], EDF, which marked the largest sterling-denominated private credit transaction to date.\nProceeds from the financing will be used to finance EDF's electronuclear projects in the U.K., most notably the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. This bespoke large-scale HGCS financing supports EDF's vital role in advancing the European energy and power infrastructure. We see a broad pipeline of these transactions, and it reinforces our reputation as a trusted adviser, making us a partner of choice for companies in need of secular CapEx investments. More broadly, Europe is an area we are investing significant time and resources to expand our dominant presence.\nOver the coming years, we see substantial origination opportunity as the region commits infrastructure investments, defense, reindustrialization and power generation. In Germany, which I visited 3 times during the quarter, we have made a significant commitment to support the country's growth initiatives and have committed to deploy over $100 billion over the next decade. We see a large direct lending opportunity as well, given over 90% of the firms with revenue greater than $100 million are still private.\nWe also see a major opportunity in the asset-based finance strategy, particularly if meaningful securitization reform takes place, which we saw in the beginning of the quarter. For context, the U.S. is a $30 trillion economy with a $15 trillion securitization market compared to Europe's $24 trillion economy with just a $500 billion total securitization market.\nWithin our sustainability and infrastructure business, it's worth noting that we have now deployed nearly $60 billion in energy transition and decarbonization opportunities since 2022, surpassing our previously 5-year goal of $50 billion, nearly 2 years ahead of schedule. Given the unprecedented CapEx needs, it is clear there is an outsized demand for long-term flexible capital where our Apollo franchise is at the forefront.\nI would specifically highlight the opportunity we see in financing AI infra projects. To facilitate the pace of growth, research estimates suggest nearly $3 trillion of investment will be required by the end of the decade. with $1.5 trillion of external funding needed to support that activity. Within this $1.5 trillion financing gap, there's nearly an $800 billion opportunity for private credit led by asset-based finance. And we believe we are particularly well suited to serve this market given our expansive long-dated capital base in terms of creativity and flexibility.\nAn emerging aspect of our origination effort continues to be our bank partnerships. We've worked collaboratively with many of the banks to drive capital formation and unlock differentiated sourcing. Currently, our global network of 12 bank partnerships spans to both U.S. and international. And based on active conversations, we anticipate adding a handful of new partnerships by year-end 2025. These partnerships are active in ABS, private corporate credit, infrastructure, trade finance, SRTs and junior capital solutions, all enhanced by the strategic alignment and trust and communication we have our large-cap team and our mid-cap team totaled $25 billion in the first half of the year, up dramatically year-over-year.\nSecondly, as the conversation surrounding private credit continues to expand, it's clear that the new favorite flavor in the marketplace is investment-grade solutions. By our account, we have an unmatched market presence with over 29 financings totaling $44 billion since 2020. Turning to capital formation. Our engine was firing on all cylinders as we generated $61 billion of inflows in the quarter, including record organic inflows of $49 billion. Inflows were driven by $40 billion from asset management, which included $12 billion of inorganic flows from the Reading Ridge Iridian acquisition and $21 billion from Athene.\nOur capital formation capabilities were differentiated with 3 distinct pillars driving our results: our institutional business, our global wealth franchise and our retirement services platform. Within the $40 billion of inflows from asset management, approximately 80% went to credit-oriented strategies and 20% to equity-oriented strategies with contributions coming from a broad array of investors.\nOne area of standout performance was our third-party insurance business that generated $7 billion of inflows, which included 6 new and 2 upsized mandates. Third-party insurance is on track for a record year with over $9 billion raised year-to-date across diverse products, types, strategies, geographies and liability profiles. Insurers are increasingly recognize our differentiated origination capabilities and unique level of alignment with our clients.\nWe own what they own, which is driving a strong pipeline of interest. In Global Wealth, momentum continues to generate -- as we generated more than $4 billion of inflows in the quarter, the second best on record despite the turbulent backdrop. Year-to-date inflows of $9 billion were up 40% versus the year ago period with contributions from 18 separate strategies encompassing our semi-liquid suite as well as a drawdown and QP offerings.\nIn particular, we've observed continued strength from ADS, which is set to take in another $600 million in July as well as building momentum in ABC and AIC. Our wealth franchise now has 7 strategies exceeding $1 billion in AUM with 2 above $20 billion, AAA and ADS, a signal of the increasing scale and receptivity we're seeing across strategies. Our expanding distribution footprint is supporting continued growth, and we currently have more than 5,000 advisers across nearly 700 firms allocating to our products.\nWith an excellent first half of the year, we believe that we are well on our way to achieve our full year goal in 2025. Athene had another excellent quarter with $21 billion of organic inflows, the second highest result on record. By channel, inflows were driven by $7 billion from retail, $12 billion from funding agreements and $2 billion from flow insurance. Retail flows saw particularly strength in fixed index annuities, where FA issuance was strong at $12 billion and marked a second quarter of record volumes as we continue to lean in and take advantage of favorable issuance spreads.\nTaken together with the strength of the first quarter, Athene is on pace for a record year in FA issuance. As we've been saying for some time, the expanding needs of the global retiree population present a significant growth opportunity for Athene, and the franchise is exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on this broad secular trend.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Martin for the financial results.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results, as you've heard, underscore the increasing momentum across our platform and demonstrate consistent execution of our long-term strategy. I'll briefly walk through the quarter's financial results and highlight the drivers that position us well for the remainder of the year.\nFRE. In Asset Management, AUM increased by 22% year-over-year to a record $840 billion, while fee-generating AUM grew 22% to $638 billion. Nearly 60% of our total AUM and 75% of our total fee-generating AUM is comprised of perpetual capital, which is highly scalable and largely insulated from cyclical drawdown fundraising. Perpetual Capital is benefiting from strong flows in our Global Wealth business as well as Athene.\nWe generated $627 million in fee-related earnings in Q2, a new quarterly high. FRE grew by 22% year-over-year, driven by the following 4 items: one, 22% overall management fee growth with 25% growth in credit, reflecting a strong origination volumes and spreads that Jim described across our asset-backed and other high-grade businesses. Notably, the acquisition of Aradian by Reading Ridge further builds out the capabilities of Reading Ridge. While this contributed to AUM, it did not contribute to growth in fee-paying AUM or management fee growth in any meaningful way.\nWith respect to equity, S3 has contributed catch-up fees for the last 3 quarters including approximately $15 million in Q2 as we closed out a very successful $5.5 billion fundraise. Two, we generated record capital solutions fees as you've heard, of $216 million, which exceeded our prior peak in Q2 of '24. The quarter's fee activity comprised approximately 100 discrete transactions supported by the breadth of our origination and portfolio activity. Three, fee revenue growth also included 21% year-over-year growth in fee-related performance fees reflecting the ongoing scaling of our semiliquid product suite led by ADS; and four, fee-related expenses grew by 13% year-over-year as we balance continued investment in our growth priorities with increasing efficiency throughout the business.\nThe increase in compensation expense in the quarter reflects an accelerated pace of hiring activity in the first half that we expect to moderate in the back half. With 17% fee-related revenue growth and 13% cost growth, we generated approximately 200 basis points of FRE margin expansion year-over-year for the quarter and for the first half. We remain confident in our ability to drive higher margins over time as we execute our business plan and achieve greater scale. For the balance of 2025 with the momentum that is evident across all the metrics that are relevant, we are tracking to the higher end of our 15% to 20% FRE guide, in a non-flagship PE fundraising year.\nSRE. Moving to Retirement Services. Q2 delivered another strong organic growth quarter with $21 billion of inflows, our second highest on record. Athene's net invested assets grew by 18% year-over-year to $275 billion. We generated $821 million of SRE for the quarter with an additional $36 million adjusting to our long-term 11% return expectation on the alternatives portfolio, all in line with our prior comments. The alternatives return for the quarter came in slightly higher than our pre-release estimate due to positive late quarter pricing and FX adjustments.\nThe blended net spread in Q2 was 122 basis points versus 126 basis points in the prior quarter, reflecting the continuing runoff of profitable business written post-COVID. We generated new business spreads of approximately 130 basis points in the first half, right in line with historical long-term spreads of the business and fully consistent with our overall SRE growth outlook for the year. We remain highly confident that we'll achieve the mid-single-digit growth in 2025 on the basis we previously communicated.\nBridge. We're continuing to work towards the close of our pending acquisition of Bridge Investment Group, and we expect to close the transaction in early September. In terms of financial impact, given partial year timing, we anticipate relatively modest FRE contribution for the remainder of 2025. For 2026, we anticipate Bridge will contribute approximately $100 million to our FRE, in line with previously published forecasts in the Bridge shareholder proxy filing. We expect meaningful scaling of Bridge's FRE and total financial accretion in 2027 and beyond, and we'll hold a call -- an update call in the fall to provide additional information.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator, and we welcome your questions.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may contain forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.\nApollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, operator, and welcome again to our call. Joining me to discuss our results and the momentum we're seeing across the business are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, President; and Martin Kelly, CFO.\nEarlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. As you can see, first quarter results marked a strong start to the year. We generated record fee-related earnings of $559 million or $0.91 per share, spread-related earnings, excluding notable items, of $826 million or $1.35 per share, and adjusted net income of $1.1 billion or $1.82 per share.\nIn addition, we declared a cash dividend of $0.51 per share of common stock for the quarter ended March 31, representing a 10% increase from our prior quarterly run rate and consistent with the growth trajectory we provided at Investor Day.\nAnd with that, I'll now hand it over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah, and thanks to all of you joining this morning. As Noah started off, strong results, particularly amid a very volatile market. FRE of $559 million, up 21% quarter-over-quarter -- or I should say, year-over-year. SRE of $826 million ex notables. AUM up $785 million, up 17% year-over-year.\nRecord inflows, $43 billion in the quarter, inclusive of $26 billion at Athene. Solid origination quarter at $56 billion, led primarily by platforms. And most importantly, fund-level returns strong.\nI'd call out 2 particular areas, in the credit business, 8% to 12% now depending on the fund on an LTM basis. And in our hybrid area, 19% on an LTM basis.\nIn communicating what's going on in this market, most of the questions I've received over the past month have been about the macro. So let me start there. It's never been more important to understand the manager philosophy and, thus, the direction of the business. You, as investors, you should expect divergent paths for public asset managers.\nFor us, purchase price matters in all markets. In debt and equity, in upmarkets and down markets, purchase price always matters.\nWe are not a current period profit maximizer. That means we are willing to sit things out. We are willing to reduce leverage. We are willing to wait for the fat pitch.\nThree, we are relentlessly focused on origination as our source of excess return. We are not riding market trends. Hope and prayer we have found to be very poor business strategies, but good strategies for life.\nJust a quick example of this. ADS was onetime leveraged in January of '23. Prudent management of the vehicle took leverage down to 0.5x in January of '25. We have earned the right to deploy in this market, and we expect an acceleration in returns rather than a reduction in risk. This is a totally different positioning than almost everyone else in the marketplace and reflective of the philosophy by which we run the business.\nLet me really pivot to macro. The last few years, through Q1, I would describe as hyper U.S. exceptionalism. Money from around the globe found its way into the U.S., primarily into our listed markets and indices. In the equity market, 10 stocks of the S&P 500 stood for 40% of the index. NVIDIA alone was larger than the market cap of every stock exchange in the world other than Japan, and those 10 stocks reached a height of a 60 PE on a current earnings basis.\nIn credit, BBB corporate spreads tightened below 100 basis points. The last time that happened, 27 years ago, in 1998. CLOs, tightest spreads in a decade.\nEvery asset manager was offered a choice. They could continue buying into this trend, adding risk, adding leverage, reducing credit quality to chase returns, or they could reduce risk, reduce leverage, prepare for the fat, or I should say, fatter pitch, and rely on proprietary origination to try to get them through while public markets and the corollary in private markets did not offer acceptable risk-adjusted returns.\nFor us, we found our returns through origination and structure rather than reaching down the credit curve. We have built massive funding and reduced risk. We are well prepared. We believe we are one of the largest active buyers of assets post Liberation Day, $25 billion in April alone. Interestingly, mostly in public markets. Public markets were the fastest to adjust from a price point of view and exhibited what we expect to see going forward: limited liquidity.\nThe equity market pretty much at all times has liquidity, but investors are discovering what we have been saying for years. There just is no liquidity in publicly-traded fixed income markets. And therefore, we expect extreme price volatility, to the point where sometimes public markets offer better returns on a risk-adjusted basis than private markets.\nThis philosophy impacts the 2 businesses. In Asset Management, we're sitting with $64 billion of dry powder. Really strong investment performance. I'd highlight particularly in private equity. Private equity, their most recent fund, Fund X, sitting with a net IRR at the end of the quarter up 19%, versus 9% for industry peers over the same time period.\nStrong DPI. Purchase price simply matters. The philosophy and performance and product breadth is resonating with our client base. Jim will talk to you about what's happening in capital formation, but think about the 5 or 6 products that are really scaling. ADS is greater than $20 billion in 3 years. S3, our secondaries business, $10 billion in less than 3 years. AAA, greater than $20 billion in 3 years. ABF over $7 billion in less than 2 years. Accord $8.5 billion in less than 2 years.\nWe feel good about what we've done. We feel good about the communication we've had with our investors and partners, and they understand our view of markets and how we have prepared for the more volatile environment that we are seeing today.\nIn Retirement Services, the macro trend continued to play out, exceptionally strong demand for all forms of guaranteed income, reflecting both higher rates and an aging population. We saw interesting competitive behavior in Q1. Think about this. Corporate spreads collapsed. Prepays of higher-yielding assets hit records. And yet we saw increased competition in the most competitive of the channels for retail sales of fixed annuities as competitors try to make up shortfalls with volume and by taking on more risk in asset selection.\nWe chose a different direction. Tighter spreads made it a great time to fund in less competitive channels. We raised $26 billion in the first quarter and another $10 billion in April. We invested that money more in cash, in treasuries, in agencies and paying down leverage. That is not without its cost, but it sets us up well in a volatile market.\nThat move toward more cash and less risky assets cost us approximately $15 million in the first quarter, and if not deployed, will cost us some $30 million for the year. However, $14 billion was invested in April alone at 50 basis points wider spreads than those available in Q1. Lower rates, now forecast in excess of those that we discussed at Investor Day, plus sizable prepays from the record tight spreads in Q1 will create headwinds.\nThe opportunity for us is a strong asset pipeline of proprietary origination, continuation of the wider spreads we're seeing in April, and our ability to run the business in a volatile market because we have prepared for it. We run a theme with a principal mindset and a long-term focus.\nAthene is in an excellent position on an absolute basis relative to nearly all peers, having 4 different funding channels, which were especially important in Q1, against the backdrop of strong secular demand for retirement products. And as you can see, we are spring-loaded on both sides of the balance sheet. That does not mean it will be straight up, but we are well prepared for volatility, and we will react accordingly with our principal hat on, making sure we get the best long-term outcome. Martin will detail for you all the puts and takes for the rest of the year, making a more difficult forecast in an uncertain environment, but one also filled with opportunity.\nLet me return for a moment to the industry that we are in. This is not unique to Apollo. This is the entirety of our industry. We have built this industry over 40 years out of the smallest bucket of our institutional clients called alternatives. We are fortunate we now have another sizable bucket called individuals. We have a third bucket, which are retirement services companies who have witnessed the success of Athene and are starting to emulate.\nWe also now have institutions who, for the first time, are entertaining the use of privates, particularly private investment grade in their fixed income bucket, and we expect eventually will replace some portion of their public equity buckets with equity that is private, but that's for another day.\nMost interestingly, over the second half of last year, and now the beginning of this year, we're seeing yet another source of demand play out, and that is in the form of traditional asset managers. Traditional asset managers are in the process of redefining what active management is. We always thought of active management as the active buying and selling of stocks and bonds. I now believe we will see active management as the public market beta married with appropriate private market assets in structures that investors understand, like mutual funds and ETFs and interval funds and otherwise.\nThese traditional asset managers, I expect, will be large consumers of private assets and will reach clients that our industry probably would not have reached on its own, whether we see the interesting innovations in model portfolios or the interesting partnerships. Or we just look at what we're doing on our own, whether it is access to private credit in a daily liquid wrapper through the State Street PRIV ETF, or the income solutions we've launched with Lord, Abbett through an interval fund, or it's introducing privates into retirement solutions through a target date fund partnered with State Street.\nAcross the board we are working with traditional asset managers to integrate private assets in an appropriate way into products that we and the industry never really expected. These strong sources of demand, starting with the original institutional base and now moving all the way for traditional asset management, I think, portend very well for our industry. so long as we are focused but not growing too fast.\nToo fast to me, we are in the business of excess return per unit of risk, therefore, we are able to grow only as fast as we are able to originate good assets that offer those risk/reward characteristics. Thus, our relentless focus on origination as much as we possibly can across the board in most of the asset classes.\nWe're also seeing interesting innovations across our business that I would call out, not just in traditional asset management, but the early signs of progress in defined contribution, in 401(k) and tax-advantaged, tokenization and digital markets, structured notes and portfolio solutions. I expect the level of creativity at our firm and in our industry to create interesting opportunities, again, boosting demand for private assets. And as you know, I am very bullish on the demand for private assets. And most days, I wake up concerned more about the supply and, thus, origination.\nUncertainty leads to volatility, but volatility historically has been our friend. We would rather have uncertainty from our current position of strength than any other way.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President & Chief Investment Officer-Credit, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. I'd like to start by sharing some perspective and view on the recent market volatility.\nThe current administration was clear on their objectives pre and post election. They want to revitalize American industry, bring back manufacturing, focus on domestic energy production and stimulate the industrial global renaissance. Tariff, taxes and regulation are the 3-legged stool to support these objectives. While the tariffs should not have come as a surprise, the scope and approach clearly rattled markets.\nAt Apollo, we've been preparing for this environment - like this environment and positioning the firm, as Marc mentioned, defensively, in anticipation of this market disruption with dry powder and liquidity to thrive.\nAs a reminder, we run our business as an equal opportunity investor with the ability to pivot between public and private primary and secondary, allowing us to focus on the most compelling risk reward. As market structure has evolved and private credit has grown far beyond direct lending to include vast pools of investment-grade assets, we believe our presence has been amplified given the differentiated model and strong relative position to address this broader opportunity set.\nOur long-dated capital has clearly demonstrated its capacity in the investment-grade arena, complementing our expertise in the noninvestment-grade arena over time. In recent months when public markets went no bid, we brought our own bid. This wasn't just liquidity, it was leadership.\nFor some, capital-light has become code for heads we win, tails we win, and hopefully, our clients do okay. In contrast, our aligned client-centric model, along with our principal-driven balance sheet, allows our platform a degree of maneuverability that is unmatched. Over many years, we built a platform to deliver stable, strong performance for our clients, and Q1 was no exception.\nTouching on origination. As Marc mentioned, we originated $56 billion of assets during the quarter, representing nearly a 30% growth year-over-year. This result was driven by activity across our diversified channels, platforms, core credit, high-grade corporate solutions, equity and hybrid. And significant momentum to start the year positions us to hit our full year targets of exceeding last year's level -- record level of volume.\nEven with credit spreads at or near generational tights, the advantages of our origination engine shine through. For example, our 16 affiliated platforms and core credit channels, we originated nearly $49 billion of assets at 200 to 250 basis points of excess spread versus comparable rated corporates, or 300 to 375 over comparable treasuries.\nIn the first quarter, we observed market tightening of approximately 30 basis points to levels representing generational tights before subsequent widening of 30 to 45 basis points in April. Our origination activity continues to be very broad-based with diversified flow that is not dependent on any one platform or transaction.\nThe deep dive, we originated over $11 billion via the broad sponsor channel in more than 80 different financing opportunities, showcasing our leading presence and depth in connectivity to the market. Just recently, our leadership in the financing for Karo Healthcare, sponsored by KKR, is another example where we stepped into a structure at attractive financing solutions in lieu of a broadly syndicated loan package. The sponsor selected of the Apollo-led consortium owing to our speed of execution and certainty of closing. We believe wins like this create a flywheel effect where demonstrating results lead us being the first call for solutions to broad clients.\nElsewhere, within our infrastructure and energy investing franchise, we signed, committed or deployed over $3 billion during the quarter across a half-dozen opportunities across the globe, highlighting our growing presence to originate with and finance the ongoing global industrial renaissance.\nThis current environment provides an opportunity to stay close to our clients and understand how we can be helpful and best serve their needs. For example, we continue to work closely with our multiple bank partners. The recently announced financing for the Jeppesen [indiscernible] Boeing via our Citi partnership is a great example of our ongoing collaboration. During this time, our scaled durable capital base and structuring expertise allowed us to offer flexible solutions with certainty for borrowers. As a result, our origination pipeline in a variety of areas, with particular focus on high-grade capital solutions and hybrid, has never been broader and wider.\nTurning to capital formation. We generated record quarterly organic inflows of $43 billion across the business, comprised of $18 billion from asset management and a remarkable $26 billion from Athene. Our capital formation engine is highly differentiated and less prone to cyclical fundraising dynamics. And our historical strong presence within the institutional channel are building momentum in wealth channel, and our market leadership in Retirement Services is a formidable combination.\nWithin the $18 billion of inflows from asset management in the quarter, approximately 70% went to credit-oriented strategies and 30% to equity-oriented strategies, with contribution coming from a broad array of investors around the globe.\nTwo strategies in particular, our Cord Plus, our opportunistic credit strategy, and S3, our sponsor and secondary solutions, both recently held successful final closings that demonstrate that our approach is resonating. S3 Equity and Hybrid Solutions Fund I closed with $5.4 billion in commitments, bringing total capital raised across the S3 ecosystem to nearly $10 billion since launching 3 years ago. And our Cord Plus Fund II closed with $4.8 billion of commitments, which when combined with the associated managed accounts bring the capital -- brings the capital raise for this strategy to $8.5 billion in less than 2 years.\nGlobal Wealth continues to be an important strategic contributor to our growth, and we are extremely excited on the momentum we are seeing in that business. The emergence of a market volatility did not have an observable impact as we generated our best fundraising quarter-to-date, approaching $5 billion in the quarter, and 85% year-over-year increase from 1 quarter '24. And I would add that, that's across 18 separate strategies, encompassing our semi-liquid suite as well as a variety of drawdown and QP offerings.\nWe saw notable strength in Asia during the quarter as our offering continues to gain traction in that region.\nWe continue to effectively scale the business with 6 strategies now above $1 billion in AUM. And while still early, the growth trends in the wealth channel are showing signs of durability post Liberation Day.\nAthene had an outstanding quarter, as mentioned, with $26 billion of organic flows the highest results on record. By channel, inflows were driven by $10 billion from retail, $11 billion from funding agreements and $5 billion in flow reinsurance. Retail flows were led in strength by MYGAs and FIAs. And the FABN issuance was the strongest on record as we leaned in and took advantage of very favorable issuance spreads, as Marc mentioned.\nIn flow reinsurance, we capitalize on the strategic opportunity in the U.S. client -- with a U.S. client that drove outsized volume. As we progress throughout the year, we continue to expect Athene's mix of new business will look like last year, with strong activity in the funding agreement and retail channels.\nAthene remains extremely well positioned to serve the enormous needs of the growing retiree population, and executing on this opportunity will enable Athene to durably grow earnings in the future.\nOur team remains focused on serving our clients and deserving our promise of excess return. We are leaning into areas of imbalance between capital and opportunity, and we have been extremely active in the market over the past month leaning into volatility with size, speed and structure. We are viewed as a partner of choice to provide capital solutions to companies unable to go public, provide liquidity solutions to GPs that need realizations, and provide alternative pools of capital to public companies seeking fund diversification or simply CapEx growth.\nIf the client of dialogue in recent weeks is any barometer of the demand of our services, then the outlook for Apollo is very, very bright. The open architecture and integrated model of our firm allows us to pivot and navigate swiftly in periods of short or extreme volatility. The recent stretch has clearly been one of our busiest in the last few years, and we're approaching the opportunity from a position in strength.\nSince the beginning of April, in addition to what Mark mentioned as the IG activity of gross $27 billion, we have participated in over 40 direct lending or financing transactions and have also seen strong activity in the NAV loan finance sector. Our pipelines remain incredibly robust across our firm.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Martin.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results demonstrate the strength of our platform and our ability to execute in a dynamic environment. I'll quickly walk through our financial results, highlight some key drivers that will position the balance of the year and then touch on capital allocation.\nFRE. In Asset Management, we generated $559 million of fee-related earnings for the quarter, a new record. FRE grew by 21% year-over-year and was driven by 3 components: 18% management fee growth with notable strength from credit, which grew by 23%; capital solutions fees of more than $150 million for the quarter, a very strong outcome in view of the emerging volatility; and expense discipline with combined comp and noncomp expenses growing by 11% year-over-year. The uptick in compensation expense reflects continued investments across our business to execute on our broad set of growth opportunities.\n17% overall revenue growth combined with 11% overall cost growth resulted in approximately 200 basis points of FRE margin expansion year-over-year.\nConsistent with prior comments, we remain confident in the long-term margin potential of the business and expect to see expansion over a multiyear period as our business continues to scale.\nKey drivers within our FRE growth plan for 2025 includes sustained momentum in global wealth, continued strength in third-party credit more broadly, in particular, our asset-backed finance business and our origination platforms, and growth in PE adjacent businesses within equity, specifically hybrid value and secondaries. Given the momentum we see in the business, we are very confident in our 2025 earnings guidance.\nSRE. At the same time, Athene's business is facing a number of market-driven uncertainties, which I will touch on in a minute. Athene's net invested assets grew by 15% year-over-year, driven by record organic inflows with strength across the 3 channels that Jim just highlighted. We generated $826 million of SRE for the quarter, excluding notable items. Adjusting to our long-term 11% return expectation on the alternatives portfolio will contribute an additional $29 million in investment income.\nThe alts return for the quarter came in higher than our pre-release estimates due to positive valuation adjustments amid late quarter volatility. The notable item in the quarter stem from a change to how we recognize income on certain derivatives and resulted in a $22 million unfavorable impact within cost of funds within the quarter.\nIn spread terms, net spread, ex notables, of 129 basis points declined by 8 basis points sequentially. And you can see the components clearly laid out on the bridge we provided within our earnings presentation.\nRecall that spread-related earnings and net spread results are partly a function of the environment and partly from proactive choices we are taking to position the business for long-term success. Relative to our SRE target for the year of $3.5 billion, which contemplated an 11% alts return. We are seeing 1.5 additional rate cuts, which is about a $40 million headwind if realized; competitive pressure in the retail channel of approximately 10 basis points on an assumed $35 billion to $40 billion of volume; along with $40 million of headwinds from higher asset prepayments. Those are the headwinds, along with the liquidity builds, that Marc referenced earlier. And collectively, they impact both our net investment income and our cost of funds trends.\nIn view of these dynamics and assuming normalized investment spreads for the balance of the year, instead of the wider spread conditions in April, we expect a mid-single-digit growth rate for 2025 off the rebased $3.2 billion starting point. We have an opportunity to earn some of this back based on the deployment pipeline and market volatility providing wider spreads, in which case, our growth rate will be higher.\nWhile different macro or business variables come into play in any given year, you should trust that we'll do sensible things to navigate the environment, and we remain focused on delivering the 10% average growth we laid out within our 5-year plan.\nTurning finally to capital allocation. We deployed over $700 million for share repurchases in the first quarter, including $130 million for opportunistic buybacks. As we have done in the past, we will seek to be relatively more active when there are particularly compelling opportunities or dislocation in our share price.\nOver the last 12 months, we've returned $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases while also allocating more than $200 million of capital to strategically invest in future growth initiatives.\nDuring the quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bridge Investment Group in an all-stock transaction with an equity value of approximately $1.5 billion. Bridge is an established leader in residential and industrial real estate as well as other specialized real estate asset classes. We believe Bridge will enhance our existing real estate business, providing immediate scale and origination capabilities that fit synergistically within Apollo's ecosystem, in particular, asset demand from Athene and ARIS, our semi-liquid real estate-oriented products.\nWe look forward to welcoming the Bridge team on board later this year. and we expect the transaction to close in Q3, subject to outstanding closing conditions.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in Apollo Fund.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn. Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone, to our call. Joining me to discuss our results and the momentum we're seeing across the business are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, President; and Martin Kelly, CFO.\nEarlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. As you can see, fourth quarter results punctuated a very strong year of performance. In the quarter specifically, we generated record fee-related earnings of $554 million or $0.90 per share. Spread related earnings of $841 million or $1.37 per share and adjusted net income of $1.4 billion or $2.22 per share, the highest quarterly level we've earned to date.\nThe fourth quarter represented another milestone for us as we were thrilled to be added to the S&P 500 in December. This is a testament to the firm's differentiated strategy, remarkable growth and institutionalization as a public company. Since we listed on the NYSE in 2011, our market cap has grown from approximately $2 billion to more than $100 billion. We expect our inclusion will broaden our public shareholder base and enable more investors to gain exposure to private markets by investing in our business. Of course, this milestone would not have been possible without the collective effort and ingenuity of all our colleagues across the firm who drive the business forward every day.\nAnd with that, I'll now hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah, and good morning to all. As Noah suggested, 2024 wrapped up in exactly the way we wanted, growth and execution. FRE for the quarter $2.1 billion, up 17% year-over-year. SRE $3.2 billion, in line with Investor Day guidance. Record annual ANI $4.6 billion.\nAs we've often suggested the reward for good work is more work. Record AUM, $751 billion, total inflow is $150 billion and origination volume over $220 billion. In short, this is exactly the quarter and exactly the year we wanted. Recall what we are trying to do and what we've reiterated in our 5-year planning process, we are not here to grow the fastest. We are not here to grow the largest. We are here to deliver the plan plus a little and like who we are and like our franchise at the end of the 5-year journey.\nAs we've said, our goal over the next 5 years is to grow FRE at an average annual rate of 20%, SRE at 10% and in any 1 year, FRE between 15% and 20%, particularly in nonfundraising years. This is exactly what we hope to do. And again, we are not here to blow the doors off any 1 quarter. We are investing in the business because what's in front of us, dwarfs, what's behind us, and it is important that we set ourselves up well for that opportunity.\nAt a recent partner's offsite, we gather all 200 partners of Apollo. And among the questions I asked them was, if we have a challenge beating our 5-year plan, is that challenge, external or internal? 90% of the people recognize what I recognize is that challenge is internal. It is all about us executing, all about us aligning the resources that we have, making the right investments. The market is coming our way. It doesn't mean every day. It doesn't mean every quarter, but I like the way the external environment is developing. And the toughest thing we do, and I know this will sound somewhat trite, toughest thing we do and now that Jim does because I get to share the responsibility with him is to keep the team planning to win. Successful companies across our industry, across every industry, have a tendency to play not to lose. And with the amount of change that our industry is facing and the amount of opportunity in front of us, we want the team that steps up every day and plays to win.\nThe strategy, as you know, is set. So what is playing to win look like? Well, for us, it is to recognize where we think the industry is going and how we think the industry is developing. As we've said, our business is going to be driven by 4 really large fundamental changes taking place in the marketplace. The first is this notion of a global industrial renaissance. We're seeing it literally every day in the U.S. in particular. And this is not just about AI and deep sea. This is amount fundamental investments in energy and infrastructure, in power and data and next-generation manufacturing and a host of other things that are going to be needed, financed and borrowed.\nThe second big driver of our business is retirement, retirement, not just in the traditional sense through Athene of providing guaranteed lifetime income, but in the nontraditional sense of helping retirees retire better. The third, recall that our entire industry was built out of the alternatives bucket of institutional clients. As all of you know from the past few years, individuals have the potential to be as large as institutions in the same sorts of products, and they will not take anywhere near 40 years to get to that size.\nAnd finally, and I think personally the most important driver of our business is an entire rethink of public and private. And what I mean by that is our industry grew up where I think people thought private was risky and public was safe. And when something is risky, you put it in a small bucket and you call it an alternative and you want very high rates of return from it. And 40 years later, after our industry starts, I think that professionals in our industry now understand that private is safe and risky and public and safe and risky. And if people are not watching closely, the largest asset manager, the traditional asset manager in our industry has delivered a wake-up call to their entire peer set, that private is going to be an important part of client solutions going forward.\nSo let me spend a little bit on each of these 4 drivers. When we think about the global industrial renaissance to us, this is the largest place we can originate. It is not just the origination coming off our 16 owned platforms, but it is the unique bespoke underwritings for the Intels and others to build the next-generation economy. This quarter, second best quarter ever, more than $60 billion of originations.\nOriginations are not just about putting capital out the door. It's about putting capital out the door at excess return per unit of risk. We want to originate that which has value, so long as we originate and capture spread by offering clients things they cannot buy in liquid public markets, we will win. It is not simply chasing a number for the quarter.\nIn retirement, yes, we are well set up to serve retirement. Athene is the largest in the industry, continues to have industry-leading market share and for the year, generated more than $70 billion of organic inflows. $70 billion could have been $75 billion or $80 billion. It is not our goal, as I suggested, to grow disproportionately in any 1 quarter or in any 1 year. And to give you a sense of momentum and retirement, just January of Athene inflows, more than $9 billion. That should not be 12x $9 billion for the year because that is not what we seek to do. We seek to earn excess returns. And when we see opportunities to do that, we will be very aggressive. And when returns are not as plentiful or not where we want them to be, we will back off. We run a principal-based business, and you can count us to be good responsible stewards of capital.\nElsewhere in retirement -- well, before I pivot from Athene, as I said, Athene has grown in traditional products that we would associate with the retirement industry, pension, funding agreements, individual annuities, group annuities and the like. We will continue to do that, and that will continue to be a growing market, but the future of Athene is about the next generation of retirement products. We as a company and we as an industry, have yet to really hit on our full potential, and I believe our full potential is to offer consumers and businesses and clients, much simpler solutions, guaranteed lifetime income versus a complex annuity is where I think the journey is focused.\nThere are other forms of guaranteed income that are prevalent throughout our financial system that Athene also has the opportunity to make inroads in and to offer industry-leading solutions. Away from the pure retirement business built on Athene, Apollo Asset Management continues to make inroads into the retirement market. This is in the absence of any legislative or regulatory change as we suggested in our last get together we already had 1 CIT up and running in a retirement solution. We now have our second, and we are making really good progress with record keepers and continue to believe that target date funds, managed accounts and other forms of retirement solutions will offer a robust future in the absence of legislative change. And with legislative change, this could be one of the true drivers of our industry, not just our business going forward.\nAs to individuals, record results, $12 billion in 2024, up 50%, Q4 was our second best ever, just truly an exceptional year. And again, the philosophy by which we run this business is not to grow disproportionately in any 1 quarter. Consider ADS, we run this vehicle for the long term. We run it with the lease leverage, the most senior, the largest companies. We want to be around for the long term. We want to take advantage of market dislocation. If we're innovating, we're innovating in access. As you know, we now offer it in a tokenized format. We'll innovate in how to serve our clients, but as an investment proposition, excess return per unit of risk, purchase price matters, we run these businesses for the long term, not for any quarterly goal or otherwise.\nJim will talk more about the diversified portfolio of products that we now offer to individuals, and I continue to believe this will be one of the most promising areas.\nJust a word on public versus private before I wrap up and talk about a few other things. BlackRock made a number of very significant acquisitions in 2024. Those acquisitions lay a foundation for an integration of public and private. I continue to believe this convergence of public and private will be a very important source of demand for private assets. I see private assets in any number of forms. Our industry and our firm will be a supplier of product to traditional asset managers as they seek to make their products more competitive given the incredible amount of indexation and correlation and quite frankly, just data that exists in the market.\nWe envision that traditional asset managers will evolve their businesses to include products that are public and private. Some traditional asset managers will actually want to launch new products that are co-branded. We are doing that as well. And some will seek to augment their business with massive managed accounts where they have access to private assets from a variety of different players. I think this is good for our entire industry. We will not, as an industry, serve the vast majority of clients around the world. We simply don't have the resources. We don't have the efficient systems and we don't have the relationships. What we do have so long as we're good at it, it's products that offer excess return per unit of risk. I see a very good marriage between our industry, our company, and the public or traditional asset managers who I believe are going to reinvent their businesses, spurred on by competitive forces.\nSo enough on the market for a bit. I continue to think in summary, that we have 4 drivers, any one of which could be a double in our business, and they will power our business forward in terms of demand for private assets. I continue to believe that the [indiscernible] will limit our growth in our business is limited to our capacity to originate good risk and to our culture and ability to absorb growth.\nWe watch both very carefully, in particular, on originations. One of the things that we have begun to do this year is to figure out how to expand our origination engine in certain parts of our business, for instance, in infrastructure, we have decided to do some modest M&A. You noticed in the quarter the addition of Argo. Argo is an infrastructure manager will add some $6 billion of high-quality AUM to our platform, but the single most important factor in deciding to absorb Argo is the Argo team. The capacities to continue to originate not just for their drawdown funds, but for our Evergreen retail funds, for our SMAs and managed accounts. And for all the vehicles of the Apollo platform is eye-opening to the Argo team and we will benefit by having a scaled business with an excellent track record join us. You should expect us to continue to do modest M&A along these same lines, where we are quite focused on increasing our capacity to originate. That is what we intend to do.\nSo I will leave lots of time for Q&A, and I'm sure we will talk about regulatory and the backdrop to what we do. But with that, I'm going to pass it over to my partner, to Jim Zelter.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President & Chief Investment Officer-Credit, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. At Investor Day, we discussed our view of today's investing paradigm, which is that private markets have a pivotal role to play in the financing, in the global industrial renaissance. As a society, we've laid out our massive global goals including hedging the energy transition, modernizing our power and utility grids and building next-generation digital infrastructure. Each of these has already created unprecedented need for capital. And in our view, these ambitions will be difficult to accomplish with our large-scale private capital solutions.\nAs we've discussed, our success is determined by our capacity to originate high-quality assets with excess return that benefit our fund partners and investors. The lack of flexible financing available today provides a unique opportunity to offer solutions that access our differentiated scaled capital base. While public IG funding is widely accessible, we believe we can provide superior flexibility, customization and certainty for borrowers and these capabilities are resonating in the marketplace.\nAs Marc mentioned, our origination engine has had tremendous momentum with a record $222 billion of our assets originated across our ecosystem in the last 12 months, approximately double that of 2023. This result was driven by a meaningful contribution from each of our channels including more than $95 billion from our 16 origination platforms and more than $90 billion from traditional core credit and approximately $25 billion from high-grade corporate solutions and $10 billion from a variety of equity inputs.\nAcross all of our debt origination activity, we sourced assets at approximately 350 to 400 basis points above treasuries, on average. Importantly, with spreads near multiyear tights across many segments of the credit market, our direct origination advantage remained durable, allowing us to capture 200 to 250 basis points of excess spread relative to comparatively rated corporates on the majority of what we originate.\nAnd I'll just comment, over the course of the last year, we observed the market tightened approximately 25 to 30 basis points but our debt originations saw similar, even less compression depending on the specific asset class, not more, enabling us to capture the attractive excess spread origination which is the key to our success.\nEntering 2025, we're focused on continuing our scale of origination capabilities and make progress toward our targets. This year, there will be really 3 key areas where we originate and focus in define success for the year. One is continuing scaling of ATLAS SP, our affiliated warehouse financing platform, which drove approximately half of our platform origination last year and represents a significant part of our growth plan.\nThe second pillar is lender finance. Lender finance is a large opportunity that we expect to grow rapidly across multiple areas of our credit franchise. One area we're particularly focused is on the ability to lend against private credit collateral in all channels where investors reside today.\nThe third is our combined direct lending. This encompasses our affiliated mid-cap financial lending platform, which originated more than $20 billion of volume last year as well as our high-grade corporate solutions and our large cap direct lending, which we continue to expand client coverage with an integrated tool box that is unmatched in the marketplace. So formation is the lifeblood of our continued growth. Last year, we generated $152 billion in total inflows across the platform comprised of $81 billion from our asset management business and as Marc mentioned, $71 billion from Athene.\nIn short, both sides of the house produced. Within asset management, our institutional and wealth channels each had strong results. Within institutional, '24 was a record year for a nonflagship year, and Global Wealth is continuing to gain momentum with greater inflows over successive years and successive quarters.\nDouble clicking on that fundraising for the quarter, credit-oriented strategies drove the activity, accounting for nearly 80% of third-party capital raised with inflows coming from more than 100 discrete funds or accounts. Some of the more significant contributors included our IG investment-grade Total Return Fund, the second vintage of Accord+, several third-party SMAs, which now insurance SMAs, which now totaled 24 as well as credit-focused wealth products we manage, including ADS, ABC and others.\nFor Athene, it's worth noting that the business was able to exceed its full year growth target by adeptly pivoting across its 4 channels. This is despite having to navigate a unique set of circumstances particularly within the pension business where Athene provides value-added solutions for corporate clients and serves more than 0.5 million pensioners. We continue to be focused on diligently building Athene, managing its growth on a year-to-year rather than quarter-over-quarter basis to drive consistent and durable growth earnings over time.\nThe business remains extremely well positioned, and we expect we'll be a leader in new product creation to serve the needs of this massive retirement population. Relative to '24 levels, we expect to drive greater inflows across both asset management and retirement services in 2025 as we expect to execute against our 5-year plan. The average annual capital formation targets we communicated at Investor Day indicate a natural upward progression as we continue to penetrate the vast market opportunities that Marc discussed.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Martin to address our financial results in more detail.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As you can see in our results, and as you've heard from both Marc and Jim this morning, 2024 is a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo, particularly given the shifting interest rate and more subdued monetization backdrop. We delivered on the financial targets we communicated, and we set a very strong foundation for the 5-year plan we presented at the Investor Day.\nI'll quickly walk through our financial performance, and highlight some key drivers that we believe will position us for a successful 2025. In the Asset Management business, we posted a new quarterly record for fee-related earnings, generating $2.1 billion of FRE for the full year or 17% growth. Two distinct areas of strength in our revenue picture in 2024 were management fees from our credit business, which increased almost 20% within that, growth in third-party credit management fees exceeding Athene and Athora as well as capital solutions fees, which increased almost 25% year-over-year, as Marc highlighted.\nOur capabilities within ACS continued to expand alongside our overall origination and deployment activity. Fee-related revenue grew by 15% and expenses by 14%, resulting in another year of FRE margin expansion. Very importantly, we're reaping the reward from past investments, which are now generating revenue growth across the platform, while at the same time, prioritizing current investments to build strategically important areas of our multiyear plan. A few of the most important initiatives that will be critical to driving success in the year ahead and beyond include global wealth, third-party credit and PE adjacent businesses within equity.\nIn Global Wealth, we see significant momentum across the business with meaningful contributions likely to come from the semiliquid products fleet, comprising 11 discrete products, including 6 currently sized at approximately $1 billion or more and continuing to scale.\nIn third-party credit, we expect asset-backed finance, key origination platforms and outlets as well as direct lending strategies to be impactful. And in terms of PE adjacent businesses, we expect infrastructure, clean transition, secondaries and hybrid value to have increasing contributions.\nTaken together and combined with the growing ACS franchise, we expect to raise, deploy and indicate significant amounts of capital that will drive attractive fee-related earnings growth. In 2025, we expect fee-related earnings growth to approximate 15% to 20%, consistent with non-flagship PEs and reflecting capacity to continue making significant investments in the growth priorities we have articulated.\nAs we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to expect fee-related earnings will grow by approximately 20% on average over the next 5 years, and everything we're seeing in the business is tracking well to deliver on that goal.\nMoving to Retirement Services. We posted a strong quarter of spread-related earnings, generating $3.2 million of SRE for the full year, consistent again with our comments at Investor Day. What are returns from Athene's alts portfolio were in line with our inaugural prerelease issued on January 7. Athene's net invested assets grew 14% in 2024 driven by record organic growth.\nNet spread ex notables of 137 basis points declined moderately year-over-year due to several factors, principally the interest rate transition and our proactive steps to mitigate the impact of lock-in spread as well as a tighter spread backdrop and a slightly lower average allocation to alts.\nImportantly, the underwritten spread on new business volumes exceeded 140 basis points during the year, supporting the current net spread of the business before considering the carry-through impact from interest rate cuts that have already taken place.\nAs we discussed at Investor Day, we expect to grow spread-related earnings by approximately 10% on average over the next 5 years, excluding the impact of interest rate transitions. We expect interest rate-related headwinds in 2025 to be largely consistent with our Investor Day comments, which embedded an assumption of 6 total equivalent rate cuts from last September through the end of 2025. Assuming an alts return of 11%, we expect SRE to approximately $2.5 billion in 2025 as we previously communicated. Key drivers of our SRE growth in the year ahead will be Athene's net organic growth, the net spread on that growth, the trajectory of interest rates and the returns on Athene's alts portfolio.\nTurning lastly to principal investing income, PII benefited from greater realized performance fees in 2024 as monetization activity improved from 2023 levels. In the fourth quarter specifically, PII benefited from the seasonal carry [ crystallization ] of certain credit strategies as well as a lower compensation ratio.\nOur net accrued performance fee balance at December 31 was $1.7 billion or $2.75 per share and continues to be supported by strong investment performance. We've generated compelling double-digit gross returns across a variety of growth strategies in 2025 as well as hybrid value -- sorry, in 2024 as well as 35% for PE fund.\nAnd finally, our operating tax rate in the fourth quarter benefited from large deductions in quarter related to employee stock compensation due to a higher share price. Going forward, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 20% over the long term, subject to usual quarterly variability.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase and interest in any Apollo fund. I would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone, to our call. We appreciate the opportunity to speak with you and discuss all the momentum we're seeing across the firm. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. We reported solid second quarter financial results, which included record quarterly FRE of $516 million or $0.84 per share, an SRE of $710 million or $1.15 per share. combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported adjusted net income of $1 billion or $1.64 per share.\nJoining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. With that, I'll hand the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Thank you for joining us. Happy summer. Those in New York certainly know what I'm talking about. This quarter was a good reminder that great companies are built by honoring the fundamental promise they have made to their clients. In our industry, alternative assets, the fundamental promise that we make to our clients is excess return per unit of risk. Absent that, I'm not sure why we, as an industry, would exist. This promise, the delivery on this promise was on full display across the entirety of our franchise for the quarter. True in private equity, in hybrid and in our credit franchise.\nJust a quick tour of the quarter. In private equity, we announced 3 transactions in the past 30 days, Travel Corp, Everi and IGT Gaming, truly an amazing stat. Team is working around the clock. If you think about the last decade of our private equity franchise, which is encompassed by funds 9 and 10, $45 billion of capital, $13 billion already realized in Fund 9 as of the end of the quarter, 29 gross, 20 net. In Fund X, 47 gross and 20 net, notwithstanding headwinds across the private equity industry by people who perhaps strayed from a fundamental promise. The team is doing an unbelievable job.\nIn hybrid, or equity that is private, something we'll talk more about on Investor Day, AAA, which is our flagship vehicle, returned 10% over the last 12 months with on track quarterly results. We now have positive returns in AAA 16 quarters in a row. To give you a longer-term perspective of why investors like hybrid, we've had 2 down quarters over the past 38. In a market characterized by volatility, by indexation and correlation by key bets on very high-flying companies, the notion that you can achieve double-digit rates of return in the equity market and still have downside protection and reduced volatility is incredibly attractive to investors across the entire spectrum from retirees to those seeking to accumulate. We have $17 billion of NAV now in our AAA vehicle. And as I've suggested, I expect this will be our largest fund over a period of time.\nCredit, which is the largest of our franchise, also had an amazing quarter. We were early in Credit, and we have built a leading and a differentiated franchise. Recall that the differentiation of our franchise is a unique focus on investment grade, private investment grade to be specific. To give you just some of the performance stats for our major vehicles for the quarter, our total return fund up nearly 2% for the quarter, 10% latest 12 months. Structured credit and ABS, 2% for the quarter, 15% for the latest 12 months. ADS, our direct lending vehicle, private market BDC, if you will, up 3.4% for the quarter, 17% in latest 12 months. Direct origination, 3.8% for the quarter, 19% for latest 12 months. Across the entirety of the franchise, equity, hybrid and credit, this was an awesome quarter.\nI start with performance because ultimately, the reward for good performance is more work. In our case, more work is inflows. We had record inflows for the quarter for a non-PE franchise year of $39 billion. Institutional was $16 billion, Global Wealth $4 billion, up 50% versus the first quarter. And Athene had organic inflows of $17 billion. It was truly a great quarter across asset management. Asset management is generally benefiting from tailwinds. What we're seeing in our business is not the result of a quarterly spike or peak, we're seeing a fundamental shift in the marketplace, and it is happening across the entirety of our franchise. If you step back and think about what the big drivers are, certainly, the big driver in credit. We are looking at 3 really interesting trends. Think of the places that capital is needed in our economy over the next decade. We are going to spend an awful lot of money on next generation of infrastructure for data centers and AI. We are going to spend an equal amount of money for energy transition, and we are going to spend a lot of money on what I'll call normal infrastructure. All 3 of those things are long-dated. Many of them are structured, many of them are complex. These are the kinds of things that are not well suited for institutions who are funded short. These are exactly the kinds of transactions in the investment-grade market that we expect to drive our business and are driving our business.\nThe way we look at the driver of our business, certainly in credit is by originations. Recall that we have a $125 million target for this year for originations. We originated $52 billion in the quarter, including $11 billion from Intel alone. We are quickly approaching the $150 billion target that we set for 2026. And the team is unhappy to hear this because they know I'm going to revise the number up. Just to give you a sense for how strong the trends are. Year-to-date, we've deployed $17 million in next-generation infrastructure alone. I expect this not to be a 1- or 2-quarter blip. I expect this to drive our business over the next decade against the backdrop of regulatory change, against the backdrop of government borrowing and all the other trends that we know are happening in fixed income.\nOrigination also drives for us Capital Solutions. Capital Solutions fees and revenues are the byproduct of a successful origination franchise. Fee revenue totaled more than $200 million. We are on pace for a record year. Our pipeline is as strong as it has ever been, and we will continue to build out the business, both by industry and by geography, including major advances in Australia and in Asia because the need for originated high-quality investment-grade assets with spread is global.\nLet me turn now to Athene and Retirement Services. Retirement Services is now in its 15th year. We've basically grown our earnings over 15 years at 15%, including 26% last year. Just like in Asset Management, good performance is ultimately rewarded with more capital. In Athene's case, this is the ability to attract strategic investors to support Athene through its sidecar, which we call ADIP. ADIP is the capital engine that helps Athene scale its business, and run a truly efficient franchise. ADIP II has now closed and raised $6 billion, almost twice as much as ADIP I. As far as we know, this is the largest third-party capital sidecar in the retirement services industry. For the quarter, Athene hit every operating metric: new business volumes, underwritten returns, credit quality, expenses, surrenders, capital. The quarter was impacted by -- excuse me, profitability for the quarter was impacted by the roll-off of exceptionally profitable business, which was put on during the peak of COVID. That same roll-off of business will also occur in the next quarter. Also during the quarter, the disagreement over the direction of interest rates towards the beginning of the quarter provided us opportunities to do additional hedging, which we did for the quarter. The roll-off of this business and hedging essentially caused us growth for the quarter and will cost us growth for Q3. We expect by Q4, the business to grow and to be back on trend. The result being that we will achieve in our estimation, mid-single-digits SRE growth for the year, accounting for the 2 last quarters, and we will return to trend double-digit growth next year. Martin will detail further and we'll dissect the pieces of this business, which I know are of interest to many of you. Athene is on track for $70 billion of organic inflows for the year.\nWhen I step back, we are simply fortunate to have delivered on our core promise to customers and to be in a market and in an industry that is driven by long-term tailwinds. We have essentially 4 tailwinds in front of us. The first I've already detailed, which is this voracious need for capital, most of which we believe to be investment grade. That will drive our fixed income franchise, fixed income replacement. The second retirement is a fact of life. We are all getting older. We have so far over the first 15 years at Athene, one, by producing incredibly good returns, not just for investors, but for customers. But essentially, what we have done is we have modernized existing products. The opportunity now exists for the entire next generation of products to serve retirees, whether they are in the traditional insurance sector or they are in the vast pool of 401(k), which heretofore has been off limits to most alternative assets providers.\nThe third, our entire industry over a 40-year period has been built out of a small bucket of the institutional marketplace. We are watching an individual marketplace led by family offices and high net worth individuals that I believe will grow to be the size of the institutional market over time. And finally, and a notion that we will spend lots of time on at Investor Day, we are watching investors fundamentally rethink the difference between public and private. We grew up thinking that private was risky and that public was safe, and that probably was true 40 years ago. Private represented 3 products, private equity, venture capital and hedge funds. And public diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds.\nWhat if our fundamental premise is wrong? What if private is both safe and risky and public is both safe and risky. The entire basis on which we have constructed portfolio allocation will need to be rethought. I don't have to guess at this. This is already happening in the fixed income bucket of our large institutional clients who are making daily trade-offs between a public investment grade and private investment grade. It is happening in fixed income first because there are helpful gatekeepers or signposts, call rating agencies who help investors discern quality between public and private markets. It is also helped by that there is not real liquidity in public fixed income markets. So the trade-off of liquidity is not that The opportunity in front of us over the next few years is fixed income replacement which will provide a turbocharge to an otherwise healthy business. But make no mistake, replacement is coming for the equity business as well. We will end up with a portion of public equity that decides that equity can be private as well. And we will have access to other parts of our institutional investors allocation. We look forward to seeing you at Investor Day and it certainly has been an active summer. And with that, I will turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott Martin Kleinman\n\nCo-President of Apollo Asset Management Inc. & Director\n\nThanks. And as Mark touched on, each of our core business drivers, deployment, investment performance and capital formation were strong in the second quarter and highlight that momentum across Apollo is building. As we've discussed, our current 5-year plan is underpinned by 3 strategic growth pillars, including origination, global wealth and capital solutions, all of which are tracking ahead of our 2026 targets and fueling growth in our franchise and our earnings power.\nOn the investing front, gross capital deployment surged to a record $70 billion in the second quarter. The driving force of this strong investing activity was debt origination, complemented by deployment in hybrid and equity strategies. Record debt origination in the second quarter was driven by broad-based strength across all 3 forms of origination: traditional, platforms and record levels of high-grade corporate solutions activity. Combined with the strong first quarter, debt origination volume in the first half of the year was close to the total amount originated for all of 2023, highlighting the increasing scale of our ecosystem. We expect momentum in overall deployment activity to persist given the line of sight we have to robust transaction pipelines in both our equity and debt-focused businesses.\nAs a result of the higher interest rate backdrop and structural changes in traditional financing markets, we're seeing a lot of demand for customized, long-dated solutions that utilize debt capital, equity capital or a combination of both. We believe we're uniquely positioned to meet this need by accessing our lower cost scale of long-duration capital within Athene and elsewhere, coupled with our flexible investment approach that aims to maximize risk return across the capital structure.\nWithin second quarter activity, the Intel transaction, Marc explained earlier is a prime example of how we combine these powerful advantages to serve clients in a differentiated way. Importantly, we expect the markets for these type of transactions to grow from here, supported by the multitrillion dollar opportunity to finance the clean energy transition and AI infrastructure build-out. Another theme we're observing in the current rate backdrop is that the bid-ask spread between buyers and sellers is persisting, hampering investment activity for most. At the industry level, the second quarter saw the lowest number of private equity deals in a quarter since the onset of COVID. This is a moment where our PE capabilities have the opportunity to shine. We believe that unlike others, we're well positioned to capitalize amid these conditions given our ability to find value, structure creatively and embrace complexity. As Marc highlighted, we've announced 5 transactions in just the last couple of months, representing approximately $15 billion in total enterprise value at an average creation multiple of under 7x, and our deal pipeline looks strong from here.\nUltimately, all of our sourcing and origination activity is a function of being able to find interesting investments and deliver good outcomes. And indeed, we're doing that across the business. Returns across our yield-focused strategies remain strong. For example, direct origination and structured credit portfolios have appreciated 19% and 15%, respectively, over the last 12 months. Hybrid Value had a standout quarter with the portfolio appreciating 5% in the second quarter and 17% over the last year. And another of our flagship hybrid businesses, according to [indiscernible] has also delivered robust returns over the past year, totaling 17%.\nAnd as Marc alluded to earlier, our PE portfolios are enjoying very strong performance and are marked at very defensible valuations. Strong investment results are helping to drive strong capital formation. Inflows totaled $39 billion in the second quarter across our Asset Management and Retirement Services businesses, bringing total inflows close to $80 billion in the first half of the year. Within that, third-party fundraising, excluding any leverage or segment transfers, has been particularly robust, totaling $20 billion and $33 billion in the second quarter and year-to-date, respectively. This momentum gives us confidence that we're on track to achieve our $50 billion fundraising target this year.\nSecond quarter fundraising activity included a record amount of third-party capital raised in yields as well as strong hybrid inflows. Fundraising was diverse across a range of products and also benefited from some sizable institutional commitments. Some of the more significant drivers by strategy included asset-backed finance, multicredit, large-cap direct lending ADIP, opportunistic credit and infrastructure equity. Additionally, we recently secured a sizable strategic investment from Mizuho Bank and Apollo Clean Transition Capital, our flagship climate and transition credit strategy. This capital enables us to continue building a strong portfolio following initial seed investments in 2023 as we position the strategy for a broader fundraise next year. Importantly, Mizuho's limited partner commitment is the largest they've ever made, which speaks to their support and advocacy of energy transition as well as the broader Apollo relationship.\nTurning to global wealth. Our momentum remains strong as we continue to solidify our position as one of the top players in the market. We've raised north of $6 billion in the first half of the year, including record fundraising in the second quarter, positioning us to exceed the $8 billion of capital raised last year. The most significant contributor to our growth momentum is Apollo Debt Solutions, the non-traded credit BDC we manage. Performance remained stellar with the fund's class share returning more than 13% net over the past year from a portfolio comprised almost entirely of first lien loans. Monthly inflows averaged over $500 million in the second quarter, reflecting these strong returns, continued traction with global distribution partners as well as new approvals across channels. Additionally, we're focused on further broadening access to the strategy on a geographic basis by extending into Europe, Asia and LatAm via our Luxembourg-based product platform.\nAs we think about the evolution of our private credit offering in the global wealth channel, we're very excited about introducing an asset-backed strategy as a complement to what we've built with ADS. Initial interest in Apollo asset-backed credit company or ABC has been quite strong as we believe distributors recognize the scale, diversity and maturity of our asset-backed finance franchise as a significant competitive advantage. We've just launched ABC in the global wealth market, and we expect flows to increase as we expand distribution to wire houses over the coming quarters. More broadly, as we think about how best to access different client segments, we've also been engaged in a number of conversations around partnerships. Our role can and will take on multiple forms, ranging from joint ventures to parts provider. We're at the center of these conversations in what's an incredibly robust opportunity set.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Martin to cover our financial results in more detail.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So as we execute on our strategy, the building blocks powering our business, asset origination, capital formation and investment performance, as you've heard, are setting us up to continue generating attractive long-term earnings growth.\nLet me close out with some comments on our Q2 financial performance and outlook in advance of a comprehensive review of our next 5 years at our Investor Day on October 1. Starting with FRE results, fee-related revenues increased 11% quarter-over-quarter and 18% year-over-year, driven by solid growth across all 3 revenue streams. Management fees grew 3% and 8%, respectively, driven by strong capital formation activity. Capital Solutions fees, as you heard, exceeded $200 million in a quarter for the first time reflecting strong growth across the broader debt origination ecosystem that included a record quarter of high-grade corporate solutions activity. And fee-related performance fees, which are spread-based versus NAV-based in our business, continued their upward trajectory. Driven by our credit business, including growth in ADS, these fees have a high degree of stability and are now run rating at more than $200 million on an annualized basis.\nLooking to the second half of the year, management fee growth should be aided by healthy organic inflows at Athene, fundraising activity and equity strategies and the deployment of capital we've already raised. We're currently sitting on a record $55 billion of management fee eligible AUM, of which approximately 80% is in yield and hybrid strategies, which generate fees when the capital is invested. Given the robust results in Capital Solutions in the first half of the year, we expect full year fees to be stronger than originally expected, inclusive of expectations for normalized fee revenue in the third and fourth quarters supported by the very healthy pipeline that Marc referenced.\nTurning to FRE expenses. The sequential increase in fee-related compensation resulted from continued investments in building out our capital formation and credit investing teams as well as some pull-through of strong fee-related revenues to compensation. We also recognized a $15 million onetime item in noncomp expenses related to a fund merger that we previously commented on. Importantly, we're on track to grow total fee-related expenses by a low double-digit rate in 2024, inclusive of the onetime expense.\nSRE, so moving on to Retirement Services. The fundamentals underpinning Athene's business remain fully intact and very strong relative to the industry. Organic inflows continued to be robust, totaling $17 billion in the second quarter and $37 billion year-to-date. We are benefiting from our 4 organic growth channels and leading market share in the U.S. annuity market as well as strong secular tailwinds driving demand for retirement income solutions. The combination of our first half results and competitive positioning gives us continued confidence in reaching our $70 billion organic inflow target for the full year.\nProfitability on new business has remained in line with targeted returns, both in terms of spread and ROE. Through our differentiated origination capabilities, we're able to invest new business volumes in attractive investments that generate excess spread through structure and liquidity. We've continued to deliver value so far this year, driven by deployment into directly originated investment grade credit of more than $10 billion with an attractive excess spread of approximately 200 basis points above comparably rated public corporate benchmarks.\nIn terms of our Q2 financial results, adjusting for long-term expectations of 11% for the alternatives portfolio, the net spread would have been 27 basis points higher. And on a comparable basis, the Q2 net spread was 6 basis points lower than Q1. There are 3 dynamics that influence the spread performance. One, nearly $4 billion of highly profitable funding agreements issued during COVID-market uncertainty at a low 2% cost of funds and invested at attractive spreads matured in Q2. Two, we strategically executed hedges primarily in Q1 and in Q2 to immunize earnings exposure to potential changes in interest rates, the cost of which is expected to be an approximate 5% headwind to earnings growth this year. Three, we also allocated more than 40% of our first half purchases to corporate securities compared with 25% to 30% in 2023, and we experienced some back-weighted deployment activity, a dynamic we also experienced last quarter.\nConsidering these factors and their impact on the second half of the year, along with in-line business performance, we expect our SRE growth rate for 2024 to be in the mid-single-digit percentage range assuming 11% alternatives return. We anticipate our net spread to be approximately 150 basis points on the same basis. For the back half, we expect Q3 SRE to be in line with Q2 before growth resumes in Q4 at a more normalized rate.\nTurning to ADIP. Integral to Athene's long-term success, we view the $6 billion fund raise for ADIP II, the second vintage of our strategic third-party capital sidecar as further validation of Athene's attractive growth trajectory. This vehicle invests side-by-side Athene in new business, enabling Athene to scale in a capital-efficient manner while providing an attractive risk-adjusted return to fund investors. Organic growth at Athene continues to be very attractive in today's environment, equating to an approximate 20% return on equity to the HoldCo when accounting for spread earnings, management fees and sidecar fees generated. We view the sidecar strategy as a true strategic differentiator as we look to penetrate the massive retirement services addressable market in front of us.\nBefore concluding, let me spend a moment on the Athene alts investments. Athene's alternatives portfolio is highly diversified and constructed to generate a hybrid like risk and return profile. Most of the portfolio is represented by AAA, which had a 9% return for Q2 and 10% over the last 12 months, inclusive of significant cash being held for future investment. The remainder of the portfolio is in several retirement services companies, including Athora, Catalina, Venerable and FWD, which are all strategic investments, and important to our long-term growth, but which have underperformed the broader portfolio on a market valuation basis.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performances. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.\nApollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP measures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation for an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone, to our call. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nWe report strong first quarter financial results, which included FRE of $462 million or $0.75 per share and SRE of $817 million or $1.32 per share. Together, these 2 earnings streams totaled $1.3 billion, increasing 18% year-over-year.\nCombined with principal investing income, holdco financing costs and taxes, we reported adjusted net income of $1.1 billion or $1.72 per share, up 26% year-over-year. Additionally, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of approximately $0.46 per share for the first quarter, reflecting the new higher annual run rate level of $1.85 per share as previously announced.\nJoining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. Before handing it over, I'd like to formally announce that we are hosting an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, October 1. We will provide additional detail in the coming months and hope that you will join our broader team as we discuss the exciting long-term growth opportunities in front of us.\nAnd with that, I'll now hand it over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah, and good morning. As Noah detailed, first quarter results were strong. Personally, I was very pleased. FRE was $462 million, up 16% year-over-year. And you will hear a little bit from me but mostly from Jim, there is momentum in every part of the business. For SRE, we reported $817 million, up 19% year-over-year.\nKeynote for the quarter, a record inflow of $20 billion for the quarter. I'm going to spend some time providing color on the quarter but then quickly move to the outlook for the year.\nIn the quarter, particularly with respect to SRE, we had 3 things going on. The first, really good. The team generated, as I suggested, $20 billion of inflows diversified across their funding channels, particularly 3 of their funding channels.\nWhile they generated what they needed to and origination, as you will hear, was very strong, they were somewhat mixed in terms of timing. The generation of liabilities took place at a relatively even pace, whereas most of the origination was back-end loaded, resulting in high cash balances for the quarter, which we expect to even out across the year.\nThe second, alternatives had a slight underperformance versus what we historically have normalized or come to expect and normalized. But the biggest action in the quarter was our move to significantly derisk the floating rate book.\nRecall that we run a common sense strategy. When rates are very low, we have been able to earn very nice rates of return without maximizing current period SRE and putting on significant floating rate exposure, which gives us upside as rates normalize. You should expect as rates have returned to more normalized levels, we use this as an opportunity to significantly reduce our exposure.\nExposure now is about $16 billion, probably where we're going to leave it for the near term. Sensitivity of 100 basis points move at floaters at this point is less than 5% of SRE. You should expect us to continue to move floating rate exposure up and down, reflecting first, the nature of our business and the fact that we do not have -- while on the upside, we have linear participation in rates, on the downside, we do not have linear participation in rate falls.\nAnd second, there is a nice hedging element to having a certain amount of floating rate exposure vis-a-vis performance of liabilities during changes of interest rates. All in all, a really strong quarter and one that gives me increased confidence that the outlook that we sketched out for all of you coming into this year will be met. I view this as on trend.\nFRE, we're expecting 15% to 20% growth in our -- in the nonflagship PE year versus the 25% we grew in '23. We have plenty of opportunities to invest in the business. And the trade-off as to where we end up between 15% and 20% will be, in my opinion, based on how much we choose to invest in the future.\nSRE, we are targeting low double-digit growth, which we believe reflects the long-term run rate growth rate of our Retirement Services business. We do expect to still meet or exceed the $70 billion of organic inflows in 2024.\nIf I were to highlight momentum in the business, I'll pick out the 2 or 3 things that I think are really exceptional. The first, the lifeblood of our business is origination. $40 billion of originations for the quarter, roughly half from our platforms. Platforms, as you recall, are unique to Apollo and represent a recurring and enduring and growing source of origination. We, in my opinion, can only grow as fast as we can originate assets that provide excess return per unit of risk, and this is a significant focus for the firm.\nCapital formation was also very strong for the quarter. Before I touch on the numbers, I'll touch on the philosophy. Capital formation is an important part of our business, but we have to be very careful to be measured in capital formation and not simply accept money at all costs at all times. We need to invest it prudently, particularly in new and growing segments where we are building investor trust.\nFor the quarter, capital formation was $40 billion, roughly $20 billion coming from retirement services and $20 billion coming from asset management. In the Asset Management business, there was a lot of momentum in global wealth, in particular, very strong performance at ADS.\nRecall that ADS is our 100% first lien, lowest leverage, run defensively, direct lending business. The team there has done a spectacular job. There's also momentum in institutional. I'd pick out asset-based finance and third-party insurance as highlights for the quarter.\nAsset-backed finance is directly tied to our capacity to originate as many of the products that come off our platforms end up or are consumed in asset-backed form. It is also tied to our philosophy of wanting 25% of everything and 100% of nothing, which produces unique alignment with our third-party insurance and third-party institutional and other clients.\nABF is particularly well suited to insurance company balance sheets. There were $8 billion of ABF flows in Q1, including a multibillion dollar strategic investment from a like-minded leading financial institution.\nIn summary, momentum has been building in the quarter. And I believe we are set for and on track, consistent with guidance here. While this year is interesting, and Noah Gunn has already highlighted our Investor Day, share with you how the team thinks about the future.\nWe are in a really exciting industry. The 2 big pillars of growth that we see ahead of us are first, retirement. Like it or not, we're all getting older. The need for guaranteed lifetime -- guaranteed retirement income everywhere in the world exceeds what is currently provided. Whether you look at aging of population, whether you look at the decline of defined benefit plans, whether you look at the inadequacy or lack of preparation of governments around the world, I continue to believe that retirement is going to be a massive driver of our business. Retirement is ultimately built on a foundation of fixed income.\nThe second and perhaps [indiscernible] trend in our business is a wholesale revisiting by investors of the ABCs of portfolio construction. And when I say investors, I mean institutions and individuals. We are an industry that has been built out of the smallest asset allocation of our institutional clients.\nIn a very simple way, I think of our institutional clients as being primarily allocated at least half to publicly traded equities, 30% allocated to publicly traded fixed income and 20% allocated to everything else, meaning alternatives. Our entire industry growth has been out of that 20% bucket. 20% is the so-called private or alternative bucket made sense in a world where private was risky and public was safe.\nI believe we are revisiting the most fundamental concepts that underlie our financial markets. Private now goes from AA to levered equity. And public, which was 8,000 public companies, there's now 4,000 public companies. And the reality is 10 represents 35% of the S&P 500 and unique concentration to 2 or 3 companies.\nInvestors are already looking to their fixed income bucket, which historically has been off limits and starting to ask questions about what is the difference between public and private, if both are safe and risky. This is just a question of liquidity trade-off, and liquidity trade-off is actually getting much, much closer.\nLiquidity in publicly traded fixed income is at record lows. Liquidity for private credit is actually increasing daily. We are not -- I'm not saying that we're going to pass each other, but the notion that investors will begin to allocate to private markets an entire asset bucket that they have not historically allocated to private markets presents our entire industry with just an unusual path toward extreme growth.\nI believe the same will happen in the equity bucket. An investor who wants exposure to the economy used to get it in public markets. Now more than half the economy is in private markets. While that allocation may not be to private equity, private equity being a product, a 10-year locked-up fund seeking very high rates of return with leverage, I believe investors increasingly will seek out equity exposure in private markets and other forms that exist today.\nAnd it is our job as in our industry to create the products for the future to allow investors to access 100% of the economy, given that it is no longer in public markets. For us to succeed, this is not really a question of opportunity. This is a question of execution.\nExecution starts with origination. We can only grow our business as fast as we can originate. As you heard, $40 billion for the quarter. We have discussed publicly $125 billion goal of origination for the year. Our original 5-year plan had us getting to $150 billion by 2026, which I hope we will exceed. And no doubt, Investor Day will exceed $200 million as our midrange target for where we need to be in origination. Again, growth in our business is limited only by our capacity to originate good risk.\nThe second thing we need to do is to prepare for a change in how capital is formed. Capital -- the change is already happening, given the importance of global wealth to our industry. And we will be one of the successful players in that industry. And we value these relationships and run the business on a long-term basis. We are essentially needing to build different ways of communicating with our clients.\nHistorically, as you know, we've raised money from our institutional clients out of their alternatives bucket. And increasingly, we will need to cover their fixed income bucket and eventually their equity bucket. I believe we are well positioned to do this, and this is coming at a good time for us and for our industry.\nAnd also if one steps back and thinks about where capital need is in the world, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's energy transition or whether it is to adapt to new technologies of data centers and the need for power, all 3 of those things represent long-term financing. I do not believe that long-term financing is well suited to the shorter nature balance sheets of the banking system nor to the daily liquid fund market.\nIncreasingly, these long-term capital needs will be matched with long-term funding from our retail and institutional clients. So again, number one, origination; number two, capital formation; and finally, product development, particularly in equity.\nThe migration of the fixed income bucket to private markets is already happening, and it's happening faster than I thought. In some ways, we expect that because there are signposts there.\nRating agencies rate things in public markets and private markets. And so investors, as they begin to think about this transition, can look to credit ratings and others as a sign of comparability between public market and private market risk.\nEquity markets lack the same sort of signpost. It is up to us as an industry to develop those kinds of products, and I'm excited about what the future looks like, not just in transition in the credit bucket but also in the equity bucket.\nIn summary, I like the hand we're playing. We are incredibly well positioned in retirement services with a decade-long lead over most of our competition.\nThe work we have done on fixed income replacement and private investment grade, I believe, is particularly well suited for the transition that is taking place as institutions and individuals migrate their historically 100% public fixed income exposure to public and private. And I believe we are well positioned with our hybrid business to begin to address the migration that I expect to take place in equity.\nJim, over to you.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President & Chief Investment Officer-Credit, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Marc. Let me dive into a few more details. The foundation of our business is built upon delivering strong investment returns for our clients. And we have historically done so by upholding a purchase price matters investment philosophy across market cycles and strategies, which embrace downside protection structure in return for excess return per unit of risk.\nMost recently, the industry has evolved into a paradigm marked by higher for longer rates, tighter spreads and extreme valuations. And we've responded accordingly. Over the last several quarters, we focused on larger companies and transactions at the top of the capital structure while employing less leverage than others in the industry.\nMarc mentioned the ADS, Apollo Debt Solutions, is a great example of that, where we produced a 14.5% return over the last year but a conservatively levered balance sheet of 0.6 with a 100% corporate loan portfolio. Additionally, we continue to generate meaningful excess return in this intersection of equity and credit, which we define as hybrid driven by a variety of structural changes and inefficiencies in the market.\nOur 2 flagship strategies in this area, the accord series and the hybrid value series, have generated particularly strong returns, appreciating 4% in the first quarter and more than 16% over the last year. Alongside investment performance, capital formation is a critical driver of our growth.\nWe generated strong inflows across the business in the first quarter, as Marc highlighted, including $20 billion from our Asset Management business and $20 billion from Athene. And organic inflows, excluding any leverage or segment transfers, totaled $33 billion, which is on track with our $120 billion target for the year.\nDouble-clicking on this third-party fundraising, credit-oriented strategies were very much in focus and accounted for more than 80% of capital raised in the quarter. Some of the more significant contributors included $3 billion to broadly support the growth of the Atlas ecosystem, $3 billion for high-grade alpha separately managed accounts, $2 billion for large-cap direct lending and our recently launched asset-based -- asset-backed finance fund.\nAs Marc mentioned, it is worth double clicking on the fact that we've made $6.5 billion of the capital from third-party insurers, reflecting the significant roads -- inroads we've made in this important growth area over the last handful of years. We're focused on delivering strategies that sit at the intersection of Athene's SRE playbook and Apollo's broad asset management capabilities, namely investment-grade private credit, which we believe is ideally suited for these insurance company investment portfolios.\nTo illustrate the scale of our alpha-generating capabilities, we've originated close to $80 billion of assets through platforms and core solutions over the last 12 months, which has generated between 150 and 200 basis points of excess spread versus comparatively rated liquid credits. As we continue to grow in these debt origination capabilities, we expect there will be growing interest from third-party insurers to invest alongside in the full spectrum of our ecosystem, a dynamic we've started to see. And all this works because of our alignment with Athene, which is critical to our value proposition.\nMoving on to global wealth, which is a strategic and growing contributor of our capital formation activity. Our journey in building out this business, we've realized there are 5 crucial components in order to succeed: investment performance, education, distribution capabilities, technology and a diversified product list, all of which we've successfully established over the last 24 months.\nWe believe that only a small group of firms can deliver on all 5. And with continued strategic focus and investment, we see ourselves among the best positioned for long-term success.\nThe numbers bear this out as we've more than doubled our run rate fundraising level with our holistic suite of products. Monthly inflows approached $1 billion in April, a meaningful increase from approximately $650 million just a quarter ago and less than $400 million a year ago.\nAs I mentioned, one of the primary drivers of this activity has been our flagship corporate direct lending offering, ADS. April subscriptions totaled over $500 million, bringing year-to-date subscriptions to approximately $1.7 billion. And this represents approximately a 400% increase in flows year-to-date compared to last year.\nPart of the step-up reflects recent market share gains in the nontraded BDC space with ADS capturing 17% of total inflows in 2024 so far compared to only 10% at the run rate in the fourth quarter. This overall growth has been enabled by leading investment performance combined with our expanding distribution footprint and attractive yield.\nThe next step in the expansion of our credit-focused product set within global wealth channel, we're on track to launch a new asset-backed finance vehicle in the coming weeks. Apollo asset-backed credit company or ABC is a semiliquid turnkey solution designed to provide our credit investors across our differentiating -- to access our differentiated origination capabilities and builds on the initial traction we've seen in our broader asset-backed franchise.\nWe believe the breadth and scale of our proprietary origination ecosystem, not just for sourcing from Wall Street, will position us to be a market leader in this nascent and important growth area of the global wealth market. Importantly, we structured ADC as an operating company, enabling us to access our full range of origination capabilities versus other traditional private credit structures.\nAnd finally, Apollo aligned alternatives, better known as AAA, is our semiliquid equity replacement strategy continues to be an important part of our global wealth offering. We raised $700 million of capital in the first quarter and continue to see strong fundraising momentum.\nWe have a pipeline of new distribution partners preparing to launch the fund over the next course of the year. And interestingly, we're also seeing growing interest from the consultant community and insurance companies as a cost-effective, scaled solution for private markets exposure.\nStepping back for a moment, we've observed that many in our industry have discovered the language of origination. As a result, our definition of fixed income replacement and private credit of $40 trillion addressable market has become mainstream and distinct from the traditional view of private credit.\nWe were pioneers of these concepts 36 months ago and expect to continue blazing the path forward for this important area of secular growth. As part of that, scaling our debt origination volume production is a strategic focus, and our quarterly results highlight that we're continuing to make meaningful progress.\nAs Marc mentioned, total debt origination volumes of nearly $120 billion over the last 12 months is up almost 40% compared with our prior year period. As a reminder, we originate assets across our yield ecosystem through 3 main channels: the traditional channel, platforms and corporate solutions. And more recently, we've identified partnerships with other financial institutions as the fourth avenue that we plan to expand over time.\nAdditionally, we have expanded our focus on the fifth leg, the broad equity and hybrid ecosystem as well, which you will hear more from us in the future. Over the past year, our platform ecosystem has been the primary driver of origination growth, having roughly doubled volume production over that period.\nAtlas SP, our warehouse finance and securitized products business, has been the major driver of that activity. One notable win to highlight in the first quarter was the $8 billion purchase of seller financing facilities from UBS. We acquired this portfolio at an attractive excess spread for IG equivalent risk, which also proved accretive and attractive to third-party investors as we materially oversubscribed on half the trade and distributed accordingly.\nLooking forward, with the Atlas business fully operational, independent and armed with a significant amount of strategic capital, both debt and equity, we're focused on meaningfully scaling that platform. While platforms are an essential component of our origination ecosystem, we're also highly focused on growing our corporate solutions platform and business.\nWe're investing a tremendous amount of time with a broad array of the largest, most sophisticated companies to educate them on the benefits of our multifaceted credit toolkit or toolbox and the benefits it can provide, namely speed, certainty, size and customization. And we're beginning to see those efforts bear tremendous fruit.\nAnd finally, we believe that partnerships will become a growing contributor of our origination capacity over time. Historically, and especially over the last several years, we believe we've been on the cutting edge of strategic dialogue with various financial institutions. We're seeking to extend our vast array of solutions to these firms in a partnership manner, which, in turn, will help expand our platform.\nImportantly, as we scale our debt origination capacity and expand newer areas of equity-focused investing, we're creating more consistent and diversified deal activity that feeds into our Capital Solutions business. While quarterly variability in fee revenue should be expected, we're observing that the business is reaching a point of consistency amid continued growth potential. In the first quarter specifically, capital solutions fees were solid, supported by record quarterly gross capital deployment of nearly $60 billion across the platform.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Martin for more detail.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Let me close out with some brief comments on our financial performance. Our first quarter results positioned us well to deliver on the financial targets we've communicated for 2024, which signal an attractive mid-teens earnings [indiscernible].\nWe view the sustainability and predictability of our earnings profile as highly valuable and increasingly appreciated by the market, especially against the backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty that has impacted more cyclical revenue streams.\nStarting with the asset management side of the business. FRE trends remained solid with 16% growth year-over-year, reflecting revenue growth of 13% and cost growth of 9%. As we look towards the remainder of the year, we're on pace to generate the fee-related revenue growth, margin expansion and overall FRE dollar growth we have indicated.\nWe expect growth in fee revenue to be supported by strong and diversified capital formation, a record $50 billion of dry powder with future management fee potential and a robust capital solutions outlook that should deliver a strong second and third quarter based on the pipeline we see today.\nFor expenses, we will continue to manage our cost base prudently while selectively investing in key areas, principally global wealth and our credit business. We also expect to recognize a $15 million onetime noncomp expense related to the previously announced merger of 2 closed-end funds with and into MidCap Financial Investment Corp., a publicly traded BDC we manage, which will most likely occur in the second quarter on the closing of these transactions and which was contemplated in our original expense growth guidance for the year. Altogether, we expect to generate between 15% and 20% FRE growth, as Marc indicated, in line with our growth expectations for a year in which we do not raise a flagship PE fund.\nTurning to retirement services. We reported SRE of $817 million at a 147 basis point net spread. Adjusting for long-term expectations for alternative returns, net spread would have been 10 basis points higher in the first quarter and on a comparable basis, 9 basis points lower than fourth quarter levels.\nThis sequential decline was driven by 2 factors: one, higher on the margin cost of new business in the higher interest rate environment, together with the delayed deployment into higher-yielding assets that Marc highlighted; and two, an approximate 5 basis point in-quarter spread impact associated with hedging a portion of Athene's net floating rate position and higher costs on certain in-force business.\nAs Marc suggested, we reduced the net floating rate portfolio by $9 billion to $16 billion during the first quarter, which results in 7% of net invested assets being subject to floating rate indices. As part of this hedging effort, we swapped $8 billion of fixed rate liabilities to floating and issued $4 billion of additional floating rate [indiscernible] agreements with the negative carry associated with each recognized as part of our cost of funds in the quarter.\nWe believe that this level of floating rate securities will adequately equip us from a strategic standpoint while also protecting future earnings power should rates decline materially. Given the smaller portfolio size, our floating rate income sensitivity has commensurately decreased to approximately $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE for every 25 basis point move in short-term rates, down from the $45 million to $55 million that we previously indicated.\nWe expect the timing differential between origination and deployment of capital to normalize through net spread in coming quarters. More specifically, there were 2 large asset transactions that closed towards the end of March, which had they closed midway through the quarter would have created a further 3 basis points of higher net spread in quarter.\nConsidering key components of Athene's earnings growth outlook versus our fourth quarter call, namely first quarter net spread results, a smaller floating rate portfolio and fewer expected rate cuts as implied by the forward curve, we continue to expect net spread of approximately 160 to 165 basis points for the full year, which excludes notable items and assumes an 11% annualized [indiscernible] return. We expect this range of net spread, coupled with robust organic growth, to support low double-digit SRE growth this year versus the comparable 2023 base.\nIn -- turning to PII. PII has been an expectedly modest contributor to our earnings base in recent quarters as we await a more favorable backdrop to monetize investments. First quarter realized performance fees were also impacted by an impairment on a position held in Fund IX.\nLooking to the second quarter, we currently expect to generate a similar amount of PII as the first quarter. An important catalyst to reignite realization activity is a reopening of the IPO market as only around 10% of our fund's total PE portfolio is publicly traded today.\nWe've seen early signs of this happening and see a path for an acceleration in PE realizations into 2025 and beyond. Increasing amounts of realized carry would generate additional cash flow to deploy into opportunistic share repurchases, enabling us to execute on our plan to reduce our share count to approximately 600 million shares by the end of 2026.\nFinally, on taxes, after a large nonrecurring benefit in the prior quarter, which reduced the 2023 annual rate, we experienced a 17% effective tax rate in the first quarter. For the full year, we expect our tax rate to approximate 20%, consistent with our long-term guidance with a rate slightly above 20% expected in the second quarter.\nIn closing, we are generating significant momentum as we continue executing on our business plan, which is setting the stage for our next phase of growth. The earnings power of the business has tremendous potential, and we look forward to delivering on the opportunity in front of us.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

This call may include forward-looking statements and projections which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call which management believes are relevant in assessing financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, Donna. And welcome again, everyone, to our call.\nEarlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the investor relations portion of our website. And in short, fourth quarter results rounded out an exceptionally strong year for both our asset management and retirement services businesses. Our 2 primary earnings streams, fee-related earnings and spread-related earnings, grew more than 25% to a record $4.9 billion in 2023. Combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported record adjusted net income of $4.1 billion or $6.74 per share for the full year.\nOne change to highlight in our financial reporting included with this morning's results. Beginning this quarter, within retirement services, you'll see spread-related earnings excluding notable items. And further down the page, we provide additional information highlighting the delta to arrive at our long-term return expectation for Athene's alternative investments. This information is useful in order to understand how we think about Athene's earnings power on a multiyear basis excluding quarterly mark-to-market fluctuations. And importantly, this change has no impact on historically reported SRE or the magnitude of historically reported notable items.\nSo joining me to discuss our strong results in more detail and outlook for the year ahead are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO.\nAnd with that, I'll hand over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Noah. And it's my pleasure to actually walk through what was a very strong year both in growth and execution.\nIf you had told me at the beginning of the year that we were going to grow 25%-plus in FRE and 26% in SRE and that we would do that successfully, we would be doing a victory lap here; and I assure you we are, in fact, doing that victory lap. Those ranges, while I wish they were recurring every year, are not the normal expectation you should have for the business. We've consistently guided all of our investors to what I believe and we believe is a long-term growth rate in FRE, which is 15% to 20% in a non-flagship year; and to low double-digit growth in SRE.\n2023 was truly exceptional. Recall that, particularly in our SRE segment in our retirement services segment, we are not a near-term profit maximizer. 2023 was extraordinary. We ended the year holding more than $12 billion of cash. We also used the very strong results to begin the creation of a countercyclical portfolio, which had us for the first time in a long time make a significant move into treasuries. While this costs us near-term SRE, it gives us flexibility to redeploy into very strong origination volumes, which you will hear about. In the third quarter, just -- excuse me. In the fourth quarter, just to highlight how strong originations volumes were, we did north of $30 billion of originations. We hope to continue up that pace. And having a pile of cash and a treasury portfolio will allow us to continue to grow SRE in the low double digits, which is what we seek to do.\nAway from earnings. Margins were up over 200 basis points. AUM hit a record $651 billion. Inflows were $160 billion. And Athene had record inflows of $66 billion. Even in inflows, Athene is not a near-term profit maximizer. This was an opportunity to really shape the kind of business and the kind of distribution that Athene wanted. And we would expect to exceed this number in terms of originations, organic originations, for Athene moving into 2024.\n2024, we see as a year of continued momentum, but we also see it taking shape slightly differently than 2023. Credit, we believe, will dominate 2024. Growth at Athene and equity strategies other than PE. Martin will spend time in his remarks discussing the '24 outlook and the finer details of Q4. I thought what I would do is spend my time and provide a little bit of historical perspective and [ also for ] road map as to where we're going.\nWe've just come back from our partners retreat, where all 201 Apollo partners get together and we discuss the outlook. And I began those remarks by anchoring people in history. In 2008, we were $44 billion of AUM. You fast forward. We've grown 14x. That's faster than Apple's revenue. That's faster than Microsoft's revenue. That's faster than semiconductors, truly extraordinary. I'd like to think that was all as a result of management acumen and management positioning, but we are the beneficiary of macro industry factors that drove not just us but our entire industry. Dodd-Frank; substantial money printing; [ a research ] for excess return in a low rate environment; and the commoditization of debt and equity markets, public markets, through indexation and correlation were the powerful tailwinds that drove our industry and allowed us to grow 14x.\nSome of these factors are still here, but I have to say the factors that are going to drive us going forward are different than the factors that in fact got us to 2023. As I think about the big drivers of our business, first, I think there is a fundamental rethink going on as to the difference between public and private. Most of us have grown up in an investment world where private was risky and public was safe. We had a private allocation, an alternatives bucket, illiquid allocation. And it was generally a relatively small portion of an institution or an individual's total strategic asset allocation and with good reason. Private, at least in the old days, was risky. Private equity, venture capital and hedge funds dominated the private bucket. On the other hand, public was perceived as safe. Stocks and bonds 60-40 portfolio [ stream to a ] world where public is both safe and risky and private is safe and risky; and the difference is only a matter of liquidity. I believe we are going to see a substantial pivot from institutions where they begin to think about private not just in a traditional alternatives context, but they think about private as just another investment that has a little less liquidity. And the question they'll be asking is, \"Am I being compensated for slightly less liquidity?\" I think that is nothing but a positive for our industry and for our firm.\nThe second is this continued commoditization of public market returns. We are at an extreme of indexation and concentration and correlation. Not just between debt and equity markets, but so much of our equity market is dominated by a handful of companies that -- with outsized valuations and outsized PE that really do drive the public indices. While that's going up, that feels great. That can just as easily go in the other direction. Sophisticated investors, institutional and individual, understand this. And if they are seeking to separate themselves from the beta of the public markets and look for alpha, they will need to look for other solutions other than those in the public markets and through indexation.\nHigh net worth and the entry of individual investors into the private markets and alternatives. We are in the earliest early days of this. This hasn't even started. This is a $65 trillion market that ultimately has the potential for private markets investors such as ourselves and our peer group to be as large, if not larger than, our institutional market. For us to get there, it's going to take education. We are evangelical in this because what private investments can do for an investor's portfolio is well substantiated academically and through financial records, but the level of understanding of how private investments can be incorporated into these portfolios is very, very immature. I look at the largest pool of investable capital anywhere in the world, some $12 trillion in 401(k). These are the people in our country who need returns the most, and we force them to be daily liquid for 50 years. Why? I don't know why. I don't think there's a good reason why. And we're beginning to see cracks even in the 401(k) market of an allocation to private, which is different than an allocation to risk, but again I think this is a very powerful trend that bodes well for our firm and for our industry.\nFinally, [ we can't escape ] that we're all getting older. Our society is getting older. Europe is getting older. Japan is getting older. Australia is getting older. Most Western markets are getting older. Most markets have done a very poor job of retirement savings. The retirement savings crisis in the U.S. is particularly acute. The numbers are well known. And I believe there is a substantial role for firms such as ours to play in [indiscernible] investor savings and allowing them to -- allowing us to provide them guaranteed lifetime income. In short, we find ourselves at $650 billion as a relatively small entity in the scheme of asset management, surrounded by 4 massive markets.\nThe market for fixed income replacement. Think of this as a rotation [ of ] institutions' and individuals' normal fixed income portfolios into private as well as public, so-called private investment grade. The second is the high net worth market, moving from traditional [indiscernible] 60-40 allocation into private market allocation. The third is rotations out of active management and into other products; and finally, the retirement market. Each of those markets offers us the opportunity to double our firm over a number of years. We just have to make sure that we are well positioned, that we make the investments today; and accept that the tailwinds that powered us to 2023 are not the same as the tailwinds that are likely to power us going forward, that the products that powered us to where we are, are not exactly the same as the products that are going to power us going forward. Fundamentally, we need to embrace change, but I like the position that we're starting from. We're starting from the only scaled player in private IG, a leading retirement services footprint, the largest hybrid ecosystem, all of which is fueled by origination, so what do we need to do? And what should you be looking for as milestones for whether in fact we are proceeding positively toward a path to take advantage of the opportunities that surround our industry and surround our firm?\nBy far, the most important thing that we need to do is scale our origination. As you know, we have been running at roughly $100 billion of annual origination, $30 billion of which came in the fourth quarter. We need to rapidly move that up, with a goal of somewhere between $200 billion and $250 billion of origination 5 years from now. As an alternative firms that provides excess return per unit of risk, we can only grow as fast as we scale our capacity to create investments that in fact offer our clients excess return per unit of risk. If we grow too fast or simply seek to gather assets, we will commoditize our business, and ultimately we will not like the results of that, so origination, probably first and second.\nCapital formation. Not only do we need to continue to build out our high net worth coverage, but if we are going to serve fixed income replacement, so-called private investment grade, the sale, the way things are sold, the client base is actually completely different than the traditional client base of an alternatives firm. Building out a fixed income replacement sales force that speaks to clients in a language that they are used to speaking in [indiscernible] necessary ingredients to scale this and not just pick around the edges. Finally, new products and product creation are the heart of financial services. If I go back and look at the beginning of my 40-year career now: Levered loans, high-yield bonds, ETFs, securitized product either did not exist or in their infancy. We take for granted these 4 products as completely mainstream and dominant products, but we should not be naive to think that they are going to be the products that dominate 15 years from now. Clients and high-net-worth individuals are going to move out of public equities. I do not believe they are going to move into 10-year [indiscernible] private partnerships. I believe they're going to move into things that are more hybrid. Hybrid, again, is the midpoint between debt and equity.\n[indiscernible] to offer clients non-binary outcomes while still providing attractive rates of return. The product set here, while large for us, is immature for the entire industry. And I think you will see this year introductions of new products with risk-rewards and liquidity requirements and partnerships [ the industry ] has not seen before [indiscernible] that we and our peer group are hard at work trying to meet the needs of our investors. And [ I ] truthfully could not be more excited about where we sit in this ecosystem. We are beginning to talk about our original 5-year plan in hindsight. Martin and Scott will provide some context that we are well on our way and confident of meeting the objectives that we put up in our 5-year plan. We are spending 2024 positioning ourselves to take advantage of the next new trends [indiscernible] we'll be there going forward, but it will not look like [indiscernible] the growth of the past. It will come differently but no less -- I'm no less optimistic.\nFinally, we're looking forward to a full Investor Day, and with us you know the definition of full means long, in October of this year. And Martin and Noah will provide you details.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott M. Kleinman\n\nCo-President & Lead Partner of Private Equity, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Marc.\nEchoing Marc's sentiment. We entered 2023 focused squarely on executing the growth plan we set forth, and we achieved those goals. Both our asset management and retirement services business proved resilient and often opportunistic as we navigated an uncertain investing backdrop, a changing rate paradigm and an evolving financial ecosystem. One thing that stayed constant, though, was our commitment to delivering excess return per unit of risk for our clients. Investment performance across our product suite was strong, with particularly robust returns in certain yields and hybrid strategies. For example, our direct origination portfolio appreciated 20% over the full year, while our hybrid value portfolio, credit strategies and accord funds all returned more than 15% in 2023. In our PE business, our flagship fund performance remains very solid, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 32% and 22% net life to-date through year-end. Importantly, we've been able to generate these attractive returns while prioritizing senior secured investment grade credit quality and a \"purchase price matters\" investment philosophy.\nOff the back of this strong investment performance, we're seeing growing demand for our investment solutions in the marketplace. We raised $44 billion of third-party capital in 2023, an annual record when excluding flagship PE activity, reflecting the increasing breadth of our product suite. Athene's organic inflows continued to [ reach new ] heights, totaling $63 billion in 2023, driven by strong secular tailwinds and leading market share. Approximately $23 billion or 35% of Athene's inflows were supported by continued growth through third-party sidecar capital. All together, organic inflows totaled $107 billion across the platform during the year.\nAs we look to 2024, we expect momentum across all avenues of capital formation to continue. In our third-party asset management business, we expect to raise a record $50 billion of capital, including annual fundraising records from both the institutional and global wealth channels. Coupled with the $70 billion of expected inflows from Athene, we expect to raise approximately $120 billion of capital this year organically, which would represent an increase of 20% on a comparable basis excluding flagship PE.\nIn a higher interest rate backdrop and with lingering impacts of the [ denominated ] effect on traditional private equity allocations, institutional investor focus has pivoted to asset classes that offer current income, inflation protection and access to areas of secular growth, namely credit, infrastructure and sustainability. We believe we're well positioned to capture this demand with our direct lending, asset-backed finance, opportunistic credit and infrastructure equity strategies currently in the market in addition to our first-time clean transition equity fund. We're also focused on building upon the success we've had with third-party insurers last year, who entrusted us with $13 billion of capital, and view this as an important client segment as we continue to scale our third-party credit platform. Overall, we've entered 2024 with a lot of momentum and expect a very strong first quarter for institutional fundraising.\nTurning to global wealth. We closed out a transformative year for the business from launching new products, expanding distribution and educating the marketplace on the benefits of alternative assets. We raised over $8 billion of capital from this channel in 2023, up more than 30% from 2022 levels, and expect to grow off that base in 2024 despite not having a flagship private equity fund in the market. We believe our growing suite of semi-liquid perpetual products is important to that success, with a few to highlight in particular. We've seen steadily growing inflows for Apollo Debt Solutions, the nontraded BDC we manage, which totaled $875 million in the fourth quarter, in addition to approximately $345 million for January 1 subscriptions, a recent monthly record. These strong inflows follow industry-leading investment performance, with Class I shares delivering an approximate 16% net return for 2023; as well as expanding distribution, with ADS now live on 5 global wirehouse platforms and 60-plus selling agreements in place with independent advisers. Looking forward, we're focused on expanding our private credit offering from corporate direct lending to asset-backed finance, which we believe will provide global wealth investors more fulsome and diversified access to our proprietary asset origination capabilities.\nAdditionally, we're pleased with the growth we've seen in AAA, our innovative core equity replacement vehicle. Inflows from global wealth investors totaled $1.5 billion in 2023, though weighted towards the second half of the year. Looking ahead, we're focused on expanding shelf space to additional key distributors in the U.S. and Europe as well as launching additional points of access to reach different parts of the retail market. And lastly, Apollo Infrastructure Company recently launched in November to capture growing demand for private infrastructure assets. We believe the company offers differentiated access to the full spectrum of our infra platform investing across sectors and the capital structure. Initial feedback from RIAs has been positive, so far, and AIC is on track to expand distribution more broadly over the course of this year.\nTurning to investment activity. We had an active year of capital deployment totaling approximately $150 billion in 2023. Looking forward, we expect many of the same themes that informed our investment pipeline last year to remain pertinent in 2024, a shrinking global banking industry, lack of public market liquidity and the need for structured financing alternatives, among others. With $58 billion of dry powder at year-end, we're well equipped to capitalize on this robust opportunity set.\nRelatedly, debt origination volume totaled almost $100 billion in 2023, as Marc said, including $30 billion in the fourth quarter alone. It's worth mentioning that about half of this volume in both the fourth quarter and full year originated from our ecosystem of 16 proprietary platforms. Over the next couple of years, we're focused on reaching our $150 billion debt target, origination debt target, that we first laid out at Investor Day. To reach that target, scaling our origination platform volume is essential and should encompass around 50% of that longer-term goal. We think we can achieve this platform volume goal by scaling our existing portfolio, especially through some of the larger platforms like Atlas and MidCap and mid-sized platforms like Wheels and [ Alliant ].\nImportantly, growth in debt origination volume has helped fuel our capital solutions business. In 2023, more than 80% of capital solutions fees were debt related, up from only 55% in 2021. Our growing high-grade alpha business is one of the important contributors to this fee mix shift, which generated approximately $10 billion of volume over the full year. In the fourth quarter specifically, we announced 3 transactions with repeat borrowers, Air France, [ Concord ] and Vonovia, showcasing the power of incumbency for large-scale structured investment-grade financing demand.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financials.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nGreat. Thank you, Scott. And good morning, everyone.\nSo as demonstrated by our results, 2023 was a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo. We delivered on the financial targets that we laid out more than a year ago despite operating in a vastly different macro environment. In the asset management business, we achieved our 25% FRE growth target through fee revenue growth of more than 20%, coupled with decelerating expense growth, which drove the 200 basis points of margin expansion. In retirement services, we grew SRE by 26%.\nAs Noah mentioned, you'll note a new presentation this quarter, on Page 10 of the earnings release, to separate SRE excluding notable items, which this quarter is $748 million or 141 basis points of net spread, from the difference between actual alts returns and the 11% long-term expectation, which this quarter is $132 million or 25 basis points of net spread. This change in presentation reflects both where the industry is moving to and is being required to move to, as a presentation format. Importantly, we still continue to manage the portfolio expecting the same 11% long-term returns.\nOn this basis, our net spread, excluding notable items, for the year was 144 basis points. Considering our long-term expectations for alternatives returns, our net spread would be an additional 21 basis points higher and, combined, 30 basis points higher in 2023 versus 2022. Assisted by higher rates, this increase was driven by record organic growth, a favorable deployment backdrop and [ higher ] floating-rate income. With these strong results across the business, we expect to exceed our stated goal of doubling our total earnings to $5.5 billion by 2026. And we expect a mid-teens-plus compound earnings growth trajectory over the next few years. Executing on our plan for 2024 is the next important milestone to achieving that target.\nBefore I get into the forward look, I'd like to discuss a few puts and takes in our fourth quarter results that will help form a better view of our run rate earnings power. On management fees: Management fees declined modestly quarter-over-quarter due to Fund X catch-up fees of approximately $25 million earned in the third quarter. Athene's alternatives portfolio returned 6.5% annualized in the fourth quarter, below our long-term expectation of 11%, with strong performance by the strategic origination platforms partially offset by other investments held outside AAA.\nOur operating tax rate benefited from large deductions related to employee stock compensation due to a higher share price as well as onetime benefits related to Athene's redomicile and new corporate tax legislation [ in Bermuda ] in December. Going forward, we expect our effective tax rate to remain approximately 20% over the long term, subject to quarterly variability. And then lastly, Athene's cost of funds in the third quarter included a 17 basis point benefit from 2 items that we previously adjusted out as notable items. Q4 also included the full year costs of a new performance fee, which amounted to 7 basis points of costs in Q4. Combining these items provides a more appropriate comparison of the quarter-over-quarter change in cost of funds, which including these adjustments was similar to the change in fixed income returns for the quarter.\nSo turning to our FRE outlook. We expect 15% to 20% growth, as Marc communicated. I'll walk through the key building blocks. Excluding $45 million of cyclical catch-up fees we earned in 2023 related to our flagship PE fund raise Fund X, we expect low- to mid-teens fee revenue growth in 2024 primarily driven by increasing management fees and fee-related performance fees. We expect management fee growth to be supported by the $120 billion of total organic inflows Scott highlighted as well as solid levels of capital deployment, further supported by $46 billion of fee-eligible AUM not yet earning management fees.\nFor capital solutions, we expect another strong year of fee revenue generation currently similar to 2023 levels. The revenue from this business has grown approximately 80% in 2 years and has already exceeded our 5-year target.\nFor expenses, we estimate our growth rate in total fee-related expenses will moderate this year to a low double-digit level. We added approximately 350 people to our total head count in 2023, at the asset manager, with approximately half the net new hires located in North America and Europe and the other half in Mumbai. We expect very targeted head count growth this year in our business, with a continued focus on growing our India team. As the pace of growth in our head count declines, we should experience a commensurate favorable slowdown in the pace of non-comp expense growth. Combining this expense outlook with a solid revenue growth picture, we expect to derive an additional 100 basis points improvement in our FRE margin to approximately 57 basis points this year, on a path to 60%-plus by 2026.\nMoving to retirement services. We expect to generate low double-digit growth in SRE this year based on a few underlying criteria. In terms of basis, the growth outlook is built upon the exclusion of any notables and assumes an 11% return on Athene's alternatives portfolio in line with historical experience, adjusting for the approximate $70 million of excess earnings we earned in 2023 on assets related to the ADIP buydowns and the Venerable recapture, both as we previously communicated; [ $70 billion ] of organic inflows funded with existing capital resources, including third-party sidecar capital; and net spread, excluding any notable items and assuming an 11% return [indiscernible], of between 160 and 165 basis points, based on the current forward rate curve which implies approximately 5 rate cuts by the end of 2024.\nAs it relates to interest rates and sensitivity. Athene has had a long-standing and intentional allocation to floating-rate securities while remaining duration matched. Holding floaters has and will continue to serve a range of strategic purposes, including assisting with asset-liability matching, enabling offensive positioning within the asset portfolio during periods of market stress and cushioning it against any [ elevated surrenders ]. With the prospect of a Fed easing cycle on the horizon, we have reduced the amount of net floating-rate assets to $25 billion at year-end; and we expect it to further decline to $20 billion by the end of the first quarter.\nTurning to principal investing briefly. We expect our PII earnings stream to be below our multiyear average target of $1 per share in 2024, with clear dependencies on both the public and private markets for monetizations and outcomes.\nOn capital allocation, our priorities remain unchanged. We're focused on investing in our existing capabilities to drive continued organic growth rather than making strategic investments. We also expect to continue immunizing regular-way employee stock comp grants and to begin taking steps to reduce our share count to 600 million shares by the end of 2026. We have also announced an increase in the annual dividend by 7.5% to $1.85 per share, beginning with the first quarter of 2024, implying a dividend yield of 1.8%, slightly above the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 of 1.5%.\nFinally, our GAAP earnings totaled $2.9 billion for the quarter and $5.1 billion for the full year, retaining our eligibility for S&P 500 index inclusion.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.\nApollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, Donna. And welcome again, everyone, to our call. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. We reported strong third quarter financial results which included record quarterly FRE of $472 million or $0.77 per share and record quarterly SRE of $873 million or $1.43 per share. Together, these two earnings streams totaled $1.3 billion in the third quarter, increasing more than 30% year-over-year and reflecting solid execution from both our asset management and retirement services businesses. Combined with principal investing income, HoldCo financing costs and taxes, we reported adjusted net income of $1 billion or $1.71 per share, up 23% year-over-year.\nJoining me this morning to discuss our results and strong relative positioning in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman; co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And one quick plug before we proceed. In a couple of weeks on the afternoon of November 14, we will be hosting a deep dive presentation on our platform origination strategy, a top area of investor focus, which will provide insights into various platforms and detail how, in aggregate, we believe they provide a competitive and sustainable advantage to Apollo in sourcing excess spread. A live video cast of the session will be available through our Investor Relations page.\nAnd with that, now back to our regularly scheduled earnings programming. Marc?\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Noah, and good morning to all. Another great quarter amidst interesting financial markets and certainly a challenging year for many in our industry. Just to highlight performance. Quarterly FRE, up 29% year-over-year. Quarterly SRE, 36% year-over-year. Margin expansion, 3 quarters in a row now. Inflows for the third quarter, $33 billion, $125 billion year-to-date. Deployment, $36 billion, fundamentally momentum on both sides of the business.\nOur business model is very robust, as I will track for you. We expect another $30 billion plus/minus of inflows for Q4, bringing total inflows for the year to $150 billion. The momentum we see in the business tells me we will have an on track continued good performance heading into Q4. Obviously, quarter is not done yet, but everything we see tells us the momentum will continue.\nIn Global Wealth, which I'll just do a quick shout-out to, given how hard the team has been working, there are now seven perpetual wealth products in the market today. Scott will go through this in detail. And just to close out, origination volume tracking, north of the $100 billion on an annualized level.\nFundamentally, everything in the business is working, and I believe we're set up appropriately to benefit from the current market. Almost everything in our business works better with higher rates. Credit, as you know, is a much bigger part of our business mix than most of our peer group, something we've built over a long period of time. And to remind you, we are focused on senior secured top of the capital structure. This is a big difference between what people normally think of as private credit and otherwise. But we want a business that lasts, one that has duration, one that is set up for a difficult economy, notwithstanding all the positives happening in the credit market.\nTo give you a sense, impairments at Athene, at or below last year's level. We expect for the year and year-to-date, notwithstanding some back and forth quarter-to-quarter. Fundamentally, the book is in very good shape.\nOn the equity side of our business, purchase price matters, which is our strategy, has really paid off. Many -- there's lots of dry powder in the equity business in private markets. But many people are sitting on the sidelines. They have no idea how much of their existing capital is going to need to be used to solve problems in their existing portfolio, to get refinancings done. Purchase price matter, and being disciplined over the past decade has left us with a very small number of situations that will require fixing. And therefore, we have been on offense, Tremendous deployment, which Scott will detail in our private equity business and in our hybrid business.\nIf you like something now in the equity business, given all the geopolitical implications, given the concerns over recession, given the high rate environment, given what is generally very difficult financing conditions, you really like it. On the margin deployment into the equity business, I think for all of '23, we'll prove for our industry to be very, very attractive.\nSo what's really happening? Let me step back and give you my view at least on what I think is happening in markets and in private markets. And I'll start -- I look at my career, which is now 39 years, and I think we have benefited from four tailwinds over this period of time. We've had rates generally going from high to low. We have printed a massive amount of money. We have borrowed forward future demand through fiscal stimulus and fiscal borrowing. And we've had the benefit of globalization. It does not surprise me with those four tailwinds that risk assets equities, growth, real estate, things like that did really well.\nBut I ask myself, are any of those four things true today? I think there's an argument as to whether there are headwinds or just the absence of tailwinds. But everything that I see tells me that we -- looking backward is not likely to be a good indication of what needs to be done going forward for investment success. In particular, looking backward over the past 10 years, which I view as an absolute aberration, will not be a good guide going forward. And the strategies that performed over the past period of time with these tailwinds are not going to perform in the new environment that we have.\nI also think there have been fundamental changes that have happened to markets and market structure over the past years as well. The most significant of which happened in 2008. 2008, we came very close to an absolute debacle in our financial system, and the rules of how our financial markets work were fundamentally rewritten. We, not just Apollo, but all of us, we just didn't notice because right after we changed the rules, we printed $8 trillion, and everything went up into the right. Well, now that we are no longer doing that, now that rates are up, now that there are headwinds, we are starting to notice some of these changes. And I'll stick to three, and I'll talk about their implications.\nOne is liquidity, public market liquidity. By some estimates, dealer capital. Capital that facilitates trading is roughly 10% today of what it was in 2008. Markets are 3x their size. That tells me we have just less liquidity in public markets. We have already seen the first complete breakdown of functioning in market, which was U.K. LDI last year. It will not surprise me going forward to see liquidity challenged, public markets challenged, and investors beginning to understand that liquidity only exists on the way up and does not exist on the way down. We should expect a more volatile, less liquid world in public markets.\nThe second is the role of banks, not just in our economy, but in economies around the world. Dodd-Frank, in theory, was targeted at constraining the power of the four big banks in the U.S., following the financial crisis. but the banking system in general. Guess what? It worked. Banks today in the U.S. markets are roughly 20% of debt capital to consumers and businesses. All of you, investors, now supply 80% of debt capital to businesses.\nIn addition, the changes that are now proposed to occur following the debacle at SVB and First Republic and Credit Suisse, will further lead to de banking. When regulators ask banks in the U.S. to put up 15% more capital, they're asking the banks to shrink or to shrink lines of business. When Europe moves from Basel III to Basel IV, they're asking banks to shrink. This is happening around the world. Debanking is not something that is periodic. It is that it's very early infancy. It does not mean that debanking is a bad business. It does not mean that four big banks don't have amazing businesses. They do. But it means on the margin, they will continue to play less and less as a percentage of the total and new investors will play more and more. That tells me as investors that you will see over the next decade a series of financial products that you've never seen before because they have historically been resident only on the balance sheets of large banks, and they are on their way to you as investment product.\nThe third I focus on is this notion of indexation and correlation. 80% of volume today of trading is S&P 500 .60% of our markets are ETFs. 10 stocks make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500. These 10 stocks are responsible for 100% of year-to-date returns. These 10 stocks have traded between 52 and 44 PE over the last few weeks. Not many of you come in every day looking to buy 50 PE stocks, yet we feel really comfortable with a massive portion of our country's retirement system assets and fiduciary assets in 50 PE stocks. We have literally never had so much concentration in so few instruments since the NFTE 50 going back and predates my career. But if one looks at the data from that period of time, a decade later, investors lost nearly 90% of their money. I'm not saying that's what's happening here. What I'm pointing out is we had this perception historically that public was safe and private was risky. I ask, is that even the right framework to think about how market structure today? Is public safe and is private risky? Or are both -- public and private, both risky and safe? I do think that, that is the conclusion and that's where investors will move to.\nLet me dig in a little bit on private credit. Private credit is the flavor of the day in our industry. You can look at press mentions. You can look at all the articles. You can look at what our colleagues and peers have had to say on their various calls. Private credit for us has been the mainstay of our business. We are nearly $500 billion in private credit, away from the 2,600 people who work in Apollo Asset Management and the more than 2,000 people who work at Athene. There are 4,000 people at Apollo who do not carry an Apollo business card, who work at 1 of our 16 platforms that Noah referenced, where we will do a deep dive. And their job every single day is to create credit, create private credit, which I'll come to. And that's what they come in and do every day. We've assembled this over the last decade plus or between $6 billion and $8 billion. Truthfully, our ecosystem is second to none in this business.\nAs I mentioned, I believe we are in the first inning or the infancy of private credit. Private credit is a secular trend, and it follows the debanking that I mentioned, and it is not just a U.S. phenomenon. It is a worldwide phenomenon. We have, to date, as a financial press and as an industry, talked about private credit as if it meant to be -- it is levered lending, sometimes called direct lending, was private credit. Let me tell you. This is a fraction of a fraction of what debanking will produce. This piece of the business of lending to buyout sponsors, sometimes it's a very good business. It is about to get commoditized. Lots of capital is coming to this area. There are low barriers to entry. And investors understand this. They are moving toward firms that have established ecosystems, that have long track records of risk and reward, that will not chase the hot dot in this market because, yes, there will be a hot dot in this market as well.\nWhen I talk about private credit, I'm really talking about the secular change as a result of debanking. I start with the notion that everything on a bank balance sheet is actually private credit. What we've seen so far and what the press is focused on is levered lending, which, as I said, is a fraction of a fraction. I think we're going to be talking about this for the next 10 years. And the vast, vast majority of what we're interested in private credit is actually investment grade. The difference between where we are today and where I think we will be is all about education and nomenclature.\nInvestors are being asked really challenging questions today. Is a A-rated private security an alternative or fixed income? Sometimes I can stop a CIO at a big fund for an hour with that question. If it's an alternative because it is private and that's how they think about the world, they're not going to buy it because they need 15% to 20% rates of return out of their alternative bucket. But if it is fixed income because it is rated the same as fixed income and it offers 200 to 300 basis points of excess return for the same risk, institutional investors, family offices, wealthy individuals should be able to tolerate some degree of illiquidity if they're getting paid for it, particularly if I go back to my secular themes of liquidity is not so good in the public market. Most of what's out there has been commoditized. I do think this is our future. I do think we, as a group, will be talking about private credit, and I expect the conversation to become much, much more sophisticated.\nAway from the business, I sometimes joke that we raise money, we invest money and we compensate people. The raising of money, the investing of money seems to be in very good shape. I'm fortunate that Scott and Jim live and breathe this every single day. I, therefore, get to focus on compensating people. And it's not just compensating people, it's also about the culture. As I've said previously, our north star is to build the best partnership and financial services. If we can be the best place for our 200 partners to work, we will retain their judgment throughout their whole career. We will also send a message to our next generation of principles, that partnership at Apollo is what it's all about. And then throughout the organization, younger people entering our firm, no matter how hard they are working, and they are working hard, and I thank you, you will have two amazing generations of mentors to teach you the business. This is the ecosystem that we're trying to create.\nWe also are trying to do something for shareholders. We understand that shareholders value more highly those things that are highly predictable, FRE and SRE; and value less highly those things that are volatile, PII. Just look at this year where FRE and SRE are up nearly 30% each; and PII reflecting market conditions, is down very significantly from what we would expect as a long-run average. Our goal, over time, is to pay our people more PII and less FRE and SRE, and that is the trend we are on. At our Investor Day some 2 years ago, we laid out a trajectory of how we're doing. Today, Martin will update you and tell you we are not only on that trajectory we are now pivoting to actually exceed that trajectory. What Martin will detail for you is not just a financial transaction, but also focused on the next generation of leadership. We have, and as Martin will detail, decided to fundamentally change the compensation for four of our next generation of leaders. These are not the only leaders who, in my view, are capable of the next generation, but they are four who are very visible within our organization: Matt Nord, David Saber, John Zito and Greg Faham. All four of them have taken on increasing amounts of responsibility over the years. They now see not just to oversee their individual departments, they oversee massive pieces of our firm that are integrated. And as such, we've decided to compensate them substantially in stock. That does not necessarily mean more, it just means different. What we've decided to do is to take the compensation of FRE and SRE and PII that they would have received and replaced a very large portion of that with stock so they are aligned with Jim and Scott and myself, but also with all of you. This will create room for us to further give that PII that those four individuals hold to others in our firm in our constant battle and our constant direction to keep more of the FRE and SRE for the house and less of the PII. And that, I believe, is how it should be. Employees, particularly our partners, are well suited to understand PII and to bear the volatility. Up good and bad of PII, I believe this to be a good outcome for shareholders. I view it as a good outcome for me personally. And I know Jim and Scott view it as a good outcome for them. Having everyone aligned and being paid in the same way, extraordinarily important.\nI will also tell you. We are committed to immunizing the stock that we intend to grant, and Martin will detail that for you as well. So Noah is already tapping his watch and telling me that my time is almost up. Fundamentally, we are on track to hit our 5-year plan. Athene, as you know, has already exceeded its 5-year plan. Of the 3 big bets that we laid out, capital Solutions in 2 years has already hit its 5-year plan, origination and global wealth are well on track to meet their 5-year plan. So fundamentally, we're confident to meet or exceed the goals that we laid out in our first 5-year plan, and it feels almost like it's time for the next update. There are so many interesting things happening in asset management, so many interesting fundamental changes in market. And so we are committed to hosting our next Investor Day later in '24, which Noah will detail, to really talk about where we go from here.\nWith that, I'll remind you, the goal that we're after, deliver the targets that we've told to you, plus a little, while maintaining our culture. We are not seeking to be the biggest. We're not seeking to be the fastest growing. We're seeking to build something that is sustainable over a very long period of time.\nWith that, I'm going to turn it over to Scott.\n\nScott M. Kleinman\n\nCo-President & Lead Partner of Private Equity, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Marc. Unlike many in the industry, the current market backdrop marked by higher interest rates, heightened volatility and economic uncertainty is where we thrive. It's good for our core investing businesses where we are asset selectors with a value orientation, not momentum or volume traders. It's also good for Athene's business where higher for longer rates drive more volume and better profitability. And it can be good for our capital solutions business where companies can access creative financing solutions when traditional sources of capital are less plentiful. This is the true power of our aligned asset management and retirement services business model, which should only increase as we continue executing on our growth objectives.\nAs you've heard us say before, the foundation of our business is providing excess return per unit of risk, and this is evident in our strong investment performance. In the yield business, our corporate credit, structured credit and direct origination strategies all appreciated between 3% and 4% in the quarter and between 12% and 17% over the last 12 months. We've seen particularly strong performance in certain underlying strategies, including Apollo Debt Solutions, which posted a total net return of 16.5% for Class 1 shares over the last 12 months. Performance in our hybrid value franchise also remains robust, with the portfolio appreciating 4% in the third quarter and 11% year-to-date. And in private equity, our flagship strategy appreciated 3% in the third quarter and 16% over the last 12 months, including 22% LTM for Fund 9 specifically as the underlying portfolio companies continue to generate healthy earnings growth and are actively managing inflation by achieving greater operational efficiencies. The portfolio is well diversified and has an average purchase multiple of slightly over 6x offering significant downside protection should economic conditions worsen.\nIn terms of investing activity, we remained active during the quarter, putting $36 billion of capital to work across the platform. Investing activity across the yield platform accounted for the vast majority of capital deployment in the quarter as we continue to capitalize on two primary interrelated themes: global debanking and lack of public market liquidity. Our ability to provide scaled capital solutions with flexibility and certainty has made us a lender of choice in today's backdrop. With that said, we're picking our spots and remaining highly disciplined in our underwriting criteria, given the potential economic pressures of interest rates remaining higher for longer. This is a playbook we've used time and time again: strong defense during times of uncertainty, leading to effective offense during periods of dislocation.\nFor our hybrid business, the pipeline of deployment opportunities is also expanding. Sponsors and corporates alike are seeking structured financing alternatives to access liquidity and refinance capital structures, which is driving heightened demand. This trend is especially evident within our hybrid value strategy, where the deployment pace in our second vintage has been strong as well as our S3 business, where we've invested more than $1 billion of capital into equity and hybrid solutions so far this year. And in private equity, we remain very busy with capital deployment activity reaching $11 billion over the last 12 months. With reductions in broad market valuations, we're seeing a wider opportunity set that fits our strategy, particularly in take privates and carve-out transactions. As a leading franchise with a long-standing track record, we remain confident in our ability to source financing, deploy capital and appropriately capitalize during challenging market environments, which was recently showcased by the sizable closings of Univar and Arconic in August.\nMoving to our capital raising results. We generated $33 billion of total inflows in the quarter, primarily comprised of the $13 billion of inflows from Athene and very strong third-party fundraising of $14 billion. Investor preferences have shifted in favor of credit over the past year, and we've been capturing this demand through our full product suite spanning corporate credit through total return and Apollo Debt Solutions, go anywhere opportunistic credit through Accord and Accord Plus and our newly-launched asset-backed finance franchise. All of these are important to our growth objectives in the yield business over the next 12 months and beyond, which will position us with even more dry powder for what we expect to be an attractive credit investing backdrop.\nAdditionally, we spent a lot of time and resources positioning ourselves for the next wave of growth in our asset management business, which we've discussed as concentrated in six complementary areas where we believe we have a competitive edge. Fundraising for these initiatives accounted for more than 25% of total third-party capital raised in the third quarter, including capital for direct origination and multi-credit sidecars and for AAA. We also expect to hold closes for our inaugural equity secondaries and clean transition equity funds over the next couple of quarters, which are two exciting areas of expansion within our equity business.\nAnd of course, an important component of our capital raising efforts this year and going forward is everything we're building in Global Wealth. This area continues to be a steady march for us as we roll out product, expand distribution, invest in technology and continue to educate the marketplace. We believe all these components have led to a differentiated platform offering for several reasons.\nFirst, excess return. As I mentioned earlier, our primary goal is to drive excess return per unit of risk for our clients through our tailored product suite, individual investors get to the same sourcing and underwriting resources as our institutional clients and our own balance sheet.\nSecond, customization. Individual investors consume product in a different way. To meet this need, we've taken institutional-like offerings and adjusted them into structures for the retail market and, in some cases, design products specifically with the individual investor in mind. We offer seven families of perpetual products today for both U.S. and non-U.S. global wealth investors and have a handful more in the pipeline.\nThird, education. We believe the benefits that alternatives bring to a diversified portfolio are still widely misunderstood by retail investors and are often equated with high-risk, high fee products. To combat this mischaracterization, we've leaned in on education through Apollo Academy, which recently crossed the 1-year mark and has more than 10,000 financial professionals registered as members.\nAnd lastly, commitment. As a leadership team, we've made an internal and external commitment to this initiative, which has translated into a couple of important benefits, including allocation of resources, both organically and via M&A, and with speed to market that allowed us -- that has allowed us to grow as quickly as we have.\nDespite all the progress we've made thus far, it's still early days, and we see a long runway of growth ahead of us in what we view as a massive addressable market. Given our emerging growth prospects relative to more mature wealth platforms, we feel confident in our ability to drive this continued growth, even if faced with a more challenging retail market backdrop.\nTurning to Athene. Organic inflows totaled $13 billion in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date inflows to $44 billion. Retail annuity sales drove half of the quarterly activity with businesses that were under -- with business that was underwritten to very strong returns. Volume has been increasing in that channel to begin the fourth quarter with approximately $2.5 billion of annuities sold in October.\nIn flow reinsurance, Athene is continuing to see a steady build in volumes driven by new distribution partnerships in Japan and the U.S. as well as strong volumes from existing counterparts. We expect flow reinsurance inflows to exceed $10 billion this year, implying healthy inflows again next quarter.\nFor pension group annuities, despite the low in activity in the third quarter, we see a solid pipeline of opportunities, including one deal that already closed in October. It's worth noting that this business now has generated $50 billion of cumulative volume since Athene entered the channel in 2017, leading the industry during that time frame. Based on the momentum we see across Athene's business, we remain on pace to generate $60 billion plus of total inflows this year.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financial results.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Scott. And good morning, everyone. So as Marc previewed, we reported another very strong quarter of results as we continue to execute against the financial targets we laid out at the beginning of this year. Markets have changed quite significantly since then, marked by even higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty, yet we've remained confident throughout 2023 in meeting or exceeding our initial financial targets for the year as further evidenced today. With these results, we believe that we're beginning to gain recognition for the predictability, consistency and differentiated growth of our earnings profile anchored by our two primary earning streams: FRE and SRE.\nI'll address five topics in my remarks today: one, earnings growth and outlook in our asset management business; two, the financial impact of the compensation awards we announced today; three, earnings growth and outlook in our Retirement Services business; four, credit performance in Athene's portfolio; and five, capital allocation priorities.\nStarting with our Asset Management business. Our 7% increase in quarterly FRE continued to be driven by solid revenue growth and expense discipline. Year-to-date, FRE revenues are higher by 25% against a 21% increase in FRE expenses. Our Capital Solutions business achieved a new high in the third quarter amid a robust year of growth. We're very pleased with the expansion of this business, which is on track to meet its 5-year revenue plan in just 2 years. We'll spend some time during our platform origination presentation on November 14, discussing the breadth of this business, and it's important to our fixed income replacement strategy.\nSpecific to Fund X in the quarter, management fee growth of 5% included a $24 million catch-up for Fund X and its final close with Fund X fees in the quarter being $14 million higher than the prior quarter, considering catch-ups in both quarters.\nOur focus on scaling the asset management business is evident in our compensation costs, which were flat in the quarter and up 14% on a year-to-date basis. Underpinning this is a moderation in our headcount growth and an emphasis on building our team in India, which recently crossed 500 employees or close to 20% of our total headcount. Our noncompensation costs are in their last year of sizable growth, reflecting a step-up in our investments in global real estate, technology and product distribution. Combined, this has driven strong positive operating leverage, resulting in more than 150 basis points of margin expansion year-to-date versus the prior year period. Based on our visibility into the fourth quarter, we remain confident in achieving 25% FRE growth in 2023, as previously communicated.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we expect FRE growth between 15% and 20%, consistent with our FRE growth expectations in a year without a flagship PE fund raise. The outcome is somewhat dependent on the environment with current expectations around the middle of that range. This outlook is guided by a strong fundraising outlook, or holding more than $45 billion of uninvested capital with management fee potential. Our current plan to repeat the very successful year in Capital Solutions in 2023 and low double-digit expense growth. We anticipate a further approximate 100-basis-point improvement in our FRE margin next year as a result.\nThe compensation awards we announced today amount to approximately $550 million of award value at grand equating to approximately 1% of our share count and include two components: one, for senior leaders, the exchange of the majority of existing and expected future compensation in the form of FRE, SRE, carry and stock for newly issued vested stock; and two, the reallocation of those savings and the expected issuance of a modest amount of additional carry to other employees and a further exchange for FRE in stock. This exchange and reallocation is accretive in value, and we expect will create an opportunity for a further reduction in our FRE compensation ratio, which we currently believe will be around 23% by 2026 before further reallocations. It will also create a reduction in stock that we expect would have otherwise been issued and will increase our cycle average PII compensation ratio to an expected range of 65% to 75%, outcomes that we believe are well aligned with shareholders, as Marc described.\nTurning to our Retirement Services business. We generated SRE of $873 million in the third quarter or 168 basis points of net spread. This included some offsetting items that when adjusted for resulted in normalized SRE being roughly in line at $879 million. In terms of balance sheet growth, net invested assets ended the quarter at $208 billion, down $6 billion versus the second quarter, reflecting the buy down by $8 of $7 billion of organic inflows from the first half of the year and the $3 billion transaction with Venerable, more than offsetting positive net flows within the quarter. Invested assets attributable to third-party investors in ADIP now exceed $50 billion, representing 20% of Athene's total invested assets. As third-party capital, ADIP has multiple benefits, including validating Athene's business model, providing capital support, driving greater profitability on business retained and enhancing AGM's overall group capital efficiency. We expect to close out 2023 with a normalized SOE growth rate exceeding 30%, reflecting our expectations for strong organic inflows in the fourth quarter, a lower core outflow rate, ADIP growth participation and a normalized net spread of approximately 165 basis points in the fourth quarter.\nAs you are aware from comments we made when we issued the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August and as evidenced by our retirement services business exceeding its 5-year earnings target in 2 years, we have benefited both from meaningfully higher volume growth and asset returns. It is imprudent to budget the continuation of that growth rate. Having said that, we continue to expect low double-digit normalized SRE growth in 2024 after adjusting for the ADIP buy down and Venerable recapture driven by: one, continued scaling of asset growth due to an abundance of organic growth opportunities across our four business channels. Cumulatively, we expect that to be at least $70 billion in 2024. Two, funding this growth with existing capital resources, including third-party ADIP capital; and three, on spreads, expected normalized net spreads of around 165 basis points for the year assuming the current forward curve. And as a reminder, higher rates benefit our floating rate assets and achievable return on our underlying capital. Athene supports every dollar of liability growth with approximately $0.08 to $0.10 of capital, which we invest alongside the dollars of cash taken in from policyholders. So while Athene continues to underwrite new business to historical targets of around 115 basis points or better at the product level, beyond the margin SRE spread is much higher in the current environment, closer to 170 basis points year-to-date.\nAs it relates to our credit quality, Athene's portfolio continues to be in a very strong position. Total impairments over the last 12 months have amounted to just 13 basis points, close to Athene's long-term average. Athene's investment portfolio is concentrated in high-quality senior secured assets with an approximate 95% allocation to fixed income, of which 95% also is rated investment grade. It's noteworthy that Athene's credit losses have been disproportionately concentrated in investment-grade corporate bonds purchased in the market as opposed to private investment-grade credit that we originate, underscoring our confidence in the credit quality of originated credit. We believe that Athene has the most transparent financial disclosure amongst its peers. And in line with our philosophy, Athene began publishing historical credit losses in their fixed income investor presentation last quarter, which will be updated in conjunction with our next call next week on November 9.\nAs it relates to capital allocation, the construct we laid out 2 years ago at our Investor Day remains largely intact with delays in exiting private equity investments impacting the timing but not the expected quantum of carry to be generated. Meanwhile, Athene has been maintaining its consistent dividend up to the holding company in a significantly more attractive growth backdrop amid rising rates. To support this, we've increased participation from ADIP and issued the mandatory convertible preferred stock in August, the proceeds of which were downstreamed to Athene. At the same time, the sheer number of organic growth opportunities at the asset manager and a targeted 20% return on group capital by growing Athene has resulted in little need to invest in the business through M&A.\nBalancing all these dynamics, we expect to continue immunizing all regular way equity-based compensation when it's issued, and we expect to immunize both the dilutive impacts of the mandatory convertible preferred and the vested stock awards we announced today over the next few years as capital is available, targeting a share count of 600 million shares outstanding. We anticipate additional capacity within our current 5-year plan but back ended to consider opportunistic for share repurchase in addition to. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.\nApollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI will now turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, Donna, and welcome again, everyone, to our call. We're really thankful for the opportunity to spend some time with you this morning.\nEarlier, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Within these documents, you can see that we generated very solid results that included record quarterly fee-related earnings of $442 million, or $0.74 per share, and record quarterly normalized spread-related earnings of $874 million, or $1.47 per share. Together, these two earnings streams totaled $1.3 billion in the second quarter, increasing more than 40% year-over-year, demonstrating the strong, resilient and fully aligned growth characteristics of our asset management and retirement services businesses. Combined with principal investing income and other holdco items, we reported normalized adjusted net income of $1.1 billion, or $1.80 per share, up 60% year-over-year.\nJoining me from our team to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And we've received some feedback from some of you that we should attempt to shorten the length of our prepared remarks. So at the risk of making a false promise, Marc himself has ensured us that we'll be endeavoring to do that today.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Noah, and we all can wish for certain things, and hope that they come through.\nIn any event, as Noah said, it was truly a very, very strong quarter. Normalized SRE and FRE of $1.3 billion for the quarter, and we are on track to earn FRE and normalized SRE $5 billion plus/minus for the year, which Martin will detail.\nOne thing worth calling out is just how exceptionally strong SRE has been. Just to put in context, Athene has now grown or will grow 30% SRE 2 years in a row. And they actually have hit their 2026 financial target, as laid out in our Investor Day some 2 years ago, in just 2 years. Not only are they doing an exceptional job, but clearly, Jim and Grant and the team have exceptionally sandbagged everyone. And the business continues to be very strong.\nIn addition to financial results, we had record inflows for the quarter on an organic basis. We had some $43 billion of inflows, including $8 billion that closed shortly after the quarter end. This closing shortly after quarter end is actually a feature of the alternatives business. Many of our institutional investors prefer to close on the first of the month and have something in another quarter from an allocation point of view rather than in the prior month. And for many of our retail, high net worth focused funds, they also closed on the first of the month. So I expect that we will be a little more careful in giving guidance quarter-by-quarter to account for how this business actually operates.\nFrom my point of view, and as Martin and we have discussed previously, we generated positive operating leverage and margin expansion this quarter, and we expect this to continue over the next couple of years as we benefit from the investments that we've made in people and facilities and in upgrading our business over the past few years.\nIn short, our strategic positioning is excellent and anchored by three really simple principles: one, purchase price matters; the second, excess return per unit of risk, that is what we do; and full alignment with our clients, both our institutional and our retail clients.\nIt actually feels pretty good. Having not chase the hot dot during an era of money printing and zero rates, our opportunity set is just different than that of our peer group. Apollo has momentum.\nIn terms of the business, let me start for the quarter with the equity business. In the equity business, this year has really marked the end of an era. So if I think about what happened over the prior decade, and perhaps longer than a decade, there were these incredible tailwinds in the equity business, tailwinds from money printing, pulling forward of demand, fiscal stimulus and certainly from zero rates. We now find ourselves in an absence of tailwinds. Rates are higher. Growth is slower. Globalization is in retreat. People will have to go back to investing in the old fashioned way. They'll actually have to be very good investors. They will need to produce alpha.\nI believe that's what we've been doing. Demonstrated by the recent private equity results, the final close for Fund X in mid-July brought in capital just around $20 billion over a 12-month marketing period versus extending over -- versus continuing to market over an extended time line. The fund is now closed. Fund IX generated 36% gross IRRs, 24% net IRRs.\nIn the quarter, it's just a really interesting time in the private equity business between haves and have nots. Arconic and Univar, two very large financings, which certainly came at a time that was challenging for the market, both executed better than expected, giving us increased confidence in the ability to get transactions we like done.\nLet me move on from the equity business and talk about the two drivers of the quarter and what I expect to drive the rest of the year. First, private credit. As I've said previously, private credit, these are two words that actually mean nothing. Private credit can be investment grade, private credit can be CCC.\nBarriers to entry in the private credit business are either quite low. Anyone with a fund and a staff capable of evaluating investments can truly enter the private credit business, or barriers to entry can be extraordinarily high, and building a full ecosystem that allows you to serve the needs of your clients in a very sophisticated way.\nThink of the difference between a hotdog stand and a Michelin Star restaurant, both are in the food business and both serve food. That is how we think about private credit and where people are positioned.\nFinancial markets, financial literacy around private credit has actually gotten quite sloppy. What is private credit? Well, if we start in the abstract, everything that is on a bank balance sheet is private credit. But most of the time, markets -- market pundits talk about private credit. They're talking about a very small sliver of a private credit universe that's focused on levered lending.\nDon't get me wrong, we like the levered lending business. Levered lending is actually a terrific business right now. It will not always be a terrific business. It is a cyclical business with low barriers to entry, but one that, at the right point in time, can be very lucrative.\nWhat we have tried to build is not a single fund, is not a single opportunity, we've tried to build an ecosystem. If I reflect on the past decade, we've invested some $8 billion, building 16 originating platforms. There are 4,000 people who work in these platforms, not Apollo employees, who are solely focused every single day on originating private credit.\nAnd as you know, much, if not most of what they do is investment grade. That's important because the investment-grade market is at least 8x larger than the high-yield market and 8x larger than the levered lending market.\nThis is a great time for private credit. This is not a quarter that's a great time for private credit, this is a secular change. Not only do we have higher base rates and regulatory change and change in market dynamics, we are in the beginning of a secular shift in how credit is provided to businesses and a shift that I believe will continue to gather speed.\nTo be successful in this market, you need a recurring supply of unique origination. This quarter, we originated some $23 billion with 50% of that from platforms. Jim Zelter will detail some of these transactions. But in addition to the names you would expect that are traditionally associated with private credit, AT&T, Air France and Vonovia, borrowers value certainty, scale and speed to execution.\nIn addition to origination, you need an integrated capital markets business. Because, after all, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. Our ACS business, led by Craig Farr, has done an extraordinary job extending our reach of private credit to clients and to non-clients. And in fact, this is among the greatest ways that we introduce the firm to people who are not yet clients of Apollo and show them what we're capable of.\nThis quarter, we raised some $7 billion of capital from third-party insurers, and we expect this to gather speed as the market continues to improve. For private credit, particularly investment grade, the way that consumers and businesses borrow is traditionally through the asset-backed market.\nAsset-backed is, for the most part, private credit. This is a $20 trillion market, and one in which we have been playing for a very, very long time, more than $220 billion of volume to date, better than 200 relationships. We have currently more than $100 billion of AUM associated with ABF, $55 billion of which is third party. Most of what happens for us in ABF is investment grade, and it is a key driver of our insurance business for Athene and for our third-party insurance clients, and increasingly, for fixed income replacement for our traditional institutional clients.\nOne of the single most important factors in this market is that we are completely aligned with our client base. We own what they own, at the same time, at the same price. There is nothing that is more confidence inspiring than alignment.\nLet me move on from private credit to talk a little bit about the job Athene did in the quarter. Athene's results are in part driven by the ability of Apollo to source attractive investment-grade credit, but also by the incredibly talented team that has been building Athene for the past 14 years. Normalized SRE for the quarter was $874 million and normalized net spread was 166 basis points, truly the widest I can remember.\n$19 billion of organic inflows in the quarter, up more than 50% year-over-year, #1 annuity market share. We now have line of sight to more than $60 billion of organic inflows this year. We are leaving by some estimates between $10 billion and $20 billion of annual originations on the table. Truly, we have an opportunity now to be selective and to build recurring franchises. We've made progress this quarter in Japan through our reinsurance business and elsewhere in Asia, and I believe the business at Athene is gathering speed. Although as I've cautioned in private in prior quarters, and as I'm sure Martin will detail, these are truly exceptionally good times, and we are beneficiaries of the large floating rate position that we have carried for more than a decade.\nAlso recall that our business is built at the top of the capital structure, on a senior secured basis and we sleep better at night. Credit experience in the quarter was incredibly benign, less than 2 basis points, which I'm sure Martin will detail.\nSurrenders or outflows also came in better than forecast. And if you recall from the chart, we've included in this quarter as well as prior quarters as well as the education we've been doing, the primary driver of surrenders is not what happens at any point in time in interest rates. It is the timing of the expiration of programs that we put on 3 and 5 years ago and for the most part, is highly predictable.\nIt is difficult to imagine going from start-up or new business to where Athene is today. Right now, we have not done an inorganic transaction for a number of years, but we are the beneficiary of four very diverse channels: retail, PRT, reinsurance and funding agreements. All four of those channels are dependent on a stable and high-quality credit rating and having an infrastructure and a scale and an operating expense ratio that allow you to lever the business.\nWe could not have built the business we have today inorganically in a high-rate environment. We were fortunate in a low rate environment to have been able to purchase inorganic blocks. At a time when their contract rates were above market rates, therefore, our risk of surrender was very low.\nIn contrast, in today's market, someone buying an inorganic block is actually buying a block where surrender charges and market value adjustments have degraded and is at much greater risk of a melting ice cube. In short, it is not a stable base on which to build the business, and we'll make it very difficult for people to achieve the kind of scale we have achieved.\nRecall that we bought in Athene for some $11 billion at acquisition, and Athene will earn $3.1 billion plus/minus of normalized SRE for the fiscal year. In short, the team is doing an incredible job, and distribution and maturation in product has not yet even matured. There is more to come.\nIn an effort to keep on time, let me focus on one last topic, which I know has been of interest to people. I really want to talk about the market environment, particularly the regulatory environment and the environment as it relates to our banking peers.\nIn short, we have never had such a collaborative dialogue with the banking system. We have gone from not only being a great customer, a partner of the banking system, to a true collaborator. The shape of our business, particularly our willingness to do very large investment-grade transactions, has made us an indispensable partner, and I do mean partner with the banking system.\nWhile some talk about the dancing of this being a great time for private credit, I've noticed that there's actually been dancing on both sides, both on the bank and the private credit side, as most banks put in an extraordinarily good quarter and are on their way to an extraordinarily good year.\nWe are also very symbiotic. Recall that we want the asset, but do not want what the bank typically wants, which is the customer. The bank wants the customer and typically does not want most of or any of the assets.\nIf I step back, the U.S. financial system is the envy of the world. We raised 50% of the world's capital. And part of the reason we are the envy of the world is the structure of our system. Banks have their role, and the investment marketplace has its role. Our system has all types of participants, but the vast, vast majority of those participants borrow short and invest long or have short-term money. Think of an open-ended mutual fund, which has daily liquidity. Many hedge funds, quarterly liquidity. Banks, daily liquidity at least on deposits.\nThe ability to bring institutional investors, retirement systems and insurance companies who have long-dated liabilities or long-dated assets to this market make them ideal partners for the short-dated capital of the banking system and the open-ended mutual funds.\nIn short, long-term locked-in liabilities are a source of stability and somewhat countercyclical for our financial system. It does not matter whether they are in funds, which are themselves very stable, or they are on retirement services balance sheet.\nTotality of the market from the investor side does no maturity transformation, has no access to the Fed window, does not benefit from U.S. government guarantee. And in our case, if you look at the retirement services balance sheet, we hold more Tier 1 capital and more Tier 2 capital than the vast majority of the top 10 banks in the U.S.\nWe do cash flow testing and scenario testing and provide a granularity to our portfolio that very few institutions, if any, can match. Our balance sheet is much more investment grade than the typical depository institution.\nIn short, our model is highly complementary to the banking system. We have never been more collaborative, and I expect this collaboration to increase as regulatory change gathers pace, both in the U.S., Europe and even the beginnings of regulatory change in Asia.\nAs we're nearing the end of summer, the team is in great shape and focused on executing the plan, we are sticking with no new toys. The upside from simply executing what's in front of us is incredibly strong.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President & Chief Investment Officer-Credit, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. Marc did a great job outlining our competitive positioning and our vision. And now I'll spend a few minutes translating how some of these important themes are playing throughout our firm with the investment environment, our investment performance and fundraising.\nIt's clear to us, and like many of you as well, the demand for private credit solutions has risen significantly as higher cost of capital have reduced the availability of traditional financing sources. We believe we're uniquely positioned to address this need for a few reasons: the scale of our capital resources, the speed of execution and the sophistication and creativity of our investment underwriting.\nWe are continuing to diligently build the largest alternative credit business in the industry, and our success to date is attributable to the expansive capabilities or what we call the Apollo toolbox. From corporate to sponsors and everything else in between, we can flexibly serve clients the need capital in a collaborative and bespoke manner. Across Apollo, we are helping healthy and growing companies who are hand strong by a limited open public market.\nThe second quarter was a prime example of this, a period that started with the fall from the regional bank crisis and ended with the markets feeling a bit more accommodating. As you might expect, we were particularly active and deployed nearly $35 billion of capital across our platform during the quarter. Much of this activity was driven by the yield business across our various sourcing channels, including financing solutions to corporates, which we call high-grade alpha; our origination platforms; as well as more traditional originations through strategies, such as large cap direct lending or leverage lending, CRE debt and a variety of structured credit CLO origination.\nIn an extremely active quarter, one of the signature financing solutions we provided was for a company Wolfspeed, a silicon carbide materials and device manufacturer. We led an investment group that provided a $1.25 billion secured note to the company as they undertook a significant growth initiative to meet accelerating demand. In this case, we work with Wolfspeed to structure a non-dilutive and flexible credit solution, which resulted in a unique win-win for the company's debt and equity investors.\nIn another example of capabilities that happened more recently, we partnered with our client and our partner, Air France KLM, one of the world's leading airlines. Following the execution of two successful innovative equity capital transactions with Air France, we announced last week that we have entered into an exclusive discussion to provide a EUR 1.5 billion capital solution through funds we manage and insurance affiliates to Air France-KLM's Flying Blue loyalty program.\nFlying Blue is one of Europe's leading loyalty programs, and this transaction would further bolster the company's already strong capital position. We are proud to say that this would be the third of a unique series of capital solutions to Air France-KLM, increasing our total capital support to the company to more than EUR 2.5 billion over the last 12 months.\nAmid our expanding opportunity set to originate investment-grade assets, debt origination activity across our 16 platforms remain strong. Notably, the acquisition of ATLAS SP Partners, the former CS business, the newest and largest asset-backed financing platform in our portfolio, is now fully closed with both client and employee retention rates exceeding our expectations. ATLAS has been extremely active in the market, executing over 30 securitizations since March and has substantial near-term pipeline. Some of the other larger platforms, namely MidCap and Wheels, are writing business at attractive spreads and generating ROEs in the mid- to high teens range.\nWhile we've been actively deploying capital, we continue to prioritize generating excess return per unit of risk. Investment performance remained strong and consistent in the quarter. Marc touched on the equity business, and I'd like to add that our direct origination, corporate credit and structured credit strategies portfolios appreciated 4%, 3% and 2%, respectively, in the second quarter, with each category outperforming indexes we benchmark in the same period.\nPerformance across hybrid strategies also have been solid, with hybrid value and our more opportunistic credit strategies each returning in excess of 4% for the quarter. Through a period of weaker public market performance last year and some instability in the first half of the year, driving strong investment performance over the past year has not been easy. Through that lens, it's worth highlighting a few strategies in particular. ADS, our nontraded BDC we manage; Redding Ridge, our CLO originator; Accord Plus, our multi-asset opportunistic credit offering; and Structured Credit Recovery Fund IV, have all outperformed relevant indexes over the last 12 months.\nTurning our focus to fundraising. We generated a record organic inflows of $35 billion, driven by strong momentum of Athene as well as a third-party asset management business. Across third party, we raised $15 billion in this specific quarter, with an additional $8 billion slipping into the first few weeks of this current quarter.\nThese -- the investments we made over the last 24 months to expand into adjacent season white space opportunities, such as secondaries and clean transition, and ones where we believe we have a strategic edge, such as third-party insurance and global wealth, have begun to pay off. Some of the areas where we've seen recent momentum include: third-party insurance, where we've developed a comprehensive client coverage network to ensure coordination across all parts of the firm, and establish a curated solution set for this fast-growing client type.\nWe think our expertise in managing retirement service balance sheets on both the asset and liability side is a meaningful differentiator in this market, and we're continuing to be very bullish on the long-term global growth opportunities in this business.\nNext is our sidecars initiative, where we raised over $4 billion across four sidecars so far this year. And sidecars enable institutional investors to invest alongside various investment strategies, mostly credit related, with greater scale and flexibility than they would otherwise achieve in a commingled fund. This type of structure is growing the trend and a great way to partner with more sophisticated investors. We have a strong pipeline in the sidecar opportunities across the global institutional investor base for the remainder of '23, supported with a dialogue of over 60 investors.\nAnd finally, capital raise from individual investors continues to be a strategic priority. Through the substantial investment we've made in the new product creation and distribution expansion, we built a diverse global wealth platform by asset class, product structure, distribution channel and geographic reach, all of which have helped migrate recent market-driven headwinds.\nWe're focused on continuing to broaden our retail-focused product suite and continue to expect launching one to two products each quarter into 2024. In terms of distribution expansion, we've made some notable progress for Apollo-aligned alternatives, AAA specifically, which is now offered on five bank platforms and has additional global U.S. and non-U.S. banks as well as RIAs and other wealth channels in the second half of the year.\nWe've also seen the monthly inflows into Apollo debt solutions. I mentioned our non-traded credit BDC we managed, ramp following the strong investment performance that has occurred over the last 24 months. All this progress makes us confident in our ability to raise more global wealth capital this year versus last, so ahead of budget.\nA final note on our capital solutions business, ACS, with fee revenue generation has been strong and stable over the last several quarters. This business, which is part of the flywheel, is clicking for a variety of reasons, including greater demand for bespoke financing solutions increasing integration and deployment across activity across the platform and more organized and effective coverage of a variety of corporate clients.\nThrough the first half of this year, we've syndicated over $6 billion across 100-plus institutional investors and are currently in the market with in excess of 30 transactions. As a bonus, we're reaching many investors who are new to the Apollo franchise through this indication, as many of our syndication partners have never invested in Apollo Fund prior. ACS has really been the integral part of our flywheel, and I want to emphasize one of Marc's themes from earlier is one of the ways we partner with banks across a broader financial landscape.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Martin to go through our financial results.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jim. I'll provide a bit more context on our financial results and outlook before we open it up for questions.\nSo as Marc and Jim have both referenced, our second quarter results completed a very strong first half and position us well to meet or exceed our 2023 financial targets. We've discussed how this year is one of execution, and you're seeing these efforts materialize in a material -- in a meaningful way.\nIn the Asset Management segment, FRE revenues for the first half of the year increased by 26% over the comparable period, FRE costs by 22% and overall FRE by 29%. The FRE margin increased by over 100 basis points as a consequence.\nIn Retirement Services, Athene's business continues to exceed all our estimates, with normalized SRE year-to-date growing in excess of 50% over the comparable period, aided by strong organic growth trends and an expanding net investment spread.\nFocusing on the second quarter, and starting with our Asset Management business, our record quarterly FRE was anchored by fee-related revenue growth of approximately 25% quarter-over-quarter. Within that, management fees increased almost 20% and capital solutions fees remained very strong and are tracking well ahead of our initial expectations for the full year.\nTotal fee-related expenses increased only modestly on a sequential basis, reflecting our commitment to disciplined expense management this year. Slowing growth in the comp expense line reflects a declining pace of hiring, with just over 100 net new Apollo employees added in the first half of the year, some 40% of the headcount growth in the same period last year. The combination of strong revenue growth and decelerating cost growth drove more than 200 basis points of FRE margin expansion quarter-over-quarter, bringing our FRE margin to 55% in the first half of the year.\nMoving to Retirement Services. Our record normalized SRE of $874 million increased 8% quarter-over-quarter, resulting in 166 basis points of normalized net spread. On a sequential basis, normalized net spread increased by 5 basis points due to higher floating rate income on the margin deployment spreads and yields on cash balances, net of higher new business and financing costs. Earnings accretion from a higher interest rate environment has exceeded our initial projections in the first 2 quarters of this year.\nLooking forward, we expect normalized SRE in the second half of the year to approximate the amount we owned in the first half, reflecting four primary components: one, continued strong organic growth at a $60 billion-plus annual piece; two, current interest rate conditions, both interest rate levels and curve shape; three, [indiscernible], the strategic third-party capital -- sidecar capital that we manage, supporting approximately 40% of total Athene inflows this year, including buying down origination from the first half; and four, a transaction with Venerable, which closed in July, where Venerable recaptured approximately $3 billion of older payout annuities. This transaction will be reflected as an outflow in the third quarter and will release capital for deployment into the strong new business environment. In connection with this transaction, we will recognize a benefit within SRE in the order of $50 million that we will treat as a onetime notable item and exclude from normalized SRE.\nCorresponding to this SRE profile, we expect normalized net spread to range between 160 and 165 basis points in the third and fourth quarters. This spread and earnings profile would result in approximately 30% year-over-year growth in normalized SRE in 2023.\nAssuming the current level and shape of the forward interest rate curve holds and ADIP supports a full pro rata share of Athene's incremental growth, we currently expect normalized SRE growth in 2024 to be in line with our longer-term guidance of low double-digit annualized growth.\nAs it relates to credit quality, Athene continues to experience a very low level of asset impairments across its portfolio, which aligns with its focus and high concentration in senior secured top of the capital structure credit.\nSince the beginning of 2020, a period that has included COVID-19, the Russia-Ukraine war, the regional bank crisis and the significant move higher in rates, Athene has incurred average annualized impairments of only 11 basis points, including just 2 basis points annualized in the most recent quarter, which is consistent with its long-term average of 9 basis points. Overall, we believe Athene's credit profile remains very strong and is well positioned to withstand a more difficult credit backdrop if one were to emerge.\nIn terms of capital allocation, we continue to assess how to best deploy free cash flow on a regular basis based on its highest returning use for shareholders. So far this year, we've allocated more capital towards share repurchases and strategic investments, given the long-term value we see in our stock price as well as the abundance of organic growth initiatives we have highlighted, which create revenue growth without the need for capital. We've deployed over $230 million of capital towards opportunistic share repurchases in the first half of 2023, in addition to immunizing employee stock issuance, with the resulting reduction in our share count over the past 2 quarters from 590 million to 595 million shares.\nAnd lastly, in response to some index eligibility questions we've received, it's worth noting that we reported positive GAAP earnings in the second quarter as well as cumulatively over the last 4 quarters. This is the final S&P index eligibility criteria that needs to be satisfied.\nIn terms of market taxonomy, Apollo is included within the financial services industry group according to the global industry classification standard. Reflecting our differentiated business mix, this classification places us within a geographically unique position relative to our direct alternative asset management peers in an underweight sector relative to the total market index.\nCombined with our leading governance characteristics, shareholder rates, earnings growth and long-term stock outperformance relative to the broader market, we believe that Apollo is well suited to be a core holding within investor portfolios.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded.\nThis call may contain forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements. Apollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures during this conference, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Please also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI will now turn the conference over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nManaging Director & Global Head of Investor Relations\n\nGreat. Thanks, Donna, and welcome again, everyone, to our call this morning. Earlier, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nFirst quarter results were strong and outperformed on a number of fronts, which we believe few others can say amid this backdrop of market volatility. We'll discuss further over the course of the call, but it's quite apparent that our purchase price matters approach is shining, allowing us to be very front-footed in executing our strategic objectives.\nThe proof is in the numbers. We reported record quarterly FRE of $397 million or $0.67 per share and normalized SRE of $811 million or $1.36 per share which together increased a remarkable 45% year-over-year. This powerful combination of fee and spread-related earnings, coupled with principal investing income, drove normalized adjusted net income of $942 or $1.58 per share in the first quarter, up 18% year-over-year, which is indicative of the type of consistent compound earnings growth we believe we can deliver to our shareholders.\nJoining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, Senior MD & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah, and good morning to all. Noah started down the path that I'd like to pick up on and really talk about the two different bets we have made versus our industry.\nThe first is an investment style bet. If you look across our $600 billion of AUM, you never have to worry about what strategy we're following. Every strategy is purchase price matters. Purchase price matters is grounded in fact, it's grounded in cash flow, it's grounded in business prospects. In the equity business, which Scott will talk about, it manifests itself in a maniacal focus on low purchase price for the quality of business that we are buying. In the credit market, it manifests itself at being top of the capital structure senior secured and floating rate.\nIf I tick through just this quarter's results and how purchase price matters plays into this amid this market dislocation and volatility, in our credit business, corporate credit, up 3%; structured credit, up 3%; direct origination, up 5%. I hosted a webcast earlier this month for ADS and Earl Hunt, 98% of the book senior secured, floating rate, originated in '22 and in '23, great years in which to originate.\nIf I turn to our equity business. Private equity, up 5%; European nonperforming loans through EPF, up 2%. Literally, across the board against a backdrop of instability, purchase price matters has paid off. It is really hard not to chase the hot dot of momentum and liquidity, especially when it goes on for so long against a backdrop of money printing, but that, in fact, is what we did and why we are where we are today.\nThe second bet I'd like to talk about goes back to our Investor Day in October 2021. We told you at the time that we were going to make a different bet than almost everyone else in our industry. And if you look across our industry, some have bet on real estate equity, some have bet on infrastructure, some have bet on subordinated debt in BDCs, some have been on growth. None of these in and of themselves are bad strategies. And in fact, some of our competitors execute against these strategies quite well. But these are not our strategies. The bet we told you at the time that we were making, if you looked at the vast majority of our AUM growth was on fixed income replacement. Think of that as private investment grade.\nWe made a really big push into private IG. Different than private credit is how private credit is normally talked about, which normally means levered loans and below investment grade. We are the investment-grade version. This quarter, our yield AUM was some $440 billion. And while that sounds quite large, and it is the largest of the private credit businesses, this is against the backdrop of a $40 trillion market that we estimate that we would otherwise be looking at. We are simply not significant in the market. And this is the best news. We are large, but not significant. That's a position I like to work from.\nThink about who we compete with and who we don't compete with. The press likes to frame private credit as an enemy of the banking system. In fact, if we think about our businesses and how we've positioned our private IG franchise, we want what the banks don't want and vice versa. So let me articulate that very clearly because I think it is important that it come out.\nAt the end of the day, we want the asset. We actually don't want the client because we are not prepared to cross-sell the client anything. We can't sell them equity, we can't sell them M&A, we can't sell them FX, derivatives, hedging, payments or credit cards. Ironically, for much of the banking system, the banking system wants the client, but not the asset, particularly in a world of market stress, where many banks, particularly regional banks are rethinking their strategy. I like where we sit in the food chain, I like what we're focused on, and I believe we are very well positioned.\nIn a time of market instability against a backdrop of a good entry point for credit at higher rates, the world is looking for safe yield. Insurance companies, including our own insurance company, Athene and Athora need safe yield. Competitive insurance companies need safe yield. Japanese banks need safe yield. Pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds need safe yield. Safe yield is, as I suggested, a potential replacement for fixed income, particularly publicly traded IG. Again, I like the hand we're playing and I like the bet we've made.\nIf I turn now to the two businesses. We told you for asset management that 2023 was going to be a year of execution and our recognition and achieving of all of the investments that we have made in prior years. In addition, we projected that we would grow some 25% year-over-year in FRE. I believe we will meet that metric. We are well on our track to doing it. We experienced $57 billion of inflows in the quarter, and we're on track to far surpass last year's $130 billion. I would expect a record or as look Scrip says near record of asset management fundraising in Q2. I believe purchase price matters resonates now more than ever, and I expect a very strong year.\nEqually interesting is capital deployment. Those who have followed closely over the past few weeks will see just how active we've been in the buyout business, a place we've had not had tremendous amounts of activity during the run-up in purchase price. Scott will walk you through the market activity. We have been equally busy in credit as this is a perfect entry point for what we do in private IG.\nAn important part of our growth today, and in fact, as I've said previously, a limiter of our growth is our capacity to originate assets that offer excess return per unit of risk. We do this both directly in terms of direct lending but we also do it via platforms. Think of platforms as businesses whose only business is the production of credit. Today, we have 16 platforms. Three of the largest are MidCap wheels and Atlas.\nJust to give you a feel for how business is progressing. MidCap did $3.5 billion of originations year-to-date. Normally, MidCap would produce about a 14% ROE. For the most recent period of time, MidCap's ROE approaches 17%. Wheels, which is our fleet lessor, has experienced no credit losses since the acquisition of Donlin. Again, wheels would normally produce about a 13% to 15% ROE. In the most recent period of time, wheels ROE is approaching 19%.\nAtlas integration well underway, I appreciate whoever wrote Atlas hugs versus Atlas shrugs. And in fact, I think the timing for the purchase of Atlas could not have been better. What is better than being a lender to other lenders during a time of market stress from a position of secured IG top of the capital structure, floating rate with wide spreads. We have a tremendous amount of work to do there, but we are very excited about what we've seen today.\nIn short, the origination business is better because of the market stress. We are filling in where the market now is suffering certain lapses, and we are earning higher spread, we are able to underwrite with a negative credit mindset, we are able to protect the downside, most of what we're doing is top of the capital structured floating rate and senior secured.\nLet me turn a bit to our capital solutions business. In prior quarters, I've given you a little bit of our philosophy. We want generally in capital solutions, particularly in our debt business 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. As we have become an increasingly large originator and an increasingly diverse originator, this business is becoming a recurring business. The vast majority of this business and the growth I expect in the future will be around this philosophy of we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. We are becoming people's favorite stop to fill out what they need in terms of yield in their IG book without compromising credit during a period of market stress and concerned about the economic future.\nSave the best for last, retirement services and Athene. 2022 was the best year in Athene's history, record inflows in earnings. 2023, I expect to be better and has started off even stronger. Every metric worked in Q1. Normalized spread of 160 basis points, new business priced very attractively, leading market share, very strong sidecar capital formation, which we will update you as we have further closings. In short, inflows were $12 billion in the first quarter, roughly about the same as 2022. And I see this a little bit as the golden age of annuities. Consumers simply prefer 5% to 2%. It's not more complicated than that.\nWe built and have continued to build our international insurance relationships. We now have three significant reinsurance relationships in the Japanese market, and I expect that to be five before year-end. I expect that we will generate some $5 billion a year annually of flow reinsurance from this market. And I expect this year in terms of flow reinsurance to be the single best year in our history, somewhere between $9 billion and $10 billion of flow.\nPension activity and pension buyout activity with higher rates is ramping. We recently announced an $8 billion solution for a blue chip client, and I expect second quarter inflows at Athene to be north of $17 billion. In short, we're on track to exceed last year's record annual inflows of $48 billion.\nFor the quarter, normalized spread was $811 million. This was, as we've set internally a bit of a Goldilocks scenario. Spreads were wider than expected, rates were higher than expected. We kept more business in-house, meaning that we did not give as much to the sidecar. That will correct itself in the second half of the year but will result in higher earnings for the year. Atlas was a net positive. In short, it all worked. In addition, as I'm sure Martin will walk through, conservative reserving methodology led to positive LDTI adjustments.\nI think as we step back, we should not multiply $811 million by 4. But relative to the 20% growth in SRE that we had projected at year-end, I would expect us to have upside to that target. That is even holding some $12.7 billion of cash at 3/31. We positioned ourselves defensively. We positioned ourselves to take advantage of widespread, and now we are taking advantage of widespread. When your book is in good shape, you are able to take advantage of opportunities offered in the marketplace.\nBefore I turn it over to Scott, and I'm anxious to turn it over to Scott because he has lots to say, I thought I would spend a minute on surrenders. Given the activity we've seen in the banking sector, we've received lots of questions about how this impacts or, in fact, does not impact the retirement services industry. Let me start with the punch line, this does not impact the retirement services industry. People who own annuities are saving for retirement. This is not money they think is accessible. When they do surrender or move it, they're typically moving to another policy. Otherwise, they incur tax burden and tax efficiency.\nFinally, from our point of view, we run our book and we invest against long-term locked-in liabilities. 80% of our portfolio is nonsurrenderable or is protected by market value adjustments and surrender charges. This is not the first time we've confronted these issues. We've been doing this for a long time.\nIn the materials that we put out this morning, I asked the team to put out a table that really goes through the four different types of outflows that we experienced in terms of our book. The first, and I'm referring to a table that is in the materials, the first is what we call maturity driven or contractual outflows. This is exactly what you -- what it sounds like. We enter into an FABN, it has a maturity. We originate a MIGA, it has a maturity. Those numbers are fully predictable, and you will see them from quarter-over-quarter. And I know when Athene does its deep dive call, you will see not just what has happened, but you will see Athene's projection for the next few quarters.\nThe next few categories, what I'll call, policy-driven outflows or policyholder driven outflows, the largest of which is income-oriented withdrawals. Recall that for retirees, when they get to a certain age, they are required to take minimum amounts out of their policies. Those minimum amounts of the policies are, in fact, what come out on a planned and on a budgeted basis. We then are left with two other types of withdrawals from those out of surrender charge where we would expect to see more withdrawals and for those in surrender charge where we would expect to see very few withdrawals. In fact, that is what we are experiencing.\nIf I look at the weeks surrounding Silicon Valley Bank and the run on Silicon Valley Bank, when I compare call center volume, surrender activity or any other form of activity, simply no change. This business continues to be very, very predictable. We are matched in terms of duration, we are matched in terms of interest rates. And it gives us the confidence to invest against these liabilities and earn spread, which we then lock in for long periods of time. In short, 2023 for us is a year of execution and one where I believe both the strategy of focusing on fixed income replacement and the investment dynamic of purchase price matters will pay off.\nFor us, there is so much upside for executing the base business plan but the simple shorthand for what we intend to do in 2023 is no new toys. The bar is extremely high to do something new given the opportunity in front of us. The three original growth drivers origination, capital solutions and global wealth are well on track. Scott will detail the next 6. We're driving toward operating leverage this year. It is a key point of our focus. It occupies a lot of our mind share. We achieved a little of it this quarter, but there's more to come. Today, we end the year or we end the quarter at $600 billion of AUM, $500 billion of that in yield and hybrid. Team is in great shape, momentum is good.\nAnd with that, I'd like to pass it to Scott.\n\nScott M. Kleinman\n\nCo-President & Lead Partner of Private Equity, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nThanks, Marc. This is certainly an exciting time to be in our business. As you can see from our results, purchase price matters is succeeding in this environment as demonstrated by strong investment performance in several strategies including flagship private equity, direct origination and opportunistic credit portfolios. We believe we're one of the few firms who can play offense in these periods of uncertainty, which was quite clear by the level of deployment activity in the first quarter. .\nWe signed four private equity deals since our last earnings call, and our current pipeline of opportunities is about 3x a year ago and growing. We announced the first acquisition from our latest flagship fund just last fall. And since then, Fund X has invested or committed approximately $6 billion of capital.\nThe strength of our relationships and ability to structure complex financing solutions are really what set us apart when traditional funding sources are limited. For example, in the wake of market turmoil surrounding bank failures in March, we announced an $8 billion acquisition of chemical company Univar Solutions, an industry vertical in which we have long-standing expertise. And just last week, we announced the $5 billion acquisition of aluminum products manufacturer Arconic by our private equity funds.\nOur hybrid business is also thriving in this backdrop of higher rates, earnings pressure and lack of appetite for bank-led syndicated credit. With corporates focused on deleveraging in the face of upcoming debt maturities and sponsors seeking exit alternatives amid tepid IPO markets, we're seeing increased demand for private market solutions via structured equity and credit. Accordingly, our investment pipeline for hybrid value is robust and we expect the deployment environment to remain attractive for quite some time.\nWith the dislocation we've seen in the banking sector over the past couple of months, we've been leaning into a wide range of investing opportunities across private credit platforms. We believe the breadth of our platform and the depth of our expertise puts us in a unique position to provide creative, flexible capital solutions to a range of borrowers, especially to those that may not be as widely serviced by traditional lenders.\nWe're able to generate a low double-digit yield for first lien debt backed by good collateral. As a recent example, we agreed to invest EUR 1 billion in a portfolio of high-quality assets controlled by Benovia, a leading global residential real estate company, which provided a long-term cost-effective solution for the company. Inclusive of this investment, we've originated over $18 billion of high-grade alpha transactions since the start of 2022. The pipeline of these types of high-quality attractive investments is already significant today. And longer term, we think the opportunity to gain market share is even greater and spans an even wider range of asset classes from corporate lending to all sorts of asset-backed finance.\nAs it relates to fundraising trends, the long-term secular tailwinds driving growth in allocations to private markets remain intact, and momentum across our platform is strong. While recent market disruption has caused some observable shifts in market behavior, particularly with U.S. and European institutional investors. Investors based in the Middle East and Asia actually turned up their focus and seem to have viewed it as an opportune time to allocate capital. Individual investors were also quite level-headed and we saw no material increase in redemptions from global wealth offerings and a steady build in new capital in the first quarter.\nOn the product level, fundraising trends in traditional private equity are still facing some headwinds, but with a total of approximately 30 comingled and perpetual capital vehicles expected to be in market this year. We still feel confident in our ability to raise more capital than we did in 2022. We expect second quarter inflows to be particularly robust given the line of sight we have to several sizable mandates and fund closes in the near-term pipeline as Marc mentioned.\nOn Fund X specifically, we've received total commitments of approximately $16 billion through the end of March. Throughout the marketing process, we've experienced solid demand from repeat investors off the back of very strong Fund IX performance, which appreciated 23% in 2022 and 8% in the first quarter.\nLooking forward, we have a great queue of investors in the final stages of documentation and currently expect total commitments to be in the low $20 billion range with a final close expected over summer. The amount of capital positions us with one of the largest funds in the industry and with the flexibility to lean into a range of interesting opportunities in today's markets.\nWe're also making meaningful progress on the six additional growth initiatives we highlighted in February. These six areas: AAA, Athene Altitude, third-party insurance, sidecars, clean transition and sponsor and secondary solutions position us to take -- tackle huge white space opportunities. These initiatives are natural extensions of our three key growth pillars and therefore, play to our strengths including complex product structuring, proprietary asset origination and, of course, generating excess return per unit of risk. As these businesses scale over the next few years, we expect our third-party fundraising will grow in size, diversity and consistency.\nHere are some highlights. For AAA, an innovative core equity replacement vehicle, we're continuing to broaden distribution to both institutional and global wealth clients. In addition to the 40-plus approvals in place with independent distributors, we have a handful of new wirehouse and bank relationships geared to come online in the coming months, and conversations with family offices are also ramping up. Just last week, we announced the launch of a Luxembourg-based product platform that provides individual investors in Europe, Asia and Latin America, access to two investment strategies, including AAA in their local currency with lower investment minimums than traditional alternative product offerings. The proposition of equity-like returns with downside protection is proving especially attractive in this highly volatile public market backdrop, and we remain very bullish on the long-term outlook for this fund.\nFor Athene Altitude, an innovative tax-deferred annuity wrap product, we've received positive initial feedback from several retail distribution partners. We have a few firms in late stages of due diligence and expect to launch the product more broadly in the coming months.\nWithin clean transition, we recently announced the launch of Apollo Clean Transition Capital or ACT Capital, with $4 billion to deploy into yield and hybrid investments in support of corporate transition to clean energy. Meaningful seed investment from a strategic partner and our aligned pools of capital should enable us to build a diversified portfolio and investment track record from which we can eventually raise additional third-party capital. We also expect to launch the Apollo Clean Transition private equity strategy in the third quarter, which will continue to expand the scope and scale of our activity in the sustainable investing area.\nAnd lastly, we began raising third-party capital for our inaugural equity secondaries vehicle in the second quarter, which is part of our Sponsor and Secondary Solutions, or S3 business. As a reminder, we began investing for this strategy last fall with a chunk of seed capital from long-term strategic -- from a long-term strategic partner and AAA to help anchor the broader fundraise. Deployment activity has been strong since then, and the vehicle has committed over $1 billion of capital in transactions led by S3.\nCombined with our three strategic growth pillars, these next six initiatives provide significant runway for growth. We look forward to providing updates as these exciting initiatives develop.\nSo with that, I'll turn the call over to Martin to go through our financial results in more detail.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So our asset management and retirement services businesses clearly continue to create recurring and growing income streams that demonstrate stability through significant market disruptions like we saw in the first quarter. Almost 60% of our assets under management is comprised of perpetual capital, with the remaining concentrated in long-term locked-up structures. And the funding source for our retirement services businesses, as Marc highlighted, is highly persistent with predictable long-term liabilities. In [ bland ], this creates a very resilient earnings profile particularly when considering pressures on the broader financial sector.\nWithin our asset management Business, first quarter FRE increased by 28% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in both management fees and capital solutions fees. These increases reflect the approximate $100 million of asset management inflows over the last 12 months as well as the broadening of our capital solutions capabilities as several of the substantial growth investments we've made over the past couple of years are translating into top line revenue.\nFee-generating inflows in the first quarter included $20 billion related to an investment management agreement with Atlas, for which we'll earn a 10 basis point fee. Fee-related expenses grew by 20% -- 26% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter. After several years of investment in our platform, the pace of headcount growth and the rate of increase in noncompensation costs will decelerate materially in 2023, making 2022 an inflection point for FRE cost growth. Altogether, as Marc suggested, we expect to deliver some operating leverage this year while targeting 25% FRE growth.\nMoving to retirement services. Athene's performance to begin the year was stellar and exceeded our expectations. Part of the outperformance reflects a more favorable investing environment while part reflects more episodic gains or timing benefits. We reported normalized net spread of approximately 160 basis points in the first quarter, the highest level the business has seen in a decade. In the first part of the year, the investing environment was very attractive and we're able to deploy incoming flows at higher on the margin yields than we anticipated. The weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases exceeded the BBB corporate bond index by more than 150 basis points in the first quarter versus only approximately 25 basis points in all of 2022. The higher rate environment also drove net spread accretion from Athene's floating rate position and cash holdings.\nEpisodic or timing benefits in the quarter included fees related to financing arrangements for the Atlas transaction and some elevated fees related to certain fixed rate loans, SRE benefits in advance of the second vintage of strategic third-party sidecar capital, assuming its proportionate share of inflows from the first half of 2023 early in Q3, and we continue to expect sidecar capital to support approximately 40% of total Athene inflows this year in aggregate. And then lastly, we expect an approximate $3 billion outflow in the third quarter related to the recapture of some older annuity liabilities by one of our affiliated partners. This will free up capital for Athene to redeploy in attractive investing environment while providing portfolio diversification for our affiliated partner, similar to the Catalina transaction in the fourth quarter of last year.\nDue to the new insurance accounting standard commonly referred to as LDTI, last week, Athene recast SRE results for 2022. These new requirements drove a favorable impact to normalized SRE of $220 million in 2022, which was entirely reflected within cost of funds and translates to 12 basis points of normalized net spread benefit. We expect this benefit to persist in 2023 and the years beyond, although at an approximate 10 basis point in normalized spread terms. This effectively increases our normalized net spread target for 2023 from 135 to 140 basis points, up by 10 basis points to 145 to 150.\nIn addition, there are a few other moving pieces that should impact the outlook for SRE this year. First, given the deployment opportunities we're seeing in the market today, we do expect to put new money to work at better yields than we had originally forecast. And then -- but on the other hand, as Marc described, we prudently increased Athene's cash balance this quarter to provide an extra layer of stability amid heightened market volatility in March.\nNormalizing for the benefit of LDTI, considering an improved deployment backlog with offsets from higher cash balances, we expect normalized SRE to slightly exceed $3 billion this year, with an estimated normalized net spread range of 150 to 155 basis points.\nLet me spend a moment on capital allocation. We expect our free cash flow to be utilized to fund the base dividend, return incremental capital to shareholders through opportunistic buybacks and dividend increases and to invest in strategic growth. In any given quarter or year, we determine how to best allocate capital based on its highest returning use.\nWe use the following framework in making this determination. For the dividend, we aim to generate a yield in line with or better than the S&P 500, which is currently yielding approximately 2% today versus 2.8%. For opportunistic share repurchases, we target at least a high teens IRR over the medium term and that's signaling closer to 20% at current trading multiples. For strategic growth investments, we underwrite a target return equal to or better than opportunistic share repurchases with the potential for strategic upside benefits. And all of these HoldCo capital users are weighed against growing Athene. Even without using any third-party sidecar capital from ADIP growing Athene is very compelling as it's generating an estimated low 20% pretax ROE today. This return profile is further enhanced with increasing utilization of ADIP.\nIn the first quarter specifically, we deployed $160 million of capital for opportunistic share repurchases, and our current orientation is to spend less on strategic investments given the large number of organic growth initiatives under development and the high bar in which we are using to consider these new opportunities. As we communicated last quarter, we expect to be a buyer of our stock on a more consistent basis as we move through our 5-year plan.\nIn conclusion, our financial results in the first quarter have positioned us very well to execute on our strategic and financial goals for the year. We're busier than ever, we're highly focused on the significant opportunity in front of us. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions)\nThis conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which does not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.\nApollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nMD & Global Head of IR, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Donna, and a special thanks to a couple of members of the research community who selected 2 of the 3 songs for our hold music jukebox that was playing before we got on the line today. Earlier this morning, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nIn short, we're very pleased to deliver a strong set of results for 2022 that featured record fee-related earnings of $1.4 billion or $2.36 per share and record normalized spread-related earnings of $2.3 billion or $3.88 per share. This strong combination of fee- and spread-related earnings, alongside principal investing income, drove total adjusted net income of $3.1 billion or $5.21 per share for the full year.\nJoining me this morning to discuss these results and our positive outlook on the business in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah, and good morning to all. 2022 was a transformational year for the firm. At the end of 2021, we held our first Investor Day, and we set out our 5-year targets and laid out what we needed to accomplish internally to achieve those targets. End of 2021 seems like a lifetime ago or at least a Fed regime or 2 ago. However, in 2022, we met or exceeded those targets. Record FRE of $1.4 billion was in line with our target and record normalized SRE of $2.3 billion was meaningfully ahead of target.\nAs important, and as we suggested, we restarted the growth engine. Inflows in 2021 were $75 billion. Inflows this year, $128 billion. Inflows for '23 will be higher. We expect a record year of capital raising in 2023. As I've often cautioned, capital raising is the reward for good performance. It is not actually the goal that we set out.\nAUM ended the year at $548 billion or ex rates and FX would have been about $565 billion, all meaningfully -- a meaningful progress against our 5-year targets. Recall that at Investor Day, we laid out 3 key objectives or 3 key pillars that we had to focus on to achieve our plan: global wealth, origination and capital solutions. Global wealth had a really strong 2022. We ended the year with approximately $30 billion of AUM in our global wealth segment, including $6 billion of capital raised in 2022, accounting for and implementing successfully the Griffin acquisition during the mid-part of the year. We are on track to meet or exceed our $50 billion target at the end of 2026.\nWhen we laid out these targets, we had 0 perpetual projects -- products in the marketplace. By year-end, we expect 9 perpetual products in the marketplace. In short, we've had tremendous receptivity to our product and to our franchise in the global wealth community. Our goal here, like the goal elsewhere in our organization, is not to be the biggest. We will not necessarily be the fastest growing. We will be seen and are seen as the innovator in this marketplace, showing the global wealth community the kinds of products that they have never seen before and addressing the unique needs of this interesting constituency.\nOrigination, volume totaled north of $100 billion on a 12-month basis. We now have 15 platforms, including 7 platforms, which were new additions during 2022. You will hear later in the call the most recent addition, Atlas, formerly known as the Credit Suisse Securitized Products group. We are definitely on track here to meet or exceed our $150 billion annual target at the end of 2026.\nHaving a steady source of unique credit production every year really enables us to power our business, to make the kind of projections and predictability and the client commitments that are necessary for us to grow. This is good for our FRE business in that it powers our third parties, particularly in private credit, and it is especially good for our SRE business in that we produce reliable amounts of excess spread, particularly in investment-grade private credit.\nI'm going to spend a second just on that term. We hear the term private credit a lot. We actually have no idea what the words private credit mean. They are just 2 words that will follow each other. What we have focused on in our platform and what we have done uniquely is to create a source of private investment grade credit. Very few people, very few organizations have that capability. This is in addition to the strength that the franchise has always had in more generic private credit. Jim will spend a lot of time on this in his remarks and is a very important part of our franchise going forward and a huge differentiator.\nThe third pillar that we set out is our capital solutions business. Capital solutions in 2021 was approximately $250 million of annual revenue, and we suggested that, at the end of 2026, we wanted that to be north of $500 million of annual revenue. In 2022, we exceeded $400 million of annual revenue. Gives me great confidence that we are on track to meet or exceed the 5-year projections that we laid out at the beginning of 2021.\nThe team has been fully built out globally. We have a massive pipeline that we executed on partially in 2022 and will carry over into the first quarter of 2023, which Martin will touch on. And most important is to help understand and help explain the ecosystem that we are creating. 15 platforms, 15 companies whose only job is to produce credit wake up every day and do what they do. They produce credit. We, as a diversified buyer of credit for our own balance sheet in SRE, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing.\nAnd so what that means, we are creating every day credit that needs to be syndicated into the marketplace. Some of that goes into funds or to SMAs of clients who have previously come to the Apollo platform. The rest of it goes into our capital solutions business. This is a strategic imperative for us and does 2 very interesting things.\nOne, as we place credit with third parties, we earn fees. Earnings fees is a fundamental part of our business model. But as important, they are expanding our ecosystem. We have done business in the alternative community with investors with circa 3,500 counterparties for a long period of time. This is an opportunity with unique product with side-by-side, with aligned product, with recurring product for our capital solutions group to go out and build new relationships. Sometimes those new relationships will result in one-off transactions, which is just fine. But oftentimes, those new relationships will open up clients' eyes as to what we can do, and we will turn those into SMAs and recurring revenues. This is an ecosystem that is picking up tremendous traction, and the team here is doing an unbelievable job.\nAs excited as I am about the '22 performance against the 3 initiatives, I now want to turn to Athene who had just an awesome year. Inflows at Athene on an organic basis were some $48 billion. Athene was the #1 purveyor of annuities in the United States despite not being represented in a lot of annuity markets. New business was put on the books in the fourth quarter at about 145 basis points of spread versus about 120 basis points of spread for the full year. Both of those targets are meaningfully ahead of what we would consider normal levels of business.\n2023, I believe, will also continue to be very strong. I doubt it will continue at the same levels that we saw in the fourth quarter, but new business is being put on the books very profitably.\nAthene's alts portfolio, which as many of you also understand, forms the foundation for AAA, our retail product, our equity replacement product, was up 10% during the year versus the S&P benchmark, which was down almost 20%. Very strong performance and an indication that Athene and AAA are doing something other than buying and providing clients with market data.\nAs we step back and we think about our positioning in this marketplace, one of the questions we asked the team, who is the fortress balance sheet in our industry. And the answer is we are the fortress balance sheet in our industry. We are A+ across all 3 agencies. We ended the year $2 billion of excess capital and more than $1 billion ahead of S&P AA.\nSome years ago, we introduced was the first sizable reinsurance sidecar for our industry, affectionately known as ADIP 1 with $3.25 billion of capital. That sidecar has now been nearly fully deployed. And yesterday or earlier this morning, we announced the first closing for ADIP 2 of some $2 billion, and we expect that ADIP 2 will be larger than ADIP 1 and further that ADIP 2 will take an increased share of the new business that Athene puts on the books.\nThis is good all around. This is good for Athene from a capital generation point of view and a capital efficiency point of view, even though it will mean that some of their assets are now -- essentially belong to investors and they will realize the benefits of SRE growth. It is good for FRE, and it is good for our origination franchises, creating additional capacity that needs to be filled, which will further spur the flywheel of our capital solutions and other businesses. In short, an amazing year for Athene.\nOur success in this business of retirement solutions has not gone unnoticed. By some measure, there are now north of 100 asset management entities or insurance entities who have become asset managers, pursuing a strategy similar to that which Athene started on 13 years ago. To be successful in this business and to understand where we sit relative to the rest of the business, I believe there are 4 things that contribute to success. First is capital, massive amounts of capital in an industry that has not been able to raise capital. The second is an ability every day to create investment-grade spread. This is something a skill set that is not traditionally resonant within the alternative industry or, quite frankly, within traditional asset management. It is a skill that we have built up.\nThe third is a really attractive cost structure. You need scale because, ultimately, spread is a function of your net interest margin, but it's also a function of a very efficient cost base. And finally, you need a very attractive cost of funds. If your cost of funds is low because you're efficient and because your products are well designed, you do not need to take investment risk to earn good returns. And if you're a good investor, returns can actually be quite high. Everything goes in reverse if your cost of funds is very high.\nWhat we are watching in our industry is the haves like Athene, where we have some $48 billion of organic origination versus the have-nots, the market entrants, who, in fact, are paying up for inorganic blocks at very high cost of funds, which also are very expensive to administer on a hope that they will get to scale. I believe that the vast majority of new entrants, although not all, will not be successful, and we'll learn a very expensive lesson along the way.\nWe are also in a period of time where the increased activity by asset managers has resulted in increased regulatory interest in what we are doing. We have spent 13 years creating the kinds of regulatory dialogues and transparency and putting out a best-in-class set of standards. We are, to my knowledge, not just a fortress balance sheet but the most transparent of the companies. We regularly published stress tests, although we are not required. We regularly publish details of assets that we are not required. We regularly go back and forth with respect to our reinsurance so that people understand there is no \"arbitrage\" between the U.S. regulatory standard and the Bermuda regulatory standard.\nAll of the things I've just mentioned have not -- are not generally followed by many, although some marks the good actors of the new entrants. What you will see in 2023 on our part is an increased foot forward to help lead this regulatory dialogue to make sure that we get to the right place with appropriate transparency and appropriate oversight. This is an amazing business that is driven by powerful trends, but it is also a business of promises to retirees. We expect that we will be included among a group of companies as internationally active insurance groups at some point in 2023, giving us an opportunity and a seat at the table to participate in shaping the regulatory future for our industry, which is changing very fast.\nSRE for us is the flip side of FRE. The ability to generate safe yield is something that very few people have. Who needs safe yield? Retirees need safe yield. Pension funds replacing a portion of their fixed income need safe yield. Banks need safe yield. Japanese insurance companies and international investors need safe yield. The world is short safe yield. And we are very good at producing it.\nSo when we produce it in an asset that is short, we want to maximize the profitability of our capability. And then that's why I say that SRE is the flip side of that. We are an FRE for the safe yield we produce for third parties and for Athene. But then, on top of that, we earn SRE, or spread-related earnings, by matching the safe yield with long-term sticky liabilities.\nIn 2022, a number of other forms of so-called permanent capital went in reverse. 2022 was an awesome year for Athene.\nLet me step back and now return to a higher level view of our business. Our business, as I've suggested previously, exists, and our industry exists to provide investors excess return per unit of risk. It does not exist for us to grow or for us to pursue that which we want. We are fundamentally responding to investor needs.\nFortunately, we have very strong tailwinds as a firm and as an industry for the need for income, excess return per unit of risk. Our business strategy is being driven and growth is being driven in areas where we believe we can continue to produce excess return per unit of risk. Our business is guided not just by excess return by unit of risk but by an aligned investing philosophy. The combination of Athene and Athora and our balance sheet side by side with investors ensures investors at all points in time that we are fully aligned with them.\nFinally, as I'm sure Jim will pivot on to, purchase price matters. The purchase price matters strategy is very hard to pursue in a risk on everything rally. Nonetheless, we did that, and the reward for doing that was certainly available and shown in 2022. But I believe the positioning we've taken out and our industry tailwinds really bode well for us going forward.\n2023 will be a very good year for Apollo. We are on offense. We have $50 billion of dry powder across the platform. We deployed $160 billion in 2022. Fundamentally, we do better when markets are uncertain and when there is uncertainty in the economy. We expect FRE and SRE in 2023 to be more than -- up more than 20% over 2022, as I'm sure Martin will detail in his remarks.\nBut we also have an amazing opportunity in our business to really focus on operating leverage. We have enough in front of us with the initiatives that are currently on our plate to not just meet our 2023 goals but to meet our 5-year targets. Alongside the 3 pillars of global wealth origination and capital solutions, we have added a number of growth initiatives, and I will not steal Jim's (inaudible) thunder as he lays out the things that are in front of us to focus on.\nSuffice it to say, 2023 will be a year of execution. We will return the business to operating leverage in 2023 and again in 2024. The team here feels great. There's tremendous momentum. We are incredibly engaged and energized. And at the end of the day, what makes this a great place is the people. This is a group of hard-working charitable people where the vast majority of the team, 93%, are involved in our giving programs, and our job is to be the single best place to be a partner in the financial services industry.\nAnd with that, I want to thank the employees for an amazing year and the investors and analysts for all the time you've given us to understand what we're trying to do.\nAnd with that, let me turn it over to Jim.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President of Apollo Asset Management,Inc & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. As you've heard us say before, one of our core tenets is excess return per unit of risk. After 12-plus years of low rates and relatively free money, the best investors will begin to reveal themselves, and strong investment performance is the foundation of our business, and we take our responsibility to provide differentiating returns to our clients quite seriously.\nAs we look out to 2023, we believe this is a particularly good time for Apollo to generate excess return. While other managers may be in a defensive position, we have been patiently waiting for this type of environment, and we're confident there will be meaningful opportunities to deploy capital amid a heightened period of volatility and, candidly, a foggy capital markets backdrop.\nMarc provided a high-level update on our 3 key growth pillars, and I'd like to deep dive for a moment into origination. As we addressed at Investor Day a short -- 16 months ago, a large portion of what we do is this high-grade fixed income replacement end of the market. Central to our strategy is the ability to originate a recurring supply of these durable assets. And one of the primary ways we do, though, is through these platforms, real operating businesses within a variety of industries.\nPlatform origination is clearly a differentiated way to originate this investment-grade assets at scale, which is needed to grow our retirement services business profitably and increasingly to the third-party accounts that want the same help in their portfolio. Importantly, however, rather than expand holdco balance sheet resources, the capital used to purchase these origination platforms can be sourced by the normal course purchasing power of Athene's alt portfolio as well as AAA.\nAt year-end, our platform ecosystem was producing approximately $35 billion of annual volume and generating about 425 basis points of excess spread versus equivalent IG benchmarks. We've assembled this portfolio of 16 platforms across asset classes and sectors, which have been acquired through a variety of funds we manage and also built organically, and we're now focused on scale execution of those. Metaphorically speaking, we pay the tuition to develop this important capability at scale, which we think is a great competitive advantage or a moat.\nThis advantage will expand following this week's or yesterday's announcement of the CS Securitized Products Group platform, which has been renamed Atlas SP. This platform is a best-in-class asset backed warehousing business, really a finance company of finance companies, with an extensive network of clients and amazing 20-year track record of negligible losses.\nThe industry-leading team at Atlas is excited to be working with Apollo, and through the closing process, it's become clear that the variety of counterparties also want to work with the Apollo ecosystem. Many investors are reaching out to us as they expand their private credit exposure from direct lending into a broad base of asset-based finance capabilities. We think this is the largely untapped part of the $40 trillion IG fixed income replacement market. And simply put, we believe the opportunity to source resilient yield in asset-based finance is where sponsor finance was and private credit was 10 years ago.\nIn addition to the 3 growth pillars, we've begun to execute on 6 additional strategic initiatives that we've mentioned past. We've organized our efforts and resources around these initiatives, and now '23 is focused on execution. In this competitive fundraising landscape, our innovative and differentiated product offerings, we believe, will stand out, and we're seeing early indications of those facts.\nAnd I'll mention a few here. We continue to be very optimistic on the growth of AAA or Apollo Aligned Alternatives. We're broadening the distribution system domestically through additional bank platform and a variety of other independent channels as well as globally to Asia and Europe. To note, we're launching our European product platform in the coming months, designed to offer a full suite of options to individuals in Europe, and AAA will be the first product available on that platform.\nWe've also begun marketing Athene Altitude. This is a product designed to offer a range of Apollo managed funds across the risk-reward spectrum but to do so in a tax-efficient vehicle. While still early, we raised $300 million in the fourth quarter from our first client, a third-party insurance firm to invest in AAA through Athene Altitude.\nAdditionally, a couple of key organic initiatives in nascent asset classes are building scale. Our sponsor and secondary solutions platform named S3 has gained momentum following a cornerstone investment from ADIA last year. This overall business has committed or deployed over $13 billion of capital since 2020, mainly in fund finance, but has committed over $1 billion into equity and credit secondaries over the past 6 months. And we expect formerly to launch fundraising for an equity secondaries fund in the second quarter and opportunistically raise capital for our credit secondaries fund ahead of a dedicated run raise in 2024.\nWe're seeing a similar story in our clean transition franchise. Since launching our sustainable investing platform about a year ago, we've committed or deployed over $6 billion of capital into these investments. And later this month, we will be adding a dedicated team for climate and infrastructure yield to further boost our origination capabilities across the board. And we anticipate launching fundraising for clean transition finance and opportunistic vehicles in the latter half of this year.\nNext, we're bringing the investment toolkit that has made Athene and Athora successful to others in the retirement services industry. Our proprietary origination volume has grown, as Marc said, in consistency and diversity. And now we're reaching a point we can distribute more of these assets to third parties who have the same fundamental needs. We are building on a strong foundation of existing relationships in that area. And over the next year, we aim to raise over $10 billion of capital from others in the retirement services space. And finally, we're replicating the successful side car structure we've had with MidCap and ADIP in a variety of other areas in our business and to do so in a simplified, cost-effective manner to really scale and partner with the investors, as Marc mentioned, in the Apollo ecosystem.\nTurning to our broader fundraising activities apart from these new 6 initiatives, our momentum on a variety of fronts is strong. In asset management, we had strong inflows and included $46 billion of third-party fundraising, which doubled 2021 levels. In the fourth quarter, specifically, total fundraising of $9 billion was driven by new capital for Athora and incremental capital for a variety of drawdown fundraises, co-investment capital and, in our global wealth, including $800 million for AAA.\nLooking to '23, we expect to a record amount of capital from third-party investors, exceeding the strong levels achieved last year, and we're already in the market with a range of drawdown funds, including our fourth vintage European Principal Finance, our third infrastructure fund; as Marc mentioned, ADIP 2; and certainly, our tenth vintage of our flagship private equity fund; additionally, a variety of funds and managed accounts across the yield strategies that are currently raising capital or will be later in the year, similar to our Accord series as well as a variety of perpetual products, as Marc mentioned, in the global wealth channel, including the nontraded BDC, nontraded REIT and 2 interval funds.\nRegarding Fund X fundraising, I'm pleased to report that we are experiencing broad support from the existing shareholder investor base and gaining traction with new investors, especially from non-U.S. regions and the global wealth channel. Through January, we've received commitments approximately $15 billion. And with congested dynamics in the market, it's difficult to predict the ultimate size of the fund and exact timing. However, we expect to close on the majority of incremental commitments in the back half of the second quarter, and we believe the fund will land within striking distance of our target.\nComing into the new year, we believe investors are focusing on managers with healthy portfolios who have less exposure to growth-oriented sectors, which certainly bodes well for our long-tenured strategy. It's worth noting that our private equity fund portfolios outperformed the S&P by over 25% in 2022. And our flagship PE fund, Fund IX, appreciated 22% during the year. Revenue and EBITDA trends remain strong in those portfolios, up mid-teens percent year-over-year across the broader fund portfolios.\nHistorically, and as you've heard, we've generated some of our best returns for investors amid market downturns, and we're one of the few funds with a complete product toolbox. Our proprietary financing capabilities have allowed us to execute transactions when the traditional markets are more restricted as they are now. And our flexible mandate across corporate carve-outs, public to privates and distressed allow us to pivot to more attractive opportunities.\nFor example, Fund X began its investment period in October. We've already deployed $1 billion of capital into 9 distressed positions through year-end as well as another $2 billion in a take-private along other variety of funds and a sizable chunk of capital to a structured financing.\nMoving to retirement services. As Marc mentioned, Athene had a spectacular year of organic inflows totaling $48 billion, including $11 billion in the fourth quarter. The most significant contributor to the fourth quarter was the retail channel, which was $7.5 billion, a new quarterly record. And retail annuities are certainly in high demand industry-wide as principal protected products with an attractive guaranteed yield are compelling in today's environment.\nZooming in, though, it's clear that Athene's success is driven more than just the industry tied expanding distribution, differentiated asset origination and ample capital resources to robust -- to support that robust growth, which has allowed us to generate record flows while writing business at compelling spreads. For '23, we expect another robust year of organic growth from Athene across all channels with gross inflows exceeding 2022 levels and reaching new highs.\nRetail and flow insurance should remain the strongest, but also benefit from a solid pipeline of new distribution relationships in both the U.S. and Asia. And we also expect pension group annuity is likely to remain heightened as the funded status of many corporate pension plans continues to exceed 100%. And while the public FABN market remains less attractive, we're seeing more opportunities in private transactions that require our overall flexibility.\nReflecting on the past year, we've certainly reinstilled a growth through all assets of our facets of our business and put the building blocks to execute our 5-year plan in place. As we said, 2023 will be a pivotal year of execution and optimization, and we're seeing great momentum already.\nWith that, let me hand it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Marc and Jim have highlighted, 2022 was a very successful year of growth and execution for Apollo. Amid a backdrop of significant market choppiness, our financial results demonstrate the strength and resiliency of our earnings streams.\nIn our first full year post merger, the combination of our asset management and retirement services businesses proved increasingly valuable. FRE and SRE comprised 93% of total pretax earnings in 2022, and on average, we expect 90% or more of our earnings to be driven by stable, recurring, predictable earnings streams over the long term.\nThis translates to a meaningfully less potential for volatility versus other businesses that may be more aligned on incentive and investment-based income streams. Our business model is fully aligned with the growth of FRE and SRE inextricably linked and highly correlated. We intend to drive consistent and attractive earnings growth regardless of the macro backdrop, in line with our stated goal from Investor Day of doubling earnings by 2026.\n2022 was a solid proof point of our progress towards this goal as we met or exceeded nearly all of our key financial and business targets, which we outlined on Page 4 of our earnings release. FRE of $1.4 billion in 2022 grew 11% year-over-year, in line with our expectations, while we absorbed costs associated with significant investments in our next chapter of growth. Management fees increased 14% year-over-year, supported by strong fundraising from both our asset management and retirement services clients as well as a solid pace of capital deployment.\nAs Marc mentioned, capital solutions fees reached a record quarterly $142 million in the fourth quarter, bringing full year revenue to $414 million, up approximately 40% year-over-year, an incredible result amid a turbulent capital markets backdrop, highlighting the quality of our team and the capabilities we've built. Finally, full year FRE margin of 54% was in line with our previously communicated guidance.\nIn retirement services, normalized net spread reached 140 basis points and 123 basis points in the fourth quarter and for the full year '22, respectively, well above our initial 110 to 115 basis point guidance as the higher interest rate backdrop, more interesting investing climate and robust organic growth trends drove upside to our expectations. Athene's alternative investment portfolio returned 10.4% in 2022, very close to our 11% normalized assumption driven by broad-based strength across strategic retirement services platforms, origination platforms and fund investment returns.\nEntering 2023, we expect another year of strength across the businesses. I'll walk through some of the key building blocks. As previously communicated, we expect fee-related revenue growth of more than 20% in 2023. The bulk of this growth should be driven by management fees resulting from a variety of new strategic growth initiatives that Marc and Jim walked through, robust organic inflows from Athene, strong capital deployment in yield and hybrid strategies and additional capital raised for Fund X.\nTurning to Capital Solutions. Fee revenue from this business far exceeded our expectations in 2022, growing approximately twice as fast as we originally expected. Given this strong outperformance, we currently see last year's level providing a good baseline for 2023, which is tracking very nicely versus our $500 million target by 2026. We see a healthy pipeline of transactions to support this revenue.\nMoving to expenses. We expect our rate of growth in total fee-related expenses to moderate as we progress through 2023, driving positive operating leverage versus our full year 2022 margin. We added almost 400 Apollo employees to our total head count in 2022, following several previous years of significant head count expansion.\nWe've been very fortunate to attract top talent in the industry across investing, fundraising, product development, capital markets and enterprise solutions. This has helped drive strong 2022 financial results and solid progress as we look forward on our growth initiatives. We expect that the bulk of our senior hiring is now behind us.\nRelatedly, we've seen a meaningful increase in our noncomp expenses to support this higher run rate level of employees as well as our strategic initiatives, which has materialized principally through growing occupancy and technology costs. Additionally, our travel and entertainment expenses have normalized back to pre-COVID levels.\nWe are prudently managing discretionary expenses as we enter the new year, which should help drive a lower growth rate year-over-year in 2023. However, you should expect the fourth quarter of 2022 noncomp to be a good jumping off point for 2023. All together, we expect FRE growth of 25% in 2023, equating to approximately $1.75 billion or slightly under $3 per share.\nTurning to Retirement Services. We expect another strong year of growth in spread-related earnings as Athene continues to fire on all cylinders. We generated extraordinary normalized SRE in the fourth quarter, which was driven by another year of record organic inflows, underwritten to spreads above our target returns as well as historic interest rate tailwinds. These ingredients led to a truly remarkable performance.\nTo an increasing degree now, as we look forward, we have the flexibility to choose how much we want to grow and how we want to fund that growth. Given the rising rate, wider spread and strong demand environment of last year, we leaned in and added tens of billions of dollars of highly profitable business that we believe will drive predictable and durable spread-related earnings for years to come.\nWe find Athene's growth in a highly capital-efficient manner, utilizing its fortress balance sheet resources, which includes third-party capital via the equity -- the aid of equity sidecars that Marc referenced. For every $100 of inflows sourced, we put up approximately $8 of capital. Last year, Athene contributed approximately 80% of that capital as they have deployed most of its remaining dry powder. And as ADIP 2 comes online, we expect greater utilization of third-party capital to support incremental growth, likely double 2022's level or approximately 40%, which will make the business even more capital-efficient than it already is today.\nIn addition to increasing capital efficiency, ADIP provides external validation by sophisticated third-party investors of Athene's core business, risk framework, fee structure and strong returns on capital. Importantly, Apollo earned management fees on total gross assets within the Athene complex, including those managed on behalf of the third-party investors in ADIP. Because of this mechanism, we are agnostic to the method of funding for Athene's growth from an asset management perspective as fee-related earnings benefit dollar to dollar in either scenario.\nAs we've emphasized before, SRE is a highly attractive earnings stream, and the economics of growing represent a highly attractive return on group capital as we evaluate the highest and best uses of capital across the complex. The returns on capital are even more attractive with more equity sidecar funding, and that's another reason we intend to utilize it to a greater degree. We expect this effort will result in Athene's net invested assets growing by a mid-single-digit rate in 2023.\nAs you know, we've benefited from higher rates due to an allocation to floating rate assets and the positive impacts on new money yields. With the forward curve signaling a flatter trajectory, we currently expect our normalized net investment spread to remain in the vicinity of the strong fourth quarter level, which we expect will underpin a normalized net spread of 135 to 140 basis points for the full year 2023.\nCombining our current expectations for organic growth, the use of aid of equity, the investing environment and the interest rate backdrop, we expect normalized SRE growth of approximately 20% in 2023. And when combining FRE and normalized SRE, we expect year-over-year earnings growth of more than 20% in '23.\nAs it relates to principal investing, we expect continued equity market volatility and relatively muted capital markets activity at least in the first half of '23. Although it's difficult to predict market trends with any accuracy, based on the visibility we have into our pipeline through the first half of the year, we currently expect PII to be below our multiyear average target of $1 per share in '23. If markets continue to improve, it's entirely possible we'll move more actively into a monetizing phase in the back half of the year.\nNow finally, let me spend a minute on capital. As a reminder, we expect to generate $15 billion of capital to invest over 2022 to '26, including $5 billion to fund the base dividend of $1.60 per share, $5 billion for additional capital returned via opportunistic buybacks and dividend increases and $5 billion for strategic growth investments. In 2022, we spent nearly $1 billion of capital on the base dividend, about $350 million of capital on strategic investments and over $300 million of capital for opportunistic share repurchases above ongoing stock comp immunization.\nGiven the line of sight we have into a strong earnings growth year, we intend to raise the annual dividend by 7.5% to $1.72 per share, starting with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. We also expect to be a regular buyer of our stock as we believe the intrinsic value remains highly compelling.\nIn conclusion, we ended the year on a very strong note in what was a very difficult market backdrop. We're refreshed and focused on executing the next leg of our strategic 5-year plan with great enthusiasm.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.",

Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.\nApollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nMD & Global Head of IR, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator, and welcome, again, to our call this morning. Earlier today, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the Investor Relations portion of our website. For the third quarter, we reported fee-related earnings of $365 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year or $0.61 per share and spread-related earnings of $578 million or $0.96 per share. Together, fee and spread-related earnings totaled $943 million or $1.57 per share. And in total, we reported adjusted net income of $801 million or $1.33 per share for the third quarter.\nJoining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Scott Kleinman, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Apologies in advance for sounding like a losing Texas football coach. I will do my best.\nI thought where I'd start is really to start with the macro or the market backdrop. I have a chart on my office wall that traces the movement of the S&P following the 2008 financial crisis and following the beginning of tightening in this round by the Fed. They are almost on top of each other. That is not to imply that we are going to have or experience the same sort of events that followed 2008, but I do believe it is an important comment on market psychology and investor sentiment.\nWhat did we expect would happen when we printed $8.1 trillion as a country? Well, exactly what should have happened, happened. Assets almost across the board elevated in price to multiples and levels we had never seen before. Risk was up. Everything went up. Interest rates went down.\nNow that we have begun tightening, we are doing nothing other than resetting to more normal levels. We act and the market backdrop is somehow that low interest rates and excess liquidity are the norm. They are not, certainly not over my nearly 40-year career and not over any sort of long-term investment cycle. We have an entire generation of investors, investment analysts, who have really grown up just seeing the market go in one direction. And we now all know it goes both ways.\nIf I just chart what happened so far this year, venture capital valuations are down 60%; NASDAQ, down 30%; S&P, down nearly 20%; Barclays Agg, down 17%. This is an amazing time for alts, alternatives, particularly for credit. Investors have now discovered that everything is correlated to the Fed. And they are also discovering that most, if not all, of last decade's investment acumen was really nothing other than market beta and in some cases, nothing other than levered market beta.\nOver the past decade, investors kind of got a free ride. There was not much need for alternatives as markets moved primarily in one direction, yet, as an industry, alternatives grew tremendously. When I think about the market backdrop we are in today, alternatives should shine. After all, as an industry, we exist because we produce excess return per unit of risk. And for the first time in a decade, investors are asking not just about the reward, but about the risk associated with investments.\nAlternatives offer diversification, in many instances, downside protection and an escape from correlation and indexation. That is the backdrop that I see for our industry. For us, this is a particularly good time. We did not chase a hot dot of growth at any price over the past decade. Our business continues to be guided by 3 fundamental principles: purchase price matters, excess return per unit of risk and aligned investing.\nAs a result, we are on offense. Just in Q3, we deployed $37 billion, $175 billion in the last 12 months. Dry powder now exceeds $50 billion. We excel in this kind of market. We are leaning in. We are out talking with investors, and we are apologizing for nothing. By and large, we did what we were supposed to have done in a period of market access, which was avoid potholes.\nScott will take you through some detail of our activity across yield, hybrid and equity and in particular, how active we were in the U.K. as a result of LDI, which is the first, I believe, of many market hiccups.\nThe proof ultimately of the strength of a franchise shows up in the numbers. As Noah already mentioned, record FRE of $365 million, up 14% year-over-year. Record Apollo capital solutions revenue is north of $100 million, as Martin will take you through. Record normalized SRE of nearly $600 million, as Martin will take you through again. $100 billion of year-to-date inflows, well exceeding the $80 billion target that we put out for all of 2022 at our Investor Day last year.\nIn terms of performance, top-tier investment performance, Fund IX gross and net were 40% and 26%. Direct origination strategies were up 10% year-to-date. Our Athene alternatives portfolio was up 8% in Q3 versus nearly 21% down for the S&P 500.\nLet me now back up a little bit and talk about each of the individual businesses. Retirement services is generating more volume and higher spreads. Consumers prefer 4% and 5% guaranteed yields versus 2% and 3% guaranteed yields. We have nearly $37 billion of year-to-date inflows. We expect to exceed $45 billion during fiscal '22, and it would not surprise me if we got really close to $50 billion. The momentum in the business is overwhelming.\nNot only is the business good, we are underwriting new business at really nice spreads. Whereas we used to underwrite around 100 to 110, 115 basis points, we were 130 basis points in Q3, and I expect the basis point spread to increase going into Q4.\nIn addition, we are experiencing increasing profitability from our net floating rate position of $30 billion. This is a strategic portfolio for us. The decision and the willingness to hold $30 billion of floating rate securities means that we have foregone income that we could have maximized in prior periods in order to set ourselves up with this form of downside protection. This notion of downside protection and not being a \"current period earnings maximizer\" is what allows us to be on offense in markets like this. Martin will take you through the direct effects of being along $30 billion of floaters in a highly increasing rate environment.\nThe other nice thing about what's happening in the business is, on average, the credit quality of the portfolio is going upmarket. We have been able to earn these spreads, taking less risk rather than more risk. We've seen minimal impact of capital on capital from ratings migration. 95% of the fixed income assets continue to be investment grade, and having excess capital, which, again, is a luxury in our industry, allows us to be opportunistic and on offense.\nLet me move from retirement services to Apollo Asset Management. Simply said, we are on track to exceed targets from last year's Investor Day. Martin will also give you some insight into what we expect for 2023.\nAnd as you recall, we made 3 key bets, which were driving our asset management business forward: one was global wealth AUM at the end of 5 years of $50 billion; the second was Apollo capital solutions revenue in excess of $500 million, again, at the end of 5 years; and origination volume of $150 billion annually. Let me review each of those 3 bets, but if you intend to tune us out, the shorthand is we're well ahead on all of those 3 bets.\nIn global wealth. This market is actually showing FAs and is showing clients that the 60-40 portfolio is not relevant anymore. I expect and our team expects that 50% of a high net worth individual's portfolio over the next 5 to 10 years will be alternative. It will not be alternative in the narrow definition of private equity or hedge funds, it will be alternative in the way that we mean alternative, which is an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bond.\nIn this kind of volatile market, where people are focused on risk/reward, we are increasing mindshare as an aligned partner. If you look back and you think about what's transpired so far this year, global wealth AUM is up $17 billion, $8 billion from Griffin, $5.5 billion from ADS and $3.5 billion from other fundraising initiatives. $17 billion is great progress on the way to a 5-year goal of $50 billion, which I fully expect that we will exceed.\nOur positioning in this market is not to be the largest. Our positioning in this market is to be the most innovative, known for purchase price matters, excess return per unit of risk and aligned investing. The same bargain that we have with our institutional clients is the bargain we intend to strike with our high net worth clients.\nAAA, which I discussed in our last conference call, which is our core equity replacement product, think of this as an alternative to S&P 500 exposure. We're already seeing great early tractions. We've been approved by 3 bank platforms, where we expect to launch at the end of this year and the beginning of next year, and we see tremendous interest from RIAs, family offices and IBDs.\nWe have already seen, as I detailed on our last call, significant corporate interest. And just to give you a sense, this portfolio is up on an annualized basis more than 10% against a backdrop of a pretty negative S&P 500. We have been positive in all 3 quarters in 2022. This is what we are trying to do, is to replicate S&P 500 returns, plus a little, yet with fixed income-like volatility.\nOn ADS, our Apollo Debt Solutions vehicle, we were up 2.2% in the quarter, outperforming investment-grade bonds, high-yield bonds and levered loans. 90% of our portfolio has been put to work in 2022. Very little of the portfolio is exposed to the \"hot dot period of 2020 to 2021.\"\nWe are on offense in this vehicle, the same way we are on offense across our business. 99% of this portfolio is first lien, which we continue to believe, for high net worth investors and others, is the right place to be in an uncertain market with uncertain government backdrop, with uncertain inflation expectations.\nUncertainty is not a time not to invest. Uncertainty is a time to make sure you are getting paid and going in with your eyes wide open as to a range of outcomes. Further in global wealth, we are seeing continued expansion, and you will see us in coming quarters discuss with you what we're doing in Asia Pacific. But suffice it to say, not only are we hiring, but we are seeing good leverage out of our FWD insurance and Challenger relationships in Australia, FWD in Hong Kong, Asia and Challenger in Australia, where we own minority stakes in both.\nTo get from where we are to where we think this market is going to be is going to require time and education. We view ourselves as innovators in this market. For those who are interested to see what we're doing, just log on to Apollo Academy. This is a powerful tool for us to engage audiences, allow FAs to earn continuing education credits and to bring thought leadership and expand the knowledge of what an alternative is in the investing public. The early engagement is really strong, and we continue to receive accolades from our channel partners for all that we are doing to move this market along.\nApollo capital solutions, I'll just spend a second on. As an aligned investor, we want 25% of everything and 100% of nothing. That means we are ideally situated to work with our investors to syndicate into sidecars, into managed accounts and other flexible vehicles.\nRevenue this quarter was very strong. We had a goal of $500 million of revenue by 2026. It will likely be north of $400 million of revenue for 2022. I'm very optimistic, just like with global wealth, where we -- I think we're likely to exceed our $50 billion AUM target. We are likely to exceed our $500 million revenue target for Apollo capital solutions.\nSomehow I get the sense that the leaders of these teams have sandbagged us, but that's all good. Our job is to execute our plan, not to chase the hot dot of growth.\nLet me now turn to the third, and perhaps most important of our key bets, origination. If you run a business that is focused on excess return per unit of risk, you do not focus on growing AUM. You focus on growing your capacity to create investments that provide excess return per unit of risk and you believe, as we have seen, that AUM will follow. That is how, in my opinion, one generates a recurring revenue, long-term lasting franchise that investors can trust.\nMuch of what we do in origination, as you will recall, is what we call fixed income replacement. Most of this is investment grade. We are occupying a slightly different space than most of our alternative peers. And we're occupying it because we think this is the most attractive space, and we are advantaged in this particular area, and we are at scale.\nCurrently, we own or operate 13 different platforms. A platform to us is a way of generating the kinds of investment-grade, yieldy assets that we require to consistently grow our business and to feed our growing retirement services and third-party credit mandates.\nDuring the quarter, we announced the signing of a framework agreement for the Credit Suisse SPG business. This would be our 14th platform. We believe that asset-backed origination has the potential to be as large a market as corporate credit. This is a product set that is primarily investment grade, that fits extraordinarily well into our requirements for both our retirement services business and the third-party business we are building, would give us access to flow from more than 200 direct clients and accounts.\nShould we close on this transaction, which we believe we will, this would allow us to be marginally accretive going into 2023, but strategically very accretive. It will be up to us to turn this into a huge success, and we are optimistic about what this business can be in our hands and are incredibly enthusiastic of moving to a quick closing on this transaction.\nHaving gone through the business, let me now talk a little bit about what we're trying to build and remind how we differentiate from most other firms in the alternatives industry. Our business model is built for the long term. The vast majority of our capital comes from our yield business, and the vast majority of our yield business is fixed income replacement. Fixed income replacement is top of the capital structure, senior secured.\nAnd that's where we want to be in uncertain times. It's why we can play offense. That does not mean we are not interested in the below investment grade market or direct origination. We are. It is just not the lion's share of our business.\nI step back and I think about, again, our industry. Indexation is ramping across fixed income markets and equity markets. And indexation and correlation, it's cousin, are just a huge source of differentiation for us. As an alternative manager, the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution is another huge source of growth. Demographics, another huge source of growth.\nAnd something not fully appreciated is the changing role of banks post Dodd-Frank. Many of the fixed income originating assets are the kinds of assets that in prior periods might have ended up on bank balance sheets. Securitization is now how America banks. We estimate that less than 20% of debt capital to U.S. businesses and consumers is provided directly by the banking system. The vast majority of capital is provided by all of you through intermediaries like us and our peers.\nThis does not mean we are replacing the banks. Quite frankly, we are now partners with the banks. If you think about what a bank wants, for the most part, a bank wants the client. They can sell the client payments and FX, hedging and M&A and equity and a whole range of services that we and our peers are not really equipped nor do I believe we will be equipped to offer.\nWhat we want is the asset. We want the asset on good terms without fees taken out in advance, where we can have a direct look at credit quality and credit underwriting to control the documentation pen. Fixed income replacement, I believe to be a vast market, where we are still in the early stages of its development. And I'm confident that we can, as a firm, adhere to excess return per unit of risk while growing our business.\nThat is the challenge that I see. There is growth everywhere in the alternatives marketplace. The key is to grow while maintaining the core tenet of what an alternative is.\nLet me close by saying, we're on offense. A year ago, almost to today, we laid out our 5-year plan. I'm confident that we're going to meet our targets, which were more than doubling of earnings by 2026. The 3 key bets are well underway, and we have already identified the next level of growth initiatives, whether it's AAA, GP, LP solutions and more to come.\nThe accelerated hiring of the past few years is now behind us, and now it is our job to focus on simplification. The entire alternatives industry has gone from a small industry to a relatively large industry over a decade. Much of the industry has grown by adding people. We now, as an industry and as a firm, need to take time to make sure we are building the systems and operating procedures that will allow us to scale the business and return to operating leverage. Make no mistake, a return to operating leverage is in the cards, and we expect that to happen for us as early as 2023.\nThe talent we've had most recently with our COO addition by Byron Vielehr and others gives us the confidence that we are well set up to both grow and to be efficient in how we grow. Energy level at the firm is very high, and I want to use this opportunity not just to speak to all of you, but to thank the team, many of whom are listening, for the tremendous work they have done so far in 2022.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Scott.\n\nScott M. Kleinman\n\nCo-President of Apollo Asset Management Inc & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. Apollo is well known for having the ability to thrive in challenging and complex economic environments. Over the past decade, amid a low interest rate backdrop, we worked hard to source attractive investment opportunities and capture excess returns for our fund investors and retirement services clients. We were measured, patient and preparing along the way.\nBut now we've entered into a particularly favorable backdrop for our investing strategy to shine. We're on our front foot in a market that is ripe with opportunities, and we're methodically putting capital to work across our platform.\nIn credit, the areas where we do the majority of our business, which is fixed income replacement, senior secured, top of the capital structure, are still open, and the recent market dislocation is creating an abundance of attractive deployment opportunities for those who can invest with size and scale.\nWe're seeing pre-financial crisis pricing frameworks, allowing us to generate higher returns with less credit risk. For example, the yield on the CCC index 1 year ago is now the same as the yield on an investment-grade index. We're buying new issue 10-year IG corporate paper between 6.25% and 6.75%. And in sterling, there's single A-rated opportunities yielding 7.25% to 7.5%.\nThese attractive high-grade assets are finding a home across our platform, particularly at Athene, where the investment portfolio is directly benefiting from rising rates and wider spreads. In the third quarter, the weighted average yield on total fixed income purchases for Athene exceeded the BBB corporate bond index by more than 80 basis points.\nIn another recent example, our size, scale and ability to move quickly allowed us to step in and provide stability to the U.K. market in response to LDI-related forced selling at a favorable entry point. Trading volumes skyrocketed to 800% above average levels when forced selling began, and we accounted for about 1/3 of aggregate liquidity supply.\nOver this 3-week period in October, our trading desk purchased $1.1 billion of AAA and AA-rated CLO paper, yielding over 8%. We're confident that none of our competitors were able to move this swiftly or buy this significantly amid such volatility.\nIn terms of origination, debt origination volume totaled $20 billion in the third quarter or approximately $100 billion over the last 12 months, demonstrating the significant scale we possess in generating attractive proprietary assets. With less competition in the market, we've increased pricing and tightened the credit box across several of our origination platforms as our financing capabilities are becoming increasingly valuable.\nOne example of this dynamic is our recent high-grade partnership with Air France. This was a unique opportunity to provide one of the world's leading airlines with a custom, asset-backed capital solution to deleverage and improve its borrowing costs. Apollo leverage cross-platform expertise, including aviation, asset-backed finance and multi-asset credit, to execute the long-term investment of EUR 500 million.\nIn private equity, our emphasis on downside protection and purchase price discipline as well as our ability to be flexible across multiple strategies, corporate carve-outs, opportunistic buyouts and distressed situations allows us to seek the best risk-adjusted return in any market.\nIn today's environment, increased market dislocation is providing many unique opportunities to lean in, creating what we expect will be a significant tailwind for the franchise. We're operating with a pipeline that is 3x as large as it was just this time last year, and we expect to commit a significant amount of capital in the coming quarters.\nThe credit markets are more exposed to rising interest rates than ever before, and we're diligently preparing for deployment opportunities in distressed debt. With the supply of sub-investment grade debt 3x as large as it was during the financial crisis and with suppressed default levels for almost 15 years, we believe many corporates will need to deleverage.\nOur financing tools are also proving to be a tremendous differentiator, allowing us to buy companies at attractive values when most competitors are unable to transact. This was the case in the recently announced acquisition of Atlas Air through a take-private transaction, totaling $5.2 billion. While most banks were effectively shut for business on new LBO commitments, we worked with our capital solutions team to structure and anchor a preferred equity tranche, reducing the required debt commitment while enhancing return potential and downside protection.\nThis example is one of many as our ability to deploy capital in this sort of market backdrop is greatly enhanced by our integrated capital solutions business. It's worth highlighting that we've strategically invested in this business over the past year, as we've previously told you, and now have a dedicated team of approximately 40 professionals. We work diligently to align the team with several newer areas of growth across the platform and organize our corporate coverage model across thousands of entrenched relationships.\nAs Marc noted, our investment has begun bearing fruit as we generated record quarterly transaction fees of $105 million in the third quarter, of which the vast majority is from capital solutions fees. In this backdrop, we're acting as a market stabilizer, providing liquidity in stressed segments of the market and helping our banking partners work through a backlog of hung deals.\nWhile we acknowledge that transaction fees can be lumpy on a quarterly basis, we're constructive about the strategic progress we've made and remain confident in our team's ability to continue to drive growth. The robust ecosystem of asset origination, capital deployment and market connectivity are crucial components of the excess return that we diligently strive to generate for our clients.\nAs demonstrated in the third quarter results, the core tenets of our investing philosophy, purchase price discipline and downside protection are clearly setting us apart. In a public equity market backdrop that was down 5% in the third quarter and 17% over the last 12 months, our private equity portfolio had flat returns and appreciated 8% over the same respective periods.\nRevenue and EBITDA trends in our funds portfolio companies are up meaningfully year-over-year, and they're actively managing margin risk by implementing cost-saving measures and passing through price increases. Elsewhere, our hybrid value portfolio continues to perform well, appreciating 1% in the third quarter and over 4% year-to-date.\nIn our yield strategy, we're really a performing credit investor that looks to make reasonable loans and get paid back. Our corporate credit and structured credit strategies appreciated 1% in the third quarter, while our direct origination portfolio appreciated over 3%, showcasing disciplined credit underwriting and superior security selection.\nAthene's alternative portfolio generated an 8% annualized return in the third quarter, continuing to benefit from the diversified and defensive characteristics that it has exhibited over time. Within the portfolio, origination platforms and strategic retirement service investments returned 12% and 4%, respectively, while fund investments returned 8%, aided by strong performance in real assets and higher cash flows from a few structured deals in our yield funds.\nThere are several qualities of Athene's alternative portfolio that drive resilient performance amid more challenged equity markets, including high current cash flow for our origination platforms, structuring of underlying assets to allow for faster paydown and amortization and timely redeployment of capital. These structural qualities create downside protection when public markets are volatile, which is proving increasingly valuable in today's market backdrop.\nMoving to our fundraising results. Third quarter inflows of $34 billion were strong and diversified across our platform. Asset management inflows totaled $21 billion and included $17 billion from third-party fundraising, including Fund X and our newly launched S3 platform.\nNotably, we began third-party capital fundraising for our nontraded REIT, Apollo Realty Income Solutions, or ARIS, in late September. As we look to close out the year, we expect another quarter of healthy fundraising, including additional Fund X capital as well as the successful equity capital raise for Athora.\nSo far, we've helped Athora raise over EUR 2 billion of new common equity capital this year, with high visibility to bringing the total to over EUR 2.5 billion in the coming weeks. We believe Athora is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a vast near-term market opportunity in Europe, and this new capital will allow them to execute on their strong pipeline of both inorganic and organic growth and to continue growing at this rapid pace.\nIn regards to the ongoing Fund X capital raise, our conversations and diligence efforts with limited partners remain very constructive as our differentiated investment philosophy and strong long-term track record are setting us apart from other funds in the market. Through the end of October, we've received commitments of approximately $14.5 billion.\nDue to the impacts of the denominator effect and the sheer number of GPs in the market this year, we've agreed to keep the fund open until the first half of '23 to accommodate our investors' annual allocation budgets. We remain confident in reaching our $25 billion target fund size and importantly, all capital closed in the remainder of '22 or the first part of '23 will accrue fees back to the fund's fee commencement date, which we activated on October 1.\nTurning to our retirement service inflows. Athene had a stellar quarter of record inorganic growth as the value proposition of principal-protected, yield-focused products are proving to be increasingly attractive in today's market. Total inflows of $13 billion in the third quarter included a record $6 billion from the retail annuity channel as fixed rate products with attractive rates were in high demand, and continued distribution expansion within large financial institutions helped as well.\nFlow reinsurance also benefited from these trends as well as growing traction from our expanding partnerships in Asia Pacific with its second best inflow quarter ever. Importantly, the duration and stickiness of Athene's funding is highly predictable, and we have not seen any material change in customer behavior so far this year.\nBefore turning it over to Martin, I'd like to pick up on a discussion that I outlined at our Investor Day approximately a year ago. We see ample white space opportunities tangential to our existing businesses that can drive accelerated growth above our base case targets. There are a few very large and growing sectors, which typically trade at higher multiples, where we have not been historically active such as fintech, life science and software.\nOver the past 18 months, we've selectively cultivated strategically and economically aligned partnerships with best-in-class managers in each of these areas to expand the breadth of our platform and expertise. Our investment in Motive, a specialist fintech private equity firm, was our first partnership in the growth space.\nThis relationship has fostered several tangible benefits already, such as providing proprietary investment origination, helping in transaction due diligence within specialized sectors, building out retail distribution technology, working on product innovation with Apollo and Athene and driving efficiency enhancements across Apollo's operating structure.\nMore recently, we announced strategic and financial relationships with Sofinnova, a leading European life science venture capital firm, earlier this year as well as Haveli, a premier enterprise software and gaming private equity firm. We expect these more recent investments to be just as successful as what we've accomplished with Motive in just over a year.\nSo with that, let me stop there and hand it over to Martin.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. So echoing Marc and Scott's sentiment this morning, this is the type of environment where Apollo really shines. Our key business drivers, including capital deployment, investment performance and fundraising, remain strong. And our financial results reflect continued momentum across our primary earnings streams.\nThe stability, quality and recurring nature of our earnings power provides comfort in these volatile markets. Management fees accounted for more than 80% of fee-related revenue, both in the third quarter and year-to-date periods. And we experienced only an estimated 1% annualized drag on our management fees quarter-over-quarter from market value to clients.\nImportantly, fee and spread-related earnings accounted for approximately 95% of total pretax earnings in the third quarter. As Marc said, we're on track to meet our 5-year targets that we laid out at Investor Day last year, which includes more than doubling both FRE and total earnings.\nStarting with our AUM results. Third quarter AUM reached $523 billion, increasing 2% quarter-over-quarter and 9% year-over-year. Inflows totaled $34 billion in the third quarter as we raised significant amounts of capital from both our asset management and retirement services clients. Total outflows of $10 billion in the quarter included $6 billion from normal course of same runoff, which increased from the prior quarter due to several expected funding agreement maturities as well as the first of its kind partial repurchase of existing notes in an effort to tighten our trading spreads.\nRealizations of $10 billion included $6 billion related to the reallocation of a limited partner's existing mandate to other strategies. In a similar dynamic to last quarter, most of the third quarter negative market activity was driven by unfavorable FX translation from Athora's portfolio due to a depreciation of the euro.\nMoving to FRE. We reported third quarter fee-related earnings of $365 million as previously referenced or $0.61 per share, which increased 14% year-over-year and reflected continuing momentum in our results after increases of 3% and 7% in the first and second quarters, respectively.\nAmid turbulent markets, fee revenue growth exceeding 20% year-over-year was very strong and included 16% growth in management fees. On a sequential basis, yield management fees benefited from a full quarter of Griffin fees and the expiration of a 6-month fee waiver for the non-traded credit BDC we manage, Apollo Debt Solutions. ADS contributed an incremental $5.5 million to each of management fees and fee-related performance fees in the third quarter.\nAnd as Scott noted, we turned on management fees for Fund X on October 1, at which point the fee base is for Fund IX step down from committed to remaining invested capital at a slightly lower fee rate. The combination of these 2 events will be modestly accretive to our fourth quarter equity management fees, and we will benefit from higher run rate and catch-up fees with successive closes.\nIn terms of expenses, comp and noncomp expenses increased on a sequential basis as expected as the impact of growth in our headcount continues to run through our cost base. Overall, we have good visibility into fourth quarter results and continue to feel confident in meeting our $2.35 per share FRE target for this year.\nAs we look to 2023, we still expect fee revenue growth of more than 20%, driven by revenue accretion from new strategic growth initiatives, robust organic inflows from our retirement services clients, fees from additional capital for Fund X and continued progress in our capital solutions build out.\nWith our period of accelerated investment spend to support our fast-growing platform behind us, we expect to generate positive operating leverage next year as we move toward our long-term FRE margin target of 60% plus by 2026. With a very strong revenue growth outlook and moderating expense growth, we are targeting FRE growth of around 25% in 2023, above our multiyear compound annual growth target of 18%.\nMoving to our retirement services segment. We generated SRE of $578 million or $0.96 per share in the third quarter, which represents a net spread of 120 basis points as a percentage of average net invested assets. Normalizing our alternative returns to 11% and excluding certain notable items, SRE, as Marc noted, was $598 million in the third quarter, translating to a normalized net spread of 124 basis points.\nOn a sequential quarterly basis, our normalized net spread increased 9 basis points, driven by 11 basis points of net accretion, both from higher floating rate income and higher on-the-margin purchases due to rising interest rates, partially offset by 2 basis points of higher operating expenses. The quarter-over-quarter increase in our OpEx reflects higher costs associated with building out our platform capacity, and we view this as a reasonable run rate in the near term.\nWe've been a beneficiary of this rising rate environment with higher short-term interest rates generating approximately $100 million of incremental SRE from our net floating rate income in the first 9 months versus the comparable period of 2021, with $60 million of this increase or $0.10 a share in the third quarter. We expect this amount to rise further due to the timing of rate basis resets.\nThis dynamic as well as attractive deployment opportunities should continue benefiting the underlying profitability of our retirement services segment, translating to an expected normalized net spread of approximately 135 basis points in the fourth quarter.\nAnd just to underscore the strength of Athene's business, a year ago, we laid out an indication of $3.35 per share of spread-related earnings this year. We expect to report closer to $4 per share with 3 key benefits: higher rates on the floating rate portfolio, organic growth exceeding our plans and a favorable investing environment.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we expect this favorable interest rate uplift, coupled with robust organic inflow outlook, to drive above average normalized SRE growth next year relative to our 11% multiyear compound annual growth expectation.\nTurning to principal investing. We reported PII of $50 million or $0.08 per share in the third quarter. Realized performance fees of $93 million were light, as expected, as we're being patient in monetizing investments to help maximize return potential for the benefit of our fund investors.\nLastly, our business generates a substantial amount of free cash flow, and we expect to deploy $15 billion of capital through 2026 in strategic growth investments, funding the base dividend and both growing the base dividend and opportunistically repurchasing shares.\nIn the third quarter, we spent approximately $200 million of capital on HoldCo investments to drive future FRE growth as well as approximately $50 million on share repurchases. As a reminder, we spent $200 million on buybacks in Q2, and we would have engaged in additional share activity in Q3 if it weren't for restrictions during the quarter.\nLooking ahead, we expect to be more active in buying back our stock, particularly in times when, in our opinion, our stock is clearly undervalued. We remain comfortable with our strong liquidity position, including a net balance sheet value at the holding company of $2.1 billion or $3.50 per share, with cash and equivalents of more than $2 billion.\nIn closing, I'd like to reiterate a central theme of our remarks this morning. We're very well positioned to capitalize on a growing pipeline of opportunities in this market backdrop and generate excess return for our clients. A year removed from our milestone Investor Day, we're even more confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and are diligently executing against our attractive growth plan, aimed at benefiting all our stakeholders.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call, and we'll open up for questions.",

This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to apollo's. Most recent S E SEC filings for risk factors relate.\n\nDue to these statements.\n\nApollo will be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are reconciled to GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in any Apollo fun.\n\nI would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn Global head of Investor Relations.\n\nThanks, Operator, and welcome again to our call. This morning earlier today, we published our earnings release and financial supplement on the stockholders portion of our website. Additionally for those who are not able to tune in live we have the presentation in video replay of the retirement services business update we hosted in June available on our website.\n\nFor the second quarter, we reported record quarterly fee related earnings of $341 million or 57 per share and spread related earnings of $442 million or 74 per share, which together totaled $783 million or $1 30 per share. We also reported normalized .\n\nof $535 million or 89 per share, which.\n\nWhich was also a record and increased 10% quarter over quarter in.\n\nIn total we reported adjusted net income of $566 million or 94 per share.\n\nJoining me this morning to discuss our results in further detail, our Marc Rowan CEO , Jim Delta Co President and Martin Kelly CFO with that I'll now turn the call over to Mark.\n\nThank you Noah and good morning.\n\nThis is among my favorite weeks, it's the week when our next class of associates.\n\nApollo.\n\nAnd we do our best to integrate them into our firm and our culture and it's also a good chance for US just to step back and really synthesize for them the things that make our firm unique and there are three that I always focused on the.\n\nFirst our business in fact, our industry is built on the proposition of excess return per unit of risk we're not in the AUM business. We're not in the fee business. We're in the business of providing clients excess return per unit of risk. So long as we do that the business will take care of itself as it has this quarter.\n\nAnd throughout this year.\n\nThe second and it's a very different proposition than almost anyone else in our industry. We are an aligned investor.\n\nOur retirement services balance sheets through Athena and are among the largest investors in each of our products side by side with our third party institutional and retail clients.\n\nAlignment.\n\nIs something unique in our industry and it's something of great comfort to our clients, particularly during periods of market volatility.\n\nAnd finally, and I know he will bring a smile to people in this room and elsewhere, we do one thing really well purchase price matters.\n\nPurchase price matters as a philosophy that starts with the protection of principal and is embedded in absolutely everything that we do we approach our credit business purchase price matters, we want to be top of the capital structure senior secured we approach our equity business in that we want to buy growth, but we don't want to pay for it. So we're prepared to work harder.\n\nThe reality is purchase price matters as a strategy has allowed us to play offense in every corner of our business this quarter and it could not have been a better quarter in terms of execution and strategic progress I'll do a quick tour of what I think were the highlights of the quarter and then Jim and Martin.\n\nWe will certainly add to it.\n\nAs Noah stated record FRE for the quarter, you should expect FRE to accelerate in the back half of the year and into 'twenty three consistent with the estimates we provided you in our Investor day back in October .\n\nRecord FRE, particularly on a normalized basis this quarter.\n\n36 billion of inflows.\n\nThe calendar was a little bit unkind to us and did not include a first close on fund 10, which would have added $13 billion to this total but make no mistake that will show up in next year. This morning, We also announced the multibillion dollars launch of S. III, our GP and LP solutions business.\n\nWe launched this quarter, our first next generation global wealth product Apollo aligned alternatives, which I will spend some time on throughout this call.\n\nRecord fees from capital solutions.\n\nWe have a very clean book, we have zero hung deals zero losses.\n\nThis is an amazing time to actually put on risk when everyone is retreating from risk.\n\nLet me turn to Athene for a moment.\n\naveraged 900 million plus per week of.\n\nOf inflows across all channels.\n\nVolume is interesting, but theyre coming at near record spreads business in the second quarter produced a 110 basis points of pre tax net net spread.\n\nWe're able to do both the volume and the spread while actively upgrading the portfolio due to market volatility the.\n\nThe quarter was also incredibly important milestone we added a moody's rating of a one now puts that alongside our a plus from S&P and our a plus from Fitch.\n\nA thorough also had an absolutely amazing quarter, we announced a sizable transaction in Germany, which will close at some point next year, we believe.\n\nWe also closed a deal in Italy, This week, which will add about $5 billion of incremental fee paying AUM.\n\nWe added a new CEO Mike Wells.\n\nJim will touch on that.\n\nAnd you should expect us to do a sizable capital raise in the second half of this year further bolstering authority.\n\nPower and growth.\n\nThere is no entity in the European market that we will have raised anywhere near what a thorough has put together in terms of its capital base to become the premier consolidator in the European market.\n\nIn terms of investment performance pay outperformed the S&P 500 by 100 basis points in Q2, and more than 2200 basis points year to date.\n\nAlt returns, which represents a subset of what we do have more downside protected was plus six in Q2 versus minus 66 annualized for the S&P.\n\nA differentiated and downside protected portfolio is exactly what we want.\n\nOn a regulated balance sheet.\n\nIn our yield business directed origination strategies were very strong contributors to the quarter.\n\nAnd as you recall the vast majority of what we do in yield is top of the capital structure senior secured in markets. Like this we do some of our best work and $40 billion of gross capital was deployed across our business in Q2.\n\nTurning now to the three best capital solutions I've already touched on and I know Jim will go into detail suffice it to say coming into the market with a very clean book without any exposure gives us a lot of firepower at a point in time when everyone's pulling back.\n\nIn origination. This is just a good time to originate assets. We originated $21 billion. This quarter 100 billion year to date, and we are a reliable source of financing when public markets and in fact private markets often do not cooperate to give you a sense of how this is impacting some of our platforms.\n\nTake our mid cap mid market senior secured lending platform.\n\nFor this half there are 16% return on equity compared to low teens. Historically this reflects a lot of firepower a lot of capital the absence of competition. We closed 17, new deals across 12, new relationships in June alone.\n\nFirst half origination volume 9 billion up 25% year over year.\n\nIf I look at wheels, Donlin, which is our fleet leasing platform or.\n\nOur initial investment in wheels, Donlin was $2 billion of AUM in the first quarter of 'twenty, one pro forma for the announced acquisition of lease plan and other growth during the year, we should close the year out at more than 7 billion of AUM across this platform.\n\nFinally, our transaction to purchase Aqua another platform focused on home improvement, particularly solar.\n\nAlso closed last week businesses performing well.\n\nLet me move now to global wealth.\n\nWe are a scaled player in the global wealth business, we've been through with metrics over a period of time.\n\nYeah.\n\nOur brand is resonating across the global wealth platform.\n\nIf I step back and think about where the industry is we are in very very early days.\n\nIf you think about what we as an industry have offered the global high net worth community. Thus far we've offered them Reits bdcs and private funds.\n\nEssentially the same product set we have offered for more than 20 years not much new has been created to this for this market.\n\nThe growth in this market. Despite the an older product set has come as a result of institutional level of fees being offered to high net worth for the first time.\n\nAnd technology.\n\nMarket understanding which have made the products more accessible more approachable and more easily digestible by global wealth systems.\n\nWe clearly will offer Reits bdcs and private funds and have successfully been doing that across our platform and I know Jim will touch on some of that.\n\nBut our desire here is to be positioned in this market as a thought leader and as an innovator and to create products specifically for this channel.\n\nreally seek to eliminate friction points that historically have kept this channel from really embracing alternatives.\n\nThis quarter right at the end, we announced the launch of AAA Apollo aligned alternatives.\n\nThis is designed with the individual investor in mind.\n\nWhat we seek to do in AAA is to produce equity like returns with fixed income like volatility.\n\nAAA .\n\nRepresents a 180 different positions, which have been put together over the past 13 years, which have a very fine track record and represent the.\n\nThe entirety with some limited exceptions of Athene equity accounts.\n\nEssentially an individual investor guests to invest side by side.\n\nWith Apollo and Athene.\n\nAcross its balance sheet in a way that is fully diversified.\n\nNo J curve.\n\nNo two levels of fees complete.\n\nComplete alignment.\n\nNo capital calls.\n\nIn a nuanced way this is private and it as equity, but it is not private equity. This is not a replication of leverage buyout or a private funds. This is fundamentally a replacement for S&P core equity holdings within an investors allocation.\n\nSomething to touch on that I said last time.\n\nWe view this market alternatives.\n\nIn a very very broad way, we view alternatives is nothing other than an alternative to publicly traded stocks and bonds.\n\nHistorically the alternatives universe has been looked at in the context of private equity or hedge funds were now in the context of recent bdcs.\n\nI believe when we step back and really contemplate what we as an industry and we as a firm are capable of here the definition and therefore, the addressable market is just much much larger.\n\nWe launched this product with $15 billion of invested or committed capital 10 billion off the clean balance sheet.\n\nOne 5 billion from Sumi Trust, which we announced at the end of July and a sizable commitment from an Asia based institutional investor and a high net worth money manager early.\n\nEarly conversations with global wealth are very encouraging.\n\nI believe that this has the potential to be the largest fund.\n\nAcross the Apollo platform by this time next year.\n\nBut the hard work now begins for us to educate the market.\n\nAnd really .\n\nSo the market how this product can be used as a core equity replacement product, forming the bedrock of our high net worth retail investors equity portfolio in place of their S&P S&P 500 exposure.\n\nContinuing on in global wealth the acquisition of Gryphon in all its various iterations is now completely closed the integration is complete momentum is very positive solid fundraising year to date for our real estate interval fund, which now stands at about $7 billion of AUM, we could not be more pleased with.\n\nHow seamless the Griffin acquisition has gone.\n\nLet me also touch on Etfs are.\n\nPrivate market BDC.\n\nAgain off to an amazing start, particularly considering the macro backdrop.\n\nAlmost 1 billion of inflows in Q2 against less than $2 million of redemptions.\n\nMore than half the portfolio is now invested in directly originated loans as of quarter end.\n\nAnd the opportunity to put capital to work, where the market has taken a risk off point of view is offering us really an interesting opportunities at very nice spreads at very low ltvs.\n\nAt the end of the day. This does as I've, often said all come down to people.\n\nNearly 100, new people joined Apollo in the second quarter. Some key hires ahead of family Office ahead of insurance third party insurance marketing head of digital assets, all of whom I believe we'll be well known to you and other constituents as the months go by these are truly outstanding people, who seeing Apollo.\n\nWhat all of US see we are at a size and scale, where we're capable of doing anything.\n\nBut we are small enough to still behave like entrepreneurs and to run our business around the principles of excess return per unit of risk.\n\nOf aligned investing and a purchase price matters I would expect on a go forward basis. The pace of hiring will slow down we are scaled that does not mean, we will not hire we will still grow.\n\nBut the vast scaling that we needed to do to accommodate our ambitious plans, which we set out at Investor day has largely been completed.\n\nCulture for US is very important we are an in office culture.\n\nWe are back those who have visited us in person often remark there shocked that just how active and in person in our office is.\n\nAs I've said to some of our competitors there is nothing like feeding people three meals a day to get them in the office.\n\nWe have for the past decade and longer followed purchase price matters, we did not chase the hot dot we'd never forgot that the business of investing was not just about reward. It was also about risk.\n\nI believe that is being perceived by our institutional clients and by our retail clients and we are being trusted as good and responsible stewards of capital.\n\nWe completed an off site this week, Jim Scott Martin myself and others.\n\nAbout as optimistic and confident as I could convey.\n\nWe fully expect that the business plan that we laid out for all of you in October of past year is well within our reach up doubling AUM doubling earnings and generating $15 billion of cash flow over the five year period per our Investor day comments with that let me turn the call over to Jim.\n\nThanks, Mark our second quarter results showcase the virtuous flywheel effect, we're witnessing across our business as it relates to capital formation debt origination and appointment regenerate.\n\nWe generated very strong quarterly inflows of 36 billion, including 24 from asset management, and 12 billion from retirement services and the quarterly total would have been nearly 50 different crude in our recent form 10 commandments it more excited.\n\nOur debt origination engine continue to source attractive investments during a very volatile and uncertain time in the public markets generating 21 billion of volume.\n\nAnd across the platform gross deployment totaled 40 billion in the second quarter and 175 million over the last 12 months, which demonstrates the scale and breadth of our investing capabilities.\n\nThere's a lot of great things to talk about across the firm right now for my remarks. This quarter will take you on a highlighted tour around the franchise, but first I'll start with an important reminder.\n\nMany of you know that we have built our business to be resilient in Mexico in terms of market dislocation.\n\nWe manage long dated and perpetual capital for our clients, we have a proven ability to foreign and create value and we can do it diligently waiting for opportunity opportune windows to monetize investments as Mark highlighted our approach is grounded in purchase price matters I E price discipline.\n\nIn a downside protection mentality that permeates everything we do.\n\nIn moments like this where what moved from uncertainty or high end market volatility is elevated we often will put significant amounts of capital to work as we did in the second quarter we.\n\nWe see a growing pipeline of attractive investment opportunities to deploy that 50 billion of dry powder, we have across our yield hybrid and equity investing strategies.\n\nStarting with yield are cautious positioning at the top of the capital structure, primarily in senior secured positions has driven broad outperformance across our farmers. This year, our direct origination strategy has depreciated by more than 3% in the second quarter.\n\nWhile our corporate credit performance has held up well versus comparable benchmarks.\n\nWith traditional sources of financing stepping back in mid heightened volatility, we're seeing tremendous deal flow in our pipeline of near term demand is quite robust.\n\nAnd spreads have widened and we moved up the spectrum to generate the same attractive returns.\n\nFor example spreads on new issue large cap private direct lending investments are now exceeding 650 basis points oversold.\n\nYear to date through July we've committed to 11 transaction of at least $1 billion.\n\nSize, demonstrating the scale and certainly we can provide our clients and kind of boom periods.\n\nWe've also issued an orange yellows and the opportunistic repurchase of over 1 billion of investment investment grade CLO partners. This year to date for both of our retirement services clients and other accounts.\n\nWith yoga approaching 8% to 10% for double E. Two.\n\nTo Triple H B.\n\nWhen considering original issue discounts that are infrequently available.\n\nWe're also seeing tremendous opportunity for our hybrid funds and strategies that provide equity like upside restructured downtime protection are becoming more and more attractive.\n\nOur hybrid value franchise in particular proved quite resilient with our first vintage appreciating 1% in the second quarter and we held a final close for our cord five raising approximately $2 billion of capital in just a few short months.\n\nThe deployment pipelines has grown quickly as companies are seeking bespoke solutions in this environment and we expect to have a very active second half of the year.\n\nInterestingly the collapse of growth equity markets has created a unique financing opportunity and challenge for warmth highly valued companies.\n\nWe are aiming to capitalize on this.\n\nThis location for providing preferred equity and creative debt structuring.\n\nThis is how purchase price matters mentality approaches the growth equity market.\n\nTurning to equity our pipeline of investment opportunities as farm and we expect to deploy a meaningful amount of capital from our flagship private equity funds in the coming months, we have approximately 1 billion of remaining capital to deploy before the department is fully committed.\n\nIn terms of et cetera.\n\nAs of today, we have received 13 billion of commitments for form 10, representing more than half our total target of 25 billion.\n\nWe are currently seeing strong support from both existing and new institutional investors, especially from outside the United States and expect to raise a record amount of capital from abroad Global wealth channel.\n\nDespite the frequently discussed congestion dynamics in the market. We believe we are offering a differentiated product and we remain confident in meeting our targets.\n\nFinancially, we expect to benefit from a step up in FRE. When we turned on form 10, which we currently expect will be sometime in the fourth quarter and all capital raise subsequently.\n\nCatch up management fees from the commencement date.\n\nMoving to retirement services business Athene is built to withstand market disruptions and prosper through them.\n\nWhat kind of an asset management business, we are not a current period profit maximize her and instead manage athene two pronged possess significant capital flexibility and ample liquidity.\n\nThis is exemplified by a $3 2 billion of excess equity liquidity and nearly 8 billion of cash within the portfolio at the end of the quarter.\n\nThis posture allows us to be positioned authentically and defend somebody at the same time and we view the current backdrop is a terrific environment for them.\n\nBusiness to grow.\n\nAthene provides customers value generating savings product with principal protection features that have the durability to perform through stress and we sleep well at night, knowing the business is highly stable.\n\nPredictable and almost entirely supported by investment grade rated assets.\n\nWithin the scenes Iag's structured securities of allocation Youll find the CLO portfolio, particularly resilient.\n\nFor example, we believe triple B rated tranches issue today can withstand an annualized default.\n\nBarring loan portfolio of approximately 711% for each of the five years without being impaired.\n\nFor those interested in more information we provided an in depth analysis on a themes investment portfolio, including helpful insights on structured securities as part of our retirement services business update from June that Noah mentioned.\n\nThe attractiveness of the other things product suite in a rising rate environment was also on full display in the second quarter with record quarterly inflows of 12 billion are underwritten to attract attractive returns.\n\nAthena retail annuity channel benefited from higher demand with record quarterly inflows of almost 4 billion and application submissions nearly doubling year over year.\n\nSecond quarter activity also included a $4 3 billion pension group annuity transaction with Lockheed Martin the largest deal of its kind in the industry. So far this year and we see a strong pipeline from that channel heading into the back of the year.\n\nClearly.\n\nAthena earnings power is growing in the current environment and its balance sheet as Matt exit been exhibiting any signs of distress from undue credit risk or unexpected withdrawals.\n\nThere've been a couple of recent updates on our.\n\nFor our retirement services business in Europe .\n\nAnd in July for announcing the appointment of Mike Wells as group, Chief Executive officer subject to regulatory approval.\n\nMike is a well respected seasoned leader within the industry. Most recently, serving as the CEO of Prudential plc.\n\nAlso in July at the or announced the transaction with acts in Germany and expect to close on annuities portfolio. Currently now are valued at 19 billion by the end of next year.\n\nThis transaction adds strategic scale to it.\n\nGerman business, which is Europes second largest retirement services market with nearly $1 two trillion of reserves and actionable pipeline of sizable transactions.\n\nTo assist in their continued growth ahead of the deal close athene expects to participate as an anchor investor and an equity raise for them for in the second half of this year.\n\nThe Axa transaction the plan appointment of the proceeds from the upcoming capital raise are expected to drive meaningful AUM growth for for over the next couple of years.\n\nMoving to our key strategic growth initiatives, our origination ecosystem is proving increasingly valuable in a period of rising interest rates and tightened liquidity over the last 12 months origination volumes totaled 100 billion as we laid out at Investor day and included a higher proportion from proprietary origination platts.\n\nForms in the second quarter.\n\nWithin the context of market weakness and dislocation, we're taking measured steps to opportunistically grow the ecosystem in line with our longer term goals for.\n\nFor example, we recently announced the acquisition of lease plan and subsequent combination with wheels bomb to create a unified fleet management platform.\n\nThis is a prime example of our platform strategy acquire expertise bolt on tangential capabilities and a growing organically build scale pro forma for the obese planned integration, we expect fleet platform originations to total approximately 3 billion annually.\n\nOur capital solutions business or ECS had an outstanding quarter with record quarterly transaction fees of 103 million showcasing our ability to step in with private capital when other sources of liquidity dry up.\n\nThe full alignment we share with our retirement services balance sheet augmented by our strategic partner bottler is proving to be meaningful.\n\nDifferentiator for financing Counterparties since we can execute more transactions with greater skus scale uncertainties than ever before.\n\nOur value added in this environment is resonating with third party clients, who want to own pieces of what we do side by side with us through managed accounts were syndication.\n\nOne of our recent signature Acs transaction was at 2 billion financing for new fortress energy to form a liquefied natural gas maritime infrastructure platform.\n\nOver the last 24 months, we have grown our partnership with new fortress from from an initial $800 million alone.\n\nComprehensive financing partnership.\n\nThe transaction initially started as an equity investment from several pools of capital within our broader sustainable investing effort.\n\nWhen third party financing market shot we pivoted earn term internally and provided 1.15 billion of debt financing via our ECS platform.\n\nWhen most capital market participants would have stepped away we were able to complete our first ever fully financed debt and equity transaction and a one stop solution, all barnwell, providing flexible scale capital with certainty of execution.\n\nAs you've heard us talk about if you've heard us talk about before we act we are actively working to bring yield hybrid and retirement services capabilities to new geographies.\n\nWe took an important step in the second quarter and announced the launch of our New Asia Pacific Credit strategy with 1.25 billion in assets, including a 500 million an anchor investment from host plus a large superannuation fund in Australia. This commitment reflects the growing demand in the region for capital solutions from Nam.\n\nBank lenders with local expertise and origination capabilities.\n\nEarlier market on a couple of newer product creation within our global wealth platform, but we've also taken an important step within our existing product suite to help further democratization of finance.\n\nEarlier this week, we announced a transformative changes to accelerate the transition of the transition of our publicly traded BDC Apollo investment Corp into a pure play senior secured middle market BDC by an equity investment for mid cap our largest origination platform.\n\nWe view this change as a unique opportunity for individual investors to participate side by side with the largest institutional investors in the world.\n\nTo enable this shift in strategy, we're reducing fees for the BDC to industry, leading levels effective January one 2023.\n\nThe portfolio transition and revamp branding or not taking place and we are excited about the future of this vehicle alongside our broader global wealth platform.\n\nAs a scotsman, sometimes speaking about last quarter, where we're seeing seeking compelling growth opportunities in areas of white space that are tangential to some of our strongest and largest businesses.\n\nEarlier this morning, we announced a cornerstone commitment from long time strategic partner Abra Gobby investment authority or audio as part of a broad 4 billion.\n\nOf new commitments to launch a platform dedicated to G. P and L. P solutions, which we're calling sponsor and secondary solutions are short S. Three.\n\nOur goal is to provide a comprehensive set of secondary and fun finance capital solutions, including private equity credit and real asset secondary investments net asset value loans G. P running staking and much more you've already we've already been active in this space, having committed or deployed more than 13 billion of capital to .\n\nHands actions of this nature over the last 12 months.\n\nWe think we're uniquely positioned to grow the business over the long term.\n\nNo all the exciting developments I just walked through with just a highlight tour, which would indicate that we are busier than ever and see immense opportunity for the Apollo franchise to thrive in this market.\n\nPause, there and hand, it over to Martin to discuss our financial results.\n\nThanks, Jim and good morning, everyone.\n\nEchoing Mark and Jim sentiment second quarter results highlight the resiliency our earnings power in a period of heightened market dislocation and volatility.\n\nBefore diving into the details of the quarter I'd like to offer a few contextual points around this theme of earnings resiliency.\n\nFirst our fee related earnings continued to be driven primarily by management fees on as the investment manager for our suite of investment strategies and perpetual capital vehicles.\n\nYear to date, nearly 85% of our fee related revenue was comprised of management fees and a 2% was comprised of more volatile fei related to performance fees.\n\nWe have de minimus sensitivity to changes in interest rates or spreads which were previously.\n\nPreviously highlighted.\n\nIn a quarter, where equity markets declined by 16% treasuries sold off by 12% and spreads widened we experienced only an approximate 1% drag on our management fees from market driven declines.\n\nAnd despite investments that we've been making around the platform in preparation for our next like a multi year growth.\n\nDoing so in a margin conscious way, maintaining a high level of efficiency with an FRE margin level above the peer average.\n\nNext our spread related earnings are highly durable and possess all weather characteristics. Since they are largely generated by the performance of hold to maturity investment grade fixed income assets exceeding a predictable and persistent cost of funds, our simple financial model with massive strategic benefit.\n\nOver the past eight years S. Ari has had a 90% correlation with FRE.\n\nAnd historical credit losses have been below industry average amounting to single digit basis points per annum.\n\nFurthermore, the amount of ethane capital supporting S. A regeneration will decline over time due.\n\nDue to the increasing usage of third party sidecar capital fire Ada.\n\nGiven the attractiveness of this earnings profile to sophisticated institutional investors.\n\nGiven all these factors its clear that spread related earnings are both highly resilient and highly attractive.\n\nTurning now to results for the quarter total AUM reached a new record of $515 billion at the end of June increasing 9% year over year.\n\nDriven by robust inflows from both asset management and retirement services.\n\nSequentially, our U M increased modestly as strong inflows of $36 billion were offset by $16 billion of unrealized mark to market depreciation $11 billion of which related to a thorough as.\n\nAs well as $8 billion of normal course outflows from Athene and authority as.\n\nAs well as $7 billion of realizations.\n\nOur fee generating AUM, which is less sensitive to changes in market values increased by $5 billion on a sequential basis.\n\nImportantly, athene and a thorough our spread based businesses with duration match assets and liabilities and therefore higher rates or wider spreads do not negatively impact profitability.\n\nBut instead temporarily reduced AUM.\n\nInflows from our asset management business totaled $24 billion in the second quarter and included $8 billion of financing across several strategies such as credit strategies are cord five cord plus total return and several yield managed accounts as well as some of our newer funds, namely AAA.\n\nIn Asia Pacific credit.\n\nWe also added $8 billion of yield a O N E.\n\n$6 $5 billion of yield fee generating AUM from our acquisition of Griffith Capital's U S management business, which closed in early may.\n\nLooking to the second half of the year, we expect AUM will benefit from approximately $20 billion of identified inflows before consideration of organic was from ethane and other asset management fundraising.\n\nWe expect these identified inflows to include initial commitments for fun 10, additional third party commitments for AAA and a sizable state investment from audio for our SRA platform launch, which Jim just mentioned.\n\nSecond quarter, FRE totaled 341 million or 57 per share increasing 7% year over year.\n\nFee related revenues increased 14% year over year, demonstrating solid growth despite market weakness.\n\nManagement fees totaled $522 million and included $16 million of fees from the acquisition of Griffin capital.\n\nAs Jim noted transaction fees reached a new quarterly record of $103 million in the second quarter.\n\nCompensation and non compensation expenses inquiries increased sequentially as the impact of the Griffith acquisition and Ohio. Some head count continues to flow through our run rate cost base.\n\nEntering the back half of the year, we have a visible pipeline of fee related revenue growth driven by increasing management fees, including the commencement of fund 10 sometime in the fourth quarter as well as stronger transaction fees expected in the second half relative to the first half from our Acs business.\n\nWe also expect expenses in the second half of the year to continue to increase as we near the end of our accelerated growth phase.\n\nWe're highly confident in meeting our $2 35 per share FRE guidance for 2022, as we initially outlined at our Investor day, and which included lower growth in the first half of 'twenty, two and higher growth in the second half.\n\nLooking to 2023, we expect fee related revenue growth to exceed 20% due to broad based momentum across our established businesses as well as traction in newer growth initiatives to both Marc and Jim outlined.\n\nWith operating leverage improvements as the pace of investment spend at hiring normalizes.\n\nMoving to our retirement services segment, we generated SRA, a $442 million or 74 per share in the second quarter, which represents a net spread of 95 basis points as a percent of average net invested assets.\n\nNormalizing out alternative returns to 11%.\n\nAs we did in the first quarter by normalizing down to 11%.\n\nAnd excluding certain notable items.\n\nwas $535 million in the second quarter.\n\nEquivalent to a normalized net spread of 115 basis points.\n\nOn a sequential basis, our normalized net spread increased by seven basis points, primarily from higher net floating rate income.\n\nAs we've discussed before this earnings accretion from rising rates demonstrates the counter cyclicality.\n\nbusiness model, and we expect the benefit of higher rates to continue to ramp through Oh, sorry.\n\nIt seems alternatives portfolio generated a 6% annualized return in the second quarter.\n\nWhich was very resilient in light of a 66% annualized decline in the S&P 500, and an 11% annualized return in the first half of the year in.\n\nIn line with a normalized return assumption.\n\nA faint alternatives portfolio is highly diversified and constructed to generate equity like returns with significant downside protection.\n\nHalf of the portfolio was invested in Apollo and other fund investments, which generated an 8% annualized with China in the second quarter.\n\nThis strength was primarily from our investments in real estate, but benefited from cash flow.\n\nproperty specific updates.\n\nSpecific sorry, strategic origination platforms, which comprise about a quarter of a portfolio returned 7% in the quarter.\n\nSeveral of our investments continue to perform well given the contractual and predictable nature of the underlying assets.\n\nThe remaining portion of the alternative portfolio can sign strategic with Simon services investments, which had a 3% annualized return despite drag from one public position.\n\nRetirement services industry observers of observers are generally aware of an accounting policy change that is approaching next year called the long duration targeted improvement or L. D. G I.\n\nOther companies may experienced significant impacts to their balance sheets with the implementation of L. D. C O T G I.\n\nWe do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our results for capital levels. Given recent purchase GAAP accounting adjustments made in conjunction with the St merger close.\n\nTurning to principal investing we reported of $20 million or three cents per share in the second quarter.\n\nWe recognized realized performance fees of $151 million.\n\nFor the first half of the year, our comp ratio equaled, 57% and is trending towards our long term target of between 60% and 70%.\n\nGiven continued weakness in the public markets, we expect monetization activity will remain light in the back half of the year, which will likely result in for 2022 below our target of a dollar a share on average over the over the planning cycle.\n\nWe are using us our overall strong cash flow generation to capitalize on the current equity market dislocation.\n\nAs part of that five year plan, we expect to generate $15 billion of capital to use for shareholder value creation.\n\nIncluding five plan to fund the base dividend five plan.\n\nFor our strategic growth investments and.\n\n$5 billion for dividend growth and opportunistic buybacks.\n\nDuring the second quarter, we spent approximately $230 million to repurchase four 3 million shares from our opportunistic share purchase reauthorization.\n\nThis repurchase activity serve to offset the $3 9 million of shares issued related to our acquisition of Griffin capital.\n\nWe will continue to evaluate the benefit between allocating capital towards opportunistic buybacks and long term investments in view of our share price.\n\nWe feel very comfortable with our liquidity position in this macro backdrop at.\n\nAt the end of the quarter on that balance sheet value was $2 1 billion or approximately $3.50 per share, which included cash and equivalents of $2 billion.\n\nOur financial strength was further validated by third party rating agencies over the past few months and May Fitch upgraded the same ratings from a to a plus reflecting a vote of confidence in our earnings outlook and capital strength.\n\nAnd in July Moodys assigned strong first time investment grade ratings to both sides of the business.\n\nOne for insurance subsidiaries and a true for Pollo restaurant management.\n\nWithin their assessment Moodys cited ethane strong market positioning and capital levels.\n\nAs well as the scale breadth and performance of our asset management business.\n\nWe view these assessments as an important third party validation of the financial strength of the combined franchise.\n\nAnd the enhanced financial flexibility, we possess together.\n\nAnd with that I'll turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star one one on your telephone.\n\nPlease stand by while we compile the Q&A roster.\n\nOur first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr Evercore ISI.\n\nWe're interested in the .\n\nAAA product I wonder if I could ask a couple of quick follow ups on .\n\nOn the .\n\nFee structure liquidity and K 110 99.\n\nAnd then how the how the securities port over.\n\nYou know at what marks is there a third party involved.\n\nCurious on all that thanks, so much.\n\nGlenn. Thank you, it's mark I'll be somewhat circumspect on what I can say because we're not this is not a marketing of.\n\nAAA, but suffice it to say that essentially what investors are being allowed to do is to invest side by side with a roughly $10 billion portfolio of 180 different investments that have been curated specifically for athene over the past 12 to 13 years.\n\nIn terms of porting them over and the valuation of Athene has produced audited financials and NAV for as long as we've been having these conversations and in fact, there are visible marks every quarter and so you should assume that everything was ported over at Nab.\n\nIn terms of liquidity.\n\nFor Athene and for institutional investors.\n\nThey are coming in and they are essentially not theyre agreeing not to take liquidity for up to five years.\n\nFor Athene as you know we expect a themes participation in this to go from roughly $10 billion to $20 billion over the next five years just based on the forecast of Athene provided at Investor Day.\n\nFor investors who want.\n\nMore liquidity there is a slightly higher fee structure and liquidity is limited to 5% per quarter at NAV across the vehicle.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a replacement for equity.\n\nRather than private equity it has the characteristics of the benchmark, it's benchmarking against the S&P.\n\nWith historical volatility level more consistent with fixed income.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo hopefully that met.\n\nanswered all your questions.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexander from Goldman Sachs.\n\nActually Brian Daley on box, Alex I'm sorry.\n\nSo regarding the $13 billion that was committed thus far for fun and Youre expecting record contribution from our global wealth channel can you help us think through how much of that $13 billion was resolved distribution partners.\n\nThis is a reserve doing the same thing as a typical commitment and make me.\n\nCan you give us some color on who those distribution partners, what sort of categorically that would be very helpful to please.\n\nWell, let me let me just say that the vast vast majority is the institutional channel, which we know in which historically been part of us a non material amount was the was the non traditional institutional channel or the global wealth channels.\n\nFor parts of that but historically whenever we've gone off the global wealth channel they've all come back with commitments well in excess of their allocation. So that the big picture is really 13 billion. The big picture is really the institutional business has driven US now certainly as we've talked about global wealth, playing a larger part of our fund raising from 5% to a larger pool.\n\nAnd over time, they are participating in fund and fund and fund 10, but it's really a institutional story like it always has been.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from both of them.\n\nGood morning, everyone.\n\nMy first one is on cash flow I am curious how much capital did you dividend up to Apollo from this three at the insurance entities and QQ relative to $4 42.\n\nSpread related earnings.\n\nHey, Craig its model, so where where what are you using the same frame that we outlined last year, which is $750 million for you. So we just witnessed.\n\nClipping away that each quarter.\n\nThe thing is clearly.\n\nVery profitable and generating cash flow, but it's also growing.\n\nSignificantly and so we would expect that level of cash flow Australia to continue at current levels.\n\nWell, we evaluate that from time to time, but I think what I'm, saying is massive growth opportunities in front of it and that's contributed to the.\n\nSo the 'twenty 'twenty 4 billion of inflows so far this year.\n\nCraig assume it just evenly over four quarters.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patching doesn't eat from autonomous research.\n\nThanks.\n\nMy question is on capital.\n\nI guess Mark do you still view the stock as the best use of capital here and through that lens is is the kind of run rate a good guide for what you can do per quarter as long as the prices have slipped.\n\nLook we are.\n\nI don't want to think we're unique every management team thinks their stock is undervalued, we particularly think our stock is undervalued and we have the flexibility this quarter to buy it back and we did.\n\nAs I've said previously one needs to earn the money to spend before you get to spend it.\n\nSo we have a framework that we think about in terms of capital allocation, which Martin went through which is roughly $5 billion for the existing dividend 5 billion allocated to growth and $5 billion, which we have the potential to be flexible on and clearly at these current levels.\n\nThere's no lack of unanimity in the room.\n\nOur stock is the best place for that capital.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.\n\nFuchs.\n\nA bunch of questions on AAA I'll just limit it to a couple for now and get back in the queue. If theyre not answered subsequently, but maybe just.\n\nTo be clear on the investment strategy for this at this.\n\nVery similar to the Athene portfolio, that's debt profile on page 16, so kind of targeting a .\n\n11% normalized return.\n\nAnd then maybe any commentary on how if that's not the case, how this might be managed differently such as like having a dynamic allocation feature.\n\nAnd then if you're able to talk about the.\n\nThe performance fee structure at all in terms of just how we should be thinking about if this grows like you say mark you know to be the biggest fund how it can be adding to performance fee related fees and I imagine that's very different for the institutional classes versus the retail classes.\n\nLet me start let me start in reverse if not very different than what's interesting here.\n\nIs our approach to this this is a fund that we started down the road to create for high net worth.\n\nAnd.\n\nThe concept here was to really do something that the market had never seen before no capital calls no J curve $10 billion of align capital.\n\nSome liquidity for high net worth no liquidity for institutions.\n\nNo two layers of fees.\n\nThat's a large institutional investor you should assume strikes the hardest bargain and is generally the lowest fee payer. So we start with the notion that we should not charge fees on top of that and that the investors should have the single best experience.\n\nThe way that manifests itself in terms of positivity for our business is we had $10 billion of capital that is now $15 billion of capital, which is accelerating our investments in platforms. It's accelerating our investments in co invest and accelerating our investments in new funds and the underlying economics are.\n\nSimply pass through it's a flywheel. This is how we scale our business. What was interesting is although we designed this product for for retail along the way to the retail launch three very large institutions. Thus far have concluded that this actually meets all of their needs.\n\nDiversification by vintage and byproduct.\n\nNo no capital calls no two levels of fees and so we are fortunate to be able to launch the product with $15 billion of commitments 10 in house and five from three large institutional investors.\n\nI am very optimistic as to how this goes but like every retail product, it's now up to us to implement and to prove success.\n\nI also like that our benchmark here is.\n\nHe is not private equity private equity as I've said previously is a fabulous business, but it is not infinitely scalable what I like about this is we have lots of opportunities to scale. It.\n\nCause the return targets.\n\nI'm not advertisers are are much more consistent with premiums to S&P 500 and premiums to wear.\n\nWe have assumed a normalized rate of return rather than something that begins with a two handle or high teens.\n\nSo hopefully that's sufficient.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of roof, that's known from bank of Montreal.\n\nOh, great. Good morning, Thanks for taking my question.\n\nWanted to come back to the global wealth business and I appreciate your comments on on AAA, but.\n\nYou talked about one to two new product per quarter for several quarters and I was curious how how does that pipeline look and what products are you, particularly excited about.\n\nBeyond AAA. Thank you.\n\nSure. Thank you for your question. So when we were at Investor Day last year, we really talked about having a we talk about products really in two big buckets perpetual products and episodic products and you know at that period of time, we arguably had you know three to four products one in a perpetual area I apologize solutions and.\n\nCouple of more in the in the episodic turning the clock forward to 'twenty and where we are right now.\n\nWe really have almost nine products are in the perpetual probably a handful more of an actual number.\n\nPerpetual products and episodic products.\n\nAnd you know at that period of time, we arguably had you know.\n\nThree to four products one in a perpetual area, our power solutions and a couple more in the in the episodic.\n\nTurning the clock forward.\n\nTwo , where we are right now.\n\nReally have almost nine products in the perpetual probably a handful more of an actual than we do in the episodic.\n\nYou all know about the Apollo that solutions are non traded BDC people also may recall that when we did the Griffin transaction, we inherited a couple of vehicles. So really the product set is growing its broad we're making sure. It was a theme here that your that the Mark has mentioned we wanted to obviously.\n\nYou know execute on what has been proven to garner demand some yield in D C and re products, but we have a variety of a broader approach that we're bringing so very very happy with not only the .\n\nFeet on the ground in the wholesaling in product creation and selling agreements, but the product set is really investors think about the investments maybe what it competes with as an asset class.\n\nAnd is there any sensitivity there.\n\nTwo credit spreads moving in and out.\n\nAgain, it's Mark I'll start with the answer is no we run a matched book and we offset.\n\nThe liabilities that we take on in the retirement services business with fixed income at roughly the same time, we take them on changes in credit spreads do not matter.\n\nThe initial Ada was for a three and a quarter billion.\n\nADM has performed extraordinarily well as I, sometimes joke with some of you.",
    "content2": "Those are in particular, who have had a more negative view of retirement services, it's such a negative business that investors compete and pay us fees to be able to invest in retirement services.\n\nWe expect to go out and raise a successor to to .\n\nBased on the success and performance of , which is well ahead of the benchmarks promised investors and we'd expect that the fund would be somewhere in the three and a half to $5 billion range consistent with how we see growth in the retirement services sector in the U S.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerry O'hara from Jefferies.\n\nThanks for taking my question. This morning, I guess with respect to the the allocation to alternatives within the the Athene portfolio. This is clearly proving to be a strong diversified return stream. So curious if there's any consideration of increasing that allocation and then I suppose on a related basis.\n\nIs there any concern of increased regulatory oversight as it's clearly some of your peers have taken a similar approach. Thank you.\n\nSo the answer is we historically at Athene have run a 95% plus minus fixed income book of which better than 90% of that is investment grade and there is no plan to deviate for that or to take increased exposure to alternative investments in in terms of.\n\nOf regulation.\n\nRetirement services is a regulated business.\n\nWe have over the past 12 to 13 years develop the expertise to operate in this business.\n\nAnd fully expect to continue to operate in the manner and the methods by which we have operated to date.\n\nI think there has been significant tuition paid.\n\nOver a better part of a decade.\n\nWhich others, who would like to do what we have done are going to need to pay.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer.\n\nasked and answered thank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS.\n\nMy question wanted to ask about organic growth in retirement services. The business update you pointed out the historical kind of ability and willingness to shift the emphasis among the four different channels based on prevailing conditions. So assuming your overall target.\n\nis still good for this year, just wondering given the distinct backdrop that we have right now where youre seeing opportunities and where maybe you're you're hanging back a little bit more thank you.\n\nLook the two strongest channels are clearly the retail fixed annuity channel, which is going as strong as it has ever gone I mean, I think Jim Martin decided that applications are up 100% year over year record quarters record weeks almost every week.\n\nThe other place we're seeing really strong.\n\nBoth is in pension group annuities, the tick up in rates to tick up and spreads have given those entities that we're close to being able to close out an older retirement plan.\n\nGreater ability to do that.\n\nAnd we're watching that very carefully and have a very strong first six months were also seeing good progress on reinsurance, particularly on a flow basis.\n\nThe one engine that you would expect that is not firing.\n\nIs the FAA the end market, which is negatively impacted by higher rates and higher spreads.\n\nBut theres been plenty to do.\n\nAnd the numbers as you know are well beyond the record year that we had last year and continue to be very strong and they are actually quite strong across the industry.\n\nThis has been a pretty good year for the whole sector. Although if you don't have lots of excess capital, you're not really able to take full advantage of it.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous research.\n\nMy follow up was asked thank you.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.\n\nYes.\n\nBrian .\n\nOne moment, while the participants line mode.\n\nHis line will be opened momentarily.\n\nWe can move ahead to the next question.\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI.\n\nOkay.\n\nGlen.\n\nOkay.\n\nPardon me one moment, while his line.\n\nHello.\n\nOkay.\n\nYes.\n\nYeah.\n\nMaybe that's a good place to end it if we're experiencing technical difficulties.\n\nOn behalf of our team I'd just like to thank everyone. Joining for joining this morning and for your continued interest in our business of course, if you add as usual if you have any follow up questions on anything discussed on today's call. Please feel free to reach out to us and we of course look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks.\n\nThanks, everyone.\n\nYeah.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating you may now disconnect."

(Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded. This call may include forward-looking statements and projections, which do not guarantee future events or performance. Please refer to Apollo's most recent SEC filings for risk factors related to these statements.\nApollo will also be discussing certain non-GAAP measures on this call, which management believes are relevant in assessing the financial performance of the business. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to the GAAP figures in Apollo's earnings presentation, which is available on the company's website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Apollo fund.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Noah Gunn, Global Head of Investor Relations.\n\nNoah Gunn\n\nMD & Global Head of IR, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, operator, and welcome again, everyone, to our call this morning. Our fourth quarter and full year [2021] results reported earlier today reflect Apollo's financial results on a stand-alone basis, before consideration of our recent merger with Athene, which closed on January 1. That said, we will briefly touch on key highlights from Athene's results, which were issued separately this morning.\nIn addition, we posted a financial supplement on our website, which updates our fourth quarter and full year results in our new post-merger financial construction. Beginning next quarter, this will be our primary view, including contributions from our 3 new segments, and will illustrate our combined earnings power.\nFee-related earnings reached a quarterly record of $309 million or $0.67 per share in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion or $2.68 per share for full year 2021. In terms of distributable earnings, we reported $1.05 of DE per share for the fourth quarter and an annual record of $4.56 per share for full year 2021, which is more than double the level we earned in 2020.\nJoining me this morning to discuss all the business momentum we are seeing at Apollo and our results in further detail are Marc Rowan, CEO; Jim Zelter, Co-President; and Martin Kelly, CFO. We look forward to addressing all your questions following the conclusion of our prepared remarks.\nAnd with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.\n\nMarc Jeffrey Rowan\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThank you, Noah. Good morning to all. Thank you for spending time with us. As I often say, I'm fortunate to lead a company in an industry that gets better every day. Our industry is driven by powerful trends, demographics, generational transfer of wealth, low rates and the extreme correlation and indexification of equity and fixed income markets. I am even more fortunate to lead a company with tremendous momentum and with a unique business model in the alternatives industry.\n2021 was a transformational year for Apollo. AUM is a record; fundraising, a record; modernizations, a record; origination, a record; 424 people joined our platform, another record; and turnover was the lowest it's been in a very long time.\nWe achieved 15% year-over-year FRE growth without any sizable inorganic activity and without a flagship fund, which, as all of you know, is in the cards for 2022. As excited as I was for 2021, 2022 should be even brighter. At our very detailed Investor Day in October, we communicated a strategic vision and financial plan.\nIn just a few short months, we have made significant progress against that plan, recall the 3 pillars of that plan or the 3 key bets as we like to say. One was the growth in our retail business and retail franchise, which I will touch on, and Jim Zelter will spend more time on. The second, origination, which is the capacity to originate investments and, therefore, continue to provide above-average rates of return per unit of risk for our clients and the third in our Capital Markets segment. Let me take a second and just briefly touch on each of those 3 bets.\nIn origination, we originated $37 billion in the fourth quarter. We're now running well over $100 billion on an annual basis. Recall why this is important. Our market sometimes loses sight of what's in short supply. Capital as a general matter is plentiful, and it is assets that offer appropriate risk rewards that are in short supply. Therefore, we are incredibly focused on growing our capacity to originate assets that offer attractive risk rewards. They are, in fact, the limiter on our growth rather than the capacity to raise money. Every attractive asset that we originate across our platform has a home in a fund, in a co-invest, on a retirement services balance sheet or through syndication. In short, it is never capital that is in short supply, it is assets, and we are micro focused on scaling origination.\nPlatforms, which are recurring originations, are a very significant portion of our strategy. In the fourth quarter alone, we added Aqua Finance in Consumer, Petros Pace Finance in solar, Alliant Inventory Solutions in partnership with BNP, and the momentum continues. No one is doing what we are doing at the size and scale, and we've talked a lot in our industry about permanent capital. I'm much more interested in talking with you about permanent origination.\nIn Global Wealth, as you know, we announced the acquisition of Griffin. Griffin Capital is a meaningful accelerator to build out our global wealth platform. We also made, during the quarter, strategic investments in 2 technology companies to facilitate the growth of our distribution businesses. Case and ICAP are 2 of the leading technology platforms, helping financial advisers access alternative strategies. Tech-enabled distribution is a must-have for anyone hoping to serve this market.\nWe also saw early product success in the channel. Our BDC, Apollo Debt Solutions, is off to a very strong start, which Jim Zelter will take you through. I continue to believe that democratization of finance is one of the most powerful tailwinds driving our platform. If you think about our industry and us, in particular, we, in the alternatives industry, have spent better than 30 years on the cutting edge of creating products and services, primarily for large global institutions who are not taxpayers. We have an opportunity now as a result of increasing sophistication of retail investors, increasing technology, increased democratization and legalization of opportunity and this massive generational transfer of wealth, to take that brainpower and focused on creating products and services that are bespoke for this particular channel. Early iterations of serving this channel have been very successful but really are the first step. They are nothing more than the institutionalization of products that already exist.\nI view the real steps here as creating unique products and services that are designed for this channel. And given our experience with Athene, which you will hear, we have tremendous insight into what it takes at a granular level to make be successful in this channel.\nOn Capital Solutions, again, Jim will go in more detail. Suffice it to say, 2021 revenues in Capital Solutions were up 20% year-over-year. And as you know, our plan that we've communicated is a doubling of capital solutions revenue over the next 5 years. Significant landmark transaction, which I know Jim will touch on in the fourth quarter, is SoftBank, which will help you imagine where we're going with Capital Solutions.\nNoah touched briefly on our quarterly reporting. This is the last quarter that we will report on a stand-alone basis with the Athene merger having closed on January 1. Athene had an awesome 2021. As good a year as Apollo had, Athene had an even better year: record profitability, earning more than $2 billion; record organic inflows, more than $37 billion of organic inflows, not only record inflows across all 4 of its business channels, but the returns at which this new business was underwritten, significantly exceeded the compelling mid-teens target that we have. With the merger closed and collaboration and creativity ongoing, I see nothing but upside from the combination that closed just a month ago.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't touch on the market. Everywhere I go, people want to understand the impact of current market trends on our business. My standard answer, if you think about the environment we've been in for the past 10 years, purchase price has not mattered. The more risk you took, the more outrageous, generally the higher the payoff. We have seen a significant correction across equity markets as a result of revaluations. We have also seen a significant change in fixed income markets as a result of Central Bank activity.\nOur platform is built for purchase price matters. We have achieved amazing results over the past decade in a market that has not necessarily been kind to our strategy and where our patient value-oriented, disciplined approach to capital deployment has not been rewarded. I believe we are in the right place at the right time. I believe the 2022 fund raise for APOLLO 10, that will be very successful as we offer our large institutional clients a different approach to how to get return in a market that is -- seems to have lost a bit of the go-go spirit.\nLet me pivot to merger and governance as I get ready to hand over to Jim Zelter, who is chomping at the bit to take over. The merger with Athene closed on January 1. The next chapter is very exciting, low risk of execution, as we know each other incredibly well, having worked together for the past 12, 13 years. We are adding the 1,400-person Athene team to the roughly 2,000 Apollo employees; pro forma 3,500 total employees, approximately $40 billion of market cap.\nIn addition to the Mira merger, this was an opportunity for us to complete the governance changes that we have had hinted at and been very explicit at throughout the last year. We are 1 share, 1 vote. We are a 2/3 independent Board. We have an independent Chair. And we have all of the requisite requirements to be eligible for broad index inclusion.\nNow let me conclude. I often say, I started our Strategy Day by really pointing out that culture beats strategy every day. We have built an incredible culture. The marketplace understands the long-term benefit of what we are building and is helping us to win the war on talent. People are attracted to the clear strategic vision, the authentic nature of the people they meet and our cultural values. As I suggested, we added 424 employees in 2021. While very exciting, we're not likely to repeat that in 2022, having made significant progress. These are senior hires across global wealth, origination, finance, Asia Pacific. We have incredible momentum going into 2022. The team is eager to execute the plan we have articulated for you. We're excited about the next chapter and a more profitable One Apollo and ready to take the hill.\nLet me now turn it over to my partner, Jim Zelter.\n\nJames Charles Zelter\n\nCo-President, Managing Partner, CIO of Credit Business & Director, Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marc. 2021 was indeed a banner year for Apollo, as Marc described. We remain squarely focused on driving excess recurrent returns across the spectrum from fixed income replacement up to private equity in order to deliver the investment alpha that our clients entrust us to provide. Our record deployment activity exemplifies our ability to source recurring transactions at scale as well as the expanding diversification of the platform.\nIn our Private Equity business, we committed and invested more capital over the last 2 years than in any other period in our history, totaling $20 billion. We believe we can deploy capital at a similar rate in '22, especially, as Marc described, the recent market volatility persists. Additionally, our committed-but-unfunded pipeline ended the quarter nearly $8 billion, primarily comprised of Lumen Technologies and the Venetian transaction.\nOur near-term pipeline of potential transactions remain strong with Fund IX 78% committed at the end of the fourth quarter, and we have approximately $5 billion of dry powder to commit before the management fees from Fund X turn on. More recently, with the rotation from growth to value over the past several months, Apollo's vision itself as a solution provider in the marketplace, providing a differentiated tool kit to our clients. The recent dislocation and heightened volatility should create attractive capital deployment opportunities across numerous investor areas of the firm.\nOur hybrid value funds, the credit franchise, broadly speaking, and our partnership with Motiv allow us to provide creative, flexible solutions across the capital structure for companies in need.\nMoving on to debt origination. Total originations surged during the fourth quarter, as Marc said, reaching $37 billion. The uptick in fourth quarter origination volume was driven by strong high-grade alpha, middle market direct lending and commercial real estate volumes. Within high-grade alpha, a strategy where we can showcase our abilities as a solution provider, we generated particularly strong activity. In 1 notable transaction, we completed a $4 billion loan to SoftBank, secured by their second Vision Fund. Our ability to deliver this magnitude of capital in a relatively short time frame via discrete bilateral negotiation is exactly why our clients partner with us. You should expect to hear more about these types of large-scale transactions as our platform continues to expand.\nHigher levels of origination volumes are also driving higher transaction fees in our Capital Solutions business. Fourth quarter and full year fees of $94 million and $298 million, respectively, reached new heights. And it's worth noting that we completed approximately 80 ACS transactions in 2021, which is double the volume we created a year prior.\nAs Marc touched on, we announced several new origination platform investments over the past few months that will help grow our supply of recurring origination volume. Importantly, Athene funded the equity commitment in all 3 of these investments as part of their normal course investment strategy, demonstrating the capital efficiency of our model.\nOne, we announced our pending acquisition of a controlling stake in consumer lender, Aqua Finance, which will extend our access to quality consumer loans. In 2021, Aqua originated nearly $2 billion of loans in the consumer arena, which represents a double over the past 3 years.\nWe also announced and closed our acquisition of Petros PACE Finance, a platform that provides significant deployment opportunity for Apollo and Athene to support clean energy real estate transactions. PACE has originated over $700 million in long-term fixed rate financing since 2016, and we expect rapid growth in that sector as the market expands and we confront sustainable construction and regulatory climate mandates.\nFinally, an important transaction was our strategic announcement with BNP Paribas to create Eliant inventory solutions. Eliant provides domestic and multinational companies with strategic and responsive inventory capital solutions to better optimize their supply chain and balance sheets. Backed by strong client demand at launch, we expect the platform to generate a multibillion-dollar level of annual flows beginning this year.\nThese 3 platforms really are great examples of our broader fixed income replacement vision at work. While we are excited about the progress we've already achieved to broaden our origination, there is still significant runway to scale our existing platforms and fill in additional growth white space.\nAt the macro level, we believe the evolving interest rate backup will create tactical opportunities to position our client portfolios into more favorable higher-yielding assets. As the market confronts a potentially higher rate environment, financial conditions are indeed tightening and risk premiums are increasing. For the last several years, there have been many -- there have been concerned about our ability to generate attractive returns in a perpetually low-rate environment. However, we always found ways to be successful and leaned into origination, and now we have an expansive ecosystem ready to capitalize on a market with potentially higher rates and certainly higher risk premiums. As we've said before, the fixed income replacement trend is just getting started, and we are certainly well positioned regardless of the rate environment.\nMoving on to monetization activity. We had another strong year of realizations totaling $4 billion, including more than $3 billion from our Private Equity platform. For the full year, Private Equity realizations reached an annual record of $19 billion, as Fund VIII and increasingly Fund IX are in harvesting mode. Looking forward, we expect our realization super cycle to continue. That said, if the current market correction persists, some of our planned term realizations may be pushed out to later in the year.\nTurning to investment performance. We had a strong year of performance across our entire franchise. Our Private Equity portfolio appreciated 48% in 2021, outperforming the S&P by over 20%. And additionally, our flagship fund performance remains exceptional, with Fund IX generating a gross IRR of 48% and 30% net. And I'll mention, Fund IX's portfolio is still relatively young, and we believe there is a lot of embedded value still to come.\nOur inaugural hybrid value fund continues to perform very well, generating a growth of 29% and 23% net. And in credit, our portfolio saw 1.6% of gross appreciation in the fourth quarter and more than 10% for the full year.\nFinally, our structured credit debt origination strategies had particularly strong performance, both outperforming their respective benchmarks by a remarkable 1,100 basis points in 2021.\nIn terms of capital raising, total inflows of $24 billion in the fourth quarter were strong, bringing full year inflows to $67 billion. As Marc mentioned, we raised a record amount of capital from third-party clients in a non-flagship fundraising year with $23 billion of total inflows. Athene added $37 billion of inflows, including 9 in the fourth quarter alone.\nThird-party fundraising in the fourth quarter totaled $8 billion, increasing from $5 billion average pace through the third quarter. and fourth quarter fundraising included healthy inflows from Accord plus EPF IV, and our second infrastructure fund, which held its final close in the quarter. Importantly, we launched the fundraising for Fund X in January and are encouraged by the early reception. We feel confident in raising our targeted $25 billion in capital and think our differentiated investment strategy, grounded in value while embracing innovation resonates, particularly well in this current market backdrop.\nWe successfully launched our nonlisted credit BDC, Apollo Debt Solutions, in November with a single platform in Asia and Europe, and expanded distribution to the domestic platform in the beginning of January. Early reception of our marketing efforts have been extremely positive, and we raised over $1 billion of equity proceeds to date since product launched 2 months ago. When our exclusivity period ends in March, we will broaden distribution to other wire houses, several RIAs and at the independent broker-dealer channel via our strategic distribution partnerships. Additionally, we've invested heavily in product development and are currently working on several other funds tailored for the mass-affluent market.\nIn December, we did announce the agreement to acquire Griffin, which is strategically important in our accelerating our multipronged 5-year global wealth strategy. A year ago, we were more limited in our global wealth capabilities, but with the launch of ADS as well as Griffin, we now have proof of concept on product and distribution capability. When Griffin closes, which is expected to occur in the first half of this year, we will have roughly 130 people working across the platform. With Griffin specifically, we expect to broaden our reach in the U.S. wealth market and independent broker-dealers, providing us with new foothold in that channel. We're continuing to add the resources and capabilities across various retail distribution channels in conjunction with the Griffin team.\nIn terms of our outlook for 2022, we feel comfortable meeting or exceeding our $80 billion organic inflow target that we communicated in the fall. We are seeing a robust pipeline in Athene and momentum across third-party fundraising initiatives, including a strong start at ADS, as I've previously mentioned; and incremental Griffin -- flow at Griffin gives us great comfort.\nLooking back to 2021, we couldn't be more excited about the evolution of the franchise. We continue to expand the dialogue with our global investor base and continue to provide solutions to companies seeking to raise capital. We have leading returns in flagship Private Equity. We've launched nascent strategies with strong early performance and client traction, including hybrid value in the infrastructure equity business. Our yield platform is expanding along with the continued build-out of our front-end origination platforms. We're syndicating more dollars alongside a growing capital solutions business, and we're seeing increased demand for our third-party retirement services. We are excited to demonstrate meaningful progress against our goals, which we laid out in the fall.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to my partner, Martin, who will discuss our financial results.\n\nMartin Bernard Kelly\n\nCFO & Co-COO, Apollo Global Management, LLC\n\nGreat. Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'll provide a brief overview of our stand-alone results and then bridge to our 2022 outlook for the combined businesses.\nOur full year after-tax DE of $2 billion was very strong and roughly doubled from 2020 levels, as Noah mentioned, driven by a sizable step-up in PE realization activity and mid-teens FRE growth. Management fees increased 14% year-over-year, which included more than 20% growth in our credit and real assets businesses. And transaction fees were up 19% year-over-year, while fee-related expenses grew 19%, reflecting our comp- and noncomp-driven investment for growth. Our full year FRE margin of 54% was in line with our expectations.\nIn mid-January, we filed a financial supplement containing historical information for our new post-merger segment reporting. And in late January, we filed an 8-K outlining merger-related updates and certain financial items. Beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will report results for 3 operating segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services and principal investing, with fee-related earnings, FRE; spread-related earnings, SRE; and principal investing income, PII, as their primary performance metrics looking forward.\nStrong results by Apollo and Athene in 2021 provide us with momentum as we head into 2022, positioning us well to achieve our 5-year targets. As previously communicated, we expect after-tax DE of approximately $3.3 billion or $5.50 per share in 2022. We expect approximately 90% of these earnings to be comprised of highly stable and recurring FRE and SRE.\nIn our Asset Management segment, we expect the following trends to drive our FRE in the year ahead. Fee-related revenues should see attractive growth in 2022, with management fee growth around the mid- to high-teens level, and our plan suggests transaction fees growing at a faster pace than they did in 2021.\nIn terms of fee-related expenses, as you know, we have been making significant investments in talent and infrastructure to drive higher FRE growth and capture the next significant leg of growth we believe is attainable. We've made many great additions across our platform and continued to attract high-caliber individuals. We are managing this growth in the context of the glide path we've laid out, which is for our comp ratio to start moving from roughly 30% toward our longer-term target of 25% over the next 5 years.\nOn the non-comp side, we are in the midst of rebasing in 2022 as we absorb the infrastructure costs, including technology and occupancy of supporting our larger team. Putting the pieces together, we expect an FRE margin of approximately 54% to 55% in 2022, putting us on a path higher towards our 60%-plus goal by 2026. We expect this will drive at least $1.4 billion of pretax FRE in 2022 or $2.35 per share.\nIn our Retirement Services segment, we are on track to deliver our 2022 objectives outlined at our Investor Day. We expect low double-digit growth in net invested assets, driven by the healthy organic growth expectations that Jim mentioned. From these assets, less fully loaded funding costs and overhead, we expect the segment to generate a net spread of approximately 110 to 115 basis points. This spread translates to pretax SRE in excess of $2 billion in 2022 or approximately $3.35 per share. Embedded within this earnings profile is an expectation for a normalized return on Athene's alternative investments of approximately 10%, following a particularly strong return in 2021, amidst a robust market backdrop.\nIn our Principal Investing segment, we believe we have a favorable tailwind at our back from having 2 flagship Private Equity funds in harvesting mode. So as Jim mentioned earlier, the timing of realization can be impacted if the market correction persists. Our best expectation for the income contribution in PII heading into a new year is to align around our forecast over a multiyear horizon. This equates to approximately $500 million of pretax income or $0.80 per share on average over the next 5 years.\nYou should think of us as net beneficiaries of a rising rate environment. Jim mentioned the opportunities created by a higher-rate environment, which we believe will benefit FRE. The only part of our revenue that is susceptible to a decline from rising rates are management fees earned from net asset value rather than committed or invested capital. Historically, the most notable pool of assets with this basis was Athene's fixed income assets. Following a recently agreed-upon adjustment to the investment management agreement with Athene, our basis for earning management fees will now be book value for the vast majority of Athene's assets. This change will serve to mitigate management fee volatility from changes in rates or spreads.\nFurther, with regard to potential SRE impacts from rising rates, approximately 20% of Athene's portfolio is in floating rate securities. While there are some offsets, we would expect a 25 basis point parallel shift up in the curve to drive an incremental $30 million to $40 million of annual SRE, representing low single-digit accretion on distributable earnings.\nTurning to capital allocation. We expect to generate $15 billion of capital for investment over the next 5 years as we discussed at our Investor Day, which is illustratively earmarked as $5 billion of capital to fund our expected annual base dividend of $1.60 per share, $5 billion of capital for dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases and another $5 billion of growth capital. The impact of the latter $10 billion is not reflected in our base targets. While we will evaluate opportunities on a case-by-case basis, we will most likely look to deploy the majority of the growth capital towards strategic ventures in the near term that will accelerate FRE growth.\nWe declared a dividend of $0.40 per share in the fourth quarter and have allocated approximately $1 billion to fund the annual dividend under this policy in 2022.\nIn conjunction with the merger close, we announced a $1.5 billion opportunistic buyback authorization, along with another $1 billion for equity immunization. This new repurchase program provides additional flexibility to return capital to shareholders and drive accretion on an open-ended basis. We intend to prioritize strategic growth investments given the pipeline we see, many of which we expect will drive additional growth in fee-related earnings above and beyond our base plan, recent examples of iCapital Chase and incremental equity investment in Athora and our all-stock acquisition of Griffin.\nTo conclude and punctuate our overall message this morning, our business is firing on all cylinders. Our fundamental business drivers are reaching record levels, and we're making huge strides in pursuit of our strategic goals. We had a very busy and successful 2021, and we're well positioned to execute on our clear strategic vision and deliver results for our shareholders and clients.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions.",

Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\n[Audio Gap] Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K.\nWe'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the Shareholders page of our website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nQuickly on results. We reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $1.2 billion. Distributable earnings were $1.9 billion or $1.52 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $1.29 per share, which will be paid to holders of record as of November 3.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our call. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the horrific shooting that occurred at our New York City offices on July 28. The random attack resulted in multiple deaths, including our beloved colleague, Wesley LePatner. Wesley was a wife and mother and a dear friend and mentor to many within and outside of our firm. We will greatly miss Wesley. We'll continue to honor her legacy.\nWe are also grateful for the bravery of our building security team, along with the New York Police Department, who responded that day and who put themselves in harm's way every day to protect others.\nTurning to our results, Blackstone reported an outstanding third quarter. Distributable earnings increased nearly 50% year-on-year to $1.9 billion, as Weston mentioned, underpinned by a 26% growth in fee-related earnings and a more than doubling of net realizations. Inflows reached $54 billion, the fourth consecutive quarter in excess of $50 billion, and totaled $225 billion for the last 12 months. Our fundraising success lifted assets under management to a new industry record of $1.24 trillion.\nAnd looking forward, I believe our prospects for growth are strong today is at any point in the firm's history. The structural tailwinds driving the alternative sector are accelerating with Blackstone as the reference firm. More investors are being introduced to the benefits of private market solutions than ever before, with growing adoption across the vast private wealth and insurance channels.\nAnd following the U.S. administration's areas in executive order, we expect the defined contribution market to open to alternatives over time as well. In these areas, the powerful advantages of our brand, scale and breadth of capabilities are even more pronounced.\nAt the same time, institutional limited partners are increasing their allocations to alternatives in multiple areas, and they're consolidating relationships with the best performing managers who can provide comprehensive multi-asset solutions.\nMeanwhile, in terms of deployment, the scope of where we invest continues to expand significantly as we scale our platforms in digital and energy infrastructure, private credit, Asia, the secondaries market for alternatives and other key growth areas. We are in the early innings of penetrating markets of enormous size and potential.\nIn addition to these secular forces, we're also now seeing the deal cycle turn, creating another significant tailwind for the firm. The combination of a resilient economy, declining cost of capital and equity markets at all-time highs is leading to a resurgence in capital markets activity. including global IPO issuance, which more than doubled year-over-year in the third quarter.\nNotwithstanding the current government's shutdown, more conducive capital markets should lead to greater realizations for Blackstone, which, in turn, support fundraising and deployment. In the last 3 months, we executed 3 successful IPOs. And our IPO pipeline for the next 12 months, if converted, would translate to one of the largest years of issuance in our history.\nDespite all these positive developments, over the past several weeks, there's been a significant external focus on the implications of certain credit defaults in the market. These events have been erroneously linked to the traditional private credit market as a result of misunderstandings and misinformation.\nImportantly, the defaults and focus resulted from bank-led and bank syndicated credits, not private credit. Moreover, these situations are widely believed to involve the fraudulent pledging of the same collateral to multiple parties.\nThe traditional private credit model is characterized by direct origination in the context of a long-term hold strategy, with due diligence performed by sophisticated institutional managers and rigorously negotiated documentation.\nFor Blackstone, our $150 billion-plus direct lending platform is comprised of over 95% senior secured debt, with low loan-to-value ratios of less than 50% on average, meaning there is significant borrower capital subordinate to our positions in nearly all cases from companies backed by financial sponsors or public companies.\nAnd in the private investment-grade area, we've concentrated our activities in multitrillion-dollar markets where Blackstone is often a leading player, including data centers, energy infrastructure and real estate, with our loans secured by underlying assets of excellent quality.\nOur long-term, highly disciplined approach to investing in credit is the foundation of the strong results we've produced in this area as with every business at the firm.\nOur non-investment grade private credit strategies have generated 10% returns annually, net of all fees since inception, nearly 20 years ago. In direct lending specifically, we've experienced annual realized losses of only 1/10 of 1%, including through the global financial crisis. And our investment-grade focused private credit platform in BXCI has experienced zero realized losses to date.\nOf course, as the cycle progresses, it's reasonable to assume we'll see some increases in defaults. But we believe our structural advantages will continue to produce superior results. Performance has powered our growth in private credit. And we believe it will continue to power our growth in the future.\nStepping back, this month, we celebrate Blackstone's 40th anniversary. It's been, I can assure you, an extraordinary journey. The firm has grown from a start-up in 1985 to the largest alternative asset manager in the world today and one of the 50 largest public companies in the United States. Importantly, we achieved almost all of this growth organically, which is quite distinctive among large firms in our industry.\nWe are business builders at Blackstone, not business buyers. And while it's harder to build a business than buy it, over the past 40 years, we methodically planted seeds that would grow into major market-leading platforms in nearly every area in which we operate.\nWhat we've achieved over the past 4 decades would not have been possible without the efforts of three extraordinary individuals, who worked alongside me to either start the firm or to take it to the next level. Pete Peterson, my co-founder, gave us the necessary credibility that provided the launchpad for our growth.\nHe was joined in 2002 by Tony James, who helped professionalize the organization and led us into many new business areas.\nJohn Gray took over in 2018 and has done a remarkable job managing the firm and pioneering a plethora of new business lines and products. John also redefined our investment approach to emphasize thematic positioning, resulting in our concentration today in data centers, where we're the largest in the world; energy and power, logistics, private credit and India, among other winning areas.\nJohn, as did Tony and Pete during their time at Blackstone, demonstrates an unstoppable work ethic and profound care for the firm, its reputation and its people.\nEach of them changed the destiny of the firm. and have been the best partners for me that I could have imagined. I owed them all an enormous debt of gratitude.\nLooking forward, what's been built at Blackstone is ideally designed for the environment we see before us and to capture the generational shifts underway in the global economy and markets.\nIn terms of where we raise capital, we believe Blackstone is the partner of choice to bring the best of private markets to a rapidly expanding universe of investors. In terms of where we invest, the future requires massive capital solutions across all forms of equity and debt capital to power the AI revolution, to develop the infrastructure needed to meet the rising global demand for energy, to fund the extraordinary advancements in drug development in the life sciences area, to partner with large investment-grade-rated corporates, who are increasingly looking to private credit to meet their objectives; to help India meet its incredible growth potential and to drive forward other transformative megatrends that will define the investment landscape for decades to come.\nAlternatives will play a vital role in this future. And we see Blackstone leading the way with the largest and broadest platform and the deepest investment capabilities, underpinned by the power of our brand.\nThe firm has achieved much in the past 40 years. But I strongly believe the best is ahead. Thank you to our shareholders for joining us on this adventure. The adventure continues.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. What Steve has done to both create and continue to drive this firm for 40 years is the stuff of legend. I'd also like to emphasize what Steve said about [ Westley ]. She was an extraordinary woman, colleague and dear friend, simply the best of the best. We will miss her a ton.\nMoving to the quarter, this is an exciting time for the firm and our investors. The deal dam is finally breaking, and we have a bunch of secular tailwinds driving us forward as well. I'm going to focus my remarks specifically on the growing sources of capital inflows at the firm.\nIn corporate and real estate credit, we crossed the $500 billion milestone, up a remarkable 18% year-over-year. In private wealth, our AUM in the channel grew 15% year-over-year to nearly $290 billion. And in our institutional business, we're seeing strong momentum across numerous areas in our drawdown and open-ended vehicles.\nDiving into credit, private credit markets are expanding from their origins in noninvestment-grade corporate credit and direct lending to become a key mechanism for financing the real economy, including commercial finance, consumer and residential finance, fund finance and of course, infrastructure.\nBlackstone is tremendously well positioned to lead this evolution as the largest third-party investment manager in credit globally, alongside our continuous innovation.\nNotably, our infrastructure and asset-based credit business grew 29% year-over-year to $107 billion, one of the fastest-growing areas at the firm. Our scale gives us access to what we believe is the broadest set of opportunities across the risk spectrum, which we can offer holistically to clients. As a result, we're seeing robust demand for multi-asset credit solutions across our 3 I's, institutions, insurance companies and individual investors.\nAnother important development underway in credit markets is the rising opportunity to partner with large investment-grade rated corporates, which we've discussed previously. Fortune 500 companies with substantial funding needs are increasingly looking to private credit for customized long-duration capital solutions, which are difficult to replicate in public markets.\nScale and reputation are key. And Blackstone has established ourselves as a partner of choice, following our landmark transactions with EQT Corp and Rogers Communications. In the third quarter, we executed another major partnership, a $7 billion investment we are leading in a venture with energy infrastructure company [ Cempra, ] to support construction of a liquefied natural gas project on the Gulf Coast.\nThese corporate partnerships provide our clients with access to high-quality, directly originated investments in a sector where we have high conviction, as always, without taking on balance sheet risk.\nMeanwhile, in the insurance channel, our AUM grew 19% year-over-year to $264 billion across IG private credit, liquid credit and other strategies. Our open architecture, multi-client approach is a major advantage. Our platform now includes 33 strategic and SMA relationships, and we continue to add more.\nImportantly, in the past 12 months, nearly 2/3 of our clients have expanded their relationship with us, the strongest testament to the value we deliver for them. In our IG focused area overall, we generated over 170 basis points of incremental spread year-to-date versus comparably rated liquid credit.\nOur farm-to-table model, which brings clients directly to borrowers, is designed to produce a structural premium to liquid markets. particularly vital in an environment where spreads and interest rates are tightening.\nTurning to private wealth, where our platform has grown to nearly $290 billion, as I mentioned, up threefold in the past 5 years. To put our scale in perspective, a recent Goldman Sachs research report highlighted that Blackstone has an estimated 50% share of all private wealth revenue among 9 major alternative firms.\nTo put our momentum in perspective, we raised over $11 billion in the channel in the third quarter, more than double year-over-year, to the highest level in over 3 years. BCRED led the way, raising $3.6 billion and is on pace for a strong Q4. BXP raised $2.1 billion in the third quarter, bringing its NAV to $15 billion in only 7 quarters. BREIT generated healthy sales of roughly $800 million in the third quarter, while repurchases continued on their downward trajectory to the lowest level in 3.5 years. Finally, BXINFRA raised over $600 million in Q3 with its NAV exceeding $3 billion only 3 quarters after launch.\nIn private wealth, as with every business at Blackstone, it all comes back to investment performance. BCRED has achieved 10% net returns annually since inception nearly 5 years ago. BREIT has generated 9% net returns for its largest share class for nearly 9 years, a 60% premium to public real estate markets, including approximately 5% net for the first 3 quarters of the year. BREIT's exposure to data centers, now almost 20% continues to be extremely helpful in driving its results. And BXP has delivered a 16% annualized net return [ Ford's ] largest share class since inception. Our investment performance powers our fundraising along with our ability to innovate.\nLooking forward, we expect 2026 to be our busiest year yet in terms of product launches with a significant focus on multi-asset opportunities. We're also broadening distribution in several major markets around the world and moving deeper into key subchannels, including the RIA channel.\nWith these developments alongside our strategic alliance with Wellington and Vanguard, our partnership with Ellen G and the U.K. wealth and retirement markets and the massive potential in the U.S. defined contribution channel over time, the opportunity in private wealth continues to expand for Blackstone.\nMoving to our institutional business, which has grown by 64% over the last 5 years and has strong momentum across multiple areas. In infrastructure, our dedicated platform grew 32% year-over-year to $69 billion, including over $3 billion raised in the third quarter. The comingle VIP strategy has generated a remarkable 17% net returns annually since inception.\nOur multi-asset investing business, BXMA, grew 12% year-over-year to a record $93 billion, again driven by performance. Q3 represented the 22nd consecutive quarter of positive composite returns for BXMA's largest strategy. Investors are responding favorably, with BXMA generating year-to-date net inflows of over $5 billion, the highest in nearly 15 years.\nIn our drawdown fund area, it was another quarter of fundraising. We held additional closings for our new private equity Asia flagship, bringing it to over $9 billion as of quarter end, already significantly larger than the prior $6 billion vintage, and we expect to meaningfully exceed our original $10 billion target.\nWe also raised additional capital for our next life sciences flagship, bringing it to $3.3 billion, already more than 2/3 the size of the prior $5 billion -- I'm sorry, already more than 2/3 the size of the prior $5 billion vintage.\nIn credit, we held an initial close of $1.6 billion for our new high-yield asset-based finance strategy, targeting $4 billion. In secondaries, we finished raising the largest ever infrastructure vehicle at $5.5 billion, and we're now raising our next PE secondary flagship, targeting at least the size of the prior $22 billion vintage, with the first major close expected in the fourth quarter.\nAlso in Q4, we expect to launch fundraising for the fifth vintage of our private equity energy transition strategy, with a prior vintage already approximately 70% committed only 16 months after starting the investment period. Other drawdown strategies we are raising include opportunistic credit, tactical opportunities and GP stakes.\nOverall, we believe investor confidence in Blackstone is as high today as ever, which, as you've heard, is translating to growing capital commitments across many areas. In real estate specifically, investor sentiment is starting to improve following the downturn. We remain firm believers in the sector's recovery, and that flows ultimately follow performance.\nCommercial real estate values bottomed in December 2023 and since then, have been slowly improving. We think they're now approaching a steeper point in that recovery curve. The cost and availability of capital have been steadily strengthening, and transaction activity has been increasing, including by 25% year-over-year in logistics, U.S. logistics in the last 12 months.\nIn a market driven by supply and demand, the dramatic decline in new construction starts, including to the lowest level in over a decade in U.S. logistics and apartments, our largest sectors in real estate; should be very positive for values over time. As we stated before, we believe Blackstone is the best positioned firm in the world to benefit from the recovery underway in real estate markets.\nIn closing, the firm is in outstanding shape by any measure, a cyclical resurgence in transaction activity alongside multiple secular growth engines should be very positive for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Over the past several quarters, we've highlighted how the scaling of the firm's platforms in key growth channels is driving robust momentum in fundraising, assets under management and FRE. In addition, we've outlined a path of accelerating net realizations over time as capital markets strengthen. The third quarter was an excellent illustration of these dynamics of work and reinforces a favorable multiyear picture for the firm.\nStarting with results, AUM continued to advance to new record levels. Total AUM rose 12% year-over-year to $1.242 trillion, while fee earning AUM grew 10% to $906 million. Management fees increased 14% year-over-year to a record $2 billion, underpinned by continued double-digit growth in base management fees, including 23% growth in base management fees for the private equity segment, 18% for credit insurance and 15% for BXMA.\nAt the same time, transaction and advisory fees for the firm nearly doubled year-over-year to $156 million, with our Capital Markets business reporting 1 of its 2 best quarters in history, following a record Q2.\nWhile we expect a lower baseline of these revenues in the fourth quarter, the expanding scope of the firm's investment activity is widening the aperture of activity in our Capital Markets business.\nFee-related performance revenues grew 72% and year-over-year to $453 million in the third quarter, generated by 9 different perpetual strategies, including BCRED and multiple other vehicles across the credit complex, BREIT and real estate BXP and private equity and BIP and infrastructure.\nOverall, total fee revenues for the firm grew 22% year-over-year to $2.5 billion in the third quarter. Fee-related earnings increased 26% year-over-year to $1.5 billion or $1.20 per share, one of the three best quarters of FRE in our history, driven by the growth in fee revenues along with healthy margin expansion.\nWith respect to margins, as we stated before, it's most informative to look over multiple quarters, given intra-year movements. On a year-to-date basis, FRE margin was 58.6%, reflecting expansion of over 100 basis points versus the prior year comparable period. While we expect FRE margin in the fourth quarter to be sequentially lower due to seasonal expense factors, for the full year 2025, we are tracking favorably against the initial view of margins we provided in January.\nDistributable earnings increased 48% year-over-year to $1.9 billion in the third quarter. or $1.52 per share, powered by the strong double-digit growth in FRE alongside a significant acceleration in net realizations. We generated $505 million of net realizations in the quarter, more than double the prior-year period and up 55% sequentially in Q2.\nThe largest single realization in the third quarter was the sale of an interest in the GP stakes portfolio within our secondaries platform at the end of September. We also completed the full exit of Hotwire sales of certain U.S. energy assets and a number of other realizations across the private and public portfolios.\nLooking forward, in terms of fund dispositions, we have a robust pipeline of processes underway amid the improving transaction backdrop, and we believe we're moving toward acceleration in 2026, the concentrated in private equity with expanding contribution from real estate over time. And the firm's underlying realization potential is significant. The net accrued performance revenue on our balance sheet, our store value, stood at $6.5 billion at quarter end or $5.30 per share, while performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground has reached a record $611 billion.\nTurning to investment performance, our funds delivered healthy returns overall in the third quarter. Infrastructure led the way with 5.2% appreciation in the quarter and 19% for the last 12 months, reflected of broad-based gains across digital infrastructure. including continued notable strength in our data center platform, along with gains in our power and transportation-related holdings.\nThe corporate private equity funds appreciated 2.5% in the quarter and 14% for the LTM period. Revenue growth at our operating company strengthened to 9% year-over-year in the third quarter, while margins have remained resilient, supported by labor market conditions that are in balance and continuing to moderate.\nIn credit, our noninvestment-grade private credit strategy reported a gross return of 2.6% in the quarter and 12% for the LTM period, reflecting healthy underlying credit performance. Default rates across our noninvestment-grade holdings overall ticked up slightly but remained minimal.\nIn our direct lending portfolio specifically, realized losses were only 12 basis points over the last 12 months. The BXMA reported a 2.9% gross return for the absolute return composite in Q3 and 13% for the last 12 months. Notably, BXMA has delivered positive composite returns due to the past 30 months, which is leading to strong inflows in the segment's fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit AUM growth in Q3.\nIn real estate, values were stable overall in the third quarter. The core+ funds appreciated modestly, driven by the third straight quarter of positive performance by BREIT. The opportunistic funds declined slightly in the quarter with positive overall appreciation in the underlying real estate offset by the negative impact of foreign currency movement.\nIn total, our real estate platform remains well positioned, 3 of our highest conviction sectors, which are supported by very positive long-term fundamentals, data centers, logistics and rental housing; comprise approximately 75% of the global equity portfolio and nearly 90% of BREIT.\nOverall, our investors have continued to benefit significantly from the firm's position with leading platforms to address many of the most important market opportunities globally, including the largest data center business, leading energy infrastructure platform, the largest third-party focused private credit business, one of the largest private market secondaries platforms, a leading life sciences business and what we believe is the largest alternative business in [indiscernible]. These platforms have powered our investment performance and our growth, and we expect will continue to do so in the future.\nIn closing, Blackstone is exceptionally well positioned, supported by both cyclical and secular tailwinds. The breadth and diversity of our global portfolio is a source of strength, while the firm's culture of innovation continues to drive us forward, leading to outstanding financial performance for shareholders.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Katie, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's second quarter conference call.\nJoining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K.

This audio cast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $1.6 billion. Distributable earnings were also $1.6 billion or $1.21 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $1.03 per share, which will be paid to holders of record as of August 1st.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our call.\nBlackstone reported outstanding results for the second quarter. Distributable earnings increased 25% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, as Weston mentioned, fee-related earnings grew a remarkable 31% year-over-year and represented 1 of the best quarters in our history. The strength of these results notwithstanding in the backdrop for realizations reflects the significant expansion of the firm's earnings power, that has been underway as we continue to innovate and scale key growth initiatives. These include our platforms in private wealth, credit and insurance and infrastructure along with the launch of multiple new funds in our drawdown area. The firm's expansion is also powering our fundraising with inflows reaching $52 billion in the second quarter and $212 billion for the last 12 months, lifting assets under management 13% year-over-year to a record $1.2 trillion. In addition, there were reports that the U.S. administration may soon issue an executive order that could help open another vast new market for the firm to deliver superior returns and diversifications for investors, the $12 trillion U.S. defined contribution channel. The foundation of Blackstone's exceptional long-term growth, of course, is investment performance. We continue to deliver for our limited partners, and the second quarter represented the highest amount of overall fund depreciation in nearly 4 years. The firm achieved these results in a turbulent quarter for markets, which began with the S&P 500 falling 14% amid collapsing investor sentiment due to tariff's policy uncertainty and geopolitical instability. At the time, we advised patience to allow for trade negotiations to take place and to give tariff diplomacy a chance to work its way through the system. Despite the significant external uncertainty, we were encouraged by the fundamental strength of the economy, the accelerating pace of technological innovation as a major growth catalyst and what we were seeing on the ground in terms of declining inflation. We consistently shared our view that inflation was below the Fed's target when adjusting for lagging shelter costs based on the proprietary data from our large-scale portfolio and our unique position in real estate.\nAs always, the firm's insights informed our views on investing, and we continue to lean into areas where we have high conviction. We invested $33 billion in the second quarter and $145 billion in the last 12 months, 1 of the most active 12-month periods in our history, setting the foundation for future value creation and what we believe is a favorable time. Our deployment has emphasized areas benefiting from long-term secular megatrends such as digital and energy infrastructure, digital commerce, private credit Life Sciences in India. These areas have also been among the largest drivers of appreciation in our funds. In particular, the enormous need for debt and equity capital to build the infrastructure powering the artificial intelligence revolution has created extremely positive dynamics for our business.\nIn real estate specifically, we called the bottom of the cycle 18 months ago. And since then, we've been actively investing across our real estate equity and debt strategies. We also said it wouldn't be a V-shaped recovery, that is what's happened. Private real estate markets have appreciated gradually over this period. We are now seeing promising signs with new supply falling sharply, the cost of debt capital coming down and transaction activity picking up. Overall, despite ongoing uncertainties in the environment, there are multiple supportive tailwinds for our business. In terms of the economy, the backdrop remains favorable with resilient growth. We see inflation remaining muted with the likelihood for an increase in goods inflation, but decelerating wage, energy and shelter inflation. These factors should give the Fed room to lower interest rates over time, which is positive for asset values.\nIn terms of policy, we continue to believe the focus of policy actions ultimately is to support growth. Tax cuts have now been passed into law and a number of trade agreements have been reached with many more under active negotiation. It remains to be seen how individual negotiations will play out, but the direction of travel is toward more resolutions. As the policy environment settles, we expect transaction activity to benefit, including realizations. Greater clarity will lead to greater confidence for companies, financial sponsors and market participants. We're seeing this dynamic start to take effect with the U.S. stock market at record levels. M&A particularly sponsor M&A accelerating and the IPO market reopening. 2 weeks ago, we successfully executed a sizable IPO in Europe. The first from our private equity or real estate portfolios outside of India in several years, and we are preparing a number of other companies for public offerings over the coming quarters. More conducive capital markets if sustained, should lead to the acceleration of realizations for Blackstone over time.\nIn closing, we are tremendously well positioned to navigate today's dynamic backdrop on behalf of our investors. Our portfolio is in excellent shape, concentrated in compelling sectors, and we have $181 billion of dry powder to take advantage of opportunities. Since our founding 4 decades ago, Blackstone has continued to innovate and advance the frontier of alternative assets, we are never standing still, and I believe the best is ahead for the firm and for our investors.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone.\nThis was a terrific quarter for Blackstone. The firm's distinctive competitive advantages continue to drive us forward in multiple areas, leading to expanding earnings power, as Steve noted. I will highlight 3 of these areas this morning. First, our robust growth in private credit; second, our market-leading position in private wealth; and third, our strong momentum in the institutional channel. Overall, a cyclical recovery in transaction activity, alongside multiple secular growth engines is a powerful combination for our firm. Starting with private credit. Blackstone has built the largest third-party focused credit business in the world with $484 billion across corporate and real estate credit, up threefold in the past 5 years. Over the same period, revenue from this platform has increased more than fourfold. Today, we offer clients and borrowers a one-stop solution across the risk spectrum with leading businesses in direct lending, leveraged loans, real estate lending, asset-based finance and numerous forms of investment-grade private credit. The scale and breadth of our platform, distinctive origination capabilities, connectivity with borrowers across the market, and our open architecture multi-client model in the insurance channel are significant advantages.\nIn insurance specifically, our decision to be an asset manager for insurance companies rather than becoming 1 positions us well to address the $40 trillion global insurance market. Today, we manage over $250 billion on behalf of insurance across private credit liquid credit and other strategies, up 20% year-over-year. Our platform now includes 30 strategic and SMA relationships, and we continue to add more.\nTwo weeks ago, we announced a partnership with a leading U.K.-based insurer and the country's largest asset manager, Legal in General, in which we'll provide investment-grade private credit solutions to support their rapidly growing pension risk transfer and annuities businesses. We will also work together to develop public private credit products for the U.K. wealth and retirement markets. We're targeting up to $20 billion for this partnership in the next 5 years.\nOur expansion in the insurance channel is powering tremendous growth for our private investment grade platform, specifically with AUM up 38% year-over-year to $115 billion in the quarter. As always, the key is investment performance. Since the start of last year, we placed or originated $68 billion of credits for our private investment grade focused clients rated A- on average, which generated approximately 190 basis points of excess spread over comparably rated liquid credits.\nStepping back, Blackstone's innovation in private credit is allowing many borrowers to access this market for the first time, while dramatically widening our aperture to invest. For example, we previously discussed the very substantial opportunity emerging with investment-grade rated corporates, illustrated by the bespoke solutions we designed for Rogers Communications and EQT Corporation.\nWe closed a $5 billion Rogers investment last month alongside Canada's preeminent pension plan as co-investors. We believe a few other investment firms could have executed this transaction given its size, complexity and the depth of relationships needed. Blackstone has become a trusted mission-critical solutions provider to many of the world's leading corporations and we expect more of these types of partnerships over time.\nTurning to private wealth where we continue to advance our market-leading position. In this vast channel, $140 trillion, including mass affluent and high net worth individuals, a new generation of investors is gaining access to the benefits of alternatives, which is a development led by Blackstone. We started raising private wealth capital 23 years ago and established a dedicated organization nearly 15 years ago, growing AUM to almost $280 billion today, by far the largest private wealth alternative platform in the world. Each of our flagship U.S. perpetual vehicles is the largest or amongst the few largest of its kind. Revenue from these vehicles exceeded $700 million in the second quarter alone compared to approximately $50 million in the same quarter 5 years ago. As with credit, our scale is a major advantage in the wealth channel, alongside our extensive network of relationships with advisers and distributors, our broad menu of high-performing products and the power of our brand, which is built on that performance.\nIn the second quarter, our sales in the wealth channel increased 30% year-over-year to $10 billion. BCRED led the way, raising $3.7 billion underpinned by performance, 10% net returns annually since inception. BXPE raised $1.7 billion in the second quarter, bringing its NAV to $12.5 billion in only 6 quarters with an annualized platform net return of 17% towards larger share class. BREIT had its best quarter of regular rate fundraising in 2.5 years in the second quarter and $1.1 billion while repurchases continued on their downward trajectory. BREIT's highly differentiated portfolio positioning has led to 9% net returns annually since inception 8.5 years ago, approximately double the public REIT index on a cumulative basis, including over 3% year-to-date for its largest share class. This has resulted in BREIT's second consecutive quarter of generating fee-related performance revenues for the firm.\nFinally, BXINFRA saw healthy sales of roughly $600 million in the quarter despite still only being on a small number of distributors. We launched BMAX, our multi-asset credit product in May, which provides individual investors, greatly expanded access to the private credit universe, and we'll be ramping up distribution over the coming quarters along with other products in development and our previously announced alliance with Wellington and Vanguard, we are quite excited about our continued prospects in the private wealth channel.\nMoving to our institutional business, where we are seeing strong momentum across key open-ended and drawdown strategies. In this channel, again, the advantages of our brand, scale, breadth of products and of course, our long-term investment performance position us extremely well in an environment where limited partners are consolidating their manager relationships, favoring the largest and strongest firms.\nIn infrastructure, our dedicated platform continues on its powerful growth trajectory. AUM rose 32% year-over-year to $64 billion, supported by remarkable investment performance. 17% net returns annually to the commingled BIP strategy since inception. Our multi-asset investing business, BXMA, reported its fastest growth in nearly 7 years with AUM of 13% year-over-year to a record $90 billion, again led by performance. Q2 marked the 21st consecutive quarter of positive composite returns with BXMA's largest strategy.\nIn our drawdown fund area, we raised significant capital in the second quarter. We closed an additional $3.5 billion for our new private equity Asia flagship, bringing the total rates to date to $8 billion, already 25% larger than its predecessor, and we expect to exceed our original $10 billion target. In our $91 billion secondary business, which has doubled in the last 5 years, we raised additional capital for our fourth infrastructure vehicle, bringing it to over $5 billion, nearly 40% larger than the prior vintage, and we launched fundraising for our new PE secondaries flagship targeting at least the size of the prior $22 billion fund with the first close expected in the fourth quarter. Other strategies we are raising include life sciences, opportunistic credit, GP stakes and tactical opportunities. Overall, LPs continue to recognize the substantial benefits of investing in private assets despite the cyclically slow realization backdrop.\nLooking forward, importantly, we believe the deal-making pause is behind us. As Steve noted, the environment we are seeing is emerging from -- I'm sorry, as noted, the environment we see emerging of lower short-term interest rates less uncertainty and continued economic growth, combined with a pent-up desire to transact is the right recipe to reignite M&A and IPO activity. For Blackstone, we have the largest forward IPO pipeline since 2021. These trends should be very favorable for dispositions exiting this year and into next year.\nIn closing, we are highly optimistic about the road ahead, supported by multiple powerful engines of growth Blackstone's value proposition for both our limited partners and our shareholders is stronger than ever.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Michael Chae.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone.\nWe've previously outlined the building blocks for the favorable step-up in the firm's earnings power that has been underway. These included the onset of management fees for multiple drawdown funds exiting fee holidays the seasoning of perpetual capital strategies and their expanding financial contribution, both in terms of NAV-based management fees and recurring fee-related performance rates, robust growth of our credit insurance business and our healthy margin position.\nFirm's second quarter results perfectly illustrate these building blocks coming to fruition while at the same time, our significant embedded potential for net realizations continues to build. I'll first review financial results, followed by investment performance and the forward outlook.\nStarting with results. Steve and Jon highlighted the continued scaling of the firm's platform in key growth channels and the powerful effect that is having on assets under management, inflows and FRE. Total AUM increased 13% year-over-year to $1.2 trillion, underpinned by inflows of $212 billion over the last 12 months, while fee-earning AUM rose 10% year-over-year to $887 million. Base management fees increased 14% and to a record $1.9 billion in Q2, representing the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Transaction and advisory fees rose 25% year-to-year with a record contribution from our total markets business related to the firm's significant investment activity in the quarter, including in private credit infrastructure. Fee-related performance revenues reached $472 million in Q2, up over 2.5 folds from last year's second quarter, generated by 8 different perpetual strategies, including BCRED and BXSL in credit, BXPE and private equity BIP in infrastructure, creating real estate, along smaller contributions or other strategies. These drives taken together lifted full fee revenues to $2.5 billion in the second quarter, a remarkable 27% year-over-year and up 14% sequentially from Q1.\nCoupled with the firm's strong margin, fee-related earnings rose 31% year-over-year to $1.5 billion in the second quarter or $1.19 per share. Distributable earnings increased 25% year-over-year to $1.6 billion in the second quarter for $1.21 per share. For the LTM period, DE rose 26% to $6.4 billion or $5 per share despite net realizations remaining at unit levels, leading to 26% growth in the dividend to $4.26 per share. This equates to an attractive 2.4% yield on the current share price, double the yield of the S&P 500, and the forward outlook is favorable, as I'll discuss further.\nMoving to investment performance. Our funds generated strong overall appreciation in the second quarter, the highest amount nearly 4 years, as Steve noted, despite the volatile environment. The corporate private equity funds appreciated 5.1% in the quarter and 17% for the last 12 months. This was broad-based. Despite the macro uncertainties at the outset of the quarter, our operating company has generated high single-digit year-over-year revenue growth, along with resilient margins. In addition to core private equity, our other PE strategies delivered strong returns in the quarter. The tactical opportunities funds appreciated 4.1% and 14% of the LTM [indiscernible]. The SP Secondary funds appreciated 6.6% in the second quarter in the context of well-positioned portfolio benefited sizable recent investments executed at favorable prices.\nThe SP funds appreciated 11% for the LTM period. Our dedicated infrastructure platform appreciated 2.9% in the second quarter and 19% for the last 12 months. Notwithstanding a decline in the public portfolio in Q2 on market turns with depreciation underpinned by continued significant momentum of data centers, along with other digital infrastructure power and transportation-related holdings.\nIn real estate, values were largely stable overall in the second quarter with appreciation in the opportunistic funds in BREIT led by strength in data centers. Within the core platform, the BTP funds declined modestly, driven by our life sciences office portfolio, which has been impacted by new supply coming online and increased tenant caution. Overall, our real estate platform remains well positioned with data centers, logistics and rental housing comprising approximately 75% of the global equity portfolio, nearly 90% of [indiscernible].\nIn credit, our non-investment grade private credit strategy for part-day gross return of 3.0% in the second quarter and over 13% for the LTM period. Default rate across our 2,000-plus non-investment-grade credits remains in the area of 50 basis points for the last 12 months with no new defaults in private credit in the second quarter. The XMA reported a 2.8% gross return for the indi return composite in Q2 and 12% in the last 12 months. Notably, BXMA has delivered positive positive returns in each of the past 27 months, a remarkable achievement in liquid markets in any case and particularly so given the historic volatility as characterized in this period.\nOne final note on returns. Our dedicated life sciences business reported outstanding performance again in the second quarter, appreciating 6.7% and 27% over the LTM period. The quarter benefited from positive developments for a number of investments in the portfolio. Our life sciences platform provides investors with exposure to innovation and an exciting growth area in a way that we believe is largely uncorrelated to broader public markets. Our prior $5 billion flagship has achieved annualized returns of 20% since inception net of fees. Overall, the strength in the firm's investment performance continues to power our growth.\nTurning to the outlook, as you've heard this morning, there is a very positive multiyear picture for the firm. First, in terms of FRE, set up to the high quality earnings stream is favorable with a few drivers of note that will affect the second half of this year. We expect base management fees to continue on a strong positive trajectory with the rate of year-over-year growth in the second half, resembling that of the first half. On transaction fees, following a very strong first half, we would anticipate a lower baseline in the second half with potential upside from rising transaction and market action.\nLooking forward to 2026 and beyond, for us structural momentum in FRE driven by the firm's multiple pensions and growth. In terms of net realizations. In the second half of this year, we expect to close the sale of the firm's 6% stake in resolution life in connection with the sale of the company to keep on life. With respect to fund dispositions, we believe we're entering a more constructive environment as Steve and Jon discussed, and that we're well positioned to see an acceleration of net realizations exiting this year and moving into 2026.\nPerformance-revenue-eligible AUM in the ground was a record $604 billion at quarter end, up 14% year-over-year. Meanwhile, net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet earned store value grew sequentially to $6.6 billion or $5.30 per share. These are positive indicators of future realization potential.\nIn closing, the firm continues on its path of extraordinary long-term growth, powered by our brand investment performance and culture of innovation against the backdrop of significant secular tailwinds. As always, we remain totally focused on delivering for our investors.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call and would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThank you, Katie, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's first quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chen, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks. I'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nQuickly on results. We reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $1.2 billion. Distributable earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.09 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.93 per common share. which will be paid to holders of record as of April 28.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our call, and thank you, Weston. Blackstone reported strong first quarter results. distributable earnings up 11% year-over-year to $1.4 billion as Weston mentioned. Fee-related earnings grew 9% and represented 1 of the best quarters in our history.\nWe raised $62 billion of inflows in Q1, the highest level in 3 years and approximately $200 billion over the last 12 months. reflecting broad-based momentum across the institutional, insurance and private wealth channels. This fundraising success within assets under management 10% year-over-year to a new record of nearly $1.2 trillion. And I'd say that $62 billion in the quarter, it's worth noting. The firm delivered these results against a turbulent market backdrop, which, of course, has further intensified since quarter end.\nUncertainty around tariffs the potential impact on economic growth and inflation has dramatically impacted investor segment. It's early -- it's too early to assess the full implications of tariffs which depends on the outcome of unprecedented multilateral negotiations with perhaps over 100 countries around the world. The complexity of the situation means patience and staying power are key.\nImportantly, the economy entered this period in a fundamentally strong position. Productivity has increased significantly over the past several years. The technological innovation is accelerating, which are powerful tailwinds. Most important questions are how sustained will this period of uncertainty be? And what are the second order consequences both domestically and for foreign countries. We believe that fast resolution is critical to mitigate risks and keep the economy on the growth path.\nFor Blackstone, it is the challenging environment that best showcased strength and stability of our firm. We built our business to navigate periods of uncertainty and dislocation with the vast majority of our assets under management committed under long-term contracts or in perpetual strategies. These structures afford us the flexibility to invest patience to sell when the time is right.\nOur LPs have come to view us as an essential partner and they've entrusted us with $177 million of dry power positioning us exceptionally well to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. Our experience with many economic and market downturns as to as some of the best times to deploy capital are in a risk-off world, when sentiment is most negative.\nAnd for our shareholders, Blackstone is an asset-light manager of third-party capital with minimal net debt and no insurance liabilities. We therefore operate with a different risk program than most other financial firms, giving us enormous flexibility to respond to changing conditions. In terms of announced tariffs, we believe that the direct first order exposure across our portfolio is limited, although there is potentially material impact to a relatively small group of our companies.\nIn real estate, specifically, tariff effects are likely to drive up construction costs and further reduce new supply, which is supportive for real estate values absent recessionary conditions. Construction starts in our 2 largest sectors in real estate U.S. logistics and apartments have already fallen to their lowest levels more in the decade.\nWe also benefited as a firm many of our phones from the strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.\nWith respect to new investments, we will look to take advantage of this moment to capture value for our LPs. We continue to lean into areas where we have high conviction. We've invested $36 billion in the first quarter and committed $13 million to new deals concentrated in areas benefiting from long-term secular tailwinds. We are creating the foundation for future value and we believe is a favorable time.\nMore volatile markets do mean we are less likely to sell in the near term, although that can change if conditions improve. We remain focused on building the long-term value of our fees. Meanwhile, the Blackstone innovation engine continues to power our growth. The firm's unique diversity and breadth with over 80 distinct investment strategies, positions us well to navigate any environment.\nWe're always working to identify the next paradigm shift in the market and investing in our future growth. We continue to see the substantial benefits of the decisions we've made in the past, including establishing a dedicated wealth business to serve individual investors nearly 15 years ago, when nobody in the alternative business is even thinking about that idea.\nToday, we manage over $270 billion in the private wealth channel comprising nearly 1/4 of the firm's total AUM, which we believe is multiples of the size of our next largest peer. Our vision in this area from the beginning was to provide individuals the same access to private market solutions that many institutions have enjoyed for decades.\nThis week, we announced a significant development and our mission to democratize private markets, a strategic alliance with Wellington and Vanguard, 2 exceptional leaders in [ weaker ] asset management. We plan to draw on the tremendous capabilities of our respective firms to collaborate on integrated other private investment solutions. Blake scantily positioned for this initiative, given our leadership in private markets and our expansive product lineup, including large-scale perpetual strategies in private equity private credit, real estate infrastructure.\nWe're very excited for this next frontier for our private wealth business. This alliance is yet another example of our [ Flex ] has been a pioneer, expanding the horizon of private markets, our strategies, geographies and new customer channels. We remain as innovative today at any point in our history.\nIn closing, although the path ahead is now more uncertain, I am highly confident and I firm, our people to navigate it to be half of our investors. Importantly, we have the significant advantages of long-term committed capital our unique brand and incredible talent with an unmatched will to win. We do some of our best works on times of volatility. And I have no doubt that will happen once again.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our television star.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Despite the challenges of the current environment, Blackstone has multiple powerful engines that continue to drive us forward. I will highlight 3 of these areas this morning.\nOne, our continued growth in private credit; two, our accelerating innovation in private wealth; and three, our strength in the institutional channel across key open-ended and drawdown strategies.\nStarting with our growth in private credit. There is a profound expansion underway in the traditional model of providing credit to borrowers, which is creating tremendous structural tailwinds for Blackstone. We've established the world's largest third-party focused credit business with $465 billion across corporate and real estate credit, up more than 2.5-fold in the past 4 years.\nInflows for the combined credit platform were $113 billion over the last 12 months, comprising nearly 60% of the firm's total. Driving these inflows, as always, is performance. We continue to see outstanding results across both our investment grade and noninvestment grade strategies, including direct lending, asset-based finance, leverage loans and real estate high-yield lending.\nOne of the most exciting opportunities before us today is an investment-grade private credit, where our business grew 35% year-over-year to $107 billion. Here, we're focused on financing the real economy, including energy and digital infrastructure, real estate, commercial and consumer finance, fund finance and other types of asset-based credit.\nBlackstone's scale and reach in these areas across both debt and equity position us extremely well. We've also established numerous contractual relationships and forward flow agreements with banks and other originators, and we expect to do more. In addition, one of the most significant areas of opportunity emerging is with large investment-grade rated corporates who are looking for customized capital solutions.\nTwo weeks ago, we announced a $5 billion solution for leading Canadian telecom company, Rogers, alongside the country's preeminent pension plans, backed by a minority interest in Rogers' wireless network infrastructure. This follows a $3.5 billion solution we designed for natural gas producer EQT Corp in the fourth quarter, with respect to their pipeline infrastructure. In both cases, we leverage the expansive breadth of our credit platform to create something bespoke for our partner, without taking on any balance sheet exposure at Blackstone.\nFor our clients, these transactions represent yet another avenue to access high-quality, directly originated investments. Since the start of last year, we placed or originated $55 billion of credits rated A- on average for our private investment grade focused clients, which generated nearly 200 basis points of excess spread over comparably rated liquid credits. This activity has been mostly on behalf of insurers, although pensions and other limited partners are starting to explore moving a portion of their liquid fixed income assets to private IG credit.\nWe believe the potential here is enormous. Meanwhile, in the insurance channel specifically, we continue to see strong traction with our open architecture multiclient model. Our insurance AUM grew 18% year-over-year to $237 billion across IG Private credit, liquid credit and other strategies. We have 4 large strategic relationships today along with 24 separately managed accounts and expect this number will continue to grow.\nLast month, one of our 4 strategic partners, Resolution Life, announced the acquisition of a nearly $10 billion block of life insurance and annuities from Protective Life. We expect to manage nearly half of these assets over time on Resolution's behalf. This transaction is another illustration of Blackstone's ability to scale our insurance platform with key partners on a capital-light basis. And for resolution, it further affirms their strong competitive position in the closed block acquisition market, a position we expect will be meaningfully enhanced under their new parent, Nippon Life, one of the world's leading insurers.\nTurning to private wealth. Our innovation is accelerating. Blackstone has built the largest private wealth alternative platform in the world, as Steve noted, with over $270 billion of AUM, we've continued to expand our product lineup, which now includes 4 large-scale perpetual vehicles in the U.S., providing individual investors deep access to the scale and breadth of the firm.\nFollowing a very strong 2024, our fundraising in private wealth grew significantly in the first quarter of 2025. And while it's still early in the second quarter, overall across private wealth, we have not seen a pullback in sales. We raised $11 billion in the channel in the first quarter, up nearly 40% year-over-year to the highest level in nearly 3 years. BCRED again led the way with almost $4 billion raised on the back of outstanding performance, achieving 10% net returns annually for its largest share class since inception over 4 years ago.\nBXP raised $2.5 billion in the first quarter and has grown to over $10 billion in only 5 quarters, delivering an annualized platform net return of 15% through February for its largest share class. BXINFRA received strong investor reception in its debut quarter with $1.6 billion despite only being on a small number of distributors to date. And BREIT has continued to perform remarkably well through volatile markets with its best quarter of returns in 18 months in Q1. BREIT has generated a 9.4% annualized net return for its largest share class since inception over 8 years ago, equating to almost double the return of the public REIT index on a cumulative basis.\nIt's hard to overstate how valuable the Blackstone brand is in this channel, built on our differentiated performance and extensive network of relationships. Our brand positions us extremely well to bring new products to market. We plan to launch our fifth perpetual flagship, BMAX in the RIA channel on May 1, this diversified strategy reflects the evolution of private lending into many different areas beyond non-investment-grade corporate loans and will invest across our credit platform.\nBMAX will also have a ticker execution and daily subscriptions as compared to monthly sales and subscription documents for our existing perpetuals. We look forward to adding this new vertical to our product suite.\nFinally, we are particularly excited to collaborate with industry leaders, Wellington and Vanguard, and developing simplified access to public private solutions. Overall, we see a huge opportunity ahead for us in the wealth market. In addition to our private wealth and credit businesses, multiple other areas of the firm are showing strong results.\nOur dedicated infrastructure platform continues on its powerful growth trajectory with AUM up 36% year-over-year to $60 billion. Performance has been outstanding with the co-mingled VIP strategy achieving 17% net returns annually since inception.\nOur multi-asset investing business, BXMA, generated the 20th straight quarter of positive composite performance in its largest strategy. These returns drove BXMA's fastest growth in over 6 years with AUM up 12% year-over-year to $88 billion.\nIn our drawdown fund area, we raised significant capital in the first quarter. We expect that the market volatility and geopolitical concerns will have some effect, but we entered this period with a lot of momentum. In Q1, we held the final closings for both our European real estate fund, the largest of its kind ever raised based on third-party commitments at approximately EUR 10 billion overall. And our nearly $8 billion real estate credit fund. These are particularly remarkable achievements given the challenging environment for real estate, which speaks to the strength of our franchise in this area.\nWe also held final closings for our $21 billion global private equity fund, along with our private equity energy transition fund, which reached more than $5.5 billion. We held a first close of $4.4 billion for our new private equity Asia flagship for which we're targeting a substantially larger size than the prior $6 billion vintage.\nOther strategies we're raising or expect to begin soon include private equity secondaries, life sciences, opportunistic credit, infrastructure secondaries, GP stakes and tactical opportunities. Despite high levels of market uncertainty, we move forward with the strength of our brand and the confidence of our limited partners.\nIn closing, we continue to lean in. We believe our brand-heavy capital-light open architecture model is the best way to serve both our clients and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to the capable Michael Chae.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, the firm delivered strong financial results and resilient fund performance despite volatile markets.\nStarting with results. The expansive breadth of our platform and the power of our brand drove excellent performance across inflows, AUM and management fees. Total AUM rose 10% year-over-year to nearly $1.2 trillion, as Steve noted, with $199 billion of inflows in the last 12 months. The earning AUM also increased 10% year-over-year, lifting management fees 11% to a record $1.9 billion in Q1. Fee-related earnings rose 9% year-over-year to $1.3 billion or $1.03 per share, 1 of the 3 best quarters in our history.\nDistributable earnings increased 11% year-over-year to $1.4 billion in the first quarter or $1.09 per share driven by the favorable growth in FRE along with a 22% increase in net realizations. While overall sales activity remained muted as expected, principal investment income increased significantly due to the sale of Bistro, a portfolio visualization software platform developed in-house at Blackstone to clear water analytics.\nWe originally created Bistro as a portfolio management tool to provide our insurance clients with a comprehensive view of their private credit holdings. It will now be integrated into Clearwater's world-class technology offerings with continued access for our clients. While Blackstone's culture of innovation is usually associated with new investment strategies, the monetization of [ Bistro ] reflects how that culture of innovation pervades the firm, including with respect to our internal technology capabilities.\nLooking forward, as Steve noted, we expect realization activity in the near term to be affected by policy-driven uncertainty and market volatility. We Ultimately, we believe the firm's ability to deliver significant realizations in more constructive markets is considerable. Net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet, our store value stood at $6.4 billion at quarter end or $5.24 per share, while performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground reached a record $583 billion, up 13% year-over-year.\nMeanwhile, fee-related earnings remain a powerful balance to earnings and dividends for shareholders. FRE for the last 12 months reached a record $5.4 billion, up 20% from the prior year comparable period, and has doubled in the past 4 years. We expect management fees to continue on a strong positive trajectory.\nOur platform perpetual strategies continues to expand substantially widening the aperture for generating high-quality fee-related performance revenues, and our underlying margin position is strong. Affirmed significant embedded earnings power continues to build.\nTurning to investment performance. We entered this period of external uncertainty with a portfolio that we believe is fundamentally well positioned. With respect to the first quarter, the firm reported positive returns across all of our major strategies. Infrastructure led with 7.5% appreciation in the quarter and 24% for the last 12 months, including continued significant momentum in our data center portfolio, which benefited real estate and other areas of the firm as well.\nThe corporate private equity funds appreciated 1.1% in the quarter and 14% for the LTM period. Our operating companies reported mid-single-digit revenue growth and resilient margins in Q1, underpinning appreciation that was partly offset by declines in certain public holdings amid the market turbulence. In credit, our noninvestment grade private credit strategies delivered a gross return of 2.7% in the quarter and 15% for the LTM period.\nBXMA reported a 2.6% gross return for the absolute return composite in Q1 and including positive performance in every month of the volatile first quarter. For the last 12 months, the composite return was 11%. And notably, in each of the last 24 months, we generated positive returns.\nFinally, in real estate, the core+ funds appreciated 1.2% in the first quarter, while the BREP opportunistic funds were up slightly, supported by positive cash flow growth across nearly every area of the portfolio. Overall, these returns reflect the resiliency and strength in the firm's portfolio position.\nWith respect to the environment going forward, that positioning provides a strong foundation as we enter a complex backdrop that will continue to evolve. It will take time to see how tariff developments unfold, as Steve noted, and how they translate to the real economy and corporate earnings. As always, the breadth and diversity of our global portfolio is a source of strength.\nIn closing, as with the many other challenging periods the firms live through in our 4-decade history, we are well prepared to navigate this one as well. Our long-term committed capital provides us the staying power to weather storms and we have enormous investment firepower to take advantage of the opportunities that arise. With multiple engines of growth and support of our investors, we are confident in the future.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Katie, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Joining me today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-K report later next month.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nQuickly on results. We reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $1.3 billion. Distributable earnings were $2.2 billion or $1.69 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $1.44 per share, which will be paid to holders of record as of February 10.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Weston, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Blackstone just reported one of the best quarters in our history. Distributable earnings increased 56% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, as Weston mentioned, underpinned by record FRE. Our limited partners entrusted us with $57 billion of inflows just in the fourth quarter and $171 billion for the year, reflecting strong momentum [indiscernible] the institutional insurance and private wealth channels.\nOf particular note, we raised $28 billion in private wealth in 2024, including $23 billion in the potential strategies nearly double. We beat that nearly doubled what we raised from individuals in these strategies in the prior year. All signs point to further acceleration in 2025. After quarter end, in January, we raised an additional $3.7 billion for our private wealth sequentials. We did the launch of our new infrastructure vehicles, representing a powerful affirmation of our unique position in this channel. We believe our $260 billion private wealth business is multiples the size of our next largest competitor.\nLargest single contributor to the firm's financial results in the fourth quarter was our dedicated infrastructure strategy, BIP, which generated $1.2 billion of fee revenues. BIP has delivered remarkable investment performance since inception only 6 years ago, including 17% net returns annually for the co-mingled strategy. This performance has fueled exceptional growth with AUM today of $55 billion, up 34% just in the past year alone. BIP anchors a broader infrastructure platform as a firm that exceeds $120 billion across equity, credit and [indiscernible]. In relatively short period of time, we've established one of the world's largest infrastructure business.\nOur success in this area is a powerful illustration of how we build an enduring leading business at Blackstone. It reflects the same blueprint for how we've been able to grow from $400,000 in startup capital, 1985, more than $1.1 trillion of AUM today, the largest alternative asset manager in the world and why I believe we will continue to achieve strong growth in the future.\nStarts with innovation as a core competency of the firm as we're always working to identify the next paradigm shift in the market. We evaluate whether we can create something truly differentiated for our limited partners, but the opportunity can be scaled significantly. If we have the right team to lead it, drawing upon the firm's deep well of talent. Importantly, any new area also add to the firm's intellectual capital and create synergies with our other businesses to make the rest of the firm better.\nWe have carefully considered infrastructure as a stand-alone business for a number of years. We've been investing successfully in energy infrastructure projects for over a decade, other private equity and credit funds, which, along with our extraordinary real estate franchise made infrastructure natural extension as a new business line. In 2017, we saw a historic investment opportunity emerging in the U.S. and around the world, made the decision the launch of dedicated strategy. We identified a consolidated individual in our private equity energy area, our partners showing [indiscernible], to lead the new business. We began raising capital in 2018 supported by an anchor commitment from an important limited partner.\nToday, with $55 billion in outstanding investment performance, BIP has exceeded our initial and predictably very high expectations. The team has done an exceptional job portfolio construction focused on compelling thematic areas, including digital infrastructure, energy and power and critical transportation infrastructure. And we see enormous runway ahead, massive funding needs for projects globally, and there are more opportunities and available capital. We envision a growth path, [indiscernible] structure business, the parallels that of our real estate business, including geographic expansion, new client channels, moving across the capital structure and risk return spectrum.\nWe started raising the European infrastructure perpetual vehicle last fall. And earlier this month, as I mentioned, launched a vehicle designed to give individual investors access to the full breadth of our infrastructure platform. Over time, we also see opportunities in Asia and the potential for sector-specific strategies.\nThe growth of our infrastructure business was greatly helped by the other businesses at Blackstone and the firm's resources around the globe. These advantages include sourcing opportunities from and investing alongside our other funds. For example, BIP joined our real estate team in 2021 and to privatize the QTS data center business, which has become the largest and fastest-growing data center platform in the world. And now our leadership position in data centers is creating additional synergies across the firm, enabling us to address many new opportunities. And as BIP has continued to scale, it has, in turn, enhanced the firm's intellectual capital, relationships and deal flow, supporting our growth in other areas, including our $90 billion infrastructure and asset-based credit platform, our infrastructure secondaries business and our dedicated energy and energy transition focused funds.\nAnd I'm pointing -- what I'm outlining this morning is just one compelling proof point of the power of the Blackstone platform. We designed the firm from the beginning to work this way with each business making the other stronger this network effect sets Blackstone of Park in the asset management area, underpins the strength of our brand, axis an accelerant for the firm's overall growth. Our clients have a positive experience in one area. We're much more likely to invest in additional Blackstone products and support our expansion.\nBuilding things organic from the ground up, this challenging fix time involves upfront costs. However, we think our approach ultimately creates a stronger, more integrated firm as well as significant economic benefits as compared to a strategy focus acquisitions. And if reserves and perpetuates our unique culture, which is foundational for the firm's success. As we head into the new year, we're moving into an environment where we see consequential tailwinds for our overall business. Market participants have been focused recently to volatility in the U.S. treasury yields, reflecting persistent inflation concerns in the context of resilient U.S. economic growth as well as policy uncertainty.\nWith respect to inflation, what we see based on our expansive portfolio and our proprietary data that the U.S. is continuing for the path of disinflation, albeit at a more moderate pace than before. The policy, where there are different factors to consider, I believe the direction of travel fundamentally is for policies that are pro growth and pro deregulation, [indiscernible], it should be quite positive for our business. Closing, the power of Blackstone's platform will continue to drive us forward. Our positioning has never been stronger nor our prospects brighter. I couldn't be prouder of our people and their dedication to serving our investors.\nWith that, turn the ball over to Jon. I will catch it.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. This was an outstanding quarter for Blackstone. Steve highlighted the power of our platform, and I'll take you through 3 areas where that power was on full display. First, our large-scale deployment; secondly, our continued momentum in credit and insurance; and third, the acceleration in our fundraising, including both private wealth and the institutional channel.\nStarting with deployment. Over the past 12 months, we've been talking about a strengthening transaction environment. and our desire to invest significant capital in anticipation of improving markets. We're pleased to say that we deployed $134 billion in 2024, up 81% year-over-year, planting the seeds of future value of what we believe is a favorable time. The combination of a healthy U.S. economy, historically tight financing spreads, greater debt availability, the prospects of a more business-friendly regulatory climate and importantly, accelerating technological innovations have given us confidence to deploy capital at scale.\nWe invested or committed $62 billion in Q4, our most active pace in 2.5 years. New commitments in the quarter included fast-growing franchise business and very tasty Jersey mics, the privatization of a grocery-anchored retail REIT, our third cake private and real estate in 2024 and a luxury mixed-use complex in Tokyo, representing the largest ever real estate transaction in the country by a non-Japanese investor. In credit, we reported record deployment for both the quarter and full year, including a $3.5 billion financing for EQT Corp, 1 of the largest natural gas producers in the United States.\nThis venture is an excellent illustration of the scale of what we're doing today in the investment-grade private credit space. and our position as a trusted solutions provider to many of the world's leading corporations. We leveraged the full breadth of our platform to design a custom solution across the capital structure for the borrowers secured by the long-term contractual cash flows of their critical pipeline infrastructure. For our clients, we provided access to a high-quality, directly originated investment and we executed the transaction, as always, without taking on balance sheet risk. We see a significant opportunity for more corporate partnerships over time. given the scale of our platform and our reputation.\nStepping back, our credit insurance business continues to see huge momentum following a remarkable 2024. We built a private credit Juggernaut and the largest third-party business of its kind in the world, with over $450 billion of total assets across corporate and real estate credit. Inflows for the combined platform exceeded $100 billion in 2024, comprising 60% of the firm's total inflows. Our non-investment grade private credit and real estate credit drawdown strategies appreciated 16% and 18%, respectively, for the year. These are extraordinary results for performing credit underpinning robust investor interest in these areas.\nWe're also seeing strong traction for our investment-grade private credit offerings, as I noted, and now manage over $100 billion in that area, up nearly 40% year-over-year, virtually all on behalf of insurance clients, but we are now seeing receptivity from pensions and other LPs as well. In the insurance channel specifically, our business has reached nearly $230 billion, up 19% year-over-year, invested across IG private credit liquid credit and other strategies. Today, we have 23 SMA clients in addition to our 4 large strategic relationships, replaced or originated $46 billion of A minus rated credits on average for our private IG focused clients in 2024, up 38% year-over-year which generated nearly 200 basis points of excess spread over comparably rated liquid credits. We've achieved these results while remaining true to our capital like brand-heavy open architecture model designed to serve a multitude of insurance clients without taking on any liabilities.\nResolution Life, 1 of our 4 strategic relationships is a perfect validation of our model. Last month, Nippon Life, the largest Japanese life insurer and an existing resolution shareholder announced it would acquire the remainder of the company it didn't already own at a $10.6 billion valuation. Blackstone had taken a small 6% stake in resolution in 2023, alongside other limited partners in connection with becoming the company's asset manager for private and structured credit.\nNippon's investment will monetize our stake, deliver an attractive gain to our limited partners and the firm all while positioning resolution to accelerate growth under an extremely well-capitalized and capable parent. Importantly, we will remain resolutions investment manager going forward. and we are excited to partner with Nippon on this next stage of the company's development.\nTurning to private wealth, where our momentum accelerated significantly in 2024 and is also off to a terrific start. We are uniquely positioned in the wealth channel, given the breadth of our product lineup, our performance and the power of our brand. Sales in the channel exceeded $28 billion in 2024, as Steve noted. BCRED led the way raising over $12 billion for the year, driving 36% year-over-year growth in NAV. Our private equity strategy, DXP has already grown to over $8 billion in its first year, including January sales. And for BREIT, flows trended favorably with net repurchase requests in December, down 97% from the peak. We raised an additional $3.7 billion for the private wealth perpetuals in January, as Steve highlighted, marking their best month of fundraising from individuals in over 2.5 years. This included more than $1 billion each from BCRED, BXPE and our new infrastructure strategy. The launch of the infrastructure strategy marked the largest ever first close for a vehicle of its kind and was 5x to 6x the size of competitors' product launches.\nTo give you the sense of the strength of our brand in this channel, over 90% of advisers who allocated to this strategy had previously allocated to another Blackstone perpetual vehicle and over 50% allocated to all 4 of our perpetual flagships. REIT's exceptional performance, 9.5% net annual return since inception for its largest share class to a real estate superstorm has helped us here a lot. We're now in the process of launching our multi-asset credit product, as discussed previously, targeting the first half of this year. We see enormous opportunity ahead in the $85 trillion private wealth market.\nOur drawdown fund area is also benefiting from robust client engagement today with the tenor of discussions feeling far better than it had in several years. We held major things in Q4 for our real estate credit flagship, bringing it to $7.1 billion so far. European real estate, which has raised $9.5 billion to date and our private equity energy transition strategy, which has raised $5.2 billion, all of which will soon complete fundraising. We raised additional capital for our opportunistic credit strategy, bringing it to over $4 billion and held initial closings of $1.6 billion for our new Life Sciences flagship, targeting at least the size of the prior $5 billion fund.\nWe will also soon begin raising the new vintages of a number of other highly successful strategies including private equity Asia, for which we expect very significant closings in the coming months, along with private equity secondaries, GP stakes and tactical opportunities. Overall, the fundraising outlook is quite positive for the firm. Investor affinity for Blackstone is as high today as ever, and it all ties back to investment performance.\nAs you'll hear from Michael in a moment, we again reported strong returns across nearly every area of the firm in the fourth quarter. Our LPs have benefited significantly from the way we've positioned the firm [indiscernible] and their capital, including building the largest third-party credit complex, the largest data center business, one of the largest energy infrastructure platforms in a leading life science business and what we believe is the largest alternatives platform in India. These areas have continued to outperform, and we believe will drive outstanding future results for our clients as well.\nIn real estate, however, our equity-oriented funds were down in the fourth quarter as the portfolio absorbed the 80 basis point increase in the 10-year treasury yield and our non-U.S. holdage were also impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar. We wouldn't expect to see a move of this magnitude in treasury yields going forward given the underlying inflation data. And while disappointing in the near term, our portfolio is in excellent shape with cash flows growing solidly overall across virtually all our real estate strategies.\nOne year ago, we said that real estate values were bottoming, but that the recovery would take time and was unlikely to be the [indiscernible]. That's exactly what happened. We remain firm believers that a sustained commercial real estate recovery is underway. Debt markets have vastly improved as borrowing spreads tightened by approximately 50% from the 2023 wise and CMBS issuance was up nearly threefold in 2024. At the same time, new construction starts are down dramatically from virtually all types of real estate, including by 2/3 from '22 levels in U.S. logistics and apartments, our largest sectors. Meanwhile, demand is resilient with the potential for acceleration in the context of a stronger U.S. economy.\nGiven our conviction, we deployed $25 billion in real estate in 2024, up nearly 70% year-over-year, and we expect to continue to deploy at scale. Real estate is a cyclical asset class that has been through a cyclical downturn. And we believe Blackstone is the best positioned firm in the world to benefit from the recovery. In closing, the firm is in terrific shape by any measure. We expect to achieve great things on behalf of all of our investors.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Michael Chae.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results represented an exceptional finish to an outstanding year, and we entered 2025 in a position of significant strength. I'll first review financial results and will then discuss investment performance and the outlook.\nStarting with results. We reported the best quarter of fee-related earnings in the firm's history and 1 of the 2 best quarters of distributable earnings. We saw the full benefit of multiple drawdown funds that were activated throughout the year, Key perpetual strategies continue to scale significantly, including the very notable contribution from the BIP infrastructure business, and we believe net realizations have begun to move off cyclical lows.\nFirst, with respect to fee-related earnings. In the fourth quarter, FRE grew a remarkable 76% year-over-year to a record $1.8 billion or $1.50 per share. Management fees rose 12% to a record $1.9 billion, including the 60th straight quarter of year-over-year base management fee growth at the firm. We activated the investment period for multiple major drawdown funds in 2024, which contributed full fees in Q4. Alongside that, key perpetual strategies, BIP, BCRED and BXPE continue to grow in scale and contribution to the firm's financials with their combined NAV up nearly 50% year-over-year.\nFee-related performance revenues increased more than eightfold year-over-year in Q4 to $1.4 billion, driven by BIP's major scheduled crystallization event with respect to 3 years of substantial accrued gains, BXPE's first significant crystallization event with respect to full year 2024 gains and the steadily growing contribution for BCRED and our direct lending platform overall with a 47% year-over-year increase in these revenues for the credit insurance segment.\nIn terms of distributable earnings, DE grew 56% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter or $1.69 per common share. In addition to the strong growth in FRE, net realizations increased 42% year-over-year to $601 million, the highest level in 10 quarters. We executed a number of realizations across both the public and private portfolios in the quarter, concentrated in corporate private equity. These included the sale of public energy positions along with the IPO and sale of a portion of our stock in an India-based company at a multiple of invested capital of over 5x with the stock trading up further since then.\nIn addition, our multi-asset investing segment, BXMA, generated outstanding investment performance in 2024, including the best year for the absolute return composite in 15 years. The BXMA crystallized incentive fees for most of its open-ended strategies annually in Q4, and the segment's performance revenues increased 144% year-over-year to $338 million.\nNow turning to the full year. The firm delivered strong results amid a complex external environment in 2024 with robust growth across all key financial and operating metrics. Distributable earnings grew 18% to $6 billion. Fee-related earnings increased 21% to a full year record of $5.3 billion. Net realizations rose 12% to $1.4 billion, supported by the strong performance in BXMA and yet another example of the benefits of our diverse business mix.\nFirm's expansive breadth of growth engines lifted total AUM up 8% to more than $1.1 trillion, another record, with $171 billion of inflows for the year. Inflows deployment and overall fund appreciation all accelerated meaningfully in 2024 expanding the foundation of future value. We achieved these results against a backdrop where the market for large-scale realizations was very challenged for much of the year and the significant underlying earnings power of our real estate business has yet to reemerge, reflecting the breadth and power of our platform that Steve and Jon described.\nMoving to investment performance. The firm delivered strong returns in almost every area in the fourth quarter. Our corporate private equity funds appreciated 4.9% and 17% for the full year. Our operating companies overall reported stable mid-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, along with continued notable margin strength. Our infrastructure business reported 4.8% appreciation in the fourth quarter and 21% for the year. In credit, our noninvestment grade private credit strategies generated a gross return of 3.1% in the fourth quarter and 16% for 2024. We continue to see resilient fundamentals across the credit portfolio and the LTM default rate across our 2,000-plus noninvestment-grade credits remained under 50 basis points.\nBXMA reported a 3.7% gross return for the absolute return composite, the 19th consecutive quarter of positive performance and 13% for the year. BXMA has generated compelling all-weather returns in liquid markets, helping to insulate our LPs from the volatility of the past several years. Indeed, since the start of 2021, BXMA's cumulative absolute return composite, net of fees is 34% or nearly double the traditional 60-40 portfolio. In real estate, the opportunistic funds declined 5.1% in the fourth quarter and 4% for the full year, while the core plus funds declined 0.8% in the quarter and were stable for the year. As Jon discussed, the fourth quarter was impacted by the sharp increase in treasury yields and the stronger U.S. dollar.\nOutside of our major reported business lines, the growth and performance of other key strategies further highlights the firm's ability to innovate and build businesses. Our dedicated life sciences platform delivered standout performance in 2024, with the funds appreciating 11.3% in the fourth quarter and 33% for the full year, driven by the achievement of positive milestones for multiple treatments under development. Our real estate credit high-yield drawdown funds appreciated 4.4% in Q4 and 18% for the year, underpinned by resilient credit performance in its real estate loan portfolio. And our GP Stakes business appreciated 4.1% in the fourth quarter and 28% for the year, reflecting its focus on top-performing managers in private markets. The resiliency and strength of the firm's investment performance continues to power our growth.\nTurning to the outlook. The firm is advancing with strong momentum across multiple drivers. First, in our drawdown fund area, in 2025, we will see the full year benefit from funds that were activated throughout 2024. Second, our platform and perpetual strategies has continued to expand overall now comprising 46% of the firm's fee-earning AUM, setting a higher baseline for management fees as we enter 2025. In addition, BXPE is now eligible to generate fee-related performance revenues on a quarterly basis and our infrastructure strategy for individual investors in its first year will be eligible in Q4 of 2025 with respect to full year 2025 games. And while BIP's significant Q4 crystallization event will not recur in 2025. We do expect smaller crystallizations periodically starting in the second quarter of this year.\nThird, there is significant underlying momentum in our credit insurance business, as you've heard this morning. segments FRE and DE grew 26% and 24%, respectively, in 2024 and with robust inflows and record deployment, the business is exceptionally well positioned to deliver strong financial performance again in 2025. Finally, with respect to realizations, we see a much more constructive environment for realizations in 2025.\nIn the near term, we would expect disposition activity to be concentrated in our private equity strategies, as real estate exit markets strengthen over time and for overall activity levels to be meaningfully higher in the second half of the year. Meanwhile, net accrued performance revenue on the firm's balance sheet stood at $6.3 billion at year-end or $5.14 per share. And performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground reached a record $561 billion. These are strong indicators of our future realization potential.\nIn closing, we are highly confident in the multiyear picture of growth at Blackstone. The power of our platform has driven extraordinary results for our investors, and we believe it will continue to do so in the future.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nGreat. Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's second quarter conference call. Joining me today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks. I'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audio cast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nSo quickly on results. We reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $948 million. Distributable earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.96 per common share and we declared a dividend of $0.82, which will be paid to holders of record as of July 29.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our call. on our last several earnings calls, we spent a good deal of time talking about how we saw inflation compared to many other market participants. We took a strong view that we were seeing different outcomes with inflation moderating more quickly in part because of our unique position in the real estate area and our understanding of the shelter component of the consumer price index.\nAs a result of our convictions, we decided to adopt a more aggressive approach to new investments. I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, we deployed $34 billion, the highest level in 2 years, and nearly $90 billion in the last 3 quarters since the 10-year treasury yield peaked.\nWith inflation continuing to recede, we expect the Fed to begin cutting interest rates later this year. This should be very positive for Blackstone's asset values and provide the foundation for a significant realization cycle over time. As the largest alternatives firm in the world with nearly $1.1 trillion of AUM, the real-time data collected across our global portfolio provides insights that help us decide in which areas to concentrate our investments.\nThis data also alerts us to major paradigm shifts, which is essential for any top-performing asset manager. Our firm has demonstrated this foresight repeatedly since our founding including the decision to extend our private equity business into real estate in 1991 when values collapsed following the savings and loan crisis. By significantly expanding our credit platform in 2008 in advance of the extraordinary investment opportunities that arose from the global financial crisis.\nBeing the first investment alternatives firm to start and develop a dedicated private wealth business in 2011 and introducing the first large-scale perpetual product for that channel in 2017 and our decision later the same year to create a perpetual infrastructure strategy for institutional investors, which now anchors an overall infrastructure platform across Blackstone, of over $100 billion.\nThis demonstrated ability to be in the right place at the right time continues on an accelerated basis today. This includes our investments in innovation in all types of private credit, where we're one of the world's largest managers; in Global Logistics, as the largest private owner of warehouses in the world; in the energy transition field, where we own the largest private renewables developer in the United States; in India, where we believe Blackstone is the largest alternative investor in what has become the fastest-growing major economy; and of course, in data centers, where we own the fastest-growing platform in the world.\nI'd like to take a moment to discuss what Blackstone is doing today in artificial intelligence, specifically in data centers, which is an essential part of that breakthrough area. AI is widely acknowledged as having the potential to be one of the greatest drivers of transformation in a generation.\nI have personally been active in this field since 2015. I believe the consequences of AI are as profound as what occurred in 1880 when Thomas Edison patented the electric light bulb. While it took years to develop commercially viable products, the subsequent build-out of the electric grid over the following decades has parallels to the creation of data centers today to power the AI revolution.\nCurrent expectations are that there will be approximately $1 trillion of capital expenditures in the United States over the next 5 years to build and facilitate new data centers with another $1 trillion of capital expenditures outside the United States. And the need to provide power for these data centers is a major contributor to an expected 40% increase in electricity demand in the United States over the next decade compared to minimal growth in the last decade.\nWe believe these explosive trends will lead to unprecedented investment opportunities for our firm. Blackstone is positioning itself to be the largest financial investor in AI infrastructure in the world as a result of our platform, capital and expertise.\nOur portfolio today consists of $55 billion of data centers, including facilities under construction, along with over $70 billion in prospective pipeline development. Our largest data center portfolio company, QTS, has grown lease capacity 7x since we took it private in 2021. Through QTS and our other holdings, we have a robust ongoing dialogue with the world's largest data center customers.\nWe're also providing equity and debt capital to other AI-related companies. For example, in the second quarter, we committed to provide AI-focused cloud service provider, CoreWeave with $4.5 billion of a $7.5 billion financing package, the largest debt financing in our history, and we're now focusing on addressing the sector's power needs in many differentiated ways.\nWith large-scale platforms in infrastructure, real estate, private credit and renewable energy, we are extremely well positioned to be the partner of choice in this rapidly growing area.\nIn another important area where Blackstone once again, has been in the right place at the right time is real estate. During the global financial crisis, most competitors were forced out of business or delivered mediocre results, in fact, sometimes losing money for their customers where Blackstone for our investors ultimately doubled their money.\nHow did we do it? We own the right assets in the right sectors with the right capital structures, enabling us to emerge from the crisis as the clear market leader. As a result, institutional limited partners and subsequently individual investors allocated significant capital to Blackstone real estate in contrast to most other real estate managers.\nWith that capital, we repositioned our portfolio over time by selling U.S. office buildings and instead bought warehouses, rental housing and eventually, data centers. These 3 sectors comprise approximately 75% of our global real estate equity portfolio today compared to 2% in 2007. This repositioning drove the outperformance and extraordinary growth of our real estate business over the last 1.5 decades.\nReal estate markets, of course, are cyclical. And over the past 2.5 years, the increase in interest rates and borrowing costs has created a more challenging environment. Even through this period, Blackstone Real Estate has delivered differentiated performance.\nBREIT, for example, has generated a cumulative return of 10% net in its largest share class since the beginning of 2022 and 10%-plus net returns annually since inception, 7.5 years ago, more than double the return of the public REIT market.\nNearly 90% of BREIT's portfolio is in warehouse, rental housing and data centers, with data centers alone contributing almost 500 basis points to returns in the last 12 months. The performance BREIT has achieved is the key reason it is 3x larger today than the next 5 largest nontraded REITs combined.\nNow the cost of capital has begun to decline, which should be further helped by Fed cuts later this year. We believe creating the basis for a new cycle of increasing values in real estate. At the same time, new construction for most types of real estate is declining dramatically, down 40% to 70% year-over-year depending on the asset class.\nLooking forward, we are confident the outcomes experienced by our investors in this cycle will further reinforce our leadership position and will result in higher allocations to Blackstone from both institutional and private wealth channels in the future.\nReal estate is one of the largest asset classes in the world and having the largest business when the cycle is turning should be very advantageous for our shareholders.\nBlackstone is the reference firm in the alternatives industry. And for nearly 4 decades, we've been an essential partner to our investors, helping them navigate a dynamic world. The Blackstone brand engenders deep trust with our clients, allowing us to innovate and build leading businesses across asset classes.\nWe now have 75 individual investment strategies, and we are working on many more currently. Our near-term plans include launching several new products in the private wealth channel, the global expansion of our infrastructure platform, further deepening our penetration of the private credit and insurance markets and expanding our business in Asia.\nOur firm is as innovative today as at any point in our history. Innovation in finance, done correctly, is essential to create the virtuous cycle of satisfied investors who provide more and more capital for future growth. I have great confidence that we are firmly on this path.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In January, we highlighted 3 powerful dynamics emerging in our business. First, that investment activity was picking up meaningfully across the firm. Second, that commercial real estate values were bottoming. And third, that our momentum in private wealth was accelerating. .\nSince then, each of these dynamics has progressed in a very positive way. Starting with investment activity. We deployed $34 billion in the second quarter, up 73% year-over-year and committed an additional $19 billion to pending deals. Activity was broad-based across the firm.\nBXCI, our credit and insurance business, had one of its busiest quarters ever with $21 billion invested or committed, including in global direct lending, along with infrastructure and asset-based credit.\nIn private equity, new commitments included 2 take privates in Japan, a music royalties business in the U.K. and a fast-growing insurance broker in India.\nBack in the U.S., we bought Tropical Smoothie, a franchisor a fast casual cafes. This acquisition launched the investment period for our corporate private equity flagship for which we've raised more than $20 billion to date.\nIn real estate, as I said, we made the call in January that values were bottoming and the pillars of recovery were coming into place. What did we do with our conviction? We deployed nearly $15 billion in the first 6 months of the year in real estate, approximately 2.5x the same period last year. Since January, Green Street's Index of private real estate values has had 6 consecutive months of flat or increasing value for the first time in over 2 years.\nIn our own portfolio, we're now seeing more bidders show up to sales processes for single assets driving price improvement. Overall, the cost of capital has declined significantly with borrowing spreads and base rates moving lower while the availability of debt capital has increased significantly.\nAt the same time, new construction starts are falling sharply and are at or near 10-year lows in the U.S. for both warehouses and apartment buildings, our 2 largest areas of concentration. For a market driven by supply and demand, this is very positive for long-term values.\nNevertheless, the office sector remains under substantial pressure with more troubled assets likely to emerge. For Blackstone, as we've discussed, we have minimal exposure to traditional U.S. office in our expansive equity portfolio. Exposure is higher in our public mortgage REIT, creating some challenges, although its focus on senior loans has been an important factor in navigating the sector's dislocation.\nWith the vast majority of our global real estate portfolio concentrated in logistics, rental housing and data centers, Blackstone is in a very differentiated position.\nMoving to our private wealth business, where our momentum has been accelerating. We raised $7.5 billion in the channel overall in the second quarter. In the perpetual vehicles, we raised over $6 billion in the second quarter and nearly $13 billion in the first half of the year, already exceeding what we raised from individuals in all of 2023. BCRED led the way with $3.4 billion rates in the quarter, the highest level in 2 years.\nBXPE raised $1.6 billion in the quarter, reaching $4.3 billion in its first 6 months. And BREIT is seeing encouraging signs on the new sales front, raising $900 million in Q2, the best quarter in over a year.\nThe vehicle has delivered 6 straight months of positive performance and has fulfilled 100% of repurchase requests every month since February. Requests in June were down 85% from the peak last year, down 50% from May and have declined further month-to-date in July.\nAs we've been saying for some time, we believe flows in the wealth channel ultimately follow performance. We built a leading platform in our industry with over $240 billion and 3 large-scale perpetual vehicles. We have more in development, including 2 we plan to bring to market by early next year.\nFirst, an infrastructure vehicle that will provide investors access to the full breadth of the firm's strategies in this area, including equity, secondaries and credit and second, a vehicle that will invest across our expansive credit platform.\nOur commitment to the $85 trillion private wealth market is stronger than ever. Multiple other areas of the firm are showing strong momentum today. Our credit and insurance business is thriving in an environment of higher interest rates and accelerating demand for both investment-grade and noninvestment-grade strategies.\nOur performance has been outstanding with minimal defaults of less than 40 basis points over the last 12 months in our noninvestment-grade portfolio. Our scale allows us to focus on larger investments where competitive dynamics are more favorable and where the quality of borrowers and sponsors is higher.\nIn our nearly $120 billion global direct lending business, our emphasis on senior secured positions with average loan-to-values of 44% provides significant equity cushion subordinated to our loans. We're the sole or lead lender in approximately 80% of our U.S. portfolio, helping us to drive document negotiations and control the dialogue with borrowers, if any challenges arise.\nWe believe our scale, careful sector and asset selection and deep experience will differentiate us in a world of greater performance dispersion in credit. In our investment-grade focused credit business, our goal is to deliver higher yields declines primarily insured by migrating a portion of their liquid portfolios to private credit. We placed or originated $24 billion of A-rated credits on average in the first half of 2024, up nearly 70% year-over-year, which generated approximately 185 basis points of excess spread versus comparably rated liquid credits.\nOur insurance AUM grew 21% year-over-year to $211 billion, driven by strong client interest in our asset-light open architecture model. We have 4 large strategic relationships and 15 SMAs today, and we expect our business to grow significantly from here.\nMoving to infrastructure. Our total platform across the firm now exceeds $100 billion, as Steve noted, including our perpetual BIP strategy, infrastructure secondaries and other infrastructure equity and credit investments.\nWe built this platform from the ground up to become one of the largest in the world. BIP specifically reached the $50 billion milestone, including July fundraising, up 21% from year-end 2023. Performance has been exceptional. With the co-mingled BIP strategy generating 16% net returns annually since inception, beating the Public Infrastructure Index by nearly 1,100 basis points per year. We are well positioned to address the massive funding needs for infrastructure projects globally, including digital and energy infrastructure.\nJust last week, we agreed to invest nearly $1 billion in a portfolio of solar and wind projects in the U.S. alongside NextEra, the largest public renewables developer in the country. A final comment on our drawdown fund business, where there are a number of initiatives we're quite excited about.\nWe've launched or expect to launch fundraising in the next few quarters for the new vintages of multiple strategies. These include the successors to our $5 billion Life Sciences fund, $9 billion private credit opportunistic strategy, $22 billion Private Equity Secondaries Fund and $6 billion Private Equity Asia Fund.\nAll have strong track records, and we expect the new vintages to be at least as large as and, in most cases, hopefully larger than the current funds. While the fundraising environment has been challenging, we're seeing more receptivity from LPs today as markets improve.\nImportantly, when we meet with our clients around the world, what we consistently hear is that they are holding or increasing their allocations to alternatives and to Blackstone.\nIn closing, our firm is emerging from this multiyear period of higher cost of capital even stronger than before, and we're sticking with our model of being a third-party asset manager relying on our track record, our people and the power of our brand to grow.\nWith that, I will turn things over to our very capable CFO, Mr. Chae.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. The firm delivered steady financial results in the second quarter with positive momentum in fundraising and deployment, as you've heard today. I will first review results and we'll then discuss investment performance and the outlook.\nStarting with results. The firm's expansive range of growth engines continues to power AUM to new record levels. Total AUM increased 7% year-over-year to $1.1 trillion, with inflows of $39 billion in the quarter and $151 billion over the last 12 months.\nFee earning inflows were also $151 billion for the LTM period, including $53 billion in the second quarter, the highest level in 2.5 years, lifting fee-earning AUM by 11% to $809 billion.\nWe activated the investment periods for our corporate private equity and PE energy transition flagships in the second quarter, which, along with BXPE and private wealth, were in fee holidays as of quarter end, representing $27 billion of fee AUM in aggregate.\nNotwithstanding the temporary impact from these fee holidays, management fees increased 5% year-over-year to a record $1.8 billion in the second quarter. Notably, Q2 represented the 58th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in base management fees at the firm.\nFee-related earnings were $1.1 billion or $0.91 per share. The comparison of FRE to prior periods was impacted by a decline in fee-related performance revenues in the Real Estate segment, including from BREIT, as its positive year-to-date appreciation came in modestly below the required hurdle.\nThese revenues carry favorable margins and their decline impacted the firm's FRE margin in the second quarter. These factors are partly offset by the steadily growing contribution from our direct lending business, with fee-related performance revenues in the credit and insurance segment rising 24% year-over-year to $168 million.\nDistributable earnings were $1.3 billion in the second quarter or $0.96 per share, up 3% year-over-year. BE was underpinned by the firm's steady baseline of fee-related earnings with Q2 representing the 11th consecutive quarter of FRE over $1 billion.\nNet realizations were $308 million in the second quarter, up year-over-year, but still reflective of a backdrop that is not yet robust as it relates to scale dispositions. That said, we executed the sales of a number of public and private holdings in the second quarter concentrated in our Asia private equity business, including a leading health care services company in Korea, the IPO and subsequent sale of stock of one of the largest housing finance platforms in India and the sale of stock of an India-based technology company.\nMoving to investment performance. Our funds generated healthy overall appreciation in the second quarter, led by strength in infrastructure, private credit and life sciences. Infrastructure reported 6.3% appreciation in the quarter and 22% over the last 12 months, with broad gains across digital, transportation and energy infrastructure.\nOur data center platform was again the single largest driver of appreciation in our real estate and infrastructure businesses and for the firm overall in the second quarter. In credit, we reported another outstanding quarter against a continuing positive backdrop for private debt market fundamentals. The private credit strategy has generated a gross return of 4.2% in the quarter and 18% for the LTM period. The default rate across our 2,000-plus noninvestment-grade credits was less than 40 basis points over the last 12 months, as Jon noted, with no new defaults in private credit in the second quarter.\nOur multi-asset investing platform, BXMA, reported a 2.1% gross return for the absolute return composite, the 17th consecutive quarter of positive performance, and 12% for the last 12 months.\nBXMA has done an extraordinary job delivering resilient all-weather returns over the past several years through volatile equity markets and the longest and deepest drawdown in bonds on record.\nSince the start of 2021, the absolute return composite net of fees is a cumulative 27% or nearly double the traditional 60-40 portfolio. The corporate PE funds appreciated 2% in the second quarter and 11% for the LTM period. Our operating companies overall reported stable mid-single-digit year-over-year revenue growth, along with continued margin strength.\nIn real estate, values were stable overall in the quarter, supported by strength in data centers and global logistics. This was offset by declines in our office portfolio, including life sciences office and certain other factors.\nOne final highlight on investment performance. Our dedicated life sciences business delivered a standout second quarter. The funds appreciated 11.9% and a remarkable 33% for the LTM period after achieving positive milestones for multiple treatments under development, including for stroke prevention, cardiovascular disease and rare forms of epilepsy in children.\nThe growth and performance of this business is yet another example of the firm's ability over many years to innovate and translate megatrends into large-scale businesses for the benefit of our investors.\nTurning to the outlook. We're putting in place the foundation for a favorable step-up in earnings power over time. First, in terms of net realizations. We expect a near-term lag between improving markets and a pickup in these revenues, as we stated previously. In the meantime, the firm's underlying performance revenue potential has continued to build, with performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground reaching a record $531 billion at quarter end.\nMeanwhile, net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet, the firm's store value, grew sequentially to $6.2 billion or $5.08 per share. As markets heal and liquidity improves, we are well positioned for a significant acceleration in net realizations over time.\nIn terms of FRE. We anticipate a material step-up in FRE in the fourth quarter with multiple drivers of note. First, with respect to management fee holidays. The corporate PE and energy transition flagships will exit their respective fee holidays in the coming months and will generate full management fees in Q4. BXP exited its fee holiday this month.\nSecond, in terms of fee-related performance revenues. Q4 includes a scheduled crystallization for the comingled BIP infrastructure strategy with respect to 3 years of significant accrued gains as well as BXP's first crystallization event with respect to full year 2024 gains.\nLooking forward to 2025, we will see the full year benefit of the flagship vehicles that were activated in 2024. We also expect to raise multiple other flagships throughout the course of 2025, including life sciences, private equity secondaries, private equity Asia and other major strategies.\nIn addition, we expect the continued expansion of our platform of perpetual strategies, which has grown by 2.5x in the past 3 years. And importantly, our credit insurance business is on a strong positive trajectory with segment FRE increasing nearly 30% year-over-year in the second quarter. The dual engines of performance and innovation at Blackstone continue to drive the firm forward.\nIn closing, the firm is exceptionally well positioned against today's evolving backdrop with powerful structural tailwinds and multiple engines of growth. Our long-term capital provides the flexibility and firepower to invest and the patience to sell assets when the time is right. We are very optimistic about the future of Blackstone.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThanks, Katy, and good morning and welcome to Blackstone's first quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K.\nWe'll also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nSo on results quickly, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $1.6 billion. Distributable earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.98 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.83, which we paid to holders of record as of April 29.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining our call. Blackstone reported strong results for the first quarter of 2024, including healthy distributable earnings of $1.3 billion, as Weston mentioned, underpinned by the highest fee-weighted earnings in 6 quarters.\nOn our January earnings call, following a volatile multiyear period for global markets, we noted an improving external environment and shared our view that 2023 would be the cyclical bottom for our firm. While changing market conditions take time to translate to financial results, including realizations and performance revenues, we are seeing positive momentum across many key forward indicators at our firm.\nInflows were $34 billion in the first quarter and $87 billion over the past 2 quarters. We invested $25 billion in quarter 1 and $56 billion in the past 2 quarters with a strengthening pipeline of new commitments. We are planting the seeds of future value in what we believe is a favorable time for deployment.\nAt the same time, our fundraising in the private wealth channel meaningfully accelerated in the first quarter. Sales for our perpetual vehicles increased more than 80% from the fourth quarter to $6.6 billion. We've stated before that short-term movements in stock and bond markets impact capital flows in this channel, but ultimately, flows follow performance as well as innovation as we're seeing now.\nWe've delivered 10.5% net returns annually for BREIT's largest share class over more than 7 years and 10% for BCRED over 3-plus years. And we continued to successfully launch new strategies, including our private equity vehicle, BXPE, in the first quarter. With $241 billion of AUM in private wealth at Blackstone, we have the leading platform in our industry by far. We've established a significant first-mover advantage with the #1 market share for each of our major season products along with a high percentage of repeat business across strategies.\nBlackstone is built on long-term investment performance. We've achieved 15% net returns annually in corporate private equity and infrastructure since inception, 14% in opportunistic real estate and secondaries, 12% in Tactical Opportunities and 10% in credit.\nIn the first quarter, our funds reported steady appreciation overall, highlighted by strength in infrastructure, credit and our multi-asset investing platform, BXMA. Our portfolio is in excellent shape, and our Limited Partners continue to benefit and we've positioned their capital, emphasizing new neighborhoods, such as digital infrastructure, logistics and energy transition.\nThe firm's thematic approach to deployment is informed by the real-time data and insights we gather from our global portfolio, which helps us to identify trends early and build conviction around our ideas. Blackstone is the largest and most diversified firm in the alternatives area with over $1 trillion of assets under management, and we believe our knowledge advantage consequently is a unique asset in our industry.\nFor example, digital infrastructure, one of the firm's highest-conviction investment themes today, is a powerful example of this knowledge advantage at work. Just as we recognized the rise of e-commerce nearly 15 years ago and started buying warehouses, we anticipated a paradigm shift around demand for data centers driven by growth in content creation, cloud adoption, and most importantly now, the revolution underway in artificial intelligence. Others now know that AI requires exponentially more computing power and capacity than was previously imagined.\nOn a personal basis, in less than 2 weeks, I am participating in the dedication ceremony for the Schwarzman College of Computing at MIT, which will be heavily focused on this area.\nWhat has Blackstone done with our conviction? We identified QTS, the fifth largest U.S. data center REIT, as a well-positioned but poorly trading public company with tremendous long-term potential. Our BREIT, BIP infrastructure and BPP perpetual strategies acquired the company for $10 billion in 2021, and its lease capacity has already grown sixfold in less than 3 years. Today, QTS is the largest data center company in North America. We are building a variety of other center platforms around the world as well.\nIn total, Blackstone vehicles now own $50 billion of data centers globally, including facilities under construction. And there is an additional $50 billion in prospective future development pipeline. Blackstone is highly differentiated in our ability to conceptualize the new business area and transform it into a $100 billion potential opportunity.\nWe are also actively investing in other companies in AI-related areas. We're buying as well as financing several firms that design, build and service data centers. We recently financed a cloud infrastructure business supporting AI development. And now we've transitioned to addressing the sector's growing power needs, leveraging our sizable energy infrastructure platform, which includes the largest private renewables developer in North America.\nThere are several other powerful megatrends that we expect to drive the firm forward, both in terms of where we invest and where we raise capital. The most compelling of these today include the secular rise of private credit, where we have one of the world's largest platforms; infrastructure; energy transition; life sciences; and the expansion of alternatives globally and particularly in Asia. In each of these areas, we've established leading platforms with tremendous momentum.\nLooking forward in 2024, the market environment will remain complex. The economy is stronger than expected but is starting to slow a bit. In terms of inflation, despite the recent U.S. CPI readings, we are seeing a decelerating wage growth and minimal input cost increases across many of our companies. In real estate, we see shelter costs moderating, contrary to government data. We believe inflation will trend lower this year, although the pace of decline has slowed recently.\nGeopolitical turbulence, including wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, adds further uncertainty to the business environment. And 2024 is a major election year as we all know with nearly half of the world's population going to the polls, which injects unpredictability around the future of important policies that impact the global economy.\nBlackstone is well positioned against this evolving backdrop. Our portfolio is concentrated in compelling sectors, and we have the industry's largest dry powder balance of nearly $200 billion to take advantage of opportunities. Our long-term capital provides the flexibility and firepower to invest while affording us the patience to sell assets when the time is right.\nThe firm itself could not be in a stronger position with minimal net debt and no insurance liabilities, allowing us to distribute $4.7 billion to shareholders over the past 12 months through dividends and share repurchases. And we are in the early days of penetrating markets of enormous size and potential.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the firm's performance in the first quarter and the momentum building across our business. This momentum is underpinned by 3 key developments. First, the transaction environment has strengthened. Secondly, in private credit, demand from both investors and borrowers is expanding. And third, our private wealth business is reaccelerating. I'll discuss each of these areas in more detail, starting with the transaction environment.\nThe market backdrop has become more supportive. The 10-year treasury yield is still down from its October peak despite the recent run-up. Borrowing spreads have tightened significantly, and the ability of debt capital has increased significantly. We're also seeing M&A activity and the IPO market restarting.\nAs we've stated before, the recovery will not be a straight line, but we're not waiting for the all-clear sign to invest. We deployed $25 billion in the first quarter and committed an additional $15 million to pending deals, including subsequent to quarter end. We were most active in our credit and insurance area, which I'll discuss further in a moment.\nIn real estate, we shared our view in January that commercial real estate values were bottoming, providing the foundation for an increase in transaction activity. This has coincided with several major investments by Blackstone.\nJust last week, we announced a $10 billion take-private of a high-quality rental housing platform, Air Communities, which follows our announcement in January to privatize Tricon Residential. Rental housing remained a major investment theme for us given the structural shortage in this space. U.S. is building roughly the same number of homes today as in 1960 despite having almost twice the population. We are also quite focused on European real estate, where we've now raised $7.6 billion for our new flagship vehicle as of quarter end.\nIn private equity, we closed the acquisition of Rover in the first quarter, a leading digital marketplace in the pet space, along with an online payments business in Japan and a health care platform in India. The economy in India, which I visited 2 weeks ago, remains incredibly strong. We're [ for ] the largest private equity and real estate platform in that country.\nBack home, our dedicated life science business announced a $750 million collaboration with Moderna to support the development of mRNA vaccines for influenza. And our growth equity fund invested in 7 Brew, an innovative quick-service coffee franchisor. As Steve highlighted, we are planting the seeds of future realizations.\nTurning to the second key development, our expansion in private equity credit. There is powerful in real estate lending. We're also now seeing a dramatic increase position in digital infrastructure, residential real estate, commercial and consumer finance, fund fits and other types of asset-based credit.\nIn our investment-grade-focused business, we believe there is a massive opportunity to deliver higher returns to clients with lower risk by moving a portion of their liquid portfolios to private markets. Alternatives have taken meaningful share of public equity portfolios over the past 30 years but little on the fixed income side.\nIn the insurance channel, this migration has been underway. And we've created a capital-light, open architecture model that can serve a multitude of limited partners. Worth noting, we crossed the $200 billion AUM milestone in insurance this quarter, up 20% year-over-year. In addition to our 4 largest clients, we now have SMA relationships with 14 insurers, which continue to grow in number and size. We placed or originated $14 billion of A-rated credits on average for them in the first quarter, up 71% year-over-year, and nearly $50 billion since the start of 2023. These credits generated approximately 200 basis points of excess spread over comparably rated liquid credits.\nIn addition to insurance clients, pension funds and other LPs see the value we're creating in private credit, and there's been a strong response to our product offerings. With nearly $420 billion in BXCI and real estate credit, we're extremely well positioned to directly originate high-quality assets on behalf of a much larger universe of investors. We've also established numerous origination relationships as well as bank partnerships, most recently with Barclays and KeyBank, in areas like consumer credit card receivables, fund finance, home improvement and infrastructure credit, and we plan to add more.\nThese arrangements are a win-win. They create more flow for our investors who want to hold these investments, these assets long term, and they help our partners better serve their customers. We expect our credit and insurance platforms to grow significantly from here.\nMoving to the third key development, the reaccelerating trends in our private wealth business. In January, we noted our momentum building as market volatility receded. And with the launch of BXPE, we now offer 3 large-scale perpetual vehicles, providing individual investors access to even more of the scale and breadth of Blackstone.\nOur sales in the wealth channel were a robust $8 billion in the first quarter, including $6.6 billion for the perpetual strategies, as Steve noted. Subscriptions for the perpetuals increased 83% from Q4 and marked the best quarter of fundraising from individuals in nearly 2 years. BCRED led the way, raising $2.9 billion. BXPE has received very strong investor reception, raising $2.7 billion in its debut quarter, and we plan to expand to more distributors over the coming months.\nOver 90% of advisers that have transacted with BXPE have previously done so with BREIT or BCRED, illustrating the affinity for our products and the power of the Blackstone brand in this channel. At the same time, BREIT has successfully navigated a challenging 2-year period for real estate markets. Its semi-liquid structure has worked as designed by providing liquidity while protecting performance. BREIT has delivered double the return of the public REIT index since inception over 7 years. This outperformance continued with strong results in Q1, underpinned by outstanding portfolio positioning that includes growth in its data center exposure.\nRepurchase requests in BREIT have fallen 85% from the peak to the lowest level in nearly 2 years, and the vehicle is no longer in proration. We're now seeing encouraging signs in terms of new sales, while repurchase requests are continuing their decline in April as well. We are confident in the recovery of BREIT flows over time given performance.\nWhen looking at the $80 trillion private wealth landscape overall, allocations remain extremely low, and we expect a long runway of growth ahead. In closing, the firm is exceptionally well positioned, supported by both cyclical and secular tailwinds. That's why we believe the future is very bright for Blackstone.\nWith that, I'll turn things over to Michael Chae.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Blackstone delivered strong results in the first quarter, highlighted by the reacceleration of fee-related earnings. I'll first review financial results and will then discuss investment performance and the forward outlook.\nStarting with results. Fee-related earnings increased 12% year-over-year to $1.2 billion or $0.95 per share, the highest level in 6 quarters and the third best quarter in firm history, powered by double-digit growth in fee revenues, coupled with the firm's robust margin position.\nWith respect to revenues, the firm's expansive breadth of strategies lifted management fees to a record $1.7 billion. Notably, Q1 reflected the 57th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth of base management fees at Blackstone.\nFee-related performance revenues doubled year-over-year to $296 million generated by multiple perpetual capital vehicles in credit and real estate, including a steadily growing contribution from our direct lending business, scheduled crystallization in our European BPP logistics strategy, and BREIT. The setup for these high-quality revenues is favorable in 2024 and beyond, which I'll discuss further in a moment.\nWith respect to margins, FRE margin was 57.9% in the first quarter, in line with full year 2023. Distributable earnings were $1.3 billion in the first quarter or $0.98 per common share, stable year-over-year and underpinned by the growth in FRE. Net realizations remain muted at $293 million. And going forward, we expect a lag between improving markets and a step-up in net realizations.\nIn the meantime, the firm's strong underlying FRE generation has supported a consistent and attractive baseline of earnings with Q1 representing the tenth consecutive quarter of FRE over $1 billion. We did execute a number of sales in the quarter, including a stake in one of the largest cell tower platforms, public stock of the London Stock Exchange Group and the sales of certain other public and private holdings.\nWe also closed or announced several dispositions in our real estate and infrastructure perpetual vehicles, which as a reminder, do not earn performance revenues based on individual asset sales but on NAV appreciation. These included a trophy retail asset in Milan for EUR 1.3 billion, representing the largest real estate single-asset sale ever in Italy, portfolio of warehouses in Southern California, and a prime office building in Seoul.\nEach of these sales generated a substantial profit individually and in aggregate, a gross multiple of invested capital of approximately 2x. These dispositions exemplify the significant quality and embedded value within the firm's investment portfolio.\nTurning to investment performance. Our funds generated healthy overall appreciation in the first quarter, as Steve noted. Infrastructure led the way with 4.8% appreciation in the quarter and 19% over the last 12 months with broad gains across digital, transportation and energy infrastructure. The QTS data center business was the single largest driver of appreciation for BIP, BREIT and BPP U.S. and for the firm overall in Q1.\nThe comingled BIP vehicle has generated 15% net returns annually since inception, powering continued robust growth with platform AUM increasing 22% year-over-year to $44 billion. The corporate PE funds appreciated 3.4% in the quarter and 13% for the LTM period.\nOur operating companies overall reported healthy, albeit decelerating, revenue growth along with margin strength. In credit, we reported another outstanding quarter in the context of strong fundamentals and debt marks generally and tightening spreads with a gross return for the private credit strategies of 4.1% and 17% for the LTM period. The default rate across our nearly 2,000 noninvestment-grade credits is less than 40 basis points over the last 12 months with 0 new defaults in our private credit business in Q1.\nOur multi-asset investing platform, BXMA, reported a 4.6% gross return for the absolute return of composite and 12% for the last 12 months, the best quarterly performance in over 3 years and the 16th quarter in a row of positive returns. Since the start of 2021, the composite has delivered nearly double the return of the 60-40 portfolio net of fees, a remarkable result in liquid markets.\nFinally, in real estate, the Core+ funds appreciated 1.2% in the first quarter, while the BREP opportunistic funds appreciated 0.3%. These returns include the negative impact of currency translation for our non-U.S. holdings related to the stronger U.S. dollar equating to 20 and 60 basis points impact on each strategy, respectively. As Jon noted, we see a recovery under way in commercial real estate and in our portfolio cash flows are growing or stable in most areas.\nOverall, strong returns lifted net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet affirmed store value sequentially to $6.1 billion or $5 per share. Meanwhile, performance revenue-eligible AUM in the ground increased to a record $515 billion. The resiliency and strength of the firm's investment performance over many years and across cycles powers the Blackstone innovation machine and provides the foundation of future growth.\nMoving to the outlook, where several embedded drivers support a favorable multiyear picture of growth. First, the firm has raised approximately $80 billion that is not yet earning management fees and new drawdown fund vintages that haven't yet turned on along with certain other funds. These commence when investment periods are activated or capital is deployed, depending on the strategy. We plan to activate our corporate private equity flagship this quarter, which has raised over $19 billion to date, followed by an effective 4-month fee holiday. We expect to activate several other drawdown funds over the balance of the year, followed by respective fee holidays.\nSecond, our platform perpetual strategies has continued to expand, now comprising 45% of the firm's fee-earning AUM. As a reminder, private wealth perpetual vehicles, including BREIT and BCRED, generate fee-related performance revenues quarterly as will BXPE starting in Q4 of this year. Our institutional strategies, BPP and real estate and BIP and infrastructure, generate these revenues on multiyear schedules with a sizable crystallization for the comingled BIP vehicle scheduled to occur in Q4 of this year with respect to 3 years of accrued gains.\nThird, our investment-grade-focused credit business is on a strong positive trajectory, as Jon highlighted, and we expect $25 billion to $30 billion inflows again this year from our 4 major insurance clients below.\nIn closing, the firm has moved forward in a position of significant strength. Our momentum is accelerating in key growth channels, and our underlying earnings power emerging from this period of hibernation continues to build. We have great confidence in the outlook for the firm.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nGreat. Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO. Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-K report later next month. I'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K.\nWe'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website. Also note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audio cast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nQuickly on results. We reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $109 million. Distributable earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.11 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.94, which will be paid to holders of record as of February 5.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our call. Blackstone reported strong results for the fourth quarter of 2023, including our highest distributable earnings in 6 quarters. which capped a volatile year for global markets.\nMost major equity indices rebounded from significant declines in 2022. And but with wide intrayear swings driven by historic movements in treasury yields, economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability. Against this backdrop,\nBlackstone generated steady fee-related earnings of $4.3 billion for the year, underpinning healthy distributable earnings of $5.1 billion. Performance revenues were down as expected in the context of limited realizations as we choose to sell less in unfavorable markets. We've designed the firm to provide resiliency in times of stress and capture the upside as markets recover.\nIn the fourth quarter, as bond yields declined, markets rallied. We executed several realizations driving strong sequential growth in DE to $1.4 billion. 2023 is also a year of important milestones for Blackstone. We were the first alternative manager to surpass $1 trillion of assets under management.\nWe were also the first in our sector to be added to the S&P 500 Index, positioning our stock to be even more widely owned. We are pleased that PX shares ranked in the top 20 best performing out of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 Index last year.\nBlackstone is now the fifth largest U.S. public company by market cap, exceeding the market value of all other asset managers. And in December, we released our sixth annual holiday video which has received over 8 million views, which may not say something about our limited acting skills, but it certainly says something about the Blackstone brand.\nOur funds appreciated overall in 2023, highlighted by strength in credit, infrastructure, corporate private equity and Life Sciences, even as we weathered a difficult environment for real estate.\nStepping back over the last 2 years, the campaign by central banks to control inflation has resulted in muted returns for most traditional asset classes. The S&P 500 returned only 3% over 2 years, while the media and U.S. stock actually declined 9%, and the REIT index was down 14%. The traditional 60-40 portfolio lost value, down 3%.\nIn contrast, Blackstone's flagship strategies generated positive appreciation for this period and meaningfully outperformed the relevant public indices. For example, our corporate private equity funds appreciated 12% and over the past 2 years compared to the S&P up 3%. That's outperformance of 9%.\nOur real estate equity strategies appreciated 1% to 6% compared to negative 14% for public REITs. So that's a dramatic outperformance. In credit, our private credit strategies appreciated 25% gross while the high-yield index was up only 2%.\nAM generated a 13% gross return for the beef composite over the past 2 years. A remarkable achievement in liquid markets and well ahead of the hedge fund index, it actually was down 1%. That's our performance of 12%.\nAnd finally, our infrastructure business appreciated 33% over the past 2 years compared to only a 7% return for the S&P Infrastructure Index. That's an outperformance of 26%. This outstanding performance is 1 of the reasons we've been able to build this platform from 0 6 years ago to over $40 billion today.\nOverall, the ability to outperform market indices over long periods of time is why the alternatives asset class and Blackstone in particular, continue to have significant momentum. Our limited partners have benefited from the exceptional balance of the firm and the careful way we've positioned their capital in a volatile world.\nOne of the key advantages that comes from our leading scale is having more, better and richer private data which informs how we invest. And Jon referred to this on television today. Our portfolio consists of over 230 companies. More than 12,000 real estate assets and 1 of the largest credit businesses in the world.\nWe marshal real-time data across these holdings to develop macro insights that we then share across all of our businesses, allowing the firm to adapt quickly to changing conditions. We believe our access to information exceeds that of our competitors, and it positions the firm very well as we move towards a world driven by artificial intelligence, an area on which we are already very focused.\nThis process of aggregating data and information helps us identify trends early and often, leads us to differentiated views on what's happening around the world. In early '21, for example, it led us to the conclusion that inflation would be higher and more pervasive than the consensus expectation, and we've positioned the firm accordingly. We then started speaking publicly that inflation was moderating as early as October 2022 and with increasing frequency in 2023.\nData from our portfolio companies showed that input cost inflation was rapidly declining. We persisted in this view even when the 10-year treasury yield spike to a 16-year high of 5% in October. As we all know, the 10 years subsequently declined over 100 basis points into year-end. The opposite of what many market participants believed would happen.\nOur access to information is an enduring competitive advantage here at Blackstone, and this advantage grows as we grow larger. As we move into 2024, we note that the rise in investor confidence around the shift from a restrictive monetary policy to 1 that is more accommodating. We now believe CPI is running below the Fed's 2% target.\nAfter adjusting the reported numbers for shelter costs, which lagged what we've observed on the ground as 1 of the largest investors in this area. At the same time, the U.S. economy has remained quite strong.\nUnemployment is nearly unchanged since the start of the Fed's tightening cycle. Most consumer segments are healthy, but the balance sheets are strong and credit fundamentals remain solid.\nIn our own portfolio, our companies are showing strong top line performance overall as well as earnings growth as cost pressures have eased. We see a resilient economy albeit 1 that is so decelerating. What we're seeing is consistent with the soft planning.\nOverall, with the cost of capital moving lower, market confidence returning, we believe we're entering a supportive environment for our business. While changing market conditions take time to fully translate to our financial results.\nThe fourth quarter reflected an acceleration in key forward indicators, including both fundraising and deployment. We're planting seeds and expanding invested capital in the ground. And with nearly $200 billion of dry powder, our purchasing power for investments, exceeds almost any other company in the world. I believe that we'll look back at 2023 as the cyclical bottom for our firm.\nLooking forward, Blackstone is exceptionally well positioned to navigate the road ahead. Our investors can count on the dedication of our people and the enduring nature of our culture, characterized by excellence, achievement, teamwork, hard work and the highest standards of ethics and integrity.\nOur employees embody these values. And they approach their work every day the passion for what they do and an unwavering commitment to serving our clients. We've created an environment the firm that is defined by meritocracy, and a quality of opportunity.\nWe do not discriminate against anyone based on race, ethnic background, religious beliefs, gender or sexual orientation. We are proud of these values. Our people want to create and build their careers at Blackstone, and there is a huge demand to work at the firm.\nWe had 62,000 unique applicants for 169 positions in the latest analyst class, reflecting an acceptance rate of $0.27 million 1%, a dramatic change from when we started the firm 38 years ago, when frankly anyone wanted to join us. This provides the foundation for the next generation of remarkable talent and will drive our growth for the foreseeable future.\nBlackstone is an extraordinary place. and our prospects are very strong. I am highly enthusiastic about what we will accomplish for our shareholders in 2024. And with that, I'll throw the ball over to Jon?\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nI'm happy to catch it. Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud of how we've navigated the challenging markets of the past few years by focusing on the right sectors. We believe we're now heading into a better environment, as Steve noted, with inflation and cost of capital headwinds moderating.\nThis backdrop is leading to the emergence of 3 powerful dynamics across our business. First, we believe that real estate values are bottoming. Second, our momentum in the private wealth channel is building. And third, investment activity has picked up meaningfully across the firm, which is a key element of creating future value.\nI'll discuss each of these dynamics in more detail. First, as I said, we believe values in commercial real estate are bottoming. This doesn't mean there won't be more troubled real estate investments to come in the market, particularly in the office sector, which were set up during a period when borrowing costs were much lower nor does it mean we won't see a slowing in fundamentals in certain sectors with excess near-term supply.\nWhat it does mean is that the cost of capital peaked as borrowing spreads have begun to tighten and the Fed is no longer raising rates, but likely cutting them in 2024. Also importantly, new construction starts have started to move down sharply in commercial real estate, which is quite positive for long-term values.\nWhile it will take time we can see the pillars of a real estate recovery coming into place. We are, of course, not waiting for all clear sign and believe the best investments are made during times of uncertainty.\nWe announced 3 major real estate transactions in the past 2 months, the $3.5 billion take-private of Tricon Residential, a partnership with Digital Realty to develop $7 billion of data centers and a joint venture with the FDIC to acquire a 20% stake in a $17 billion first mortgage portfolio from the former Signature Bank.\nWe think this is just the start, as Blackstone Real Estate has $65 billion of dry powder to invest into this dislocated market. Meanwhile, in our existing portfolio, we've absorbed the Increase in interest rates and cash flows are growing or stable in most areas. We continue to see robust fundamentals in logistics, student housing and data centers which together comprise the majority of our real estate equity portfolio.\nThat said, in Q4, the value of our funds declined by 4% to 4.5%, primarily relating to 2 factors: First, the single largest driver was the decline in the unrealized value of our interest rate hedges as treasury yields fell. We put these structures in place to fix our financing costs ahead of the rise in interest rates, and they have generated significant value.\nSecond, in our life sciences office and U.S. multifamily holdings, near-term performance has decelerated as new supply works is through the system. The residual effect of construction undertaken in a low rate environment. The good news is that new supply in these sectors and for virtually all other types of real estate is declining materially, as I mentioned.\nWe believe that with our exceptional portfolio positioning in large-scale dry powder, our real estate business will emerge from this cycle even stronger than before. Outside of real estate, our other businesses are demonstrating resiliency and fundamental strength.\nOur credit and insurance teams had a remarkable year in 2023, with gross returns of 16.4% in the private credit strategies and 13% in liquid credit. These are extraordinary results for a performing credit business. The default rate across our nearly 2,000 noninvestment-grade credits is only 30 basis points over the last 12 months.\nAnd in our investment-grade focused business, we placed or originated $30 billion of a quality credits on average in 2023 for our major insurance clients. which generated 190 basis points of excess spread compared to comparably rated liquid credits.\nIn corporate private equity, our operating company's overall reported healthy revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 7% year-over-year, along with margin strength. On the inflation front, wage growth continued to moderate and for the first time in 2.5 years, the majority of our surveyed companies are not finding it challenging to hire workers.\nAnd finally, for BAM, since the start of 2021, when we brought in Joe Dowling to lead the business, the BPS composite has been up every quarter, outperforming the 60-40 portfolio by approximately 1,200 basis points.\nMoving to the second key dynamic emerging in our business, our momentum in private wealth. Blackstone has been serving this channel with a dedicated organization for 13 years, and we are the clear market leader with nearly $240 billion of AUM.\nWe built enormous trust with our investors by delivering outstanding long-term performance, including 11% net returns annually from BREIT's largest share class and 10% for BCRED. We raised nearly $5 billion in the channel in Q4, including $3.6 billion for our perpetual vehicles. Subscriptions for perpetuals accelerated to $2.7 billion on January 2, reflecting the best month of fundraising from individual investors since June 2022.\nBCRED had its best month since May 2022, raising $1.1 billion in January, and our new private equity vehicle, BXP, raised $1.3 billion in January, which we believe is the largest ever first close of its kind. BXP will leverage the firm's full breadth of investment capabilities in private equity, including buyout, secondaries, tactical opportunities, life sciences growth and other opportunistic strategies.\nAt the same time, BREIT has weathered the storm in real estate markets and December repurchase requests were down over 50% from Q3 and down 80% from last January's peak. If current trends continue, we expect to be out of proration this quarter.\nBREIT's semi-liquid structure has worked as design since launching the vehicle 7 years ago, by providing liquidity while protecting performance. In 6 of those years, redeeming investors were fulfilled immediately. Over the past year, it took a little over 4 months on average to be substantially redeemed.\nWe believe investors experience of receiving double the public REIT market over the past 7 years with this semi-liquid structure is proof of concept. We continue to be optimistic about our prospects in the vast and underpenetrated private wealth channel, given our performance, the investment we've made in distribution and our highly differentiated brand.\nIn addition to private wealth, we also have very strong momentum in the insurance channel. Our AUM grew 20% year-over-year to $192 billion and we have clear line of sight to $250 billion over the next several years with existing clients alone. We expect to benefit from multiple engines of growth as these clients execute pension risk transfers, additional annuity sales, new insurance block deals and separate accounts for sector-specific lending.\nTurning to the third key dynamic the firm's investment activity is accelerating. Following a choppy year, we deployed $31 billion in the fourth quarter, up 2.5x from Q3 and committed $15 billion to pending transactions. We continue to emphasize key thematic areas including digital infrastructure, enterprise software and energy transition.\nIn private equity, we're privatizing 2 leading digital marketplaces, including Adevinta in Europe and Rover, my family's favorite in the pet space. We also committed to acquire an energy services software firm in the U.S. and an online payments business in Japan.\nIn credit, borrower demand is multiples of supply today, and deployment in our credit, insurance and real estate credit businesses more than tripled in Q4 compared to the third quarter to $21 billion. And we've also been providing creatively structured capital solutions in Tac Opps, secondaries and BAM. As Steve highlighted, we're planning seeds for future realizations at a favorable moment.\nIn closing, we're optimistic on the path ahead with multiple powerful dynamics unfolding in our business. They not be a straight line, but as always, our brand and track record will continue to drive us forward. and our shareholders stand to benefit from the firm's substantial embedded earnings power over time.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Michael Chae.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. The firm delivered resilient performance in 2023. And as we move forward beyond what we believe was a cyclical trough for key business lines, we are well positioned.\nI'll first review financial results and then we'll discuss the key elements of the forward outlook. Starting with results. Total AUM increased 7% year-over-year to new record levels, led by robust strength in credit and insurance. Total inflows reached nearly $150 billion for the full year, the third best in our history despite the challenging fundraising environment, highlighting the firm's expansive breadth of strategies.\nFee earning AUM increased 6% year-over-year, while base management fees rose 7% to a record $6.5 billion. Q4 represented the 56th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in base management fees at the firm. Fee related earnings were $4.3 billion for the year or $3.58 per share, stable with the prior year, underpinned by the growth in management fees, along with continued margin expansion, notwithstanding a decline in fee-related performance revenues.\nFRE margin expanded 75 basis points to 57.8% for the full year, the highest level ever. fee-related performance revenues were $859 million for the year, with a lower contribution from real estate, partly offset by a 51% year-over-year increase in these revenues from our direct lending business as it continues to grow in scale and impact to the firm's financials. Distributable earnings were $5.1 billion in 2023 or $3.95 per common share.\nWhile FRE was a balance to earnings throughout the year, the shape of the year was driven by our sales activity. Net realizations were muted in the first 3 quarters as we remained highly selective amid the volatile backdrop for broader markets and asset values.\nIn the fourth quarter, we took advantage of more favorable conditions to execute the sales of public stock across multiple holdings, along with a number of other realizations. In addition, BAM crystallizes incentive fees for most of its open-ended strategies annually in Q4, and the segment's performance revenues increased 43% year-over-year, commensurate with its strong overall 2023 investment performance.\nIn total, net realizations for the firm were $425 million in the fourth quarter, up 16% year-over-year and up 64% sequentially from Q3. The growth in net realizations lifted total distributed earnings to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. the highest level in 6 quarters, as Steve highlighted, or $1.11 per common share.\nMoving to the outlook. The firm is moving forward with strong underlying momentum across multiple drivers of growth. First, in our drawdown fund business, we've raised over 80% of our $150 billion target for the most recent vintage of flagships, but less than half was earning management fees as of year-end. We expect this to increase to the substantial majority earning management fees by the latter part of 2024.\nWe recently launched the investment period for our European real estate vehicle. And over the coming quarters, we expect to activate our flagships in corporate private equity, PE energy transition, growth equity, infrastructure secondaries and by early next year, GP stakes in Life Sciences.\nThese funds will earn fees following their respective fee holidays. We expect to activate our corporate private equity flagship in the near term, which has raised $18 billion to date to a target of at least $20 billion, followed by a 4-month fee holiday.\nAt the same time, we are moving towards the next vintage of fundraising for multiple strategies, including the near-term launch of fundraising for our fifth private credit opportunistic strategy, targeting $10 billion.\nSecond, our perpetual capital platform has continued to expand today comprising 44% of the firm's fee-earning AUM. Key drivers of recent growth include BCRED and our infrastructure platform, which grew fee-earning AUM by 26% and 21% in 2023, respectively.\nThe co-mingled VIP infrastructure vehicle has achieved 15% net returns annually since inception, and its next scheduled crystallization of fee-related performance revenues will occur in the fourth quarter of this year with respect to 3 years of gains.\nThird, in the insurance channel, AUM has reached $192 billion, up 20% year-over-year, as John noted, driven principally by our 4 major clients, and we anticipate substantial inflows from them going forward underpinning strong growth in fee revenues and FRE in this channel.\nFinally, with respect to realizations, we are positioned for an eventual acceleration in realizations in the context of more supportive markets, although it will take time to build the pipeline. Performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground is $505 billion, up 12% over the past 2 years despite volatile markets and up over 70% in 3 years.\nWe hold a large-scale, high-quality portfolio, which is well diversified across asset classes, regions and vintages. And net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet stands at $5.8 billion.\nThe firm's embedded performance-related earnings power is significant. As always, our long-term capital affords us the patients to optimize our exits over time as markets heal in order to maximize value for our investors. In closing, history has shown that Blackstone has always emerged from cycles even stronger.\nOur business has been built on this throughout nearly 4 decades. We are now in the process of emerging from a significant cycle and we are confident that history will repeat itself again because of the power of our brand, our platform, our people and our culture.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call and would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThank you, Katie, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's third quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $921 million. Distributable earnings were $1.2 billion or $0.94 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.80, which will be paid to holders of record as of October 30.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our call. Before we begin, I wanted to take a moment to acknowledge the recent events in Israel. We were shocked by the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred, which are an upfront to our shared human values. And we are deeply saddened by the violence and tragic loss of life unfolding in the region. Our thoughts are with the people of Israel, our colleagues there and all of those enduring pain and hardship throughout the region.\nTurning to our results. The third quarter of 2023 was a volatile period for global markets, including a dramatic increase in bond yields. Most major equity indices have declined and the median U.S. stock is negative on a year-to-year basis. Higher interest rates, along with the confluence of other factors, including economic uncertainty, geopolitical turbulence, high fiscal deficits, political dysfunction and labor unrest have adversely impacted investor sentiment.\nToday's environment is an extremely challenging one for investors to navigate. Against this backdrop, Blackstone generated distributable earnings of $1.2 billion in the third quarter, which were stable with the second quarter. The environment today is less favorable for realizations, so we've chosen to sell less. But the firm's underlying earnings power continues to build, and we remain focused on executing the operating plans for our companies and driving the long-term value of our holdings.\nOur limited partners continue to benefit from the favorable positioning of our portfolio with resilient fundamentals in the sectors where we're focused, which Jon will discuss further. The result is that nearly all of our flagship strategies outperformed market indices in the third quarter, as they have for nearly 40 years.\nThe firm's global scale gives us deep insights into what's happening in the real economy, which inform how we position the firm and construct our portfolios amid changing conditions. We've been saying consistently that we believe the Fed will keep rates higher for longer, and we didn't share the previous consensus view that they would cut rates by the end of this year.\nWhat we are seeing in the data is an economy that's strong today, but decelerating. We also see that significant progress is being made on inflation, perhaps more so than other market participants, based on the movement in bond yields recently. In our portfolio, we estimate input costs were largely flat year-over-year, wage growth is moderating and job openings are declining.\nThough it will take time, we believe the collective weight central bank actions will bring about the intended effect of cooling the economy, leading to the conditions for a more accommodative Fed stance and an eventual easing of the cost of capital.\nMeanwhile, Blackstone's unique diversity and breadth, with over 70 distinct investment strategies, position us extremely well to navigate any environment. The balance of our firm allows us to pivot to where we see the greatest opportunities at a given point in the cycle. For example, our credit businesses are thriving today in the context of very favorable operating environment, given higher base rates, along with challenges to traditional lenders.\nInvestment performance has been outstanding, including 14.4% appreciation over the last 12 months in our private credit strategies and 4.6% just in the third quarter. Unsurprisingly, client demand in this area is accelerating across all channels: institutional, insurance and individuals.\nIn keeping pace with this evolving opportunity, we recently announced the integration of our corporate credit, asset-backed finance and insurance groups into a single new unit, BXCI. We expect this integration will create a more seamless experience for clients and borrowers, allowing us to offer a one-stop solution across corporate and asset-based private credit, including both investment grade and non-investment grade.\nWe believe these changes will further accelerate growth, and the BXCI real estate credit collectively could grow AUM from approximately $370 billion today to $1 trillion within the next 10 years, given the powerful secular tailwinds and strength of our platform.\nIn addition to credit and insurance, we are seeing compelling near-term dynamics in several other areas where Blackstone has established leading businesses, such as infrastructure, notably including digital infrastructure; energy transition and Life Sciences. The private wealth channel also remains a tremendous long-term opportunity for the firm. Jon will discuss the positive developments in these areas in more detail.\nOverall, limited partners continue to move away from the traditional 60-40 liquid portfolio. And despite market headwinds, they are allocating more capital to the best alternative managers across more asset classes.\nBlackstone is extremely well positioned to capture future opportunities for growth in the alternatives area, which remains early in its long-term development. We are the reference institution among global LPs, a position that has been continually reinforced across market cycles of nearly 40 years. We have led the industry's evolution, and I expect we will continue to lead it in the future.\nLast month, we were gratified that S&P Dow Jones chose Blackstone as the first major alternative manager to be included in the S&P 500, the largest benchmark index, and the last one, where Blackstone is not yet a part of, following our conversion to a corporation in 2019. This milestone is a further reflection of the firm's leadership position in our industry and the broader market, as well as our progression as a valuable and widely owned public company.\nMost importantly, we've continued to generate exceptional long-term results for both our fund investors and our shareholders. This is our mission, it's what drives us forward as a firm. While the market environment will undoubtedly present challenges, we'll also provide opportunities we are well positioned to capitalize upon, with over $200 billion of dry powder. These are the times to best highlight the distinctiveness of our firm and the enduring nature of our culture. Everyone at Blackstone is completely focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The investment performance we've consistently produced over decades has created a huge reservoir of goodwill with our customers, allowing us to grow even in difficult periods. Meanwhile, our platform expansion provides multiple ways to win for them across market cycles. And as Steve noted, virtually all customer channels are increasing their allocations to alternatives over time, many in a material way.\nThese key pillars give me great confidence in the future of Blackstone. Starting with investment performance. Our funds generated positive appreciation overall in the third quarter compared to declines in nearly all major market indices, with significant strength in private credit, infrastructure and Life Sciences. Against the backdrop where the cost of capital has risen considerably, it is critical to own high-quality businesses with secular tailwinds or assets that benefit from higher rates, like floating rate credit.\nIn real estate, Blackstone is in an extremely differentiated position. The majority of the equity portfolio is in logistics, data centers and student housing, which continue to benefit from robust fundamentals. Our data center business, QTS, held in BREIT, BPP and our infrastructure vehicle was the single largest source of appreciation at the firm, driven by explosive growth in data creation that is being accelerated by the AI revolution.\nSince privatizing the company 2 years ago, lease capacity has grown sixfold, with the development pipeline preleased to major tech companies. And we are evaluating additional deployment opportunities in the space. In logistics, the firm's largest exposure overall, trends remain favorable with re-leasing spreads in our U.S. warehouses of over 60% in recent months, and similarly, strong dynamics in many of our other major logistics markets globally.\nAt the same time, market rents continue to move higher. In certain other areas of the portfolio, including our U.S. apartment buildings, we're seeing moderation in growth. But cash flows are stable or increasing across the vast majority of our real estate holdings. That said, higher interest rates are impacting valuation multiples in the sector. This is also having the effect of meaningfully reducing the new supply pipeline, which is favorable for values longer term.\nConstruction starts are falling sharply for virtually all types of real estate, including year-over-year declines of 30% to 70% for U.S. apartment buildings, warehouses and hotels. And in the dislocated market, having $66 billion of dry powder in real estate is a significant advantage.\nIn corporate private equity, our operating companies reported resilient, high single-digit revenue growth in the third quarter, with strong margin performance as cost pressures continue to abate. In credit, the increase in base rates has been very positive for our clients. Today, we can originate high-quality senior loans with all-in yields of over 12% at sub-40% loan-to-value ratios.\nMeanwhile, our existing portfolio is stable and default rates remain historically low at under 50 basis points for our noninvestment-grade holdings. In our investment-grade credit portfolio, in 2023, we've delivered 140 basis points of excess spread to our major insurance clients while materially improving credit quality.\nAnd finally, BAAM had its 14th consecutive quarter of positive performance for the BPS composite. Since the start of 2021, BAAM has achieved a 17% cumulative composite net return compared to a 2% decline in the 60-40 portfolio, equating to exceptional outperformance in liquid markets. The strength of our returns and the breadth of our firm allow us to continue raising significant capital in a very difficult fundraising environment.\nTotal inflows were $25 billion in the third quarter and $139 billion over the past 12 months. The greatest demand today is for private credit solutions, as Steve discussed, and our credit, insurance and real estate credit businesses comprised over 50% of total inflows again in the third quarter. In the insurance channel, our major clients allocated $5 billion to us in the quarter bringing AUM to $178 billion, with a promising pipeline of additional prospects.\nWe also finished raising our energy transition private credit fund, BGREEN, with a strategy reaching $7.5 billion, the largest of its kind in the world. And in the individual channel, BCRED, raised $2.5 billion in the third quarter, up 36% from Q2 on the back of strong performance. Outside of credit, other major fund closings in the third quarter included our European real estate flagship, which has raised over EUR 4 billion to date.\nOver half of our investment activity in real estate this year has been in Europe given greater dislocation and pressure on sellers in the region. We also raised $1.2 billion in tactical opportunities, $1.1 billion for secondaries vehicles and an additional $500 million for our corporate private equity flagship.\nWe previously highlighted several other growth avenues with favorable momentum. We've been innovating and planting seeds in these areas, which have now blossomed into major businesses at Blackstone. Our infrastructure platform has grown to $40 billion in only 5 years, including 28% growth in the last 12 months. Performance has been extraordinary, with 17% net returns annually since inception for our BIP vehicle. Given the immense funding needs for infrastructure projects globally and outperformance, we believe this could be a $100 billion business over time.\nKey areas of focus include digital infrastructure, such as QTS, along with the energy transition. BIP's largest investment in Q3 was a wind and solar portfolio from AEP, which is part of a broader renewable asset strategy. Other significant investments by the firm recently in energy transition include additional capital in the nation's largest private renewables developer,and a stake in a major U.S. utility to support its transition to green energy.\nAnd in credit, we committed $600 million in Q3 to a platform we're building to provide preferred equity financing to leading renewable companies. With BIP and our dedicated credit and private equity energy transition vehicles, we are extremely well positioned to benefit from the massive tailwinds in this rapidly growing sector.\nIn Life Sciences, our BXLS business had a terrific quarter and is experiencing strong momentum. Our funds appreciated 11.7%, with notable positive developments for several life-saving medications and technologies, including an anticoagulant drug to help prevent strokes, a treatment for hypertension and a next-generation implantable defibrillator. We're also being actively deploying capital, most recently to help fund a leading biotech firm focused on treatments for rare diseases. We plan to start raising our next Life Sciences flagship vehicle early next year.\nFinally, in Private Wealth, we raised $3.3 billion in our perpetual vehicles in the third quarter, led by BCRED. For BREIT, while sales remained muted due to the environment at $724 million, repurchase requests have declined materially, down nearly 30% from Q2 and nearly 60% from the January peak. BREIT's largest share class has delivered 12% net return since inception, approximately 7 years ago, nearly 4x the public REIT index. Meanwhile, all investors have been submitting repurchase requests during the proration period have been substantially redeemed in 6 months or less.\nBREIT's semi-liquid vehicle has worked exactly as intended by providing liquidity for investors in a deliberate and thoughtful way while protecting performance. Blackstone has established the largest private wealth alternatives platform in the world. Now in addition to our perpetual strategies in real estate and credit, we're extending our leading franchise to include private equity with the launch of a new perpetual vehicle, BXPE.\nThis diversified vehicle will leverage the firm's unique breadth of investment capabilities across the PE spectrum, including buyout secondaries, tactical opportunities, life sciences and other opportunistic strategies. We are working with several distributors and expect inflows to start early next year. We're excited to add this new vehicle to our product lineup and remain optimistic about our long-term growth trajectory in this vast and underpenetrated channel.\nIn closing, despite the market's near-term challenges, we remain focused on delivering for our investors over the long term. We are executing our asset-light, brand-heavy strategy with minimal net debt and no insurance liabilities, and we have powerful momentum across a multitude of growth channels of enormous size.\nWith that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. The headline for the firm's financial performance in the third quarter is stability amid a challenging external operating environment. Despite executing fewer sales in less favorable markets, we are generating a consistent and attractive baseline of earnings and dividends for shareholders. Meanwhile, we continue to expand the foundation of the firm's earnings power across multiple drivers of growth.\nStarting with results. As Steve and Jon highlighted, the firm's extraordinary breadth has supported continued growth in AUM despite the broader market declines. Total AUM increased 6% year-over-year, moving beyond the $1 trillion model, led by 10% growth in the credit insurance segment. Fee earning AUM rose 4% to a record $735 billion, driving base management fees up 6% to $1.6 billion, reflecting the 55th consecutive quarter of year-over-year base management fee growth at Blackstone.\nFee-related earnings were $1.1 billion in the third quarter or $0.92 per share. largely stable with Q2, underpinned by steady top line performance along with the firm's strong market position. The year-over-year comparison was affected by a decline in transaction fees, which are activity-based, as well as lower fee-related performance revenues, Notwithstanding these headwinds, the firm generated $275 million of fee-related performance revenues in the third quarter across multiple perpetual vehicles in real estate and credit, notably reflecting the growing contribution from BCRED along with a material year-over-year increase from the BPP platform.\nDistributable earnings were $1.2 million in the third quarter or $0.94 per share, again stable with Q2. On a year-over-year basis, net realizations declined given the market backdrop. However, we did execute the sales of public stock in the London Stock Exchange Group and our stake in an India-based software company, along with certain other holdings in private equity. Realizations also included a significant sale in BREIT, which, as a reminder, does not earn performance revenues based on individual asset sales but on NAV, subject to a hurdle.\nThe sale was of a self-storage company for $2.2 billion, one of the largest ever transactions in the sector, which generated a profit of over $600 million and a gross multiple of invested capital of 1.8x in less than 3 years. BREIT's asset sales since the beginning of last year when interest rates began moving materially higher, have occurred at an average premium to their prior carrying value of 4%.\nOverall, we've been highly selective in terms of realizations, and activity is likely to remain muted in the near term given the environment. But the firm's FRE continues to provide real balance to earnings, and Q3 represented the eighth consecutive quarter of FRE over $1 billion. Meanwhile, our long-term fund structures let us focus on building value in the portfolio while we wait for market conditions to improve.\nPerformance revenue eligible AUM in the ground increased in the third quarter to a record $505 billion, and has nearly doubled in the past 3 years. Net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet, affirmed store value, stands at $6.4 billion or $5.29 per share. We hold an expansive portfolio of exceptional quality and embedded value, including $16 billion of public stock in our private equity and real estate drawdown funds. When markets ultimately become more receptive, we are well positioned for an acceleration in realization activity as well.\nMoving to the outlook. We remain highly confident in the multiyear expansion of the firm's earning power and FRE, with several embedded growth drivers. First, in our drawdown fund business, we've raised nearly 80% of our $150 billion target, but less than half was earning management fees at quarter end. We launched the investment period for the new European real estate flagship in September, which will earn management fees after an effective 4-month fee holiday for first closers.\nOver the next several quarters, subject to deployment, we expect to activate the new flagships for private equity, private equity energy transition, growth equity and infrastructure secondaries, followed by the respective fee [indiscernible]. Second, our platform of perpetual strategies has continued to expand, including BCRED, which generates fee-related performance revenues quarterly based on investment tail and our BIP infrastructure vehicle, with its next crystallization scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter of 2024 with respect to 3 years of gains.\nThird, in the insurance area, AUM has reached $178 billion, as Jon noted, up 18% year-over-year, driven by robust inflows from our major clients from whom we anticipate substantial largely contractual inflows in the years ahead.\nIn closing, the firm's all-weather business model provides resiliency and staying power in difficult markets. Meanwhile, our underlying earnings power continues to build, and we have greater investment firepower than ever before. With multiple growth engines driving us forward, we are well positioned for the future.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThank you, Katie, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's second quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website, and we expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks. I'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K.

Distributable earnings were also $1.2 billion or $0.93 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.79 per share, which will be paid to holders of record as of July 31.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Weston, and good morning. Thank you all for joining the call. Blackstone reached a remarkable milestone in the second quarter. We surpassed $1 trillion of assets under management. The first alternative manager to do so of more than 3 years ahead of the aspirational road map we presented at our Investor Day in 2018.\nThis achievement is significant in many ways, including for me personally. I founded Blackstone with my partner, Pete Peterson, in 1985 with $400,000 of startup capital. We sent out 450 personal announcements of our new venture and published a full-page newspaper ad with the expectation that the phone would start ringing off the hook. It was a humbling experience when no one called other than a few people wishing us luck.\nWhen we started raising our first private equity fund in 1986 with a $1 billion target, we discovered that giving a $5 million or $10 million commitment was a substantial accomplishment. Fortunately, we hung in there, and we were ultimately successful.\nLooking at Blackstone today, I feel an immense sense of pride. We've established an unparalleled global platform of leading business lines, offering over 70 distinct investment strategies. We believe our clients view us as the gold standard in alternative asset management. And this milestone reflects the extraordinary level of trust we've built with them over nearly 4 decades.\nWe've delivered for them in good times and bad, generating $300 billion of aggregate gains with minimal losses. In fact, virtually all of our drawdown funds we've launched in our history, have been profitable for our investors. Our performance has helped secure retirees' pensions, fund students educations, pay health care benefits and protect and grow the savings of individual investors.\nWe are tremendously proud of the role we've played in driving these outcomes. Our ability to create excess returns over long periods of time in support of these critically important objectives is what distinguishes us as a firm that powers our growth. This milestone is also reflective of Blackstone's distinctive positioning as the leading innovator in our industry.\nAt our founding, we determined the building a great company required us to be in a continuous innovation mode, which we have institutionalized as a core competency of the firm. Our original strategic plan, which was to start in corporate advisory and then quickly move into private equity, followed by a succession of other asset management businesses over time.\nWe only entered a new area, and we saw the opportunity to generate great risk-adjusted returns for our customers. We identified a remarkable leader the new area created intellectual capital that benefited the rest of the firm. For example, we entered the hedge fund of funds business in 1990. Real estate in 1991 when values had collapsed following the savings and loan crisis. And credit in 1998, which we expanded substantially in 2008 ahead of the generational investment opportunities that arose from the global financial crisis.\nIn 2011, we launched a dedicated private wealth business. The following year, we created tactical opportunities. And the year after that, we entered the nascent secondaries market for drawdown funds. In 2017, we launched our infrastructure strategy. In 2018, we started both our insurance solutions management and life sciences businesses. And in 2020, we launched our first growth equity fund. Today, nearly all of these major lines of business are market leaders in their respective asset classes with exceptional long-term performance.\nThere are many advantages that come from our unique scale. With our portfolio of over 230 companies, 12,000 real estate assets and 1 of the largest lending businesses in the world, we believe that we have more information than just about anyone competing with us. We specialize in the production and analysis of enormous amounts of data, which we review every week in our Monday morning meetings with each of our major product lines.\nThis process done over 35 years,helps us identify trends before others and adjust where we invest our clients' capital. This also allows us to maintain a hands-on management style, keeps our professionals fully connected and supports centralized decision-making. Our focus on data aggregation and analysis also led us to establish our own data science group early as 2015. We started building a team of exceptional data scientists, which today numbers over 50 people, and we are rapidly and significantly expanding our capabilities in artificial intelligence\nWe've been using AI to help improve operations and our portfolio companies as well as the Blackstone itself. We believe that the new generation of AI has the potential to transform companies and industries. And the timeliness and effectiveness of its implementation will be determinative of who the winners and losers will be. Blackstone fortunately, is in an NVO position in the alternative asset world with an 8-year head start in this field, and we are committed to further expanding our leadership position there as quickly as possible.\nOur growth along with our commitment to meritocracy have also allowed us to attract and retain great talent, many of the best people in the world want to work here at Blackstone. This year, we had 62,000 unique applicants for 1691st year analyst positions, equating to a selection rate of less than 0.3 of 1%. Getting an entry-level job at Blackstone is 12x harder than getting into Harvard. I doubt I'd be able to be hired today. I'm not sure that's a great thing.\nOur scale has also been the firm even safer. We're an A+ rated manager of third-party capital distributed across hundreds of segregated investment vehicles. We don't depend on deposits for our funding. And the vast majority of our capital is under long-term contracts or perpetual, which we carefully aligned with the duration of our investments.\nWe don't operate with a cross-collateralized balance sheet like depository institutions. We have virtually no net leverage at the parent company compared to U.S. banks with an average of 12x leverage, and we have no insurance liabilities. We've always believed in extreme conservatism in managing our capital structure and the structure of our funds.\nAs the largest manager today, Blackstone has led the adoption of alternatives which have revolutionized the field of investment management. When we started in 1985, alternatives were basically limited to private equity, and there were only a few public pension funds have insurance companies who invested in the asset class. Diamonds, sovereign wealth funds and retail investors, for example, have virtually no participation.\nOver the subsequent 4 decades, alternatives have grown to $12 trillion of assets. But this is still small compared to the $225 trillion of liquid stocks and bonds. With a minimal share of total investable assets today, we expect alternatives to expand substantially in the future. I believe that Blackstone, given our unique brand and global reach is the best-positioned firm in the world to capture future opportunities for growth in the alternatives area.\nThe most compelling of these today include private credit and insurance, infrastructure globally, energy transition, large sciences the development of the alternatives business in Asia and the private wealth channel, where the democratization of alternatives in its early stages. Jon will discuss these areas in more detail. Our mission since 1985 is to be the best in the world at what we choose to do.\nEven this we've grown, we've never strayed from this mission or from the core values that have defined us, including excellence, integrity, aristocracy, teamwork and dedication to serving our customers. Work at our firm, you must believe in our mission and embody these values. Blackstone is an extraordinary place. Our prospects are accelerating. We never rest on our achievements, and we're always looking ahead, striving to lift the firm to new heights. I strongly believe the best is ahead for Blackstone, investors in our funds and our shareholders. And with that, turn the ball over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. $1 trillion is a mile marker on a much longer journey and we are early in our expansion into markets of enormous potential. Of course, it all starts with investment performance. In our drawdown funds, we've delivered 15% net returns annually in corporate private equity and opportunistic real estate for over 30 years. 15% in secondaries, 12% in tactical opportunities and 10% in credit. And our perpetual strategies, which remain continuously invested we've generated 14% net returns in infrastructure, 12% for BREIT's largest share class and 9% for our institutional core-plus real estate funds.\nAnd for our major insurance clients, we produced over 150 basis points of excess spread over the past 6 quarters compared to investment-grade credit with similar ratings or said another way, without adding incremental risk. There are a number of drivers of our outperformance. But as we've grown, picking the right sectors and markets has become more important than ever. where you invest matters, and we continue to benefit from our thematic emphasis on winning areas like global logistics, digital infrastructure and energy transition.\nIn the second quarter, these sectors were among the largest drivers of appreciation in our funds. It's worth noting, we're also seeing strong signs of inflation flowing across our portfolio, which we view as extremely positive for the rate environment going forward, along with valuations for companies and our real estate holdings in particular. Michael will discuss our portfolio positioning and Q2 returns in more detail. The strength of our investment performance over decades allows us to raise scale capital even in a very challenging fundraising environment.\nTotal inflows reached $30 billion in the second quarter and $158 billion over the past 12 months, positioning us with record dry powder of nearly $200 billion. The greatest demand today is for private credit solutions and our corporate credit insurance and real estate debt businesses comprised over 50% of Q2 inflows.\nOur drawdown fund area, we raised additional capital for our corporate PE flagship bringing it to approximately $17 billion, and we expect a total size in the low $20s billion range. We also held an accelerated first close of $1.3 billion for our European real estate flagship and expect another close later this month. Overall, we've raised nearly 75% of our $150 billion target and remain on track to substantially achieve it by early 2024.\nStepping back, Steve highlighted a number of areas with particularly attractive long-term dynamics for our business, starting with credit, where there is a structural shift underway in the market. Traditional financing providers are cautious, while at the same time, both LP demand and borrower need for credit solutions are accelerating, long-term investors, including insurance companies, and institutional LPs hold large portfolios of liquid investment-grade credit assets typically purchased from banks and intermediaries.\nWith our $362 billion platform in credit and real estate credit, we have leading capabilities to directly and efficiently originate high-quality assets on their behalf. We're also partnering with banks and other originators that are facing greater lending constraints but want to continue to serve their customers in areas like home improvement, auto finance and renewables.\nWe've closed or having processed 5 of these partnerships totaling $6 billion and plan to add more. In the $40 trillion insurance channel, we manage $174 billion today. Inflows from this channel were over $7 billion in the second quarter with more than $4 billion from our largest 4 clients. We expect a strong pace of inflows from them going forward, including from 2 of our clients who, on a combined basis, are the second largest sellers of fixed annuities in the U.S. along with a pipeline of additional prospects.\nOther areas in our credit business are showing strong momentum as well. Our global direct lending platform is over $100 billion today. and we see attractive expansion opportunities in the U.S., Europe and Asia. BCRED raised $1.8 billion in the second quarter, up nearly 60% from Q1 and plus approximately $900 million of monthly subscriptions on July 1, and we expect to complete raising our green energy credit vehicle in a few weeks at over $7 billion.\nTurning to infrastructure. Our perpetual BIP strategy is 1 of our fastest-growing areas, up 25% year-over-year to $37 billion. It will be massive funding needs over the next 15 to 20 years for infrastructure projects globally, notably, including digital infrastructure and energy transition, where we are building sizable platforms.\nFirst, in digital infrastructure, there is a well-publicized arms race happening in AI, and the major tech companies are expected to invest $1 trillion over the next 5 years in this area, mostly to data centers.\nIn 2021, we privatized the QTS data center business in BREIT, BIP and BPP for $10 billion and it's showing extraordinary momentum with more capacity leased in the last 2 years than in the previous 17. We expect our investors will benefit significantly from the powerful tailwinds in this rapidly growing sector.\nIn energy transition, decarbonization is projected to require $4.5 trillion of annual investment over the next 25 years, further supported by legislative action globally. This has been 1 of our busiest areas in BIP and also our dedicated energy transition private equity and credit funds.\nThe firm's 2 largest commitments in the second quarter were a stake in a major utility to support its transition from significant coal-powered generation to 0% in 5 years and additional growth capital for our portfolio company, Invenergy, the nation's largest private renewables developer. We believe the need for scale capital and expertise in this area will only increase over time.\nMoving to Life Sciences, major advances in genomics and precision medicines, coupled with a historic shift in the funding model for drug development have created an unprecedented opportunity. We've established an extensive life sciences ecosystem at Blackstone with substantial capabilities and portfolio holdings across the firm.\nOur dedicated BX life sciences, biopharmaceutical -- I'm sorry, our dedicated BXLS business has been actively deploying capital in partnership with major biopharmaceutical and med tech companies, most recently to support development of vaccines for pneumonia. We've also assembled the world's largest private lab office platform in real estate concentrated in great markets like Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nAsia represents another significant opportunity for our firm, cutting across both business lines and distribution channels. India is projected to remain 1 of the fastest-growing major economies in the world, and it's no coincidence. The country is our third largest market for equity investing after the U.S. and U.K. In real estate, we even changed the landscape by working alongside regulators to launch India's first public REITs.\nMeanwhile, Japan is in early stages of its trajectory, both in terms of large investors starting to allocate to alternatives as well as deployment opportunities as the market opens to outside capital. Overall, there is substantial runway ahead for our business in Asia.\nFinally, moving to our private wealth platform. We've established the world's leading alternatives business with approximately $240 billion of AUM. But this is an $80 trillion market with low single-digit allocations to alternatives today. Morgan Stanley's research team recently cited estimates of allocations rising to 10% to 20% over time. This is further substantiated by the discussions we have with the major distributors who tell us they want significantly more exposure to our products.\nAlthough we do face some near-term headwinds BCRED's flows have been accelerating, as I mentioned. And for BREIT, June was the lowest month so far this year in terms of share redemption requests, down nearly 30% from the January peak. Longer term, we remain confident in the reacceleration of growth in this channel, given our portfolio positioning and exceptional performance.\nIn closing, we are highly energized about the firm's prospects. We're focused on the open space in front of us, and we're building simple, scalable and repeatable businesses to tackle opportunities of tremendous size. I could not have more confidence in Blackstone's future.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, which began amid the bank crisis and related market volatility, the firm delivered steady financial results and resilient fund performance. Starting with results. Our expansive breadth of growth engines lifted AUM to new record levels, as you've heard this morning. Total AUM increased 6% year-over-year to $1 trillion. The earning AUM rose 7% year-over-year to $731 billion driving management fees up 9% to a record $1.7 billion.\nNotably, the second quarter marked the 54th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in base management fees at Blackstone. Fee-related earnings increased 12% year-over-year to $1.1 billion or $0.94 per share, powered by the growth in management fees, coupled with the firm's robust margin position.\nFRE rose 10% sequentially from Q1 as fee-related performance revenues nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter to $267 million, even without contribution from BREIT, driven by multiple other perpetual capital vehicles in real estate and credit. As noted previously, we expect these revenues to further accelerate in the second half of this year concentrated in Q4 with a number of scheduled crystallization events in the BPP platform.\nDistributable earnings were $1.2 billion in the second quarter or $0.93 per share, which was largely stable with Q1. The year-over-year comparison was affected by a material decline in net realizations from last year's record quarter. As expected, sales activity has remained muted against a slow transaction backdrop generally.\nHowever, we did execute the sales of public stock in certain of our private equity holdings, along with the portfolio of U.S. warehouses to Pro Lodges for $3.1 billion at an attractive cap rate of 4%, a positive indication of Vale for the $175 billion of warehouses we continue to own which are the firm's largest exposure.\nRealizations in the quarter also included BREIT sale of a resort hotel for $800 million, reflecting a 22% premium to its December carrying value. and a multiple of invested capital of 2.2x. These sales illustrate the exceptional quality and embedded value of our portfolio.\nStepping back, our model focused on long-term committed capital keeps us from being forced sellers when markets are less favorable. During these periods, as we've seen in past cycles, a portion of our earnings related to realizations is interrupted, but ultimately reemerges as markets heal. In the meantime, a firm's underlying earnings power continues to build.\nHarman's revenue eligible AUM in the ground increased in the second quarter to a record $504 billion, and has more than doubled in the past 3 years. Net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet firm store value grew sequentially to $6.5 billion or $5.31 per share. In the context of more supportive markets, we are well positioned for an acceleration realizations over time.\nTurning to investment performance. Nearly all of our flagship strategies reported positive appreciation in the second quarter. The corporate private equity funds appreciated 3.5%, with our operating companies reporting robust revenue growth of 12% year-over-year, along with expanding margins overall. These trends reflect our favorable sector positioning and focus on high-quality businesses with pricing power, coupled with cost deceleration.\nIn real estate, the core+ funds appreciated 1.7% in the quarter, while the Brent opportunistic funds were stable. We are seeing sustained strength in our key sectors in terms of cash flow growth. Half of our owned real estate is in logistics, student housing and data centers, which have experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in market rents.\nIn our U.S. rental housing holdings overall, fundamentals are stable with cash flow is increasing at a high single-digit rate. For BREIT, over 80% of the portfolio is concentrated in these sectors leading to strong same-store NOI growth of approximately 7.5% in the first half of the year.\nLooking forward, in the environment of lower inflation and lower interest rates should be very favorable for our real estate portfolio overall. In credit, the private and liquid credit strategies appreciated 3.3% and 2.8%, respectively, in the second quarter, reflective of a healthy portfolio generating strong current income. Despite a moderate uptick in broader market default rates, which we do expect to rise further in our noninvestment-grade portfolio, defaults remain low at less than 1%.\nFinally, in BAAM, the BPS gross composite return was 1.9% in Q2, representing the 13th consecutive quarter of positive performance. Over the past several years, BAAM has done an outstanding job protecting investor capital in an environment of significant volatility in liquid markets. Since the start of 2021, the BPS composite net return is up over 14% compared to 1% for the traditional 60-40 portfolio.\nOverall, the resiliency and strength of the firm's returns over many years is the foundation of the extraordinary growth we've achieved. In closing, the firm continues on a path of an expanding asset base, reaching $1 trillion today, and we believe ultimately well beyond. From the beginning, we've taken a very long-term view towards building an enduring business at Blackstone.\nToday, as the reference institution in our industry, we have the distinctive assets of our brand and reputation, our scale and our culture, a culture defined by decades of performance and innovation. This is what has powered our success to date and what we believe will propel our future.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open it up now for questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSr. MD of External Relations Group & Head of IR, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Katie, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's first quarter conference call. Joining today are: Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. And you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the Shareholders page of our website.\nAlso, note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $211 million. Distributable earnings were $1.2 billion or $0.97 per common share. And we declared a dividend of $0.82 per share, which will be paid to holders of record as of May 1.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Weston, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call. First quarter of 2023 represented a turbulent period for markets, tightening financial conditions and growing concerns of a recession while the S&P 500 posted gains that were concentrated in just a handful of large tech companies.\nMeanwhile, the median stock in the U.S. was flat for the quarter and is down 35% from recent peak levels. Capital markets activity remains muted, IPOs and M&A activity down 50% to 60% year-over-year. To combat inflation, the Fed has increased the Fed funds rate by 475 basis points just in 1 year, representing the largest increase since 1980.\nWhile there is not widespread distress in the real economy, this tightening campaign has led to significant challenges for investors, along with unintended consequences, which we saw with U.K. pensions last summer, more recently in the U.S. and European banking systems. These challenges once again highlighted the exceptional strength and stability of Blackstone.\nOur clients and counterparties have learned there is inherent safety in dealing with us. We don't operate with the risk profile of financial firms that have fallen into trouble, almost always due to the combination of a highly leveraged balance sheet and a mismatch of assets and liabilities. At Blackstone, we have neither.\nWe are an asset-light manager of third-party capital distributed across hundreds of segregated investment vehicles. Our firm has minimal net debt and no insurance liabilities. We don't take deposits. I'll say that one again. We don't take deposits. The vast majority of AUM is under long-term contracts or in perpetual strategies.\nIn our funds, we seek to align the time horizon of our investments with the duration of the capital, which positions us to not be forced sellers in difficult markets. This is true of our semi-liquid vehicles as well such as BREIT, which invest in longer-term assets. We designed this vehicle at its formation in 2017 with predetermined limits for potential repurchases in order to be prepared for adverse market conditions, creating a level of safety so that it can continue to deliver strong outperformance over the long term as it has done historically.\nThe safety of Blackstone's approach extends to the way we invest. One of our core values is to avoid losing our customers' money. Of course, we also seek to significantly outperform benchmarks over time as everyone knows we have. We've launched nearly 90 drawdown funds in our history, comprising approximately $500 billion of aggregate commitments, which almost all, 98% of them, generated gains for investors despite adverse investment environments during the lives at some point of most of these funds.\nWe have an extremely rigorous process for evaluating risk with an investment committee framework designed to minimize the prospect of losses and ensure consistency of judgment. And our global scale and reach give us deep insights into what's happening in the real economy, which inform how we position the firm and our portfolio ahead of changing conditions.\nTo paraphrase a quote often attributed to the hockey great, Wayne Gretzky, \"You have to skate to where the puck is going, not to where it is.\" At Blackstone, we follow the same approach. In real estate, an area of heightened external focus by the media and investors recently, our equity business has experienced realized losses in only 1% over 30 years, a truly remarkable result.\nThis includes during the global financial crisis, a period which saw most of our competitors collapse or exit the market. In contrast, we bought the right assets and put in place the right capital structures, more than doubling investor capital in that vintage of funds. We emerged from the crisis stronger and believe that this cycle will have a similar outcome.\nToday, investor sentiment toward real estate has been quite negative again, largely due to the pressures, as Jon explained on TV today, in the U.S. office market. Vacancies in offices have reached all-time-high levels. And owners of many of these assets may be unable to extend financing in a more constrained capital environment.\nAt Blackstone, we have minimal exposure to traditional U.S. office, having reduced our holdings from over 60% in the real estate equity portfolio at the time of our IPO in 2007 to less than 2% today. We instead emphasized sectors that are doing very well, including logistics, which now comprises 40% of the portfolio, up from 0 in 2007.\nOur real estate team has done a remarkable job of portfolio construction. In fact, I would call it some of Blackstone's finest work. Our positioning is the reason that BREIT, for example, continues to generate strong growth in cash flows, up an estimated 9% year-over-year in the first quarter despite market headwinds. We expect our investors to have a highly differentiated experience as a result as they have throughout our history.\nIn credit, higher interest rates and much higher available yields have led to significantly more investor capital being allocated to this area. Jon will expand on this opportunity for Blackstone. Simultaneously, there's an increased focus on the potential for higher market defaults in an economic turndown. Blackstone's credit business, as with real estate, has delivered excess returns over long periods of time while protecting the downside.\nFor example, we are the largest manager of leveraged loans in the world. And our historic annual default rate in the U.S. is less than 1%. This record and our standard of care should provide comfort to investors who are new to this asset class. Private credit disperses risk outside the government backstop banking sector with capital typically raised in discrete long-term funds rather than a funding model that is reliant on deposits, which demand instant liquidity.\nThis approach to credit extension makes the system safer and also supports the economy in challenging times. Our limited partners recognize Blackstone as a safe institution which to allocate their capital, even as the world becomes more complex, in fact, especially so. We have learned at the best time to put money to work is in a risk-off world, when sentiment becomes negative.\nRecent stress in the banking system has led to heightened levels of negativity, along with diminished availability of credit, which should provide additional opportunity for us, given the firm's scale, available capital in both the credit and equity areas. Overall, our LPs have entrusted us with an unprecedented $194 billion of dry powder ahead of what we believe could be a historic opportunity for deployment.\nOne final note for me. Earlier this week, S&P Dow Jones updated the eligibility rules for their flagship indices to once again include companies with multiple share classes. This important development follows a consultation period in which they engaged a broad universe of market constituents. Blackstone is, by far, the largest company by market cap not included in the S&P 500 today. We are hopeful that this development paves the way for our inclusion, which would be very positive for our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nPresident, Chief Operating Officer & Director, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Despite the challenges of the current environment, Blackstone's value proposition for customers and shareholders is stronger than ever. I'll discuss the key elements that underpin this confidence.\nFirst, our investment performance remains highly differentiated, as it has been for nearly 4 decades. This is the most important determinant of our success and is what allows us to attract more capital. We've delivered 15% net returns annually in corporate private equity, opportunistic real estate and secondaries; 12% in tactical opportunities; and 10% in credit. In Q1, our funds protected investor capital against the volatile market backdrop, which Michael will discuss. Over the past 12 months, nearly all our flagship strategies again meaningfully outperformed the relevant public indices.\nSecond, our strong returns are the direct result of the way we've deployed capital and where we are very well positioned for the current environment. As we've said before, where you invest matters. Nowhere is that more apparent than in real estate, where 83% of the portfolio is in our high-conviction sectors, including logistics, rental housing, hotels, data centers and life science office. We're seeing a massive diversion in performance in these areas compared to more challenged parts of the real estate market.\nIn logistics, the largest exposure in our real estate portfolio and at the firm overall, we estimate the mark-to-market for our warehouse rents is approximately 50% in the United States, 30% in the U.K. and 100% in Canada. While at the same time, market rents are generally growing at double-digit rates.\nIn rental housing, the second-largest concentration in our real estate portfolio, rents have moderated in our U.S. apartment buildings. But we're still seeing re-leasing spreads of approximately 4% and cash flow growth that's materially higher while our student and other housing assets are showing even greater strength.\nAt the same time, the pullback in capital markets is further constraining the new supply pipeline for most types of real estate, which is likely to intensify as regional banks provide a meaningful portion of U.S. construction lending. This is quite positive for real estate over time.\nAside from the supply-demand dynamics, the single most important driver for real estate valuations is the level of the 10-year treasury. While rising rates have been a significant headwind for real estate valuations recently, we've seen a reversal with the 10-year yield down 65 basis points from its high last year.\nIn corporate private equity, our operating companies are showing continued strong momentum. Revenues grew 13% in Q1, reflecting our timely emphasis on travel, leisure and energy transition companies. Meanwhile, we're seeing indications that cost pressures have peaked. While the broader economy remains resilient, we do anticipate a deceleration, given the weight of the Fed's actions and pressure on the banking system. Our companies overall are well positioned to navigate such an environment.\nIn credit, over 90% of our noninsurance portfolio is floating rate. And fundamentals remain healthy with a default rate of less than 1% across our non-investment-grade loans. Finally, BAAM's weightings in structured credit and quant strategies helped drive positive performance once again in Q1 with much less volatility than broader markets. In the last 2-plus years since we brought in a new investment leadership team, BAAM has beaten the typical 60-40 portfolio by nearly 1,500 basis points, remarkable outperformance in liquid markets.\nThird, as a result of our performance, our customers are entrusting us with more capital. The fundraising environment has become more challenging. But the breadth of our firm allows us to continue to raise scale capital, including over $40 billion in the first quarter and $217 billion over the last 12 months. We're seeing the greatest demand today for private credit solutions, given higher interest rates and wider spreads.\nCoupled with the pullback in regional bank activity, this is a golden moment for our credit, real estate credit and insurance solutions teams, which accounted for 60% of the firm's inflows in Q1. Our 4 major insurance clients allocated an additional $8 billion to us in the first quarter. And we expect a strong pace of inflows from them throughout the year.\nIn the case of Resolution, the $3 billion external fundraise is now fully committed and the repositioning of their asset base is underway. We also launched a new U.S. direct lending product in Q1 for both institutional and insurance clients, targeting $10 billion for this first vintage. We've raised nearly $6 billion to date for our green energy-oriented private credit vehicle and expect to hit the $7 billion cap in June.\nOur new real estate debt vehicle has strong initial momentum with $3.5 billion of commitments so far. And in private wealth, BCRED's monthly subscriptions on April 1 reached their highest level since October at nearly $500 million. As one of the largest private direct lenders in a world of growing capital constraints, we see this as an extremely favorable environment for deployment.\nMore broadly, as regional banks experience outflows of deposits, we are seeing real-time opportunities to partner with them at scale, utilizing our insurance capital in areas like auto finance, home improvement lending and equipment finance. We expect private credit and insurance to grow significantly from here.\nMoving to our private wealth platform, which overall had a solid first quarter against a difficult backdrop. We raised $8.1 billion in the channel, including $4.5 billion from the University of California. We're seeing stabilization in BREIT's repurchase trends with requests down 16% in March compared to the January peak. But obviously, it depends in the near term on market conditions. We remain confident in the reacceleration of growth in this channel once volatility recedes, given the exceptional positioning and performance of our products.\nTurning to our drawdown fund business. A few weeks ago, we held the final close for our global real estate flagship, which reached $30.4 billion, the largest private equity or real estate private equity fund ever raised. We also commenced fundraising for the next vintage of our European strategy, targeting a similar amount as the prior fund, which was EUR 9.5 billion of third-party capital, with the first close expected this summer.\nIn corporate private equity, we've raised $15.5 billion to date for our latest flagship with additional closings expected in the second quarter. The environment has remained difficult. But we continue to target a vehicle of substantially similar size as the prior fund. Overall, we are affirming our $150 billion target with approximately 70% raised to date. We anticipate having substantially achieved this by early next year.\nFourth, our latest fundraising cycle has positioned us very well for the current environment. We have nearly $200 billion of dry powder to take advantage of dislocation. With stock markets under pressure, we did agree to privatize two public companies in an otherwise muted deployment quarter, including a leading provider of events management software and a logistics REIT in the U.K. We also continued our push into the energy transition space with a commitment to acquire a portfolio of wind and solar assets through our infrastructure portfolio company, Invenergy.\nFinally, we remain true to our asset-light, brand-heavy strategy, relying on our people and track record to grow. We continue to operate with minimal net debt and no insurance liabilities. Over the past 5 years, we've generated $22 billion of distributable earnings and have paid out 100% of these earnings through dividends and buybacks. Our share count has remained flat over this period despite AUM more than doubling. There are a few firms in the world with such a shareholder-friendly approach to returning capital to investors. Our unleveraged capital-light model is especially valuable in a time like this.\nIn closing, despite the market's near-term challenges, we remain focused on being long-term investors, patient with our existing assets and lightning quick as opportunities emerge. And our model allows us to do both.\nWith that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nSenior Managing Director & Chief Financial Officer, The Blackstone Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. The firm's first quarter results reflected steady performance against a challenging external operating environment, our funds protected capital in volatile markets, and we continue to expand the foundation of the firm's earnings power across multiple drivers of growth. I'll discuss each of these areas in more detail.\nStarting with results. The unique breadth of our platform and the power of our brand have led to continued strong momentum across inflows, AUM and management fees. Total AUM rose 8% year-over-year to $991 billion with $217 billion of inflows over the last 12 months. This is through a period in which the S&P 500 declined 8% and the public REIT index was down nearly 20%. Fee-earning AUM also increased 8%, driving base management fees up 13% year-over-year to a record $1.6 billion in Q1, marking the 53rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth.\nFee-related earnings were $1 billion in the quarter or $0.86 per share, stable with Q4, supported by the growth in management fees and the firm's strong margin position. The year-over-year FRE comparison was affected by a decline in fee-related performance revenues. As we highlighted previously, we expect these revenues to accelerate in the second half of this year. With respect to margins, FRE margin for the trailing 12 months expanded 80 basis points from the prior year comparable period to 57.4%, reflective of the firm's disciplined focus on managing expenses in a difficult environment.\nDistributable earnings were $1.2 billion in the first quarter or $0.97 per share again, largely stable with Q4. Net realizations declined year-over-year as last year's market turbulence had the effect of reducing the realization of pipeline entering 2023. Notwithstanding these headwinds, the firm's ability to generate approximately $1 per share of DEs again in Q1, a level met or exceeded now for 7 straight quarters, illustrates the elevation in earnings power that has been underway at Blackstone.\nIn terms of realizations, during the quarter, we took advantage of a favorable window of market liquidity before the SVP-related turbulence to sell $3 billion of public stock across a number of portfolio companies in private equity at an aggregate multiple of investor capital approximately 3x. These sales included the full exit of our stake in Sona Comstar, a company we transformed from a traditional auto part supplier to India's largest electric vehicle components provider.\nIncluding prior sales, we generated $1.4 billion of gains on this investment at 11x our LP's money. While the environment for realizations is likely to remain challenged in the near term, our long-term fund structures allow us to benefit from patience. We can focus on building value while we wait for market conditions to improve.\nIn the meantime, the firm's performance revenue potential continues to grow. Performance revenue-eligible AUM in the ground is nearly $500 billion at quarter end. Net accrued performance revenue on the balance sheet, the firm's store value, stands at $6.4 billion or $5.27 per share. While down from a record level in Q1 of last year, primarily due to realizations, the receivable is still up 22% in 2 years and has nearly tripled in 3 years. We hold $16 billion of public stock in our private equity and real estate drawdown funds. When markets ultimately stabilize, we are well positioned for an acceleration in realizations.\nTurning to investment performance. First quarter corporate private equity funds appreciated 2.8%. And overall, our portfolio of companies are reporting strong revenue growth and resilient margins. In real estate, the BREP opportunistic buffer was largely stable in the quarter while the Core+ funds depreciated 1.6%. We are seeing sustained strength in our key sectors in terms of cash flow growth, offset in Q1 by sharp write-downs in our remaining traditional office portfolio, which we had already significantly reduced over a period of [indiscernible] quarters.\nWithin Core+, BREIT's Class I shares reported a modest negative net return of 0.5%. However, BREIT's return was a positive 0.6%, excluding the effect of its interest rate hedge, which was impacted by the dramatic decline in the 10-year treasuries. The hedge overall has generated substantial gains for investors, locking in low-cost fixed rate debt ahead of last year's rise in interest rates. Since inception, BREIT has delivered net returns of approximately 12% per year or nearly 3x the public REIT index.\nIn credit, private and liquid credit strategies appreciated 3.4% and 3%, respectively, in the first quarter, reflective of the healthy portfolio generating attractive current income. And in BAAM, the BPS gross composite return was 0.9% in Q1, the 12th quarter in a row of positive performance.\nMoving to the outlook. We remain highly confident in the multiyear expansion of the firm's earnings power and FRE with several embedded growth drivers. First, in our drawdown fund business, we continue to advance toward our $150 billion target across 18 months. Second, our perpetual capital platform continues to expand with AUM up 13% year-over-year to $381 billion, including more than 30% growth in our BIP infrastructure and BCRED strategies.\nThird, in the insurance area, AUM for our dedicated platform has reached nearly $170 billion, up $9 billion sequentially from Q4, driven by robust inflows from our major clients. 2023 in total, we expect inflows of $25 billion to $30 billion from these clients. We anticipate substantial, largely contractual growth for our insurance platform in the years ahead. To summarize, the firm has significant momentum with multiple engines driving us forward.\nIn closing, we are very optimistic about the future of Blackstone. Our business model is designed to protect us in difficult times. And we have greater investment firepower than ever before. We remain totally focused on delivering for our investors.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call. I would like to open up now to questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nI'd like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded. And with that, let me hand it over to Weston Tucker, Head of Shareholder Relations. Weston, please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSenior MD & Head of Shareholder Relations, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Matt, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; and Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-K report next month. I'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements.

Also, please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase any interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $743 million. Distributable earnings were $1.3 billion or $1.07 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.91 per share, which will be paid to holders of record as of February 6.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, CEO & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nWell, thank you, Weston, and good morning, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call. 2022 represented the most challenging market environment since the global financial crisis. Central banks around the world embarked on one of the most aggressive tightening cycles in history to combat the highest inflation in a generation.\nIn the United States, we saw the highest level of inflation since 1981. Federal fund rate here rose from basically 0 at the start of the year to 4.5%, the largest increase in 50 years. Equity markets fell sharply as a result, with the S&P down 18% for the year, NASDAQ down 33%, public REIT index, not to be forgotten, down 25%.\nThe intra-year movements were even more extreme, with these indices down 26% to 37% at their lowest. In credit, the high-yield and high-grade indices declined 11% and 13%, respectively. Overall, the 60-40 portfolio had one of the worst years on record. And against this extremely unfavorable market backdrop, Blackstone delivered earnings and dividend growth for our shareholders. Distributable earnings, for example, rose 7% to $6.6 billion in 2022, while fee-related earnings increased 9% and to $4.4 billion, a record year for the firm on both metrics despite the collapse in equity and debt markets.\nThe fourth quarter, although we had fewer realizations due to the environment, we generated strong DE of $1.3 billion reflective of the firm's substantial earnings power, which has grown dramatically over the past several years. Most importantly, Blackstone distinguished itself compared to almost all diversified liquid securities managers by preserving our limited partners' capital.\nThe year in which the typical investor lost somewhere between 15% and 25% of their money, our limited partner investors had a highly differentiated outcome. Our flagship strategies in real estate, private credit and secondaries appreciated 7% to 10%, while those losses were recurring elsewhere. Our Hedge Fund Solutions business achieved a gross composite return of 5% with positive returns every quarter of the year. Our corporate private equity, tactical opportunities and liquid credit strategies were down only modestly for the year between 1% and 3%.\nOne of Blackstone's core principles since our founding in 1985, involves the preservation of capital as a necessary component of the investments we make. We assess investment opportunities rigorously always with a focus on not losing our clients' money.\nIn addition, of course, we seek returns that significantly exceed public market benchmarks over time. This year, we are proud that we again executed on this foundational principle. Our approach to investing has enabled us to grow from having no assets in 1985, to becoming the largest alternative asset manager in the world today.\nAs you would expect, our investors are rewarding us, including remarkable inflows of $226 billion just in 2022, which drove 11% growth in assets under management to a record $975 billion. Our inflows this year alone qualify as a top 10 alternative manager out of the over 10,000 alternative managers globally. But Blackstone and others started in the alternatives business, institutional investors provided almost all of the capital for investment. That business remains robust today as institutions are continuing to increase allocations.\nWith a vast $85 trillion private wealth channel, a new generation of investors is starting to experience the benefits of alternatives as well, a development led by Blackstone, where we have the largest market share. 20 years ago, we started raising money in this channel by offering access to the same high-quality products we offer to institutions. Over a decade ago, we built a dedicated private wealth team, which today comprises approximately 300 people globally, where we invested significantly to establish the leading sales and service organization in our sector, interfacing with the largest wealth distribution systems.\n6 years ago, we launched our first large-scale customized products for individual investors. These products were designed to provide attractive returns by investing in longer-term assets, and therefore, capture the premium for liquidity which is the basis of much of our business. And we structured these products to provide liquidity over time, subject to limits as it is essential to match the time horizon of investments with the duration of capital. This is a foundational principle of portfolio construction. And these products have worked exactly as intended.\nBlackstone's largest product in the private wealth channel, BREIT, has delivered 12.5% net returns annually since inception 6 years ago for its largest share class, earning over 3x the public REIT index. There's been a lot of talk about public REITs. We've outearned them by 3x. In 2022, BREIT's net return was over 8% while equity and debt markets were melting. And its growth in net operating income, 2022 was 65% higher than public REITs through the latest available public data at some performance.\nBlackstone's second largest product in this area of BCRED, has achieved 8% net returns annually, significantly outperforming the relevant credit indices and is yielding over 10% today, exclusively in floating rate debts.\nThe response to our performance has been extremely positive. In 2022, our sales in the private wealth channel totaled a remarkable $48 billion, not exactly what you're hearing in the media. In the fourth quarter, despite market headwinds. Our sales were a robust $8 billion, including $4 billion in our perpetual vehicles and $4 billion in other strategies.\nOn a net basis, after repurchases, we saw positive net inflows in this channel of $3 billion overall in the fourth quarter, with strong demand for our drawdown products. Specifically, our perpetual strategies saw moderate net outflows in the quarter of approximately $800 million. As one would expect, flows in these strategies are impacted by market cycles. We believe we're seeing a temporary decline in an otherwise very positive long-term growth trajectory.\nFirstly speaking, I've been in finance for over 50 years, and I'm frankly quite surprised by the intense external focus on the flows for BREIT at a time of cyclical lows in stock and bond markets. For those of us that build and create businesses, what's going on is highly predictable. It should be expected that flows from high net worth individuals would decline for nearly all types of new investments in this environment.\nHaving navigated 5 major market declines in my career, I've learned that focusing just on what's happening at the bottom of cycles, this leads the public regarding likely future trends for appreciation and growth in well-constructed and historically high-performing products. My experience is these market bottoms often last for relatively short periods of time and are followed by a resumption of historic trends.\nAt Blackstone, we are focused on the long term, not next month. And rather than simply counting balls and strikes, we're working to win the World Series. And as we all know, not all World Series are won 4 games to 0. All people remember is who won the World Series, and that is our intention, and that has been our experience with the vast bulk of our products.\nOur funds are built on performance and our consistent experience over nearly 4 decades has been that with strong returns, flows will follow. The need for very high-quality products in the private wealth channel is very substantial, and we're bringing something highly differentiated in terms of our portfolio and performance. What we've created for individual investors is so good that one of the most sophisticated institutions in the world contacted us and indicated they wanted to invest as well.\nEarlier this month, the University of California system invested $4 billion in BREIT and is investing an additional $500 million beyond that, which we announced yesterday with an effective 6-year hold. This investment builds upon a 15-year relationship between our firms. I had the pleasure of meeting with UC's Chief Investment Officer over the holiday period, and he said they consider BREIT to have one of the best positioned real estate portfolios in the United States.\nThis investment provides BREIT with substantial additional firepower and flexibility and represents a powerful affirmation of the portfolio and its performance. It also illustrates the significant advantages of buying products from Blackstone. Investors in our funds get access to the full capabilities of our firm, not just those of an individual portfolio manager, including our intellectual capital, relationships, creativity and the many other benefits that come from our leading market position. We use these advantages to drive the best outcomes possible for our customers.\nOur distribution partners understand this as well, and they've told us they plan to continue to expand their clients' access to alternatives. Blackstone's commitment to the private wealth channel is stronger than ever. And we believe our performance in this cycle will ultimately provide impetus for significant growth in this area. Our returns in the face of adverse markets and adverse media are proof of concept that our disciplined approach to institutional asset management applies for the benefit of individuals as well.\nIn closing, as we move into 2023, Blackstone is uniquely positioned to navigate the challenges of today's world on behalf of all of our investors. As a whole, our portfolio is in excellent shape, with an emphasis on downside protection as well as upside when asset values ultimately recover from this cycle.\nWith almost $187 billion of dry powder, we have more capital than almost any other financial investor in the world to buy assets opportunistically when values are low and liquidity is scarce. We have lived through many cycles and have always emerged stronger, growing the firm to greater heights.\nPublic market and investors who don't understand our model historically run the risk of missing out on Blackstone's substantial long-term stock performance. Our people own 36% of Blackstone's equity. I can tell you, this is a group that is extremely bullish on our firm's prospects.\nAnd with that, I'll turn things over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nGeneral Partner, President, COO & Director, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. The true measure of our success is the returns we generate for clients. Despite a very tough year for markets, we've continued to deliver for them. Nearly all our flagship strategies outperformed the relevant public indices in 2022, as Steve highlighted, the result of how we've positioned investor capital along with our value creation focus. We do not own the market. It matters where you invest.\nThere is no better example of this than in real estate, where we've achieved 16% net returns annually in our global opportunistic funds across the many economic and interest rate cycles of the past 30 years. More recently, given our concerns around rising interest rates and inflation, we concentrated over 80% of our current real estate portfolio in sectors where strong cash flow growth could help offset these headwinds, including logistics, rental housing, life science office, hotels and data centers.\nLogistics is the largest exposure across Blackstone, comprising approximately 40% of the entire real estate portfolio. Fundamentals globally remain extraordinarily strong. In recent months, re-leasing spreads, the increase in rents as expiring leases roll over were 65% in our U.S. holdings, accelerating to a record 75% in December; approximately 50% in the U.K.; and 30% in Europe overall; 20% in Australia; and 100% in Canada. At the same time, construction starts for warehouses along with most types of real estate are now falling sharply, which is further tightening and already constrained new supply pipeline.\nOf course, these exceptional fundamentals do not apply everywhere. In traditional U.S. office, for example, secular challenges have been exacerbated in a post-pandemic world. We've written down the equity value of traditional U.S. office assets dramatically since 2018. And fortunately, such assets represent only 2% of our global real estate portfolio versus approximately 50%, 15 years ago.\nIn private equity, our concentration in the travel and leisure, energy and energy transition areas have had a meaningful impact on our results. We largely avoided unprofitable tech and did nothing in crypto. Our thematic approach has led to 14% year-over-year revenue growth in Q4 for our corporate private equity operating companies.\nMargins in our portfolio have proven to be resilient, reflective of our focus on high-quality businesses with pricing power. And in our noninsurance corporate credit business, with nearly $200 billion of total AUM, over 90% of our investments are floating rate, which has benefited returns as rates moved higher.\nFinally, in BAAM, we emphasize macro and quant strategies, yielding outstanding results for our investors in liquid securities. The strength of our returns over decades reinforces the Blackstone brand and allows us to serve investors in more areas.\nWhile the fundraising environment remains challenging, we are in a differentiated position with LPs globally. We're seeing the greatest demand today for private credit strategies, including from insurance clients and for infrastructure. In credit, the current environment is favorable for deployment given the significant increases in base rates and wider spreads.\nMoreover, our investors benefit from our direct origination capabilities, which is a key differentiator for insurance clients in particular. That's leading to robust growth in this area, with $8 billion of inflows in Q4 from our large insurance mandates, bringing platform AUM to $160 billion. And we have line of sight to over $250 billion over time from existing clients alone. This includes our resolution platform, where we recently announced an incremental $1 billion commitment from Nippon Life, Japan's leading life insurance company to help accelerate the company's growth.\nIn infrastructure, we raised $3 billion in the fourth quarter and $10 billion in 2022, bringing AUM to $35 billion in just 5 years. Performance has been outstanding, with 19% net returns annually since inception. Again, it's about where we chose to invest, including inflation-protected areas like digital, transportation and energy infrastructure.\nTurning to our drawdown fund business. We've raised approximately $100 billion to date for the current vintage of flagships, advancing toward our $150 billion target. In corporate private equity, we've closed on over $15 billion for the new flagship and believe we will raise roughly a similar amount as the prior fund in a difficult private equity fundraising environment.\nIn secondaries, we completed the fundraise for SP's flagship PE strategy at over $22 billion, the industry's largest, as well as SP's GP-led continuation fund at $2.7 billion. We also raised additional capital in Q4 for our renewables and energy transition focused strategies in credit and private equity, targeting over $10 billion in aggregate.\nIn real estate, we commenced fundraising for our latest debt vehicle, which we believe will be comparably sized to its $8 billion predecessor. And later this quarter, we expect to start raising our seventh European opportunistic strategy, targeting a similar size to the prior fund, which was EUR 9.5 billion of third-party capital. As with fundraising, our global scale and our reputation as a partner of choice are key advantages in deploying capital, particularly when the rural becomes challenging.\nOur largest commitment in Q4 was for a majority stake in Emerson Electric's Climate Technologies segment. This $14 billion corporate carve-out was the result of a year-long dialogue completed at a time when traditional financing sources were largely unavailable. Emerson remains our partner in the investment. The ability to source, structure and finance such a complex transaction at scale in a difficult investment environment highlights the very best of Blackstone.\nOther investments in Q4 included CoreTrust in partnership with HCA, another bilateral discussion with a high-quality corporate and the privatization of Atlantia, one of the largest transportation infrastructure companies alongside the Benetton family.\nWe're starting to see some interesting opportunities arise from the market dislocation, including from real estate funds seeking liquidity, leading to investments in logistics portfolios in Canada, the U.K. and Sweden, but it will take time for a volume of large-scale opportunities to emerge. Our latest fundraising cycle has positioned us very well with $187 billion of dry powder.\nIn closing, we continue to see global LPs increase their allocation to alternatives, and Blackstone is the leader in the space. For shareholders, our firm represents exceptional value. We've grown distributable earnings 20% annually for the past 10 years, more than double the rate of the market. We've done that while paying out nearly 100% of our earnings through dividends and buybacks.\nMoreover, the share count has barely grown over that decade, and we continue to operate with minimal net debt and no insurance liabilities. It is an extraordinary business model, and our brand and relationships with customers have never been stronger.\nWith that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nCFO, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. The firm's results reflect strong performance in difficult markets. Our business continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience and fundamental strength in terms of investment returns, inflows and earnings power. I'll first review financial results and then we'll discuss investment performance and key elements of the forward outlook.\nStarting with results. Despite the challenging backdrop, fee-related earnings, net realizations and distributable earnings also a meaningful positive growth for the full year, with FRE and DE reaching record levels, as Steve highlighted. FRE increased 9% to $4.4 billion or $3.65 per share, powered by very strong growth in management fees and healthy margin expansion, notwithstanding a decline in fee-related performance revenues.\nOur expansive breadth of growth engines and the activation of new drawdown funds throughout the year lifted base management fees 25% to a record $6 billion for the year and the 52nd straight quarter of year-over-year base management fee growth at Blackstone. At the same time, FRE margin expanded 75 basis points to 57.1%, the highest level ever for a calendar year, reflective of the firm's robust margin position and ability to manage costs with discipline in a difficult environment.\nFee-related performance revenues were $1.4 billion for the year, driven by strong returns across our perpetual strategies, with contribution from 12 discrete vehicles. Looking forward, the setup for this high-quality revenue stream in 2023 and beyond is quite favorable, which I'll discuss further in a moment.\nDistributable earnings increased 7% in 2022 to $6.6 billion or $5.17 per common share, driven by the growth in FRE, along with a 4% increase in net realizations. The shape of the year was impacted by our realization activity, which, of course, is market dependent. We saw a record first half driven by certain large realizations of note, while the pace of sales slowed in the second half, reflecting overall market activity levels. FRE remained a balance to earnings throughout the year, 2022 comprising 4 of the firm's 5 best quarters for FRE in history.\nIn the fourth quarter, FRE was $1.1 billion or $0.88 per share. The year-over-year comparison was affected by the change in the crystallization schedule for BREIT's fee-related performance revenues in 2022. Previously, each full year's revenues crystallized in the fourth quarter, which moved to a quarterly crystallization in the first quarter of 2022. Notably, excluding these revenues, the firm's FRE growth in the fourth quarter was positive 7%, more in line with the full year.\nDistributable earnings in the fourth quarter of 2022 were $1.3 billion or $1.07 per common share, down from the prior year record quarter. Stepping back, despite a muted backdrop for realizations for much of the year, our distributable earnings were above or well above $1 per share every quarter for the past 6 consecutive quarters, which had only previously occurred 3x in our history. This reflects well the elevation of our earnings power that is underway.\nTurning to investment performance. Against the volatile market backdrop of 2022, our funds protected investor capital. In the fourth quarter, the corporate private equity funds appreciated 3.8%, with strength in our travel-related and energy holdings along with our publics broadly. Our portfolio companies are well positioned overall with continued strong revenue growth and resilient margins.\nIn real estate, the Core+ and opportunistic funds depreciated 1.5% to 2% in the quarter. In the context of rising cost to capital, we've continued to increase cap rate assumptions across the portfolio, driving the fourth quarter decline. Notwithstanding this impact, our real estate strategy still saw significant appreciation for the full year due to robust cash flow growth across our holdings. Of note, 10-year yields have moved meaningfully lower since year-end, which, if sustained, should provide additional valuation support over time.\nIn credit, the private credit strategy is appreciated 2.4% and the liquid strategies appreciated 3%, reflective of a resilient portfolio generating strong current income against a stable backdrop for credit generally in the quarter. And in BAAM, the BPS gross composite return was 2.1% in the quarter, the 11th quarter in a row of positive performance. Overall, our portfolios are performing well in a challenging external operating environment.\nTurning to the outlook. First, as it relates to realizations, we expect sales activity to remain muted in the near term given market conditions. And as always, when markets ultimately stabilize, we would expect realizations to reaccelerate as well. With respect to FRE, we continue to expect a material step-up over the next several years, led by the combination of: first, our drawdown fundraising cycle; second, expanding contribution from perpetual strategies; and third, the substantial, largely contractual growth of our dedicated insurance platform.\nIn terms of the drawdown funds, the fee holiday for our global real estate flagship has ended, and 2023 will include a nearly full year contribution of management fees. We expect to launch the investment period for the corporate PE flagship later this year, subject to deployment which will be followed by an effective 4-month fee holiday. We will launch various other funds in the coming quarters depending on deployment. In total, only $56 billion of our $150 billion target was earning management fees as of year-end.\nCapital strategies continue to grow in number and scale with over 50 discrete vehicles today. A combined fee AUM of our 4 flagship strategies, BPP, BREIT, BIP and BCRED, grew 30% in 2022 to $184 billion. This sets a substantially higher baseline for fee revenues entering the year. In addition to NAV-based management fees, over 30 of the perpetual vehicles are eligible to generate fee-related performance revenues, and the firm will continue to benefit from the layering effect of these revenues. We previously noted that the BPP platform has 4x more AUM subject to crystallization in 2023 and 2022 concentrated in the second half of the year.\nFinally, in insurance, we ended 2022 with over $100 billion of AUM from our 4 large clients, generating $450 million of management fee revenue for the year. As these mandates grow over time, both organically and by contract, we anticipate fee revenues just from these mandates will more than double to approximately $1 billion in 4 to 5 years, including strong double-digit growth this year. These revenues carry attractive incremental margins given our extensive existing capabilities. So to summarize, with multiple embedded key drivers, we have strong confidence in continued FRE expansion in 2023 and beyond.\nIn closing, despite the uncertainties in today's world, we entered the new year from a position of fundamental strength. Our earnings power has elevated dramatically for the past several years. And looking forward, we have great confidence in the future.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call, and would like to open it up now for questions."

My name is Ben, and I'm your event manager. (Operator Instructions) I'd like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd now I would like to hand it over to your host. Weston, the word is yours.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSenior MD & Head of Shareholder Relations, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Blackstone's third quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso, please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $4 million. Distributable earnings were $1.4 billion or $1.06 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $0.90 per common share, which will be paid to holders of record as of October 31.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, CEO & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThank you, Weston. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. The third quarter of 2022 was a continuation of one of the most difficult periods for markets in decades. Global markets extended the dramatic sell-off to characterize the first half of the year. The S&P 500 falling another 5%, bringing the year-to-date decline to 24%. The public REIT index was down 10% in just a quarter and 28% year-to-date. The NASDAQ fell 32% year-to-date. And in debt markets, high-grade and high-yield bonds declined 14% to 15% in the first 9 months of the year.\nHigh inflation, rising interest rates and a slowing economy, combined with ongoing geopolitical turmoil, have created an extremely difficult environment for investors to navigate. The traditional 60-40 portfolio is down over 20% year-to-date, its worst performance in nearly 50 years, and sentiment in almost all areas is likely to remain negative, given the Fed's commitment to continue increasing interest rates to combat inflation.\nAgainst this highly challenging backdrop, Blackstone delivered excellent results for our shareholders. Fee-related earnings for the third quarter rose 51% year-over-year to $1.2 billion, representing our second best quarter on record. We generated strong distributable earnings of $1.4 billion or $1.06 a share, as Wes noted.\nWhile most money managers focusing on liquid markets have seen declining AUM, we've continued to grow. Our assets under management increased 30% year-over-year to a record $951 billion, with strong demand for our products across the institutional, private wealth and insurance channels. Just last week, we announced our fourth major partnership in the insurance space with Resolution Life, a leading life and annuity block consolidator, which we expect to comprise approximately $25 billion of AUM in the first year and over $60 billion over time as their platform grows.\nKey to Blackstone's success with our customers is that we have protected their capital through these remarkable market declines. One of our core principles since we founded the firm in 1985 is to avoid losing our clients' money, and we've done an excellent job of that. As the largest and most diverse alternatives firm in the world, we have unique access to data and insights on what is happening in the global economy, allowing us to anticipate trends and, we believe, minimize risk.\nWe then carefully choose sectors and which type of assets to buy and actively work to build great companies and platforms. We use this advantage as well to help determine areas of focus in the liquid securities area. This synergistic approach has led to distinctly strong positioning across our business today. For example, in real estate, approximately 80% of our portfolio is in sectors where rents are growing above the rate of inflation, including logistics, rental housing, life science office and hotels.\nIn corporate private equity, our emphasis on faster-growing companies has resulted in a 17% year-over-year revenue growth in our operating companies in the third quarter, led by our travel, leisure-related holdings at 17% growth in revenue as the economy is slowing all over the world. This is a stunning result, given the size of our portfolio which, in total, across our private equity business, employs approximately 500,000 people.\nIn corporate and real estate credit, we benefit from close to 100% floating rate exposure, and we're experiencing negligible defaults. And our hedge fund solutions business is performing remarkably well with the BPS Composite achieving positive returns in the third quarter and every quarter so far in 2022. This is a highly differentiated outcome in liquid securities compared to the year-to-date decline of 24% in the S&P.\nBlackstone's long history of outperformance and capital protection is, of course, critically important to our LPs and their constituents. They have found it difficult to achieve their objectives by investing in traditional asset classes alone. That's why LPs around the world are choosing to increase allocations to alternatives, and in particular, to Blackstone.\nRecent research from Morgan Stanley estimates that private markets AUM will grow 12% annually over the next 5 years with shared growth in areas such as infrastructure, real estate and private credit as investors seek yield and inflation protection, all areas of distinctive competence here at Blackstone.\nFrom a channel perspective, Morgan Stanley predicts the greatest growth among individual investors, with allocations to alternatives from high net worth investors more than doubling in 5 years to 8% to 10% of their portfolios. This represents a major paradigm change when we identified over a decade ago and trillions of dollars of opportunity, which Jon will discuss in more detail. Blackstone is the clear leader in this channel with the largest market share among alternative managers.\nBlackstone occupies a special status with customers and potential customers around the world. They are facing significant uncertainties today and are looking to us to help them navigate these challenges, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to do so. We are proud of the trust that they place in us, and we remain steadfast in our mission to serve them.\nIn closing, our firm has prospered across the many cycles of the past 37 years since we started. We had no assets then. And today, we're closing in on $1 trillion of AUM. Historically, we've taken advantage of the pullbacks to deploy significant capital at attractive prices, extend our leadership position across business lines and invest in new initiatives as well as in our people. For our shareholders, this has translated into extraordinary growth, and we have no intention of slowing down.\nWe are in the early innings of penetrating new channels and markets with enormous potential. The firm's earnings power continues to expand, concentrated in the highest quality earnings. Even though the investment climate is challenging, we have the confidence, the resources and the loyalty of our customers and our people. We continue to develop our franchise for the benefit of all of our constituencies.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nGeneral Partner, President, COO & Director, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our business is all about delivering for our customers in rain or shine, and the third quarter was no exception. Our investment performance again demonstrated the durability of our model along with the benefits of our thematic investing, as Steve highlighted. Meanwhile, the firm's strong results have allowed us to continue expanding who we serve and where we can invest even in the most difficult of times. I'll update you on the multiple avenues of growth we have in front of us.\nStarting with our drawdown fund business. With the support of our LPs, we are progressing toward our $150 billion target with more than half achieved at this point. We've largely completed the fundraise for 2 of our 3 largest flagships, global real estate and private equity secondaries and have launched their respective investment periods. Our corporate private equity flagship has raised $14 billion to date, and we expect it to be at least as large as the prior fund.\nIn credit, we've closed on $4 billion for a new strategy focused on renewables and the energy transition and expect to reach our target of $6 billion to $7 billion in the coming quarters, we believe the largest private credit vehicle of its kind. This is an area where we see tremendous secular tailwinds and where we reported additional inflows in the quarter in growth equity, Tactical Opportunities and private equity energy. While the market environment will remain a headwind for the industry overall, we are in a differentiated position given the diversity of our platform, global reach and the power of our brand.\nTurning to private wealth. One of the long-term megatrends transforming the market landscape is that individual investors are finally getting access to alternatives in a form and structure that works for them. This development has been led by Blackstone and our distribution partners, and the response has been powerful. We now manage $236 billion of private wealth AUM, up 43% in the past 12 months alone. In the third quarter, sales in this channel totaled $8 billion, including $6.6 billion for our perpetual vehicles. We do also offer limited repurchases in the perpetuals, which totaled $3.7 billion.\nAs we discussed last quarter, stock market volatility meaningfully impacts net flows in these vehicles. That said, this is a vast and underpenetrated market, and our products have outstanding performance and positioning.\nBREIT's net returns since inception 6 years ago is 13% per year or 4x the public REIT index. Nearly 80% of BREIT's portfolio is comprised of logistics and rental housing, some of the best-performing sectors with short duration leases and rents outpacing inflation. BCRED has generated an 8% annual net return since inception and with a floating rate portfolio, returns benefit as interest rates move higher. Looking forward, we plan to launch more products in this channel, deepen penetration with existing partners and add new relationships around the world.\nMoving to our institutional perpetual business, which is over $100 billion across 42 vehicles, up 37% year-over-year, including our institutional real estate Core+ platform and infrastructure. Our infrastructure business nearly doubled year-over-year to $31 billion on the back of excellent performance. Both platforms continue to benefit from their focus on hard assets in great sectors with strong fundamentals, helping drive positive appreciation in the quarter and year-to-date.\nTurning to insurance. Our AUM has doubled in the past 12 months to over $150 billion. We've now added a fourth large-scale mandate with Resolution Life, as Steve noted, which is one of the leading closed block consolidators servicing the multitrillion-dollar life and annuity market on a global basis. This is another example of our strategy to serve as an investment manager for multiple insurance clients without becoming an insurance company ourselves or taking on liabilities.\nOver time, we expect more than $250 billion of AUM from existing clients alone, several of which have an added tailwind from greatly accelerated annuity sales. Our deep investment expertise and capabilities in private credit in particular uniquely position us to serve insurance clients.\nStepping back, private credit represents another long-term megatrend in the alternative sector. We can leverage our expansive platform to directly originate yield-oriented investment products for our clients, including insurance companies as well as institutional and individual investors. And we see a particularly favorable environment for deployment today as base rates have increased significantly and spreads have widened, all while traditional sources of financing have pulled back.\nWith over $320 billion of AUM across our credit and real estate credit businesses, we've built one of the largest platforms in our industry but still comprise a tiny fraction of these markets overall. We are quite excited about the long-term potential.\nTaken together, our diverse range of growth engines drove total inflows of $45 billion in the third quarter and a record $183 billion year-to-date, a period in which markets experienced some of the worst declines on record, as Steve discussed. These results, more than anything, speak to the strength of our brand and the trust our clients place in us. And with a record $182 billion of dry powder capital, we have the ability to take advantage of dislocations.\nIn closing, despite the many challenges of today's investment environment, we are well positioned to navigate the road ahead. I could not have more confidence in our firm and our people. For our shareholders, we continue to achieve significant growth while remaining true to our capital-light model, allowing us to return 100% of earnings over the past 5 years through dividends and share buybacks. We are totally focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nCFO, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. The firm's third quarter results highlight a business model designed to provide resiliency in difficult markets. At the same time, we are advancing through the largest fundraising cycle in our history which, coupled with our expanding platform of perpetual capital strategies, is setting the foundation for a material step-up in FRE. I'll discuss each of these areas in more detail.\nStarting with results. One of the best illustrations of the durability of our financial model is the continued powerful trajectory of fee-related earnings. In the third quarter, FRE increased 51% year-over-year to $1.2 billion or $0.98 per share, powered by 42% growth in fee revenues, along with significant margin expansion.\nWith respect to revenues, the firm's expansive breadth of growth engines lifted management fees to a record $1.6 billion, up 22% year-over-year and 4% sequentially from quarter 2. At the same time, the continued scaling of our perpetual strategies, combined with strong investment performance across those strategies, led to $372 million of fee-related performance revenues.\nWith respect to margins, FRE margin for the 9-month year-to-date period expanded nearly 100 basis points from the prior year comparable period to 56.5% and is tracking above our previous expectation. We now expect full year 2022 margin to be in the same 56% area, in line with 2021.\nDistributable earnings were $1.4 billion in the third quarter, underpinned by the robust momentum in FRE. Net realizations declined year-over-year as the market environment unit activity levels as expected. While the backdrop for exits is likely to remain less favorable in the near term, one of the key attributes of our model is that we can focus on executing our operating plans and creating value for the long term, patiently waiting to identify the optimal opportunities for monetization.\nIn the meantime, the firm's performance revenue potential continues to build. Performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground grew 26% year-over-year to a record $494 billion. Net accrued performance revenues on the balance sheet stand at $7.1 billion or nearly $6 per share, down over the past few quarters primarily due to record realization activity, but still double its level of 2 years ago.\nMoving to investment performance. As Steve noted, against the backdrop of continued pressure in global equity and credit markets, our funds protected investor capital. Core+ real estate, credit and BAAM appreciated 1% to 3% in the quarter. In corporate private equity and opportunistic real estate, values were largely stable, and Tac Opps saw modest depreciation of approximately 2%. These returns included the negative impact of currency translation for our non-U.S. holdings related to the stronger U.S. dollar.\nFew additional observations on our returns. First, in private equity, our portfolio of companies historically have been held at a meaningful discount to public comps in terms of valuation multiples, which continues to be true today. In alignment with that, in terms of outcomes, exits have occurred at a significant premium compared to unaffected carrying values.\nSecond, in real estate, in the context of rising interest rates, we've materially increased cap rate assumptions across the portfolio. Notwithstanding this impact, our real estate strategies have still seen strong appreciation year-to-date as cash flow growth and dividends have more than offset the impact of wider cap rates.\nTurning to the outlook, which is characterized by the firm's continuing progression toward higher and more recurring earnings. As we highlighted last quarter, we expect the combination of our drawdown fundraising cycle along with the growing contribution from perpetual strategies to lead to a structural step-up in FRE over the next several years. In terms of the drawdown funds, we launched the investment period for the global real estate flagship in August with an effective 4-month fee holiday for first closers. We will launch other funds over time depending on deployment.\nWith respect to perpetual strategies, we previously discussed the layering effect of fee-related performance revenues and noted that BPP in particular has 4x more AUM subject to crystallization in 2023 than in 2022. At the same time, the private wealth perpetual vehicles have continued to compound in value with fee-earning AUM increasing $27 billion at the start of this year and $94 billion in total, setting a higher baseline for fee revenues going forward. As Jon described, these vehicles remain exceptionally well positioned.\nAnd for BCRED specifically, it's worth highlighting that the driver of fee-related performance revenues is investment income, borrowers paying interest, which has a high degree of visibility. Overall, the dual catalyst of our drawdown fundraising cycle and the ongoing perpetualization of our business give us confidence in the multiyear outlook for FRE.\nOne final item of note. Last month, our insurance client, Corebridge, successfully completed its IPO despite the extremely difficult capital markets backdrop. This represented an important milestone in their evolution as a stand-alone public company. Blackstone was not a seller in the offering nor was Corebridge, and we are committed to being shareholders for years to come. We have a very positive view on the value of the company, including the expected benefits from increasing base rates and widening spreads. We have been pleased with the success of our partnership to date and look forward to continuing to deliver for them as their exclusive investment manager for key asset classes.\nIn closing, the firm is in an excellent position today. Our all-weather model protects us in times of stress and provides a powerful foundation for future growth. We have great confidence in what the firm will achieve in the years ahead.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call and would like to open it up now for questions."

My name is Ben, and I'm your event manager. (Operator Instructions)\nI'd like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded. And now I would like to hand it over to your host. Weston, the word is yours.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSenior MD & Head of Shareholder Relations, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nTerrific. Thanks, Ben, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's second quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. And for a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported a GAAP net loss for the quarter of $256 million. Distributable earnings were $2 billion or $1.49 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $1.27 per share, paid to holders of record as of August 1.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, CEO & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThanks a lot, Weston. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. As you know, the second quarter and the first half of '22 represented some of the worst periods for market performance in history. Investors were anticipating extremely high levels of inflation, rising interest rates and a slowing economy. The S&P fell 16% in the quarter and 20% in the first 6 months of the year, the largest first half decline for U.S. equities in over 50 years.\nDebt markets experienced the largest decline on record. Taken together, the typical 60-40 portfolio produced its worst return since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Capital markets activity, of course, slowed dramatically, including U.S. IPOs, down over 90% year-on-year, and commodity prices soared but now appear to be backing off from their highest levels.\nDespite these hostile conditions, Blackstone again delivered outstanding results for our investors. Distributable earnings in Q2 nearly doubled year-over-year to $2 billion, one of the 2 best quarters in our history, driven by a 45% growth in fee-related earnings and record realizations. We raised a remarkable $88 billion of inflows. That's $88 billion of inflows in the quarter in the midst of the market chaos, our second highest quarter ever and equal, ironically, to Blackstone's total AUM at the time of our IPO in 2007.\nFor the past 12 months, inflows reached $340 billion, driving a 38% increase in AUM to a record setting for us, $941 million. We are about midway through the largest fundraising cycle in our history with enormous support from our limited partners, providing us with an unprecedented $170 billion of dry powder capital. And over the next several years, we expect historically attractive investment opportunities to arise from this dislocation. As a result, our fundraising cycle and the deployment of our dry powder should significantly expand the firm's earnings power and fee-related earnings over time.\nHow can Blackstone generate these extraordinary results while most other money managers are suffering? We believe that it is the power of our brand and our superior performance, which have enabled us to build unique relationships with our clients over decades. We've also benefited from the remarkable trends started over 30 years ago of increasing allocations to alternative managers as investors seek higher, sustainable returns, including retail investors, which represent a vast and largely untapped market.\nLimited partners across customer channels rely on us to produce differentiated outcomes compared to what they can achieve in traditional asset classes. In the second quarter, for example, our flagship strategies, again, dramatically outperformed the relevant market indices, most notably in real estate and our hedge fund solutions business.\nIn real estate, while the public REIT index fell 17% in the quarter, our Core+ funds were up 2.3%. I'll do that again for you. The index is down 17%, we were up 2.3%. And our opportunistic funds protected capital, down only 1%. So we only performed by 16% for our customers over the index. For the first 6 months of the year, our real estate strategies appreciated 9% to 10% versus a 20% decline in the REIT index, equaling an outperformance of roughly 3,000 basis points. I don't know many asset classes that perform -- outperform indexes by 3,000 basis points.\nMeanwhile, in liquids, BAM achieved positive returns again in the second quarter and a 1.8% growth for the first half, outperforming the S&P by 2,200 basis points for the 6-month period and the hedge fund index by nearly 700 basis points. This is exactly what BAM's products are designed to do in down markets. These results, frankly, are stunning compared to the losses most investors are experiencing.\nWhat drives our fund's outperformance and allows us to sustain it over time? Our investment process is highly differentiated, including a rigorous focus on choosing the best sectors and assets, always with a priority of protecting capital. And we create value in our investments with our deep portfolio operations and asset management capabilities. We had anticipated higher interest rates and more pervasive inflation for some time, and we position the firm's portfolios to reflect that, which Jon will discuss in more detail. We're seeing the clear benefits of that foresight today and so are our customers.\nLooking forward, market conditions will remain challenging. We're cautious on inflation, which we think could stay higher for longer than most expect, and central banks will have to continue responding. It will be a difficult balancing act in combating inflation while trying to minimize the negative impact on economies.\nEurope is also facing the most severe impacts of the war in Ukraine in terms of dislocations in energy markets and the global food supply. And in Asia, the periodic reassertion of COVID remains a headwind to growth. These conditions, of course, create significant uncertainty for markets. And the critical question is how much has already been incorporated in the broad-based declines that have occurred. It is impossible to know the exact outcome because it depends on future central bank actions, but economic softening, along with corporate margin pressure, will be prevalent.\nBlackstone is uniquely positioned to navigate these uncertainties on behalf of our investors. We've lived through many cycles in our 36-year history. In each one, we learned a lot, and each one reinforced the importance of having long-term committed capital. The vast majority of our AUM today is under long-term contracts or in perpetual structures, helping us avoid the large decreases in AUM experienced by many other money managers in this environment, as we've all seen.\nOur model also provides us the advantage of patience to buy assets and the flexibility to sell when the time is right. Meanwhile, our portfolio is in excellent shape, having been carefully designed with the current environment in mind. The firm is extremely secure financially with a market cap today of $120 billion, minimal net debt and importantly, no insurance liabilities. Our fundraising should allow us to invest large-scale capital at lower prices, providing the basis for substantial realizations in the future. We expect a significant expansion of FRE over the next several years, which Michael will discuss.\nIn conclusion, despite the difficult conditions that come with every central bank tightening cycle, I am extremely confident that Blackstone, as always, will prosper and grow even stronger in the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nGeneral Partner, President, COO & Director, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Despite the challenging quarter, Blackstone delivered both for our customers and shareholders. And with 4 powerful engines of growth and record dry powder capital to invest, we are ideally positioned for the road ahead. The foundation of our business remains investment performance. The way we positioned investor capital over the past several years is driving differentiated returns today, as Steve noted.\nWe've been preparing for an environment of rising rates and a normalization of market multiples for some time. And the facts on the ground across our global portfolio suggested inflation would be higher and more persistent than many believed. These views informed our investing, leading us towards owning floating rate debt, hard assets with shorter duration income streams and high-quality companies with limited exposure to input costs and with pricing power.\nWe also have pursued attractive cyclical opportunities such as the travel recovery thing, and we did not lose our discipline even as we invested in faster-growing sectors, always keeping a sharp focus on profitability. Nowhere are the benefits of our thematic approach more apparent than in our $320 billion real estate business, which just reported a record quarter. Performance remains outstanding, the output of our emphasis on sectors where rent growth continues to meaningfully outpace inflation. In logistics and rental housing, our 2 largest exposures, fundamentals are the strongest we've seen.\nIn logistics, e-commerce tailwinds and corporates moving away from just-in-time inventory have driven vacancy towards all-time low levels. We estimate rental growth in our U.S. and Canadian logistics markets exceeded 40% year-over-year in the second quarter. And in our U.S. multifamily markets, rents grew 19% based on the most recent data for May.\nBREIT perfectly exemplifies the strength of our concentrated strategy in these 2 areas with estimated year-to-date growth in same-store property net operating income of 16%. In corporate private equity, revenue growth in our portfolio also remained quite strong in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year for our operating companies, which helped to offset significant increases in labor and input costs. While we were not immune to the market volatility, we saw a strong appreciation in our travel, leisure and energy holdings. These areas comprise 28% of our corporate private equity business compared to a 5% weighting in the S&P 500.\nIn our credit business, fundamentals remain healthy. Default rates are historically low, and our focus on large senior secured loans has led to an average loan-to-value ratio of just 44% in our U.S. direct lending portfolio with significant borrower equity subordinate to our positions. The value of our assets is further highlighted by our record realization activity in the second quarter. The firm's largest realizations in the quarter and among the largest in our history was a $23 billion recapitalization of last-mile logistics platform Mileway and the $5.7 billion sale of the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas in 2 of our favorite secular neighborhoods.\nLooking forward, volatile markets do mean realizations will likely be muted for some time. However, FRE will continue to provide meaningful ballast to earnings during this period. Conversely, market dislocation creates attractive opportunities to deploy, and our enormous dry powder and long-duration fund structures give us the ability to take advantage of these opportunities as they emerge.\nTurning to our 4 engines of growth. Our customers continue to respond favorably to our performance, and our drawdown fund business could not be in a stronger position today. We launched fundraising for our new global real estate flagship in March, targeting $30.3 billion, which is 50% larger than its predecessor and would represent the largest private equity or real estate private equity drawdown fund ever raised.\nIn only 3 months, we closed on $24.4 billion, with the remaining capacity already fully allocated. Combined with our BREP funds in Europe and Asia, we will have $50 billion of opportunistic real estate capital to deploy globally, only 12% which is invested today. This is a very advantageous position given the current environment.\nWe've also raised $9 billion to date for our new corporate private equity flagship and expect it to be at least as large as the prior fund. Our private equity secondary flagship is on track to reach its target of approximately $20 billion, the largest secondaries vehicle ever raised. We closed on $3 billion for our new growth equity vehicle and expect to exceed the size of the prior fund here as well. And the list goes on. Overall, we remain highly confident in our $150 million aggregate target for drawdown strategies.\nMoving to our institutional perpetual capital platform, which has grown rapidly and now exceeds $100 billion. Our institutional real estate Core+ strategy, BPP, is $74 billion across 25 different vehicles, including $8 billion of additional perpetual capital raised in the second quarter for the Mileway recapitalization. As a reminder, we have 4 open-ended institutional BPP strategies focused on North America, Asia, Europe and the life sciences sector that can continuously raise capital. We also have perpetual closed-end and co-investment vehicles, including Logicor and Mileway in Europe, Stuyvesant Town in New York, Canadian industrial, Japanese apartments and more.\nOur infrastructure strategy has grown to $30 billion with an additional $3 billion raised in the second quarter and over $12 billion of inflows since reopening to new capital late last year. Both BPP and our infrastructure platform continue to benefit from their focus on hard assets and great sectors where inflation is further limiting new supply.\nTurning to retail. Sales in the channel were $15.5 billion in the quarter. For our 3 perpetual products, BREIT, BCRED and BEPIF, sales totaled a robust $11 billion with an additional $2.4 billion of monthly subscriptions on July 1. We do offer limited repurchases within these vehicles, which increased in the quarter to $2.9 billion, driven by Asia-based retail investors.\nAs we saw in 2020, retail net flows are impacted in a volatile market environment. But the key long term is that our investment performance for our 3 perpetual vehicles remains very strong as does the positioning of their respective portfolios. Looking forward, we have more perpetual products in registration, and we continue to add distribution partners around the world.\nFinally, on insurance, our business has more than doubled in the past 12 months to over $150 billion, and we are seeing continued organic flows from our clients totaling $3 billion year-to-date. We are focused on delivering for them, and we're also pursuing a variety of additional growth opportunities on a balance sheet-light basis.\nIn closing, we have both the staying power and firepower to thrive in this challenging environment as we have for 36 years. Our strategy remains the same as always. We are an asset-light, brand-heavy investment manager focused on delivering exceptional returns for our clients, which creates both near-term dividends and long-term appreciation for our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nCFO, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. For the past several years, we've been highlighting the continuing expansion and transformation of our AUM and earnings. At our Investor Day in 2018, we first shared the message about a meaningful step-up in earnings power, driven by the combination of: first, the drawdown fundraising cycle, at the time consisting of 5 flagships targeting $60 billion; and second, the growing contribution of our perpetual capital platform. Over the subsequent 4 years, our asset and earnings base and quality have expanded dramatically, powered by these factors.\nFirm's second quarter results reflected another definitive step on this journey. Meanwhile, the key elements of the forward outlook favorably resemble our setup 4 years ago, with a new drawdown fund cycle underway and a growing array of perpetual strategies. I'll discuss each of these areas in more detail.\nStarting with results. The exceptional range of growth engines firing across the firm has continued to propel AUM to new record levels. Management fees grew 28% year-over-year to a record $1.6 billion in the second quarter and were up 6% sequentially from Q1. Combined with $347 million of fee-related performance revenues in the second quarter generated by a variety of perpetual vehicles, total fee revenues exceeded $1.9 billion, up 51% year-over-year.\nFee-related earnings increased 45% year-over-year to $1 billion, reflecting the strong growth in fee revenues. With respect to FRE margin, as we've stated before, it's most informative to look over multiple quarters given intra-year movements. On a year-to-date basis, FRE margin was 55.1%, in line with the prior year comparable period despite a significant step-up in T&E expense from muted levels last year.\nAs we noted then, the COVID-related reduction in T&E spend was a benefit that would eventually reverse. Adjusting for this impact, year-to-date 2022 margins were stable with the full year 2021 as well. For 2022, we expect full year margin to be approximately in the same 55% area, reflecting expansion of over 200 basis points in 2 years and 900 basis points in 4 years.\nDistributable earnings increased 86% year-over-year to $2.0 billion in the second quarter or $1.49 per share driven by strong growth in both FRE and net realizations. Net realizations rose over 2.5 fold to a record $1.3 billion, powered by Mileway and The Cosmopolitan. While the overall effect of the current environment will be to slow realizations in the near term, our performance revenue potential continues to build. Invested performance revenue eligible AUM grew 39% year-over-year to a record $487 billion. Net accrued performance revenues on the balance sheet stand at $7.5 billion or over $6 per share. While down from a record level in Q1, primarily due to realizations, this store value is still up 11% year-over-year and is up nearly threefold from the same period 2 years ago.\nTurning to the outlook. Similar to the road map we provided 4 years ago, we believe the combination of the firm's latest drawdown fundraising cycle and the ongoing expansion and scaling of our perpetual capital platform will lead to a structural step-up in the firm's FRE over the next several years. First, our $150 billion target across 18 drawdown funds represents an increase of over 25% compared to their prior vintages. This engine alone should add approximately 20% to FRE as these funds are raised and activated over time. We expect to launch the new $30 billion real estate flagship in early fall with an effective 4-month fee holiday for first closers. We will launch other funds at various points over the coming quarters depending on deployment.\nAt the same time, and alongside the drawdown funds, our perpetual capital platform has expanded dramatically since Investor Day. In the past 12 months alone, perpetual AUM more than doubled to $356 billion, consisting of 21 strategies across 51 discrete vehicles with more in development. Most of these vehicles generate recurring fee-related performance revenues, and momentum in this high-quality earnings stream continues to build. Indeed, perpetual strategies now comprise 45% of the firm's total performance revenue eligible AUM in the ground or $219 billion, reflecting a model that is less and less dependent on asset sales.\nIn the past, we referred to the layering effect of these revenues as crystallization events occur on different cycles across strategies. In the case of BPP in particular, we expect to see a meaningful step-up in fee-related performance revenues in 2023, with 4x more BPP AUM subject to crystallization than in 2022. Overall, our perpetual platform, including both institutional and retail strategies, has been a key driver of the firm's evolution towards higher and more recurring earnings, a progression we expect to continue.\nSo in closing, as Blackstone moves into the second half of 2022, despite the many uncertainties in the world, we are highly confident in the future. Our business model is set up to provide extraordinary resiliency in difficult times as shown throughout our history. At the same time, we have multiple engines of growth driving us forward and are putting in place the foundation for a material step-up in FRE.\nWith that, thank you for joining the call and would like to open it up now for questions."

My name is Christophe, and I'm the event manager for today. (Operator Instructions) I would like to advise all parties that this conference is being recorded.\nAnd with that, I'll hand it over to Weston. Please proceed.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSenior MD & Head of Shareholder Relations, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, and good morning, and welcome to Blackstone's first quarter conference call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-Q report in a few weeks.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. And for a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP measures, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audiocast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $2.5 billion. Distributable earnings were $1.9 billion or $1.55 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $1.32 per share to be paid to holders of record as of May 2.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, CEO & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThanks a lot, Weston, and good morning, and thank you for joining our call.\nBlackstone reported an exceptional start to the year, with the first quarter representing one of the 2 best in our 36-year history. This was despite increasing interest rates and ever higher inflation, driving major declines in equity and debt markets. Distributable earnings, as Weston mentioned, in the first quarter rose 63% this year over last year to $1.9 billion, while fee-related earnings increased 55% to $1.1 billion.\nInflows, capital deployed and realizations all set new records for the firm for any 12-month period. Most importantly, our investment performance was outstanding, dramatically outperforming public indices. Another example of why alternative assets continue to grow rapidly in a risk-off world. These results are highly atypical in money management. But greater than a single quarter, they represent further proof of concept, Blackstone's position in the financial sector, which I believe we are uniquely placed.\nSo what differentiates us? There are certain attributes that characterize a great financial firm, including strong investment performance over long periods of time; significant growth in assets while maintaining debt performance; the ability to continuously innovate; a trusted brand; loyalty from customers, who themselves are healthy and growing; wide geographic and product reach; a distinctive high-performance culture; the ability to attract and keep great talent; and the capacity to identify and act upon paradigm shifts before others. It is rare even for a great firm to possess several of these pillars of success. At Blackstone, I believe we've demonstrated we have all of them.\nAs the largest alternative manager in the world, we've built leading businesses across all of the major asset classes with uniformly outstanding returns. Our flagship strategies have significantly outperformed the comparable public indices, including 16% to 17% net returns annually, corporate private equity and global opportunistic real estate for 3 decades, leading the indices by approximately 5% to 9% per year.\nAs we've grown larger, we have not sacrificed returns. Quite the opposite, in fact. In the first quarter, while nearly every major asset class outside commodities declined, our funds delivered strong performance. This is best highlighted on the one hand by our real estate business, our largest business, for superior sector and asset selection led to our flagship strategies, appreciating 8% to 10% just in the quarter compared to a 4% decline in the REIT index.\nOn the other hand, in liquid markets, our hedge fund solutions delivered a positive composite return in the quarter compared to a 5% to 9% decline in the major global equity indices. Strong performance over decades has given us the confidence and ability to innovate. While most companies struggle to build a great business outside of their original success, innovation itself is a core competency at our firm.\nToday, we have approximately 60 strategies, and we're constantly developing more, increasingly in the form of perpetual capital vehicles. As we deliver for our clients across more and more strategies, it deepens our relationships with them and creates a powerful network effect, leading to a greater share of wallet. That's why our inflows reached $50 billion in the first quarter alone and $289 billion for the last 12 months.\nOver the past 3 years, our limited partners have entrusted us with $500 billion of inflows, which is greater than the total AUM, any other alternative firm. Above all else, people and reputation are the absolute necessities for finance success. At Blackstone, these are our most important assets and the foundation of everything we've been able to achieve. We have more talented people at the firm today than ever before, operating at the highest level of excellence. And we are reinvesting significantly in our capabilities and people in order to expand our leadership position in every area and further widen our competitive moat.\nAs the gold standard in financial services, Blackstone is magnet to the industry's best talent as evidenced by 35,000 unique applications for fewer and only 200 positions in our most recent analyst recruiting class. And we've also been named consistently as one of the Best Places to Work in finance.\nTaken together, these pillars of success are why Blackstone has continued to post strong results and why we have extraordinary forward momentum despite the current backdrop of rising rates and higher inflation. While no investment manager can be totally immune from these headwinds, we believe the unique balance of our firm and positioning of our portfolio will enable us to mitigate the adverse consequences of these factors.\nAs we've highlighted previously, in our $200 billion corporate credit business, virtually all of our investments are in floating rate debt, which provides a better return for our customers as interest rates move higher. And our nearly $300 billion real estate business, approximately 80% of the equity portfolio in sectors where rents in the U.S. are growing significantly in excess of the rate of inflation, owning hard assets has historically provided a strong hedge for inflation, which favors our $27 billion infrastructure business as well.\nFor our $125 billion corporate private equity platform, our operating companies grew a remarkable 20% -- 22% year-over-year in the first quarter, partially benefiting from reopening tailwinds. While we're seeing the impact of inflation on some of our companies, which we expect to continue, we believe investing in companies with strong revenue growth is the best protection to generate outperformance in the future. And in our $83 billion hedge fund solutions platform, we expect volatile liquid markets to advantage our downside protected strategies, which we saw in the first quarter.\nOverall, the transformation of our firm continues, which we first outlined at our Investor Day in 2018, with our AUM rapidly shifting to its perpetual strategies and our earnings towards more recurring FRE. Over this 3.5-year period, perpetual AUM is up over 5x, and annual FRE has more than tripled. This transformation makes us more resilient to market cycles and provides additional opportunities to create value for our limited partners.\nIn closing, I've never been more pleased with the positioning of our firm or more optimistic about its prospects.\nNow, I'll turn it over to our television star, Jon Gray.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nGeneral Partner, President, COO & Director, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It's one thing for an investment firm to achieve strong results when markets are all going up. It's quite another to do so in a challenging environment like Q1.\nOver the past several years, we've been fortifying our business model to deliver for investors in good times and bad. This applies to the way we've deployed capital as well as the businesses we've entered. The power of that model was on full display in the first quarter.\nStarting with the portfolio and investment performance. We've been mindful of the prospect of rising interest rates and a normalization of market multiples for several years. This informed our investing, as Steve noted, and we concentrated our deployment towards hard assets in the businesses where revenue could grow faster than inflationary pressures. These include global logistics, life sciences, rental housing, enterprise software, and digital and energy infrastructure. Today, we're benefiting from extraordinarily positive fundamentals in these areas, and they remain significant drivers of appreciation in our funds.\nAfter the start of the pandemic, we also ramped up deployment in the travel sector, including investments in Bourne Leisure; Signature Aviation; and extended stay hotels; along with pending commitments for Crown Resorts; toll road operator, ASPI; and Visa services firm, VFS. We are now seeing a robust recovery in global travel.\nThe tremendous value of what we own today is further highlighted by our realization activity. Nowhere is that more apparent than in logistics, our largest investment team comprising 40% of the global real estate portfolio. We first started investing in this sector at scale in 2010 given the expected explosion in e-commerce. And today, we own approximately $170 billion of warehouses. We're also now seeing a surge in corporation's increasing inventory holdings to mitigate supply chain issues. We have harvested gains along the way, including Encore in 2015 and Logicor in 2017, two of the firm's most successful investments. And the largest realization in Q1 was the refinancing of a portion of our U.S. logistics portfolio.\nMoreover, in our European portfolio, we expect to complete the EUR 21 billion recapitalization of Mileway, the largest last mile logistics platform on the continent in the next few weeks. We built this platform through 220 separate acquisitions over 5 years. After a fulsome market check process, the portfolio is being acquired by a new perpetual capital vehicle managed by Blackstone along with existing Core+ vehicles with an aggregate EUR 10 billion of equity commitments.\nTurning to our business expansion. We've been talking about moving into more open waters in terms of broadening the clients we serve and the investments we can make. This expansion with an emphasis on perpetual strategies has made our business more durable in difficult markets. Last quarter, we highlighted 4 key engines of growth, and I'll briefly give you an update on each.\nIn retail, investor demand for our products remained strong despite market headwinds. We've continued to raise a total of $4 billion to $5 billion per month of equity capital for our 3 retail perpetual vehicles: BREIT, BCRED and BPIF, including the most recent monthly subscription on April 1. Investors recognize our products are well positioned for the inflationary environment ahead given BREIT's focus on hard assets with short-duration leases, while BCRED is a floating rate vehicle with an average loan-to-value of 43%. BREIT more than doubled in size year-over-year to $63 billion, generating 5.8% appreciation in the first quarter.\nWe have the most powerful brand in the retail channel and an enormous first-mover advantage, selling our products today through a broad network of distribution partners. We are in the early innings of our build-out in this vast and underpenetrated market.\nOur institutional perpetual capital platform also continues to grow rapidly, approaching the $100 billion milestone. In infrastructure, we raised $2.5 billion in the quarter and over $9 billion since reopening the vehicle in Q4, bringing the strategy to $27 billion. We've been actively deploying this capital and given the opportunity set and our performance, we expect this business to grow significantly over time.\nIn real estate, our institutional BPP strategy grew 30% year-over-year to $66 billion with an additional step-up coming this quarter from Mileway.\nTurning to insurance. AUM on this platform has more than doubled year-over-year to $155 billion. We believe we're uniquely positioned in our sector as an asset-light investment manager serving multiple insurance clients. We are focused on delivering for them and expect to find additional growth opportunities over time on a balance sheet-light basis.\nMoving to our drawdown funds, where we spent the last 36 years building what we believe is the best platform in the world. Last quarter, we highlighted moving into a new flagship fundraising cycle, targeting approximately $150 billion in aggregate. Despite the more crowded fundraising environment in the private equity area today, our confidence in this target remains extremely high. This is reflective of the strength of our brand, track record, the breadth of our platform and the geographic reach of our capital raising.\nIn fact, we expect significant closings for our 2 largest flagships, global real estate and corporate private equity, in the next few months. Our third-largest private equity secondaries has closed on $14 billion to date and is on track to reach approximately $20 billion later this year, which would be the largest secondaries vehicle ever raised.\nFundraising momentum has never been stronger at Blackstone. The firm's breadth also positions us well to deploy capital as illustrated by the new -- the nearly $150 billion invested over the past 12 months. Major new commitments in the first quarter were in some of our favorite neighborhoods: rental housing, logistics, life sciences and software. Looking forward, we have an active pipeline and the market volatility is creating opportunities, including several public company situations.\nEarlier this week, we announced a $13 billion total enterprise value take private of the largest student housing platform in the United States. And last week, in partnership with the Benetton family, we launched a tender offer to privatize Atlantia, one of the largest transportation infrastructure companies.\nIn closing, we expect to move into a higher inflation. Higher rate environment will create challenges, but the fundamentals at our firm remain exceptionally strong. Investors continue to look to alternatives in Blackstone in particular to deliver the investment solutions they need, and we are building simple, repeatable, scalable businesses to serve them.\nFor our shareholders, we've continued to grow earnings rapidly while remaining true to our capital-light model. This has allowed us to return 100% of earnings over the past 4 years through dividends and share buybacks while keeping the share count flat and incurring virtually no net debt and no insurance liabilities. This highly attractive model gives us great confidence in the future.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nCFO, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone.\nTwo key dynamics have underpinned the evolution of our business over the past several years. First, the development of an entire platform of perpetual capital strategies, and the scaling of those strategies has fundamentally transformed the firm's FRE trajectory. Second, the growing breadth of our business and ways to win overall is fueling an expansion of the firm's store value and performance revenue potential. The net result is higher earnings, higher quality earnings and greater resiliency through market cycles.\nThe firm's outstanding first quarter results perfectly illustrate these dynamics. First, with respect to perpetual capital and FRE. Perpetual AUM more than doubled year-over-year to $338 billion across 18 vehicles. These strategies now comprise 43% of the firm's fee-earning AUM, and their impact on the repeatability of our capital metrics and earnings can't be overstated.\nIn terms of capital metrics, over half of the firm's record LTM inflows and record deployment was from perpetual strategies. It was only 4 years ago that we first surpassed $100 billion of inflows in a single year. The firm is now raising that or more from our perpetual strategies alone. Moreover, nearly all of these vehicles continuously fundraise, creating much more consistency of inflows from quarter-to-quarter.\nIn terms of earnings, the perpetualization of our business is similarly driving a meaningful step-up in the magnitude and resiliency of earnings. As we've outlined before, these strategies generate management fees that compound with both inflows and NAV appreciation, which set a higher and higher baseline for fee revenues as we go. The combined fee-earning AUM of 4 flagship perpetual capital strategies, BREIT, BPP, BCRED and our infrastructure platform, BIP, nearly doubled in the last 12 months to over $160 billion including a $27 billion increase from appreciation.\nIn addition to NAV-based management fees, 10 of the perpetual vehicles generate fee-related performance revenues, which, by definition, crystallize on a recurring basis without asset sales. Importantly, in the first quarter, BREIT moved from its prior annual crystallization schedule occurring in the fourth quarter of each year to a quarterly crystallization similar to BCRED.\nThe combination of these factors and the exceptional range of growth engines firing across the firm overall is powering continued robust increases in total fee revenues and FRE. Management fees rose 25% year-over-year to a record $1.5 billion. Fee-related performance revenues more than tripled year-over-year to $558 million. And even if you were to adjust the prior period for the BREIT change, they more than doubled. FRE rose 55% year-over-year to $1.1 billion in the quarter or $0.95 per share. We are now approaching a quarterly run rate of $1 per share in this high-quality earnings stream, which is in the area of full year FRE at the time of our Investor Day.\nMoving to performance revenues and the growing store value. In the first quarter, net realizations increased 73% year-over-year to nearly $1 billion. Fund realizations reached a record $23 billion and included the refinancing of our U.S. logistics portfolio, the partial sale of fintech company, IntraFi and the monetization of stakes in various private and public holdings across the firm. The dramatic expansion in the number and scale of the firm strategies and commensurate increase in aggregate deployment has led to a record $481 billion of performance revenue eligible value in the ground, up 50% year-over-year.\nAt the same time, sustained investment outperformance across the platform on this growing base of invested capital has driven a continued expansion of the firm's store value. In the first quarter, $1.9 billion of net performance revenues lifted the balance sheet receivable 9% sequentially to $9.5 billion or nearly $8 per share, the highest level in our history.\nOn a year-over-year basis, the receivable increased to 84%, notwithstanding $4.3 billion of net realized distributions. Taken together, remarkable growth in both FRE and net realizations drove a 63% year-over-year increase in distributable earnings in the first quarter to $1.9 billion or $1.55 per share. For the LTM period, DE reached $5.36 per share, a record for any 12 months in our history. Looking forward, strong FRE momentum, coupled with a robust near-term realization pipeline, give us great confidence in the outlook.\nIn closing, I'll go back to where I started with the ongoing transformation of the firm. We are on a path characterized by rising AUM milestones, a path to $1 trillion this year and ultimately well beyond with commensurate significant elevation in earnings power and earnings quality each step of the way. We have 4 robust growth engines driving us forward. And in all of them, we continue to deliver outstanding results and have the full support of our LPs. Despite the uncertainties of today's world, we feel great about Blackstone's future.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call and would like to open it up now for questions."

My name is Leslie, and I'm the event manager. (Operator Instructions) I'd like to advise all parties that the conference is being recorded for replay purposes.\nAnd now I'd like to hand you over to your host for today, Weston. Please go ahead.\n\nWeston M. Tucker\n\nSenior MD & Head of Shareholder Relations, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nTerrific. Thanks, Leslie. And good morning and welcome to Blackstone's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Joining today are Steve Schwarzman, Chairman and CEO; Jon Gray, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Michael Chae, Chief Financial Officer.\nEarlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. We expect to file our 10-K report later next month.\nI'd like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements, which are uncertain and outside of the firm's control and may differ from actual results materially. We do not undertake any duty to update these statements. For a discussion of some of the risks that could affect results, please see the Risk Factors section of our 10-K. We'll also refer to non-GAAP measures on this call, and you'll find reconciliations in the press release on the shareholders page of our website.\nAlso please note that nothing on this call constitutes an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase an interest in any Blackstone fund. This audio cast is copyrighted material of Blackstone and may not be duplicated without consent.\nOn results, we reported GAAP net income for the quarter of $2.9 billion. Distributable earnings were $2.3 billion or $1.71 per common share, and we declared a dividend of $1.45 to be paid to holders of record as of February 7.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.\n\nStephen Allen Schwarzman\n\nChairman, CEO & Co-Founder, The Blackstone Group L.P.\n\nThank you, Weston. Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, Blackstone reported the most remarkable results in our history on virtually every metric. Distributable earnings rose 55% to $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter and increased 85% to $6.2 billion for the year. Investment performance was exceptional, including over 40% appreciation in our opportunistic real estate and corporate private equity funds for 2021. And we raised $270 billion of inflows, over $0.25 trillion in 1 year, lifting assets under management by 42% to $881 billion. No other alternative firm in the world has approached this level of absolute growth in a single year.\nWe told you in the second quarter that it was the most consequential in our history. That assertion was not based on short-term results. It was reflective of the sea change underway in asset management and our positioning within it, which is now playing out even more powerfully than we had previously anticipated.\nCapital flows continue to shift towards 2 ends of a barbell: on one side to low-cost passive funds; on the other side, flows are accelerating towards alternatives, a trend benefiting numerous firms in our industry, but none more profoundly than Blackstone.\nIn the world of alternatives, Blackstone is clear choice for Global Limited Partners looking to invest in the asset class, whether it's a retail distributor or an institutional investor that needs to deploy billions of dollars across the capital structure. Today, we offer nearly 60 investment strategies, up from 35 5 years ago. We have the deepest menu of available products with compelling performance across our platform and the largest flow of investment activity in the world.\nThe result is a powerful network effect. Our customers are constantly in our store and our shelves are full, which results in Blackstone gaining a huge percentage of repeat business and a high likelihood it will choose our new products as well. This network effect extends to new platforms that we launch. Our LPs know that when we launch a new product, it's with the intention of building the highest-quality business and that our scale and reach can have an extraordinarily positive effect for them.\nFor example, the clean energy transition has been a major investment theme across the firm for several years, and we are already one of the largest providers of private credit in this area. Last week, we launched a sustainable resources platform to pull together the full breadth of the firm's resources. We see an opportunity to invest $100 billion in support of energy transition and climate change solutions over the next decade. Blackstone intends to be a global leader in investing and a force for good in this critically important area.\nAcross the firm, we are exceptionally well positioned to continue growing in a way that is unprecedented in the alternative asset class, and I couldn't be more confident in our momentum despite the significant correction underway in the global markets. The average stock in the S&P has declined 17% from its recent peak, while the average Nasdaq stock is down 44%. The alternative manager stocks have not been immune to these pressures. And we've noted investor concerns around the impact of inflation, the prospect of rising interest rates and the ability to continue raising capital.\nI believe the tremendous balance of our firm and the careful design of our portfolio will once again allow us to not only navigate this environment, but to thrive in it as we have for 36 years. In our $280 billion real estate business, which generated nearly half of our earnings last year, over 70% of the equity portfolio is in the best areas: logistics, rental housing and life sciences office. Leases in this portfolio are shorter duration with the ability to reprice as we move through the inflationary period. Importantly, in the United States, we're now seeing rents in these sectors grow at 2 to 3x the rate of inflation. And as the cost of new construction rises with inflation, it greatly benefits the value of our existing holdings.\nIn corporate private equity, our portfolio is also well positioned for inflation. Our holdings are concentrated in areas with strong secular growth that are more resilient to rising input costs. Our operating companies reported 23% year-over-year growth in revenues in the fourth quarter. That's really stunning, 23% revenues. And 2/3 saw margin expansion in the year in our nearly $200 billion corporate credit business.\nAs interest rates move higher in response to inflation, we expect our returns to benefit. The vast majority of our investments in corporate credit are in floating rate debt, which helps protect capital and provides a better and better return as base rates increase. And while higher rates can be a headwind for liquid markets, with $136 billion of dry capital -- dry powder capital across the firm, we can move quickly to invest when pricing becomes more favorable.\nFrom a fundraising perspective, I expect our strong momentum to continue in the current environment. In the institutional channel, LPs are increasing their allocations to alternatives. In fact, 80% of LPs according to a recent survey buy frequent. In most cases, they are concentrating capital with fewer managers, which favors Blackstone.\nIn the retail channel, individuals in the U.S. have accumulated $2.8 trillion of excess savings since the start of the pandemic. Our perpetual products in real estate and credit are uniquely designed with inflation in mind to protect capital and generate substantial current income. In total, we raised $50 billion of equity capital in this channel last year. And despite the uncertainty in the markets, financial advisers have very high confidence in the attractiveness of our products.\nI have personally lived through many cycles here at Blackstone in the past 36 years. And each time, our firm has come out stronger than before. Markets often overcorrect in a way that is disconnected from fundamentals. When you look at our firm's progression, including today's exceptional results, it should be clear that the fundamentals of Blackstone are dramatically accelerating. We've been telling you for years about these powerful trends, and what we've told you has come true.\nAt our Investor Day a little over 3 years ago, we shared our vision of reaching $1 trillion of AUM in 8 years. We now believe we will reach $1 trillion of AUM this year, in half the time we predicted. We've nearly tripled annual FRE and doubled DE over this period. Our profit margins have continued to expand and today are 3x higher than the median of the largest 100 U.S. public companies.\nBlackstone has an unrivaled position in our industry. Our prospects are extraordinary. We have the most recognized brand, which has been continually reinforced through market cycles. Our firm is regularly acknowledged by third parties for the strength of our franchise, including by Morgan Stanley who has repeatedly selected us as 1 of the 30 best companies in any industry. And our unique culture continues to set us apart, characterized by the highest standards of excellence and integrity, unwavering dedication to our clients, new product innovation and a commitment to preserve capital.\nIn closing, as we move into 2022, market landscape will undoubtedly present challenges, but it will also provide opportunities that we are very well positioned to capitalize upon. The firm has never been in a stronger position. Every part of our business has ambitious plans, remarkable momentum and an unquestionable will to win. I have never had deeper confidence in our future and pride in our people.\nThank you for your support. With that, I'll turn it over to Jon.\n\nJonathan D. Gray\n\nGeneral Partner, President, COO & Director, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. It was another tremendous quarter for Blackstone and our investors, highlighted by extraordinary growth. AUM increased $150 billion in 3 months, the equivalent of a top 10 global alternatives firm, as we continue to expand the platform with a significant focus on perpetual capital strategies. This is driving a meaningful step-up in the growth and quality of our earnings, with both distributable earnings and FRE reaching record levels for the quarter and year.\nWe've achieved these results while sticking to our model: managing third-party capital, relying on our brand and track record to grow. With minimal net debt, no insurance liabilities, we have no need to retain capital and have been able to return 100% of earnings to shareholders.\nOf course, the foundation of our business remains investment performance, and our funds posted outstanding returns in 2021. We continue to benefit from our thematic approach to deployment, emphasizing faster-growing areas of the economy, which were again the largest drivers of appreciation in our funds.\nNowhere is that more apparent than in real estate, which led the firm's returns in the fourth quarter. In my 30-year career, I've never seen real estate fundamentals in the sectors where we are focused as strong as they are today. The strength of our returns powers the Blackstone innovation machine, allowing us to expand who we serve and where we can invest.\n10 years ago, our business primarily consisted of episodic drawdown funds, pursuing opportunistic returns. While this remains a terrific and vital business to us, we've added 3 more engines, all growing rapidly. I'll briefly touch on all 4.\nStarting with retail. Investor demand for institutional-quality income solutions, coupled with the Blackstone brand, is a potent combination. We raised over $13 billion of equity capital in the fourth quarter across 3 products: BREIT, BCRED and BPIF, the equivalent of a large drawdown fund every quarter. BREIT more than doubled last year to $54 billion of NAV on the back of exceptional performance, generating a 30% net return and was the largest contributor to earnings in the quarter.\nMoving to our institutional perpetual funds. This evergreen platform is approaching and should surpass the $100 billion milestone this year. There is significant investor demand for long-dated strategies that compound in value. In infrastructure, we reopened new capital in the fourth quarter, raising nearly $7 billion and bringing the strategy to $23 billion of perpetual capital after only 4 years.\nA few weeks ago, we announced a $3 billion investment in Invenergy, the largest private renewables company in North America. In real estate, we talk a lot about BREIT, but don't forget the power of our institutional Core+ strategy, BPP, which grew over 30% last year to $61 billion.\nTurning to our drawdown funds. Given the strong pace of deployment across the firm, we're now moving into a new flagship fundraising cycle. Over the next 18 months, we expect to have launched and substantially complete fundraising for nearly all of the firm's major drawdown strategies, 17 funds targeting approximately $150 billion in aggregate, reflecting a 25% increase over the prior cycle. We expect to start raising our 2 largest flagships, global real estate and corporate private equity, this quarter.\nOur third-largest private equity secondaries launched in the fourth quarter, raising $13 billion in Q4 and is on track to reach approximately $20 billion, which would be the largest secondaries vehicle ever raised. Other vehicles in this pipeline include real estate Asia, real estate Europe, real estate credit, private equity energy, growth equity, tactical opportunities, real estate and infrastructure secondaries, SP's GP continuation strategy, European credit, clean energy credit, BAM ceding and stake strategies, and life sciences. The breadth of the firm today is truly remarkable.\nFinally, in insurance, our business more than doubled last year to approximately $160 billion with the closing of the AIG and Everlake mandates. AIG has committed an additional $42 billion, and we expect to find additional growth opportunities in this area over time on a capital-light basis. Together, these 4 engines helped drive total inflows of $155 billion in the fourth quarter and $270 billion for the year. This expansion has also opened up many new avenues to invest. And the fourth quarter was our busiest ever, with $66 billion deployed and an additional $19 billion committed to pending transactions. The largest new commitments were in some of our favorite secular neighborhoods, including renewables, rental housing, logistics and content creation.\nIn closing, when we look at what's in front of us and our momentum in 4 distinct verticals. We could not be more excited about the future. We believe it is a mistake to underestimate the power of this brand and the potential of this business.\nAnd with that, I will turn things over to Michael.\n\nMichael S. Chae\n\nCFO, The Blackstone Group Inc.\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. Over the past several years, we've been highlighting transformation of the firm's capital base and earnings power with a focus on 3 important dynamics: first, that sustained robust AUM growth and the scaling of perpetual strategies would accelerate fee-related earnings; second, that our growing breadth of funds and investment firepower, combined with strong returns on greater deployed capital, would expand the firm's store value and performance revenue potential; and third, that we would grow in a capital-light way with a definitive focus on delivering value to shareholders. The firm's record results are a perfect reflection of these dynamics at work.\nFirst, with respect to FRE, which reached $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter and rose a remarkable 71% for the year to $4.1 billion or $3.37 per share. It was only a year ago that we effectively hit our Investor Day target of $2 per share. And since then, AUM is up 42%, fee earning AUM is up 38%, and and perpetual capital AUM more than doubled to $313 billion across 18 separate vehicles. Petrol strategies now comprise 42% of the firm's fee-earning AUM, and their growth in number and scale is contributing to FRE in 2 important ways: management fees that compound with accelerating inflows and appreciation in NAV, and fee-related performance revenues that crystallize on a recurring basis without asset sales.\nIn total, management fees rose 26% for the year to $5.2 billion. Fee-related performance revenues increased more than fivefold to $2 billion driven by BREIT, which crystallizes these revenues annually in 4Q, along with a significant contribution from the BPP funds; the direct lending platform in credit; and in the fourth quarter, infrastructure. The combination of 60% year-over-year growth in total fee revenues and the firm's robust margin position drove FRE margins to 56.3% for the year, the highest level ever.\nLooking forward, the outlook for FRE is strong. In the context of the forward growth verticals that Jon discussed, across 3 of them, the majority of capital is perpetual with a significant and compounding financial contribution that I described. Combined NAV of BREIT and BCRED alone tripled in 2021, setting a higher baseline for fee revenue entering the year. Alongside that, we expect to see a material future benefit from the upcoming flagship fundraising cycle, with $150 billion targeted to be raised and respective investment periods activated over time.\nMoving to performance revenues and the growing store value. Net realizations more than doubled in 2021 to $2.9 billion, powered by record fund realizations of $77 billion. For the fourth quarter, fund realizations were $21 billion, including the sale of consumer finance platform, Exiter; several holdings in Tac Opps, including specialty retailer, Diamonds Direct; an upstream energy platform in credit; and certain U.S. logistics and multifamily assets. We also monetized stakes in various public holdings and refinanced a number of portfolio companies.\nThe Blackstone innovation machine is creating a level of activity that is unprecedented for both the firm and our industry at large, driving a meaningful elevation of our performance revenue potential. The dramatic expansion of the firm's strategies has driven a more than threefold increase in aggregate deployment from $45 billion in 2018 and to $144 billion in 2021. This, in turn, has led to a more than doubling of performance revenue-eligible value in the ground over this period to approximately $450 billion despite almost $200 billion of realizations.\nImportantly, as the firm has grown, there's been no diminution of investment performance, the measure of the ongoing value creation in the capital we've cumulatively deployed. On the contrary, the firm's returns in 2021 were some of our best. The BREP opportunistic funds appreciated 44%; corporate private equity, 42%; secondaries, 50%; Tac Opps, 35%; infrastructure, 30%; growth equity, 28%; real estate Core+, 25%; and private credit, 22%. The BAAM Composite rose 8% gross for the year, outperforming the HFRX Global Index by over 400 basis points with significantly lower volatility than the broader market, consistent with BAAM's mandate.\nIn BREP and corporate private equity, we reported the best annual returns in over a decade in secondaries, Core+ and Tac Opps since inception of the strategies and in private credit since 2013. Strong investment performance powered $2.2 billion of net performance revenues in the fourth quarter and lifted the balance sheet receivable to $8.7 billion or $7.28 per share, the highest level in our history. This balance more than doubled year-over-year, notwithstanding $3.5 billion of realized distributions. Together, outstanding growth in both FRE and net realizations drove distributable earnings for the year up 85% to a record $6.2 billion or $4.77 per share.\nFinally, on delivering value to shareholders. Our strong financial position and limited use of capital have allowed us to fully distribute our earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. These totaled $6.5 billion with respect to 2021, a record year for the firm and we believe by far the largest capital return by any public asset manager in a single year.\nIn closing, the firm is truly firing on all cylinders. Our momentum has never been stronger with enormous structural tailwinds and multiple engines of growth. We are very optimistic about the future of Blackstone.\nWith that, we thank you for joining the call and would like to open it up now for questions."

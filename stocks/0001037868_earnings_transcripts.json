Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with double-digit growth in sales, orders, operating profit and diluted earnings per share. Organic sales growth was strong in the quarter, leading to outstanding margin expansion and earnings well ahead of our expectations. Given these excellent results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance.\nNow let me turn to our third quarter financial results. Sales were a record $1.89 billion, an increase of 11% from the third quarter of 2024. Organic sales were up 4%, acquisitions added 6 points and foreign currency translation was a 1-point benefit. Orders were also very strong in the quarter, with overall orders up 13% to a record $1.97 billion and organic orders up 7%, leading to a record backlog of $3.54 billion.\nOur operational performance in the quarter was excellent with strong margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth. Operating income in the quarter was a record $496 million, an 11% increase over the third quarter of 2024. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, margins were 27%, up 90 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $592 million up 11% versus the prior year, with EBITDA margins and outstanding 31.3%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.89 per diluted share up 14% versus the third quarter of 2024.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the group level. First, the electronic consumers agreement. EIG delivered outstanding operating performance in the third quarter with strong margin expansion and operating margin levels that reflect the differentiated nature of our products and solutions. EIG sales were a record $1.25 billion, up 10% from last year's third quarter. Organic sales were flat, acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency was a 1 point tailwind. EIG operating income was $360 million, up 6% versus the prior year. Operating margins excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, were 30.4%, up 50 basis points versus the prior year.\nThe Electromechanical Group had an excellent quarter, delivering outstanding sales growth, record operating income and sizable margin expansion. EMG's third quarter sales were a record $646 million, up 13% versus the prior year. Organic sales were up 12% and foreign currency was a 1 point tailwind. Growth was broad-based across all EMG businesses in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was a record $164 million, up 25% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins were up sharply to 25.4%, a 250 basis point increase from the third quarter of 2024.\nOur results in the third quarter and thus far this year are a powerful demonstration of the AMETEK growth model in action. Our distributed operating structure and embedded operational excellence culture has allowed our businesses to quickly react to changing market dynamics and deliver excellent results. While there is still macroeconomic uncertainty, given the ongoing trade conflicts, AMETEK is well positioned. We are seeing positive inflection in our automation and engineered solutions markets. along with continued strength across our aerospace and defense businesses.\nAdditionally, we are managing a growing pipeline of opportunities within our power businesses and are benefiting from the strong secular trends driving that market. We are also seeing some improved visibility across our process markets. Although as noted, we are closely monitoring the trade dynamics and impact on demand timing. Our recent acquisitions, FARO, Virtek, Kern and Paragon are integrating very well into AMETEK and delivering strong results. As Dalip will cover, we have significant balance sheet flexibility providing us with ample firepower to deploy on strategic acquisitions.\nLastly, our operating model continues to shine with our colleagues doing an outstanding job leveraging our global infrastructure and operating systems to drive outstanding performance. Thank you to all colleagues for your tremendous efforts.\nNow switching to capital deployment. As noted, our integration efforts with recent acquisitions are progressing very well. Strategic acquisitions continue to be a core element of our growth strategy and the primary focus for our capital deployment. We are managing a strong pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates and expect to be active in pursuing strategic opportunities going forward.\nComplementing our proven acquisition strategy is a consistent commitment to investing in our businesses to best position them for long-term success. For 2025, we now expect to deploy an incremental $90 million toward organic growth initiatives. With this investment focused primarily on research and development, sales and digital marketing initiatives. The tangible results of this focus are clear with our third quarter vitality index, a strong 26%. The benefits of these investments coming to fruition can be seen in the many new product innovations across the company.\nI wanted to highlight a few of these new product innovations the first one from our Virtek Vision business. Virtek Vision is a leading provider of 3D laser projection and quality control inspection systems for critical aerospace and industrial applications. Virtek recently introduced a new AI-powered camera and software monitoring system that complements its advanced 3D laser projection system, further advancing their intelligent real-time inspection capabilities. The Iris AI inspection camera addresses customers' critical need for improved quality control and real-time documentation and complex manufacturing workflows.\nThe AI-powered camera captures and documents every step of the bill process, creating a complete digital record for each part. A notable feature of this new solution is the ability for users to create custom AI inspection models that can automatically detect anomalies, allowing for real-time process corrections. With this new product launch, Virtek makes powerful digital manufacturing tools intuitive and operator friendly, helping customers improve quality and productivity.\nOur NSI MI Technologies business the global defense tech leader in advanced RF and microwave test and measurement solutions is also doing an outstanding job developing highly differentiated custom solutions for their customers' critical applications. NSI is aligned with strong secular growth themes tied to advancements in satellite systems, autonomous vehicles and defense systems and as a result, are seeing excellent demand for their advanced measurement solutions. NSI's recently introduced new product, the Vector Digital Receiver advances their antenna, radome and electromatic field measurement capabilities. directly supporting the development of next-generation communication systems and advanced sensors for air, land, space and sea applications.\nI also wanted to congratulate our Rauland business on an impressive recent industry recognition. Rauland is a global leader in advanced clinical communications and workflow solutions for hospitals and health care systems worldwide. For the second consecutive year, Rauland has won the prestigious Medtech Breakthrough Award for Best Clinical administration hardware device. This award recognizes Rauland's responder platform for its critical role in addressing key challenges in modern health care such as nursing shortages and clinician workload truss.\nThe new Responder Enterprise Converge simplifies and coordinates care by improving direct staff to staff and patient distaff communication, which leads to faster response times, enhanced patient safety and better staff efficiency. This recognition underscores Rauland's technology leadership and its commitment to developing solutions that empower health care professionals and improve patient outcomes. This is a fantastic example of how our businesses are translating their technological innovation efforts into market-leading award-winning solutions for our customers.\nFinally, an update on the global trade environment. The situation continues to be very fluid and ever-changing. We remain vigilant in monitoring developments and proactively managing potential impacts. As we have discussed, our businesses continue to execute their well-defined mitigation plans, which include targeted pricing, strategic supply chain modifications and utilizing our global manufacturing footprint to adapt to changing demand patterns.\nOur teams also continue to leverage our U.S. manufacturing presence to support global customers adapting their own supply chains. AMETEK's culture and decentralized operating structure remain key advantages, providing flexibility to implement these actions quickly and effectively. Our proven playbook for navigating these uncertain environments continues to serve us well, and our teams are executing effectively.\nNow turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect full year sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2024. Given our strong third quarter performance and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $7.32 to $7.37, up 7% to 8% versus the prior year. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $7.06 to $7.20 per diluted share.\nFor the fourth quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up approximately 10% with earnings in the range of $1.90 to $1.95 per share, up 2% to 4% versus the prior year. Fourth quarter earnings growth would be 6% to 9% adjusting for last year's lower-than-normal tax rate.\nTo summarize, AMETEK delivered an excellent third quarter with strong sales and orders growth, robust margin expansion and earnings well ahead of our expectations. Our businesses continue to execute exceptionally well, delivering our differentiated technology solutions across a diverse set of niche markets.\nThe durability of our operating model and our strong cash flow provide us with the flexibility to navigate through challenging market conditions and continue to proactively invest in our businesses and in strategic acquisitions. As a result, we remain firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders.\nI will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip?\n\nDalip Mohan Puri\n\nSenior Vice President of Operational Finance\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had an excellent third quarter with strong growth and outstanding operating performance. This allowed us to deliver several financial records as well as double-digit growth in orders, sales, operating income and earnings per share in the quarter.\nNow let me provide some additional financial highlights for the third quarter. Third quarter general and administrative expenses were $28 million or 1.5% of sales, essentially in line with last year's third quarter. Third quarter interest expense was $23 million. Third quarter other expense was $17.9 million with the increase versus last year's third quarter, primarily due to onetime acquisition-related costs for Faro Technologies.\nAs I noted during our previous earnings conference call, we are excluding onetime acquisition-related costs from adjusted earnings. This approach will be consistently applied to future acquisitions, ensuring comparability and clarity in our non-GAAP financial reporting. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%, down from 18.8% in the third quarter of 2024. The reduction was driven by a lower effective international tax rate. For 2025, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 18% and 18.5%. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures in the third quarter were $21 million. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $103 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $425 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $210 million or $0.91 per diluted share.\nOperating working capital in the third quarter was 18.9% of sales, a slight improvement from the third quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was $441 million in the quarter. and free cash flow was $420 million. Free cash flow conversion was a strong 113% in the quarter. For 2025, we expect free cash flow conversion of approximately 110% to 115% of net income.\nTotal debt at September 30 was $2.5 billion, up from $2.1 billion at the end of 2024 due to the acquisition of Faro Technologies. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $439 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x. We continue to have significant financial capacity and flexibility with over $2 billion in cash and available credit to support our growth initiatives and our capital deployment strategies.\nIn the third quarter, we demonstrated this financial flexibility by deploying approximately $920 million on the acquisition of Faro, $150 million on share repurchases and $71 million in dividends, all while maintaining our financial capacity and a conservative balance sheet with gross leverage around 1x. The share repurchases in the quarter resulted in approximately 800,000 shares of our common stock being repurchased in the open market.\nIn summary, AMETEK delivered an excellent third quarter with strong top line growth, robust margin expansion, outstanding earnings growth and a meaningful increase to full year earnings guidance. Our differentiated technology portfolio our global manufacturing capabilities, along with our strong cash flow and balance sheet provides us with the foundation to successfully execute our growth strategy and to continue delivering exceptional results.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Sir, you may begin.\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Towanda. Good morning, and welcome to AMETEK's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call.

Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open it up for your questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered strong second quarter results, highlighted by record level sales and EBITDA, strong core margin expansion and excellent earnings growth. We also raised our full year sales and earnings guidance to reflect our second quarter results and the recent acquisition of FARO Technologies. The addition of FARO Technologies nicely complements our existing metrology and precision measurement businesses.\nOur ability to deliver strong operating performance is notable given the challenging macro environment and is a testament to the quality of our differentiated businesses, the strength of our operating capabilities and the contribution from all AMETEK colleagues.\nNow let me turn to our second quarter financial results. Sales were a record $1.78 billion, an increase of 2.5% from the second quarter of 2024. Organic sales were flat. Acquisitions added 1.5 points and foreign currency translation was a 1-point benefit. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.00 and we ended the second quarter with a backlog of $3.47 billion near record levels.\nOur operating performance in the quarter was excellent, leading to strong margin expansion and earnings growth. Operating income in the quarter was $462 million, a 3% increase over the second quarter of 2024. The operating margins were 26% in the quarter, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Core margins, excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency, were very strong at 26.7%, up 90 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $565 million, up 4% versus the prior year with EBITDA margins an impressive 31.8%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.78 per diluted share, up 7% versus the second quarter of 2024.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered solid operating performance in the second quarter. EIG sales were $1.16 billion, up 1% from last year's second quarter. Organic sales were down 3%, acquisitions added 2 points and foreign currency was a 1 point tailwind. EIG operating income was $344 million, and operating margins were 29.7% with core margins a very strong 30.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior year.\nThe Electromechanical Group had an excellent quarter with strong sales and orders growth, record operating income and sizable margin expansion in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $618 million, up 6% from the prior year. Organic sales were up 5% and foreign currency was a 1 point tailwind. Additionally, orders were again strong in the quarter with notable order strength within our Paragon and Automation businesses. EMG's operating income in the second quarter was a record $144 million, up 17% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins were 23.3%, up 210 basis points in the second quarter of 2024, with core margins up an impressive 260 basis points.\nOur businesses continue to execute well, delivering strong operating results against the backdrop of a challenging macro environment. Our business model allows us to react quickly to changing economic conditions while ensuring we remain focused on delivering long-term sustainable growth.\nWe are committed to making strategic growth investments across our businesses to help support and accelerate progress. For all of 2025, we continue to expect to invest an incremental $85 million in strategic growth initiatives across the company, with these investments focused on research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. These efforts and our commitment to innovation ensure a steady stream of new products that support our customers' critical applications and position us for continued success. Our vitality index, which was 26% in the quarter, continues to reflect the success of our technology innovation strategy.\nI want to take a moment to highlight a recent new product introduction from our [ Spectro Analytical Instruments ] business. Spectro Analytical Instruments is a leading global provider of advanced instrumentation solutions for highly precise and accurate elemental analysis. This new product, the [ Spectra Green MS ] is their latest solution designed for high-performance elemental analysis. It addresses a key challenge in environmental and pharmaceutical laboratories by simplifying the process of analyzing complex samples for trace elements. The new product incorporates several innovations that improve workflow and efficiency, including its ability to analyze both high concentration and trace elements in a single measurement significantly reducing analysis time for busy lapse.\nWith this new product launch, Spectro Analytical continues to advance its technology leadership and provide customers with greater speed, accuracy and ease of use for their critical applications. This is just one of the many innovative new product introductions across our business.\nNow switching to capital deployment. As noted, we acquired FARO Technologies subsequent to the end of the second quarter for approximately $920 million. FARO is a leading provider of advanced 3D metrology and digital reality solutions. Their technology solutions, which include measurement arms, laser scanners and integrated software platforms enable customers in end markets, including aerospace and defense, public safety and architecture and engineering to precisely measure and visualize physical environments for a wide range of critical applications. FARO's product suite nicely complements our existing metrology and precision imaging capabilities, particularly within our [indiscernible] business, providing the most comprehensive portfolio of automated 3D metrology, laser projection and digital reality solutions.\nThis acquisition provides AMETEK with a significant presence in the fast-growing digital reality market and has a strong recurring revenue profile through its service and cloud-based subscriptions. We see significant potential to expand operating margins through integration into AMETEK's global infrastructure and operating model. FARO has annual sales of approximately $340 million. We're very pleased to welcome the FARO team to AMETEK and excited for the future.\nStrategic acquisitions are a core component of the AMETEK Growth Model, and we are committed to deploying our strong cash flow to expand our portfolio in highly attractive market segments. Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and Dalip will detail, we have a very strong and flexible balance sheet. We anticipate remaining active in this area.\nFinally, a comment on the global trade landscape. While the situation remains fluid, our businesses have been proactive in addressing the potential impacts of tariffs. As we highlighted last quarter, we have well defined mitigation plans that are being executed across the organization. These actions are multifaceted and include targeted pricing initiatives, strategic adjustments to our global supply chains and leveraging our worldwide manufacturing footprint to localize production.\nOur teams are also identifying opportunities to utilize our U.S. manufacturing presence to support global customers looking to localize or reshore their supply chains. AMETEK's diversification across end markets and geographies limits our dependence on any single region and our decentralized structure allows for the flexibility need to implement these mitigation actions quickly and effectively. We have a proven playbook for navigating through these uncertain environments, and we are making outstanding progress.\nOur focus remains on supporting our customers, delivering strong results and utilizing our strong financial position to invest in our long-term growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions.\nNow turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Given our results in the second quarter, and the closing of FARO Technologies, we now expect full year sales to be up mid-single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $7.06 to $7.20, up 3% to 5% versus the prior year. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $7.02 to $7.18 per diluted share.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with earnings in the range of $1.72 to $1.76 per share, up 4% to 6% versus the prior year. Our full year and third quarter guidance incorporates the expected contributions from the FARO Technologies.\nIn summary, AMETEK delivered strong second quarter results. Our businesses are well positioned with differentiated technology solutions, serving a diverse set of growing niche markets. We have a durable operating model and an ability to react quickly to changing market dynamics. Our strong cash flows provide us with the opportunity to deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth and strong returns for our shareholders.\nI will now turn it over to Dalip Puri, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip?\n\nDalip Mohan Puri\n\nSenior Vice President of Operational Finance\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had a solid second quarter, highlighted by excellent operating performance, robust core margin expansion and strong earnings growth.\nNow let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $27 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's second quarter. Second quarter interest expense was $17 million. Second quarter other expense was higher by approximately $3 million versus the prior period due to lower pension income and foreign exchange movements. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, in line with the second quarter of 2024. For 2025, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nThe recently enacted tax reconciliation bill aligns well with our U.S.-based manufacturing footprint and innovation-led growth model. While we are continuing to assess the full implications, we expect it to favorably impact our cash tax position. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $29 million and we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $160 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $108 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $425 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $210 million or $0.91 per diluted share.\nOperating working capital in the second quarter was 18.6% of sales, in line with the second quarter of 2024. Operating cash flow was $359 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was $330 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow conversion was 102% of net income. For 2025, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion of approximately 115% of net income. Total debt at June 30 was $1.9 billion down from $2.1 billion at the end of 2024. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $620 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.85 and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.6.\nPro forma for the acquisition of FARO, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio increases modestly from 0.85 to 1.25. With respect to our recent acquisition of FARO, we will be excluding any onetime acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges from adjusted cash EPS starting in the third quarter. This approach will also be consistently applied to all future acquisitions, ensuring comparability and clarity in our non-GAAP financial reporting.\nWe continue to have significant financial capacity and flexibility with over $2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and to further deploy on strategic acquisitions.\nIn summary, AMETEK had a solid second quarter, delivering strong results, including robust margin expansion and earnings growth. Our leading positions across attractive market segments, combined with our strong balance sheet, and outstanding global operating capabilities leave us very well positioned to navigate the current environment and deliver on our growth strategies.\nKevin?\n\nKevin C.

AMETEK had a strong start to 2025 with excellent first quarter results. We delivered robust margin expansion, generated strong free cash flow and delivered earnings above our expectations. Additionally, orders were again strong in the quarter. Our results reflect the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our niche differentiated businesses and most importantly, the outstanding efforts from our colleagues.\nNow let me turn to our first quarter financial results.

Diluted earnings per share were $1.75, up 7% versus the first quarter of 2024 and above our guidance range of $1.67 to $1.69 per share.

EMG's operating margins were up a sizable 120 basis points from the first quarter of 2024.\nI'm pleased with our performance in the first quarter with robust margin expansion, strong order growth, excellent cash flow generation and percent earnings growth despite a continued uncertain economic environment. We remain committed to making strategic investments in our businesses to best position them for long-term growth. These investments are supporting our global and market expansion and technology innovation strategies.\nFor all of 2025, we continue to expect to invest an incremental $85 million in support of these initiatives with key investments in research, development and engineering to help advance our product differentiation. Our Vitality Index, which measures the sales of new products introduced in the past 3 years was a strong percentage.\nWe are confident that these investments will further solidify our competitive positions in our core markets to now broaden our exposure within new attractive growth markets. I wanted to take a moment to highlight just 2 of the many recent new product introductions across the company. First, from Gatan, a leader in electron microscope technology.\nThey recently launched the EDAX Elite Ultra energy disperse of X-ray spectroscopy system. The Elite Ultra solves a common challenge in advanced materials research by improving the ability to map and quantify elements in very thin samples. This system provides faster, more active results allowing for deeper insights into material composition.\nOne of the key features of the Elite Ultra is a larger sensor, which captures more x-rays and improve the system's sensitivity to a wider range of elements leading to better data and faster analysis. Gatan worked closely with another AMETEK business, [ Amtech ] and the development of this advanced center technology.\nThis is just one example of the ways our businesses partner together to help support and accelerate our technology innovation. With this new product introduction, Gatan continues to lead the way in developing advanced solutions that help scientists and engineers push the boundaries of their scientific research.\nVision Research also launched a new line of small, powerful high-speed cameras to [ Fantom ] KT series. These cameras leverage a custom design high-speed sensor from [indiscernible] another AMETEK business. These sensors provide superior image quality and performance, making them ideal for advanced applications.\nTheir compact design makes them easy to use in a variety of set whether for industrial testing, motion analysis or medical research. Through this latest innovation, Vision Research continues to lead the market in high-speed imaging technology offering researchers powerful tools to capture and analyze fast-moving phenomena. These advancements, along with many others introduced in the quarter, highlight our continued commitment to our customers and position us well to drive long-term success and meet evolving needs across emerging applications.\nNow switching to capital deployment. Strategic acquisitions remain our #1 priority for capital deployment. We are managing a robust pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates. While our top priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions, we are also well positioned to deploy capital and share buybacks.\nWe have a $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization, and as we have shown in prior periods of market dislocation, we are willing to opportunistically purchase shares. Given our robust free cash flow generation and strong flexible balance sheet, we are well positioned to deploy capital in both strategic acquisitions and opportunistic share purchases.\nNow let me share our views on the rapidly evolving trade conflict and how AMETEK is approaching this period of heightened uncertainty. Taking a step back, during the first quarter, we saw improving order patterns and generally solid conditions across most markets and geographies. While there was still some cautiousness from customers, conditions were improving, and we were encouraged with our start to the year.\nWith the introduction of the tariffs in early April and subsequent back and forth trade negotiations over the past month, the level of uncertainty around trade policy and its implications have increased. Although it is impossible to know how these trade conflicts will evolve, we are confident in our ability to successfully navigate an uncertain and changing economic environment.\nOur distributed operating structure empowers local teams to respond quickly and appropriately to the unique dynamics of their businesses, markets, supply chains and customers. This level of flexibility is a meaningful advantage in the dynamic environment such as the current one. Our portfolio of highly differentiated products and mission-critical applications will allow us to effectively pass through higher input costs, including tariffs while continuing to deliver strong margins and cash flows.\nOur broad exposure and diversification across end markets and geographies limit our dependence on any single customer, product, technology, supplier or region. This diversification is a strategic strength and help shield the entire company from a concentrated risk. Our large global manufacturing footprint and supplier base, along with our asset-light business model will allow us to localize production and adjust supply chains.\nAnd lastly, our strong balance sheet and outstanding cash flow generation provides us with the ability to continue playing offense through acquisitions and opportunistic share repurchases while also continuing to invest in our businesses. During the first wave of the China tariffs in 2018 during COVID and then again during the resulting supply chain basis, through high levels of economic uncertainty and each time our business has quickly reacted and strengthened decisions.\nOur business is robust by design and resilient by nature. We use periods of disruption to make our business stronger and more efficient. We use our strong cash flows and balance sheet to better position AMETEK for accelerated growth following the period of uncertainty. We are confident we can do the same in this environment.\nMore specifically, our businesses have responded quickly and have developed terraces plans, which include specific mitigation actions to offset the impact from tariffs. These mitigation actions include select pricing initiatives, localization of production operations, adjustments to our supply chain and targeted productivity actions.\nWe are also finding opportunities created by the tariffs to take advantage of our substantial U.S. manufacturing footprint to broaden our customer base and support their growth in the U.S. While uncertainty has increased as a result of the global trade dynamics, we believe we can offset tariff headwinds through the implementation of these mitigation actions.\nAs a result, we continue to expect full year sales to be up low single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2024. We also continue to expect diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $7.2 to $7.18, up 3% to 5% compared to last year's results. We expect the benefits from these various mitigating actions to build throughout their. We remain confident in our full year outlook and our ability to deliver strong results in 2025.\nIn summary, AMETEK delivered strong results to start the year. Our businesses executed exceptionally well, delivering strong margins, solid orders growth and earnings ahead of our expectations. The durability of the AMETEK Road bottle, combined with our diversified market exposures, outstanding cash flows improvement management capabilities position us well to navigate through these uncertain economic times.\nWe remain focused on delivering long-term growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. I will now turn it over to Dalip, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip?\n\nDalip Mohan Puri\n\nSenior Vice President of Operational Finance\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered a strong start to the year, highlighted by excellent operating performance, robust core margin expansion and strong free cash flow conversion. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the first quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $28 million, up $1.5 million from the prior year.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect general and administrative expenses to be up modestly versus 2024 levels and to remain at approximately 1.5% of sales. First quarter other operating expenses in dollars compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to lower interest and investment income. First quarter interest expense was $19 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, in line with the first quarter of 2024. For 2025, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. As we have stated in the past, actual and quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter were $23 million. And for the full year, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $155 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $106 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $410 million including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $203 million or $0.88 per diluted share.\nOperating working capital in the first quarter was 18.1% of sales. That compares to 18.7% in last year's first quarter. Operating cash flow was $418 million up 2% versus the first quarter of 2024, while free cash flow of $394 million, up 3% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was strong at 112% in the quarter. For 2025, we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 115% of net income.\nTotal debt at March 31 was $1.9 billion, down from $2.1 billion at the end of 2024. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $399 million. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.7x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and our active acquisition pipeline.\nWhile acquisitions remain our #1 capital allocation priority for use of our free cash flow, we also seek to provide value to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and a consistently increasing dividend. In February, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.31 per share, our sixth consecutive year of 10% plus annual increases in our dividend payout.\nAdditionally, AMETEK's Board of Directors approved a $1.25 billion share repurchase authorization in February that provides us with added flexibility to enhance shareholder value. In summary, our businesses delivered strong results to start the year. Our proven operating capabilities drove strong earnings, robust margin expansion and outstanding free cash flow conversion.\nWith a proven strategy, significant capital deployment capacity and a strong track record of execution, we're confident in our positioning to navigate current trade uncertainties and drive growth and value creation in 2025. I'll now pass it to you, Ken.\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dalip. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions?"

Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open it up for questions, and I'll turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, highlighted by robust margin expansion, outstanding cash flow generation, strong organic orders growth and double-digit growth in earnings per share. In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, EBITDA and diluted earnings per share as well as for operating cash flow and free cash flow.\nWe also repurchased $155 million in shares during the quarter. And this morning, we announced the acquisition of Current Micro technique for approximately EUR 105 million. Our performance this quarter marks the combination of a strong year in which we leverage the proven strength of our operating model to deliver outstanding results despite a challenging economic environment. Now let me turn to our fourth quarter results.\nFourth quarter sales were a record $1.76 billion, up 2% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 3%, acquisitions added 5 points in the quarter and foreign currency was flat. Orders were solid in the quarter with organic orders up 4% versus the prior year, with positive organic growth across both our EIG and EMG segments, and we ended the quarter with a strong backlog of $3.4 billion. AMETEK's operating performance in the fourth quarter was excellent. Operating income in the quarter was a record, $469 million, a 5% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 26.6% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year. While core margins, which exclude the dilutive impact from acquisitions, were up a sizable [ 140 basis points ] [indiscernible] in quarter was a record $561 million, up 7% versus the prior year with EBITDA margin -- with EBITDA margin an impressive, 31.9%. This operating performance led to a robust cash generation with free cash flow of record $498 million in the quarter, 4% versus last year's fourth quarter, and free cash flow to net income conversion of 129%.\nDiluted earnings per share were a record $1.87, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.81 to $1.86 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG delivered outstanding performance in the fourth quarter with impressive margin expansion and operating margin levels that reflect the high quality of our businesses.\nEIG sales were $1.21 billion, down 2% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were down 3%, and acquisitions added 1 point. Growth was strongest across our Aerospace & Defense businesses, while our advanced optical metrology businesses Zygo, also saw solid growth in the quarter. Similar to last year, our EIG businesses experienced some project delays in the fourth quarter as customers remain cautious at year-end. We view these as temporary delays as the new project pipeline remains strong. EIG operating income was a record $386.6 million, up 8% versus the prior year, and operating margins were also a record 31.8%, up a robust 280 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with strong operating performance.\nEMG's fourth quarter sales were [ $54 million the ] prior year, with organic sales down 4%. Strong performance in our Aerospace & Defense businesses was offset by weakness in our OEM exposed businesses, which continued to face headwinds from inventory destocking. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $111.2 million, down 1% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's fourth quarter operating margins were 20.3%.\nNow the full year. Overall performance was strong in 2024 as we established annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.94 billion, up 5% from 2023. Operating income for 2024 was $1.81 billion, up 6% and operating margins were 26.1% for the full year, up 20 basis points from the prior year, with core margins up 120 basis points. EBITDA for the year was $2.18 billion, up 8%, with EBITDA margins a very strong 31.4%.\nFull year 2024 earnings were $6.83 per diluted share, up 7% versus the prior year. We also delivered exceptional cash flows in 2024 with free cash flow up 6% versus the prior year and free cash flow to net income conversion of very strong 124%. AMETEK's performance in 2024 underscores the quality of our businesses, the flexibility of our operating model and the outstanding contributions from all AMETEK colleagues. Our teams navigated a complex economic environment and deliver strong results while also ensuring AMETEK is well positioned for long-term success. Now turning to cattle deployment and acquisitions. As noted in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $155 million in shares, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to approximately $220 million.\nWhile our top priority for capital deployment remains acquisitions. Our strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to also opportunistically repurchase shares. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we acquired current Micro technique, which we announced this morning. [indiscernible] is a leading manufacturer of high-precision machine and optical inspection solutions that achieve industry-leading accuracy and surface finish. Kern's highly engineered solutions help customers produce highly complex and precise components used in semiconductor, med tech space and other high-tech industries. Kern is a strong strategic fit with our Ultra Precision Technologies business, expanding our existing capabilities and also high precision manufacturing and opening up new opportunities to serve customers with growing demands for miniaturization and accuracy.\nHeadquartered near Munich, Germany earned annual sales of approximately EUR 50 million. I'm excited to welcome all current colleagues of the AMETEK family. Looking ahead to 2025, we are managing a strong pipeline of high-quality acquisition candidates. We have a healthy and flexible balance sheet, providing us the opportunity to deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. With our robust balance sheet, significant financial capacity and disciplined approach to capital deployment, AMETEK is well positioned to continue driving long-term value through our acquisition strategy.\nIn addition to acquisitions, we continue to invest in our businesses to best position them for long-term growth. In 2024, we invested approximately $90 million in incremental growth investments largely across research, development and engineering and sales and marketing functions to support their organic growth initiatives. We expect to invest approximately $85 million in incremental growth investments in 2025. These investments and initiatives have strengthened our leadership positions within our niche markets, helped open up new growth opportunities in attractive adjacent markets and accelerated our new product development and technology innovation. One such example of our technology innovation successes can be found in our latest innovation [indiscernible] winner at CAMECA. CAMECA's LEAP series of Adam Pro [indiscernible] provide 3D imaging and chemical composition characterization and materials at the nanoscale. Historically, the lead product line focused on material science and geology applications targeted at highly knowledgeable academic customers at PhD level. CAMECA determined that an enhanced productivity system with high sensitivity and improved yield will broaden the market and support both academic and industrial customers who put a premium on throughput, automation and analytical capability. This led to the development of THE new LEAP 6000 XR, which provides enhanced ease-of-use new automation features for data collection and improved analytical capabilities. With this new technology, Adam Pro tomography is now used to study nearly all classes of solid materials from the oldest minerals on earth for the most advanced aerospace alloys. As a result, new applications are emerging due to CAMECA's customer-centric approach to innovation.\nNow shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. We remain cautious as we start the year given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. However, we are encouraged by the strength in orders we experienced in the second half of the year, our strong backlog, our leading positions across a diverse set of markets, which are poised for improved growth and our significant capital available to deploy on strategic acquisitions. For 2025, we expect both overall and organic sales to increase low single digits on a percentage basis compared to 2024. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $7.02 to $7.18, up 3% to 5% compared to last year's results.\nFor the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be roughly flat versus the prior year first quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.67 to $1.69 per share, up 23% versus the prior year. Just to summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong finish to the year with solid performance in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strength of our portfolio and our ability to execute our growth strategy in a sluggish macro environment. Our differentiated technologies and deep industry expertise continue to position us well in attractive niche markets, providing a solid foundation for future growth. With a focus on innovation, operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation, we are confident in our ability to drive continued growth and create long-term value for our shareholders in 2025 and beyond.\nI will now turn it over to Dalip Puri, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we will be glad to take your questions. Dalip?\n\nDalip Mohan Puri\n\nSenior Vice President of Operational Finance\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had a strong finish to 2024, establishing records for sales, operating income, earnings per share and cash flow in the quarter. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2025. Starting with general and administrative expenses.\nFourth quarter G&A expenses were $28.9 million, up $2.5 million from the prior year. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up approximately $5 million. As a percentage of sales, G&A expense was 1.5%, in line with 2023 levels. For 2025, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales. Fourth quarter other operating expenses were down $1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 due to lower due diligence costs.\nFor 2025, we expect other operating expenses to be largely in line with 2020 full level. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 12.8%, down from 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to statute expirations. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 17.3%, which was in line with our guidance range of 17% to 17.5%. For 2025, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, PAUSE from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the fourth quarter and $127 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to be approximately $155 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $96, and for the full year was $383 million. In 2025, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $194 million or $0.83 per diluted share.\nFor the quarter, operating working capital was 16.8% of sales. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was a record at $550 million, up 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Free cash flow was also a record in the quarter. up 4% to $498 million with excellent free cash flow conversion of 129% for the quarter. Free cash flow for 2024 was a record $1.7 billion, up 6% versus the prior year, with full year free cash flow conversion also very strong at 124% of net income. For 2025, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 115%. Total debt at year-end was $2.1 billion, down $1.2 billion from the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $374 million. As Dave noted, we spent approximately $155 million on share repurchases in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases for the year to approximately $220 million.\nAdditionally, subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately EUR 105 million on the acquisition of current Micro technique. At the end of 2024, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity, with approximately $2.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our acquisition strategy and growth initiatives.\nIn summary, we delivered strong fourth quarter and full year 2024 operating results, highlighted by record earnings, robust margins and excellent cash flow generation. With a proven strategy, significant capital deployment capacity and a strong track record of execution, we are well positioned to navigate current trade uncertainties and to drive growth and value creation in 2025.

Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered solid results with a strong operating performance in the second quarter against the backdrop of a more subdued global growth environment. In the quarter, we experienced continued headwinds from inventory destocking across our OEM customer base, leading to lower-than-expected sales volumes.\nAdditionally, we are seeing signs of customers turning more cautious leading to some temporary delays in project spending. Despite these headwinds, our businesses delivered strong operating performance in the quarter, we saw the growth in cash flow and earnings and robust core margin expansion reflecting the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK operating model. We expect the inventory destocking and more cautious customer behavior to continue in the back half of the year. As a result, we are adjusting our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate these near-term headwinds.\nAs we've done in the past, we will expand our focus on operational efficiencies and continue to invest back in our businesses utilize our strong balance sheet to deploy capital on strategic acquisitions and ensure we position AMETEK for continued long-term growth. [Audio Gap]\nSales in the quarter sales in the second quarter were $1.73 billion, up 5% from the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down 2%. Acquisitions added 8 points in the quarter and foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was excellent with robust margin expansion. Operating income in the quarter was a record $448 million, a 7% increase over the second quarter of 2023.\nOperating margins were 25.8% in the quarter, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a sizable 180 basis points in the quarter. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $545 million, up 10% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins in impressive 31.4%. Cash flow in the quarter was excellent, reflecting our operating capability and asset-light business model.\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was up 14% to $381 million with free cash flow up 17% and free cash flow conversion of 107%. This operating performance led to earnings of $1.66 per diluted share, up 6% versus the second quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.63 to $1.65 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level.\nFirst, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG delivered strong operating performance with outstanding margin expansion. EIG sales were $1.15 billion, a 2% increase from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were flat and acquisitions contributed 2 points. Growth was strongest within our Aerospace and Defense and CAMECA businesses in the quarter. EIG operating income was $350 million, up 14% versus the prior year and operating margins were at 30.3%, up 320 basis points from the prior year.\nOur EIG businesses are operating at a very high level with excellent operating margins. They remain well positioned to benefit from a number of important long-term secular growth drivers, given their increasing exposures to attractive markets across process, aerospace, power and energy markets. The Electric material group continues to navigate the impacts of the inventory normalization across our automation and engineered solutions businesses.\nIn the quarter, EMG sales were a record $81 million, a 14% increase compared to the prior year, driven by contributions from the acquisition of Paragon Medical. Organic sales declined 6% due to weakness in our automation and Engineered Solutions businesses, more than offsetting solid growth across our EMG Aerospace and Defense businesses.\nAcquisitions contributed 20% in the quarter. Operating income for the second quarter was $123 million, with operating margins at 21.2%, while core operating income margins were 25%. As we have noted for a number of quarters, OEM customers across a wide range of markets are reducing excess inventory built up during the supply chain prices. While we had expected to see conditions approved in the second half of the year, we now believe demand within this OEM customer base will remain subdued at current levels through the end of 2024.\nThis inventory normalization is also impacting our medical OEM businesses, including Paragon Medical, leading to near-term delays in orders and shipments. Paragon remains very well positioned for strong growth once the inventory correction is complete, given their leadership position across a number of high-growth med tech market segments. Additionally, Paragon has won a new programs that we're currently investing in, which will drive incremental growth in 2025 and beyond.\nAs we noted last quarter, we are leveraging our proven integration capabilities to drive meaningful operational improvements to best position Paragon for long-term success. As the volumes return following destocking, we believe the business will be levered to deliver outstanding sales growth and profitability.\nIn summary, we are operating our businesses very well with 7% growth in operating income and 180 basis points of core margin expansion in the quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flow with 17% free cash flow growth in the quarter. And for the full year, we expect free cash flow to net income conversion to be between 110% and 120%. The strength of AMETEK's operational excellence strategy is evident in our operating results. We continue to drive efficiency improvements across our businesses by leveraging our global infrastructure and OpEx initiatives. And this year, we now expect to generate $140 million in savings.\nWe also remain committed to investing back into our businesses. And this year, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in growth, largely focused on research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index, which was a strong 24% in the quarter.\nAdditionally, our strong free cash flow and flexible balance sheet provides us with ample financial capacity for strategic acquisitions. Our pipeline of acquisition opportunities remain strong. AMETEK is very well positioned to continue to expand our portfolio of highly differentiated businesses that both our organic growth investments and our acquisition strategy. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nWith destocking expected to continue through the balance of the year and some customers turning more cautious on project spending, we are adjusting our sales and earnings guidance for the full year. Overall sales are now expected to be up 5% to 7% versus the prior year, with organic sales expected to be flat to down low single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.70 to $6.80, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results.\nThis is less than a 1% reduction from our prior earnings guidance range of $6.74 to $6.86 as our proactive productivity actions, along with a lower expected fourth quarter tax rate helped offset the impact of the reduced sales forecast. This guidance reflects second half sales and operating earnings, essentially in line with our first half results.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with earnings in the range of $1.60 to $1.62 per share, down 1% to 2% versus the prior year. In summary, we are pleased with our business's strong operating performance in the second quarter. We have a proven operating model and an experienced management team, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the sluggish demand environment and deliver exceptional long-term results. I will now turn it over to Dalip Puri, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions.\n\nDalip Mohan Puri\n\nSenior Vice President of Operational Finance\n\nThank, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave noted, AMETEK had a solid second quarter with excellent operating performance leading to outstanding margin expansion and strong cash flows. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter. Second quarter general and administrative expenses were $25 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's second quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales.\nSecond quarter interest expense was $31 million, up $12 million from the second quarter of 2023 due to higher debt balances following the acquisition of Paragon Medical in December. Second quarter other expense was down approximately $4 million versus the prior period, due largely to higher pension income and higher investment income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 19%, up from 18.2% in the second quarter of 2023.\nFor 2024, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 17% and 18%, driven by a lower fourth quarter tax rate due to statute expirations. As we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from the full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $21 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $150 million for the full year or about 2% of sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $99 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million. This includes after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 18.6% of sales. Operating cash flow was $381 million, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2023. While free cash flow was $360 million, up 17% over the prior year.\nFor the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 107% of net income. For the full year, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at June 30 was $2.65 billion. down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $397 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.2x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1x.\nWe have significant financial capacity and flexibility with $2.2 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and to deploy on strategic acquisitions. In summary, AMETEK had a solid second quarter of 2024, delivering strong results with robust margin expansion and excellent free cash flows.\nOur leading positions across attractive market segments Combined with our strong balance sheet and outstanding operating capabilities leaves us very well positioned to navigate the current environment and to deliver on our growth strategies. Kevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Dalip. Can we please open the lines for questions?"

Welcome to AMETEK's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Julia. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. We today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dalip PurI, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations.\nA detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. Any references made on this call to 2023 or 2024 results or 2024 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization and excluding the pretax $29.2 million or $0.10 per diluted share charge in the first quarter for integration costs related to the Paragon Medical acquisition. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open the call for questions.\nI'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2024 with outstanding operating performance leading to double-digit growth in earnings per share. During the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income and EBITDA and deliver robust core margin expansion and excellent cash flows. Considering our first quarter results and the positive outlook for the back half of the year, we are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. AMETEK's continued success is a testament to the strength and resiliency of our growth model, the quality of our businesses and the outstanding contributions from all AMETEK colleagues. Now let me turn to our first quarter results.\nSales in the first quarter were $1.74 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2023. Organic sales were down slightly. Acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency had a small positive impact. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96, and we ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.46 billion near record levels. AMETEK's operating performance at the start of the year was excellent. Operating income in the quarter was a record $446 million, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2023. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, core margins were up a very strong 180 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $542 million up 13% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 31.2%. This outstanding performance led to earnings of $1.64 per diluted share up 10% versus the first quarter of 2023 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.60.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a strong start to the year with tremendous operating performance leading to record operating margins and impressive margin expansion. Sales for EIG were $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 4% from the first quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 1% and acquisitions added 3 points. Growth in the quarter remained strongest across our Aerospace and Defense and Materials Analysis businesses.\nEIG's operational execution in the first quarter was superb with strong profit and exceptional operating margin expansion. Operating income was $353 million, up 14% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were a record 30.5%, up a robust 280 basis points. This level of operating margin speaks to the quality and leadership positions of our highly differentiated businesses. The Electromechanical Group also delivered solid first quarter operating performance despite the headwinds from inventory normalization impacting some of our EMG businesses. EMG's first quarter sales were a record $579 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by contributions from recent acquisitions of Paragon Medical and Bison Engineering. First quarter operating income was $120 million, while core operating income margins were 24.1% in the quarter.\nOur first quarter results reflect the unique capabilities of our growth model to successfully manage short-term market headwinds and deliver robust margin expansion, outstanding cash flow and strong double-digit earnings growth. Our businesses remain focused on executing our strategic initiatives and delivering differentiated technology solutions to support our customers' most complex challenges. Our distributed operating structure enables flexibility in responding to market dynamics, while our robust cash flow and balance sheet provide ample support for our acquisition strategy.\nThis acquisition strategy along with our organic growth initiatives is expanding AMETEK's presence within high-growth markets. These markets include med tech, clean energy, electrification and aerospace and defense and help ensure our diverse portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on these attractive long-term secular growth areas. We remain committed to investing across our businesses to accelerate new product development and expand our sales and marketing efforts. In 2024, we expect to invest an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives with a sizable portion of this in support of our research, development and engineering efforts. The effectiveness of these investments is reflected in our vitality index which was a strong 25% in the first quarter.\nAMETEK's commitment to invest in RD&E and continuously innovate ensures a steady stream of new products that support our customers' critical applications and position us for continued success. I wanted to take a moment to highlight an example of how the elements of the AMETEK growth model work together to deliver exceptional results. AMETEK Zygo, a global leader in the design and manufacturer of advanced optical metrology systems and ultraprecise optical components was recently awarded AMETEK's Dr. John H. Luxoward, an annual award provided to the AMETEK business that best exemplifies the commitment to continuous improvement and achievements and operational excellence.\nAs part of its market expansion strategy, Zygo identified an attractive new market segment, virtual and augmented reality applications as a compelling growth opportunity, for their advanced optical metrology systems. This led to Zygo's new product development and commercial teams working closely together to advance their technology capabilities and commercialize as a solution to support the highly precise requirements of this application. The success of this work resulted in strong demand and the need for Zygo to meaningfully increase production. Utilizing cross-functional teams and deploying tools like value stream mapping, and Lean Six Sigma, they achieved a remarkable threefold increase in production output, allowing them to meet the growing demand for the metrology solution.\nThis achievement highlights the synergy between our new product development, global market expansion and operational excellence strategies to help identify, develop and deliver exceptional technology solutions to address an important market need and accelerate growth. Congratulations to the Zygo team for a job well done. Now switching to our acquisition strategy. The acquisitions we completed in 2023 are integrating nicely into AMETEK. We are leveraging our proven integration capabilities and our global infrastructure to help accelerate their growth, drive operational improvements and deliver strong returns. We are very excited about these acquisitions as they are expanding our market presence in attractive growth markets, including the medtech space through the Paragon Medical acquisition.\nParagon Medical, which we acquired in December, is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Paragon has an outstanding brand, leading innovation and design capabilities and a strong position serving a number of high-growth market segments. Our integration efforts are focused on supporting and accelerating this growth, while also leveraging AMETEK's infrastructure and operational excellence capabilities to drive efficiency improvements.\nThe integration charge we took in the first quarter will allow us to drive these improvements and better position Paragon for accelerated growth and profitability. Looking ahead, our acquisition pipeline remains robust, and we are actively working on multiple opportunities. We have the balance sheet and financial capacity to deploy meaningful capital on strategic acquisitions. We look forward to delivering continued value to our shareholders through strategic acquisitions and prudent capital deployment. Now turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect the impact of inventory normalization to continue through the first half of the year with improvements in the second half of the year as we indicated on our last earnings call.\nAs a result, for the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.74 to $6.86, up 6% to 8% compared to last year's results, an increase from the previous guidance range of $6.70 to $6.85. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with earnings of $1.63 to $1.65, up 4% to 5% versus the prior year.\nIn summary, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter with earnings growth, which exceeded our expectations, driven by exceptional operating performance. We are encouraged by these results and remain confident in our ability to navigate the current environment and benefit from improved sales growth in the back half of 2024. We are confident in the future of AMETEK has our world-class talent and the adaptability of the AMETEK road model will continue to drive long-term sustainable success for our stakeholders.\nI will now turn it over to Dalip Puri who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Dalip?\n\nDalip Mohan Puri\n\nSenior Vice President of Operational Finance\n\nThank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong first quarter with record level sales and exceptional operating performance, highlighted by strong core margin expansion and free cash flow conversion. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the first quarter. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.4 million or 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's first quarter. For fiscal year 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales.\nFirst quarter interest expense was $35 million, up $15 million from the prior year first quarter due to higher debt balances outstanding following the December 2023 acquisition of Paragon Medical. Other operating expenses were down $5 million primarily due to higher interest income and higher pension income compared to the prior year's first quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.9%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2023. For 2024, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%.\nAs we have stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $28 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $160 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $98 million. In 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share.\nOperating working capital in the first quarter was 18.7% of sales. Operating cash flow was $410 million, up 6% versus the first quarter of 2023, while free cash flow was $383 million, up 4% over the prior year. For the quarter, free cash flow conversion was a strong 123% of net income. For the remainder of 2024, we continue to expect strong free cash flow conversion in the range of 110% and 120% of net income. Total debt at March 31 was $2.9 billion, down from $3.3 billion at the end of 2023.\nOffsetting this debt it's cash and cash equivalents of $374 million. At the end of the first quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and available credit facilities to support our growth initiatives and our active acquisition pipeline.\nWhile acquisitions remain our #1 priority for use of our free cash flow, we also seek to opportunistically repurchase our shares and provide our shareholders with a consistently increasing dividend. And in February, we announced a 12% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.28 per share, our fifth consecutive year of 10% plus annual increases.\nIn summary, our businesses delivered strong results to start the year with outstanding operating performance, leading to robust core margin expansion and excellent free cash flow.\nKevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dalip. Julie, can we please open the lines for questions? ."

We'll begin today's call with prepared remarks, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into the financial results for the quarter, it is with mixed emotions that I share the news of changes in our financial leadership, which we announced on January 16.\nAfter an outstanding 36-year career at AMETEK, our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Burke, has decided to embark on a well-deserved retirement effective April 2, 2024. Bill's tremendous leadership of our finance organization and his strategic guidance has been instrumental in AMETEK's long-term growth and success. His legacy is deeply woven into the fabric of our organization, and we express our heartfelt gratitude for his exceptional contributions.\nIn light of this transition, I'm delighted to announce the appointment of Dalip Puri as our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dalip, currently serving as Senior Vice President, Operational Finance, brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role. Dalip joined AMETEK in 2017 as Treasurer and subsequently took on the role of Group Controller, providing financial oversight for over half of AMETEK's businesses before transitioning into his current role of Operational Finance.\nDalip's leadership of key financial initiatives at AMETEK, along with a proven track record make him the natural choice to lead our financial organization into the future. I'm confident that under Dalip's leadership, our financial organization will continue to thrive contributing significantly to the success of AMETEK. To ensure a seamless transition, Bill will stay on as a senior adviser until April 2025. Thank you, Bill, for your exceptional service, and congratulations Dalip. I'm truly excited about the future.\nNow let me turn to this quarter's results. AMETEK delivered exceptional performance in the fourth quarter, delivering record results and outstanding operational execution, leading to results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we set records for sales, operating income, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flow. We also ended the quarter with record backlog.\nFurthermore, in the quarter, we successfully deployed over $2 billion on strategic acquisitions, enhancing our portfolio with the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. These results cap a record year for acquisitions and underscore the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our businesses and the success of our organic growth initiatives. AMETEK's continued success is also the result of the dedicated efforts of our global employees. I want to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your efforts and significant contributions in 2023.\nNow let me turn to our fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.73 billion, up 6.5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was approximately 1.5%. Acquisitions added 4 points and foreign currency added 1 point. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.53 billion which is up 10% from the start of 2023. AMETEK's operational performance in the quarter was outstanding, with robust margin expansion and strong incremental margins.\nOperating income in the quarter was a record $445 million, a 12% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.7% in the quarter, up an impressive 120 basis points from the prior year while core margins were up 200 basis points in the quarter. This strong margin expansion reflects the strength and flexibility of our operating model and the quality and differentiation of our businesses.\nEBITDA in the quarter was a record $526 million, up 8% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins an impressive 30.4%. Our strong growth and operating performance led to robust cash generation with free cash flow up 47% in the quarter to a record $481 million. This tremendous operating performance led to record diluted earnings per share of $1.68, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.61 to $1.63 per share.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments grew by an excellent quarter with strong sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.24 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added 3 points with currency accounting for the balance. EIG sales growth in the fourth quarter was strongest across our Aerospace & Defense businesses and our Materials Analysis division.\nEIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and exceptional margin expansion. Operating income was a record $359 million, up 17% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 29%, up and outstanding 250 basis points from the prior year. The Electromechanical Group also finished the year with strong performance despite the continued impact from the normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base.\nFourth quarter sales for EMG were $495 million, up 6% versus the prior year, driven by the contributions from recent acquisitions. EMG's fourth quarter operating income was $112 million, while operating margin -- operating income margins were 22.7% in the quarter. Excluding the dilutive impact from acquisitions, EMG core margins were up 100 basis points versus the prior year.\nNow for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2023, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.6 billion, up 7% from 2022. Organic sales increased 4%, with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. Operating income for 2023 was $1.7 billion, up 14% and operating margins were 25.9% for the full year, with margins up 150 basis points versus the prior year.\nEBITDA for the year was $2 billion with EBITDA margins are very strong 30.5%. In full year 2023, earnings were $6.38 per diluted share up 12% versus the prior year. Our performance in the fourth quarter and full year highlights the strength of the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are strategically aligned with diverse and attractive markets while our organic growth initiatives position us for sustained long-term growth.\nOur distributed operating structure empowers our businesses to execute on our growth strategies and quickly adapt to evolving market dynamics. This structure is a cornerstone of the success and navigating throughout different economic cycles. Furthermore, our asset-light business model and strong operational execution result in exceptional cash flow generation. This robust cash flow, coupled with our strong balance sheet, provides AMETEK with plenty of firepower to support our growth initiatives and to deploy on acquisitions.\nSpeaking of acquisitions, we were very active in 2023, successfully deploying approximately $2.25 billion on 5 acquisitions, including the acquisitions of Amplify Research and Paragon Medical in the fourth quarter. I'm very excited to welcome all acquired companies to AMETEK. Each acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK as they help expand our product and technology offerings and highly attractive growth markets and applications including renewable energy development and the modernization of the Power group.\nIn addition, our latest acquisition, Paragon Medical, which we closed in the middle of December, nicely expands our presence in the medical technology market. Paragon is a leading manufacturer specializing in highly engineered medical components and single-use and consumable surgical instruments. Their product portfolio spans crucial medical applications and the reputation for quality and precision has earned on the trust of a diverse customer base, including top-tier medical device OEMs.\nLooking ahead to 2024. Our acquisition pipeline remains robust. As noted, we have a strong and flexible balance sheet and anticipate remaining active deploying capital and acquisitions. In addition to our acquisition strategy, AMETEK remains committed to making strategic investments in organic growth initiatives. In 2023, we invested an incremental $100 million in growth initiatives. And in 2024, we expect to invest another incremental $100 million. The majority of this investment will be within our research, development and engineering and sales and marketing functions.\nIn the quarter, our vitality index, which reflects sales from new products introduced in the last 3 years was a very healthy 29%. Through these strategic investments and acquisitions, we have seen a steady transition of AMETEK's portfolio, with an expanded presence in secular growth markets and reduced exposures in more cyclical markets. This strategic evolution of the portfolio, combined with our proven operational acumen, positions AMETEK well for continued strong and sustained growth. Now shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. For 2024, we expect overall sales to be up low double digits on a percentage basis with low to mid-single-digit organic sales growth.\nDiluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.85, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up low double digits with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.60 per share, up 5% to 7% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout the full year of 2023 was outstanding. Our businesses delivered exceptional results with all elements of the AMETEK growth model, playing a key role in our success.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. I appreciate your kind words at the top of the call. As Dave noted, I have made the decision to retire after 36 years with AMETEK, nearly 8 of which I had the privilege of serving as Chief Financial Officer. I want to express my deepest gratitude and thanks to the entire AMETEK family for the incredible journey we've shared. It has been an honor to contribute to the tremendous growth and success of AMETEK.\nTo Dave and the Board of Directors, thank you for your confidence in me. Your support and leadership have been invaluable. And to my colleagues, your dedication has been the driving force behind our share of success and I am truly thankful for the privilege of working closely with you. I look forward to remaining with the company as a senior adviser until April 2025 to ensure a seamless transition. I'm confident in Dalip's leadership and in the very strong and talented financial organization at AMETEK.\nBefore I get into the results for the fourth quarter, Dalip would like to say a few words. Dalip?\n\nDalip M. Puri\n\nThank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to meeting and working with all of you in the new future. I too want to express my thanks to Dave, to Bill, to the Board of Directors and the leadership team for their trust and confidence in me. It is an honor to serve as AMETEK's EVP and CFO and I'm very excited to lead AMETEK's incredible finance organization and to partner with Dave as we continue to deliver sustained and strong growth across our portfolio of businesses.\nI also want to express my thanks to Bill for his guidance and mentorship over the years and his commitment to a smooth transition. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Bill.\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dalip. Now on to the fourth quarter results. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2023 with outstanding operating performance leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2024.\nFourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $26.3 million, up $3 million from the prior year but unchanged at 1.5% of sales. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $7 million and as a percentage of sales were 1.5%, in line with 2022 levels. In 2024, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.4% of sales. Fourth quarter other income and expense was additional expense, $7 million compared to the fourth quarter 2022, driven by higher due diligence costs and lower pension income.\nFor 2024, we expect other income and expense to be largely in line with 2023 levels. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.8%, down from 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to statute expirations. For 2024, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures were $60 million in the fourth quarter and $136 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be approximately $160 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $92 million, and for the full year was $338 million. 2024, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $400 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $190 million or $0.82 per diluted share.\nFor the quarter, operating working capital was 17.2% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was superb with operating cash flow of record of $541 million, up 40% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record in the quarter, up 47% to $481 million with free cash flow conversion of 140% for the quarter. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.6 billion, up 58% versus the prior year and 122% of net income. For 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion to be between 110% and 120% of net income.\nTotal debt at year-end was $3.31 billion, up from $239 [ million ] at the end of 2022 due largely to the Paragon acquisition in December. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $410 million. As Dave noted, during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $2 billion on the acquisitions of Amplifier Research and Paragon Medical. Our gross leverage was 1.5x at the end of 2023, up from 1.2x at the end of 2022, despite deploying approximately $2.25 billion on acquisitions during the year.\nWe remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital and have approximately $1.5 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives. In summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2023, delivering strong growth and a high quality of earnings. We are well positioned for continued growth and success in 2024.\nThank you once again, and now I'll turn it back to Kevin.\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill. Tanya, can we please open the line for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abigail. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\nWith me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nAny references made on this call to 2022 or 2023 results or to 2023 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.\nAMETEK delivered excellent results in the third quarter, highlighted by outstanding operational execution, superb margin expansion, strong cash flows and earnings ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for operating income, operating margins, earnings per share, EBITDA and cash flows. Given these strong results and our outlook for the balance of the year, we have, again, increased our earnings guidance for the full year.\nWe have also been very active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of United Electronics Industries and subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired Amplifier Research. Today, we also announced the signing of a definitive purchase agreement to acquire Paragon Medical, a highly attractive acquisition, which broadens our exposure in the medical technology space. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly.\nNow let me turn to our third quarter results. Third quarter sales were $1.62 billion, up 5% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was flat. Acquisitions added 4 points in the quarter and foreign currency added 1 point. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 0.96. We ended the quarter with a very strong backlog of $3.4 billion, near record levels and down a modest 2% sequentially. Our backlog is up 5% from last year's third quarter and up 23% or $640 million from the end of 2021.\nAMETEK's operating performance in the third quarter was exceptional. Operating income in the quarter was a record $438 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 27% in the quarter, up a sizable 220 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was also a record at $511 million, up 10% over the prior year, with EBITDA margin, an impressive 31.5%.\nOperating cash flow was up 45% in the quarter to a record $473 million. This outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.64 per diluted share, up 13% versus the third quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.56 to $1.58.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered impressive operating performance, with continued strong and broad-based sales growth. Sales for EIG were $1.14 billion in the quarter, up 8% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 3.5%, acquisitions added 3.5% and foreign currency added a point. EIG's organic sales growth remains broad-based and reflects our leading position across attractive market segments and the impact of our organic growth initiatives.\nGrowth in the quarter was particularly strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses as well as in our Zygo, Spectro and CAMECA businesses. Third quarter operating income was a record $335 million, up 23% versus the prior year. And operating margins were a record 29.5% in the quarter, up an impressive 360 basis points from the prior year. Tremendous work by our EIG businesses in the third quarter.\nThe Electromechanical Group also delivered solid operating performance in the quarter, despite the impact of normalization of inventory levels across our OEM customer base. EMG's third quarter sales were $487 million, down 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales down 8% in the quarter. Acquisitions added 4 points and foreign currency added 2 points. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $128 million, down 7% compared to the prior year period, while EMG's third quarter operating margins were a very solid 26.2%.\nOur performance in the third quarter and thus far in 2023, reflects the unique value inherent in the AMETEK growth model. Our differentiated businesses are aligned with diverse and attractive growth markets, while our organic growth initiatives continue to position us for long-term sustainable growth.\nOur distributed operating structure provides our businesses with the ability to execute their growth strategy and the flexibility to react quickly to changing market conditions. And our asset-light business model and strong operational execution drive outstanding cash flow generation, which we redeploy on value-enhancing acquisitions. This strong cash flow and our robust balance sheet are key differentiators for AMETEK in this higher interest rate environment.\nNow switching to our acquisition strategy. As noted, we have been very active in managing a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities. We are pleased to welcome our most recent acquisitions, United Electronic Industries and Amplifier Research. I'm pleased that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical. I will provide some more color on each of these businesses, starting with Paragon Medical.\nParagon Medical is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered medical components and instruments serving applications, including orthopedics, minimally invasive surgery, robotic surgery and drug delivery solutions. Paragon's broad product portfolio of single-use and implantable components are sold to a diverse blue-chip customer base of leading medical device OEMs.\nParagon is an excellent acquisition for AMETEK. It expands our presence in the med tech space and provides us with access to attractive new market segments with strong growth rates. We are acquiring Paragon in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.9 billion. Paragon has annual sales of approximately $500 million and is headquartered in Pierceton, Indiana. The closing of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory approvals.\nNow switching to United Electronic Industries, or UEI, which we acquired in August. UEI is a leading provider of ruggedized test, measurement, simulation and control solutions. UEI's custom products cater to diverse data acquisition needs from hardware in the loop testing, to aircraft simulators and automated testing systems and mission-critical applications.\nWith a strong presence in the defense, aerospace nuclear power generation and semiconductor, UEI nicely complements AMETEK's Power Systems and Instruments division, significantly expanding our data acquisition capabilities. UEI has annual sales of approximately $35 million and is based in Norwood, Massachusetts.\nNext, Amplifier Research is a leading provider of innovative RF and microwave solutions. Its equipment is used for electromagnetic compatibility testing within the defense, industrial, automotive, medical and communication sectors. Amplifier Research is an outstanding strategic acquisition and complementary fit with our existing compliance test solutions business. Their technical capability has broaden our RF instrumentation and testing portfolio.\nAmplifier Research is a growing business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for electric vehicle research, development and testing. Amplifier Research is based in Souderton, PA and has annual sales of approximately $60 million.\nOur acquisition pipeline remains very solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital in the coming quarters. AMETEK also remains committed to investing in our businesses to help position them for long-term sustainable organic growth.\nIn 2023, we plan to invest approximately $100 million in these growth initiatives, including our new product development efforts where our businesses continue to develop highly differentiated technologies to help solve our customers' most complex challenges.\nIn the quarter, our vitality index, which measures sales from products introduced over the prior 3 years, was a healthy 26%. As a complement to our internal new product development efforts, our ORTEC business recently acquired a small technology company, innoRIID, to help broaden their technology capabilities in the radiation detection market.\ninnoRIID, both cutting-edge technology expertise and an exceptional product development team known for their innovative solutions, having developed specialized artificial intelligence algorithms for radiation detection in a range of nuclear security, research, health and medical applications.\nNow turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With strong performance in the third quarter and a positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are, once again, raising our earnings guidance. For the full year, we continue to expect overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits, and we continue to expect organic sales to be up mid-single digits.\nDiluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.31 to $6.33, up approximately 11% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $6.18 to $6.26 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.61 to $1.63 per share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year.\nIn summary, AMETEK's third quarter results for 2023 were outstanding, with strong growth across our long-cycle businesses, record operating performance and strong acquisition activity. Our businesses continue to excel, driven by our differentiated technology solutions serving diverse and growing markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging economic environments, while actively deploying capital to enhance shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned for long-term sustainable growth.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter, with exceptional operating performance, robust margin expansion and strong cash flows. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.\nThird quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year, and as a percentage of sales, were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's third quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Other income and expense was a headwind of $9 million in the quarter, due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.7%, down from 19% in the third quarter of 2022, due to improved utilization of tax credits. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 18.5% and 19%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures in the third quarter were $29 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $330 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per share.\nOperating working capital in the third quarter was 19.1% of sales. Cash flow was excellent in the quarter with outstanding growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $473 million, up 45% versus the third quarter of 2022, while free cash flow was also a record at $444 million, up 49% over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 131% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion.\nTotal debt at September 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $842 million. At the end of the third quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.6x, leaving us with significant available cash and financial capacity to deploy on strategic acquisitions. As Dave has noted, we've been very active.\nDuring the third quarter, we deployed approximately $150 million on the acquisitions of UEI and innoRIID. And subsequent to the end of the quarter, we deployed approximately $105 million on the acquisition of Amplifier Research. Also subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire Paragon Medical for $1.9 billion, which would be our largest acquisition to date. Following the acquisition of Paragon, we would still have significant financial capacity with approximately $1.5 billion of cash in existing credit facilities available to support our growth initiatives.\nIn summary, AMETEK had exceptional results in the third quarter. We achieved significant margin expansion and delivered high-quality earnings. Our strong position in key market segments, coupled with a very strong backlog and exceptional operating capabilities, positions us well for continued success. Kevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Abigail, could we please open the lines for questions?"

Welcome to the AMETEK Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.\n[Operator Instructions]\nPlease be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin C.

Joining me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK achieved exceptional performance in the second quarter, marked by strong sales growth, outstanding operational execution, and record results ahead of our expectations. In the quarter, we established records for sales, operating income, operating margins, earnings per share, and EBITDA. We also ended the quarter with a record backlog.\nAMETEK's continued outstanding results reflect the strength of the AMETEK growth model, the quality of our niche differentiated businesses. The benefits from our organic growth initiatives and, most importantly, the outstanding efforts from our dedicated colleagues. Considering our strong second quarter results and the positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year.\nNow let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were $1.65 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was 5%. Acquisitions added 4 points in the quarter and foreign currency was flat. Our book-to-bill ratio in the second quarter was 1.01, our 12th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. As a result, we ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.44 billion up $220 million from the end of 2022 and up $1.6 billion or 91% from the end of 2020. Operating income in the quarter was a record $419 million. A 15% increase over the second quarter of 2022. Operating margins were 25.4% in the quarter, up an impressive 130 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $496 million, up 12% over the prior year, while EBITDA margins were also impressive at 30.1%.\nThis operating performance led to record earnings of $1.57 per diluted share, up 14% versus the second quarter of 2022 and above our guidance range of $1.49 to $1.51 per share. Now let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group had a great quarter with excellent sales growth and tremendous operating performance. Sales for EIG were $1.13 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the second quarter of last year. Organic sales were up a very strong 8% with acquisitions accounting for the balance of the growth. EIG sales growth in the second quarter was widespread across each of our divisions, with growth particularly strong in our Aerospace and Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses. EIG's operating performance was impressive with strong profit growth and margin expansion.\nOperating income was $307 million up 16% versus the prior year, while operating margins were 27.1%, up a robust 130 basis points from the prior year. The Electra [ Mechanical ] Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $511 million up 5% versus the prior year, driven by the acquisition of Bison Engineering, with organic sales roughly flat in the quarter. EMG's operating income in the quarter was $136 million up 10% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second quarter operating margins were excellent at 26.6%, up 100 basis points versus the prior year. While EMG's core operating margins was exclude acquisition dilution, we're up a sizable 180 basis points.\nOverall, AMETEK achieved outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, AMETEK's continued strong operating execution. Our strong results speak to the attractiveness and diversity of the end markets we serve. Our businesses hold leading positions in attractive niche market segments. Through our continued organic growth investments and strategic acquisitions, we are expanding our presence in market segments and niches aligned with strong secular growth drivers. As a result, our businesses are well positioned with differentiated solutions, to benefit from the meaningful and long-term investments in areas such as electrification, clean energy, health care efficiency and manufacturing reinsuring.\nIn addition to our alignment with strong growth markets, AMETEK has seen great success from our organic growth initiatives and investments. For all of 2023, we expect to spend over $100 million on incremental growth investments. These investments are largely focused on expanding our sales, marketing, and commercial excellence initiatives as well as broadening our research, development and engineering efforts. AMETEK's research development and engineering teams across our businesses consistently deliver innovative, and next-generation products tailored to meet the unique needs of our customers. While there are numerous examples across the company, I wanted to highlight our Abaco business unit for their outstanding accomplishments.\nAbaco is a leading provider of commercial off-the-shelf embedded computing systems for aerospace, defense and specialized industrial applications. Demand for [ Abaco ] solutions remains strong, given the position as a leading provider of ruggedized technology solutions with advanced thermal management capabilities. Abaco was awarded the best overall design for high-performance PCBAs at the recent Accelerator Technology Innovation Awards. Abaco also recently introduced a next-generation integrated computing and graphics car with the latest GPU technology. This provides our customers with advanced computing graphics processing and security capabilities required in AI-focused applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, radar signal processing and deep machine learning for autonomous systems.\nIn addition to Abaco, many other businesses are well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for high computing power and analytics. We recognize the pivotal role of organic growth initiatives and driving our overall growth strategy. These investments in organic growth, coupled with our market leadership and attractive market exposures position the company for continued success in driving sustainable long-term growth. Now switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. Over the last 3 quarters, we deployed approximately $530 million on the acquisition of 3 businesses: Navitar, RTDS and Bison Engineering.\nEach of these businesses is integrating nicely into AMETEK, and each is very well positioned to capitalize on attractive growth opportunities in their markets. Our acquisition pipeline remains very strong, and our businesses and internal M&A teams are actively managing a number of opportunities. AMETEK remains committed to leveraging our strong cash flow to pursue strategic acquisitions that align with our growth objectives. With a robust balance sheet and significant financial capacity, we are well positioned to support our acquisition strategy and capitalize on value-creating opportunities in the future.\nNow turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment continue to warrant caution in the short term, we are confident in our ability to navigate through these challenges and deliver strong results. Building upon our strong first half results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we are again increasing our earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up mid- to high single digits with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $6.18 to $6.26, up 9% to 10% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.96 to $6.10 per diluted share.\nFor the third quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid-single digits, with adjusted earnings of $1.56 to $1.58 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year. In summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses continued to deliver excellent performance, benefiting from differentiated technology solutions that cater to diverse and growing niche markets. The implementation of our organic growth initiatives has yielded higher levels of growth, while our portfolio remains aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets. Our asset-light business model and strong cash flows provide us with the flexibility to navigate challenging, environments while actively deploying capital to drive increased shareholder value.\nAs a result, AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth. I will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong second quarter with record level operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Now let me provide some additional financial highlights for the second quarter.\nSecond quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.5 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year, and as a percentage of sales were 1.5% versus 1.6% in last year's second quarter. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately 1.5% of sales, in line with last year's G&A to sales level. Second quarter other income and expense was a $6 million headwind versus the prior period due largely to lower pension income in the quarter. The effective tax rate was 18.2%, down slightly from the 18.5% in the second quarter of 2022. For 2023, we now anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter were $28 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $145 million for the full year or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per diluted share. Operating working capital in the second quarter was 19% of sales. Cash flow in the quarter was up meaningfully from the prior year.\nOperating cash flow was $335 million, up 42% from the prior year, and free cash flow was $307 million, up 47% from the second quarter of 2022. Free cash flow conversion was 95% in the quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect approximately 120% free cash flow to net income conversion. Total debt at June 30 was $2.2 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $606 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8x. We continue to have excellent financial capacity with approximately $2.9 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nIn summary, our businesses continue to deliver exceptional results in the second quarter of 2023. We delivered strong sales growth, achieved robust margin expansion and a high quality of earnings. Our leading positions across attractive market segments, record backlog and outstanding operating capabilities have positioned us well for continued success in the back half of the year.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK had an excellent start to 2023 with outstanding results in the first quarter. Continued solid demand across our diverse set of end markets led to strong sales and orders growth and another record backlog. Our business has delivered tremendous operating performance with record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter. Additionally, we generated record cash flows and deployed a portion of that cash flow on our first acquisition of the year, Bison Gear & Engineering.\nGiven these results and the outlook for the remainder of 2023, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance for the full year.\nNow let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.6 billion, up 10% over the same period in 2022. Organic sales growth was excellent at 9%. Acquisitions added 2 points, while foreign currency was a slight headwind. AMETEK's continued strong organic sales growth reflects the success of our organic growth initiatives and our leadership positions across diverse and attractive niche markets.\nDemand also remained solid with overall orders growing 6% in the quarter. Organic orders were up low single digits on a percentage basis against a difficult prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.13 in the quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $3.4 billion, an increase of over $200 million from the end of 2022.\nAs noted, AMETEK's operating performance in the first quarter was exceptional. Our operating income in the quarter was a record $405.5 million, a 15% increase over the first quarter of 2022. Operating margins were a record 25.4% in the quarter, up 120 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins, which exclude our acquisition dilution and the gain from a facility sale in the first quarter of 2022 were up an impressive 180 basis points with strong core margin expansion in each group.\nEBITDA in the quarter was $482 million, up 11% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 30.2%. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating model, the differentiation of our businesses and the great work of our teams. This tremendous operating performance led to a high quality of earnings with diluted earnings per share of $1.49, up 12% versus the prior first quarter of 2022, and above our guidance range of $1.38 to $1.42 per share.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. EIG delivered excellent sales growth and operating performance with sales up 13% versus the prior year to $1.12 billion. Organic sales were up 11%. Acquisitions added 3 percentage points with foreign currency, a slight headwind in the quarter. This strong organic sales growth remains broad-based across our businesses and geographies with growth particularly strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter.\nEIG's operating profit was impressive, resulting in a record operating profit in the quarter. Operating income was $309.7 million, up 27% versus the prior year, while EIG margins were 27.7%, up a robust 290 basis points from the prior year.\nThe Electromechanical Group also delivered excellent results in the quarter with solid organic sales growth and strong operating performance. EMG's first quarter sales were $479.9 million, up 2% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 4% in the quarter and foreign currency a 2-point headwind. Growth was notably strong across our Aerospace & Defense businesses in the quarter.\nEMG's operating income in the first quarter was $120.5 million, and operating margins were 25.1%. On a core basis, excluding acquisition dilution and the gain from a facility sale in the first quarter of 2022, EMG margins were up 50 basis points versus last year's first quarter.\nSo overall tremendous performance by our businesses and all AMETEK colleagues. All elements of the AMETEK growth model, operational excellence, global and market expansion, new product development and strategic acquisitions are working well. These strategies allow us to quickly react to changing market conditions, invest in our businesses for long-term growth and deploy our capital on value-enhancing acquisitions.\nNow switching to our capital deployment and acquisition strategy. The primary focus for our strong cash flow remains strategic acquisitions. We are managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates, and we have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity to support this strategy.\nI'm excited to announce our most recent acquisition, Bison Gear & Engineering. Bison is an excellent strategic fit with AMETEK's automation businesses, helping expand our presence within this attractive secular growth market. Bison is a leading provider of customized motion control solutions for use across a wide range of high-precision applications within the automation, food and beverage, power and transportation markets. Bison's portfolio of linear and motion control technology is highly complementary with existing technologies, providing an expanded product offering that enables wider and deeper market participation in attractive markets and applications, including growing electrification requirements.\nBison is based in St. Charles, Illinois, and has annual sales of approximately $80 million. In addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain focused on ensuring sustainable growth by investing in organic growth initiatives. This includes making strategic growth investments and driving broader adoption of growth has ends, digitalization and new product development.\nFor all of 2023, we now expect to invest approximately $100 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments in research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. One way we celebrate and recognize the great work of our businesses, new product development efforts is through the AMETEK Innovation Award. This award is provided annually to the AMETEK business who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded organic growth opportunity.\nThe most recent innovation award winner was our Creaform business for developing its innovative new handheld 3D metrology solution, PL3. Creaform, based in Levy, Canada, is a leading provider of 3D portable and automated measurement technologies for applications such as reverse engineering, quality control, product development and nondestructive testing. The introduction of PL3 further expands the breadth of Creaform's metrology offering and makes high-end 3D scanning accessible to professionals and small enterprises, opening up a new attractive market segment.\nIn addition to the PL3, Creaform also recently added a new scanner to their HandySCAN 3D platform, the HandySCAN BLACK Alete Limited. The latest addition to Creaform's flagship metrology-grade 3D scanners set a new industry standard for handheld devices. I would like to extend my congratulations to the entire Creaform team for their innovative new products and ongoing efforts to push into boundaries and metrology.\nNow turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. We remain cautious in the short term due to uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment. However, given the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage through these challenges. The company's record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid- and long-cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth.\nGiven our strong first quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are increasing our sales and earnings guidance. For the full year, we now expect overall sales to be up mid- to high-single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid-single digits, with organic sales expected to be up mid-single digits.\nDiluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.96 to $6.10, up 5% to 7% compared to last year's results. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.84 to $6 per diluted share. For the second quarter, we anticipate overall sales to be up mid- to high-single digits with earnings of $1.49 to $1.51 per share, up 8% to 9% versus the prior year.\nIn summary, AMETEK had an excellent first quarter. We delivered strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, a record backlog, record cash flows and increased our earnings guidance for the year. The company's differentiated technology solutions, market-leading positions in attractive markets and proven operating capabilities have allowed us to navigate through challenging economic cycles. Additionally, AMETEK's strong cash flows and robust balance sheet provide us meaningful flexibility to deploy capital to drive shareholder value. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK had an outstanding first quarter, positioning us well to start the year. We delivered record level operating performance and a high quality of earnings in the quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights. First quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $5 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense as well as the return to more normal levels of discretionary spending.\nFor 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales, below 2022 level of 1.5% of sales. Other income and expense was a headwind of $8 million in the quarter due largely to lower pension income and higher due diligence costs. The effective tax rate in the first quarter was 19.5% versus 19% in the first quarter of 2022. For 2023, we continue to anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter were $20 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $140 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $82 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $335 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $157 million or $0.68 per diluted share.\nOperating working capital in the first quarter was 19.2% of sales. Cash flow was outstanding in the quarter with sizable growth versus the prior year. Operating cash flow was a record $370 million, up 92% versus the first quarter of 2022. Free cash flow was also a record at $367 million, up 110% over the prior year. While free cash flow conversion was a very strong 120% of net income.\nTotal debt at March 31 was $2.25 billion, down from $2.4 billion at the end of 2022. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $400 million. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at the end of the first quarter was 1.1x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x.\nDuring the first quarter, we acquired Bison Gear & Engineering, and we remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have significant financial capacity with approximately $2.6 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nIn summary, our business has delivered exceptional results to start the year with strong organic sales growth, robust margin expansion and high-quality earnings. Kevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Chris, could we please open the lines for questions?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rocco. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nAny references made on this call to 2021 or '22 results or 2023 guidance will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased with AMETEK's results in the fourth quarter and for all of 2022. AMETEK's continued excellent performance reflects the quality of our niche differentiated businesses, the strength of the AMETEK growth model and the expanding impact of our organic growth initiatives and most importantly, the outstanding efforts of our global employees. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your many contributions to our success. We have navigated many challenges over the last few years, only to emerge stronger and even better positioned for sustained growth.\nOur results in the fourth quarter were outstanding. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and excellent operating performance led to a high quality of earnings, which exceeded our expectations in the quarter. We ended the year with a record backlog as demand remained solid across our diverse end markets. Organic growth was again very strong in the quarter as our teams are successfully driving key organic growth initiatives across their businesses and expanding their presence serving attractive growth markets. Operationally, we're performing exceptionally well and offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in strong margin expansion. Additionally, cash flow in the quarter was outstanding, providing us the flexibility to invest in our businesses and deploy capital on strategic acquisitions.\nNow on to the results of the fourth quarter and all of 2022. Fourth quarter sales were $1.63 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 9%. Acquisitions added 2 points and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind in the quarter. Orders were solid in the fourth quarter against a challenging comparison, resulting in a record backlog of $3.22 billion.\nOperating income in the quarter was a record of $398 million, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.5% in the quarter, up 50 basis points from the prior year. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $489 million, up 12% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were an impressive 30.1%. This outstanding operating performance led to record earnings of $1.52 per diluted share, up 11% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.45 to $1.47 per share.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered continued strong sales growth and excellent operating performance. Sales for EIG were a record $1.16 billion in the quarter, up 10% from the fourth quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 9%, acquisitions added 3% and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind. EIG growth was broad-based with particularly strong growth across our Aerospace & Defense and Ultra Precision Technologies businesses in the quarter. EIG's operating income in the fourth quarter was a record $307 million, up 10% versus the prior year while EIG margins were a very strong 26.5% in the quarter.\nThe Electromechanical Group also finished the year with outstanding performance. EMG's fourth quarter sales were $466 million, up 4% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 8% and foreign currency a 3-point headwind. Growth was again broad-based across EMG with our Aerospace & Defense businesses leading to growth. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $115 million, up 9% compared to the prior year period. EMG's fourth quarter operating margins were 24.6%, up an impressive 100 basis points versus the prior year.\nNow for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2022, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $6.15 billion, up 11% from 2021. Organic sales increased 11%, acquisitions added 2% and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind. Operating income for 2022 was $1.5 billion, up 15% and operating margins were 24.4%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, while core margins were up an impressive 130 basis points, reflecting our ability to successfully manage inflation and supply chain challenges.\nEBITDA for the year was $1.83 billion, up 15% from 2021 with EBITDA margins a very strong 29.7%, up 100 basis points from the prior year. Full year earnings were $5.68 per diluted share, up an impressive 17% versus the prior year.\nAMETEK's performance in a challenging operating environment highlights the proven strength and flexibility of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to successfully navigate through uncertain economic times. Our businesses continue to leverage the key elements of the AMETEK Growth Model to accelerate global growth, develop innovative new products and identify and execute on operational efficiency improvements. Additionally, our business has worked closely with our corporate development team to manage our acquisition pipeline, resulting in a continued strong deployment of capital on strategic acquisitions.\nIn 2021 and 2022 combined, we deployed over $2.4 billion in capital on 8 acquisitions and acquired over $600 million in annual sales. We expect to remain active in 2023 as our deal pipeline remains very strong and our balance sheet provides us significant financial capacity to deploy capital.\nIn addition to our acquisition strategy, we remain committed to investing in organic growth initiatives and are very pleased with the impact these investments are having on AMETEK's growth. As I highlighted during our last earnings call, AMETEK's portfolio has strategically evolved with increased exposure to higher-growth market segments. This portfolio evolution has been driven by our acquisition strategy and by the organic investments we are making in our businesses.\nIn 2023, we expect to invest an incremental $90 million in support of these growth initiatives, including investments across research, development and engineering and sales and marketing. One way we measure the success of these investments is through our Vitality Index, which was an outstanding 27% of sales in 2022.\nOur increased investments in RD&E continue to yield innovative advanced technology solutions, including within our Zygo business. Zygo, which is based in Middlefield, Connecticut, designs and manufacture advanced optical metrology systems and ultra-precise optical components and assemblies for a diverse set of end markets, including defense, research and semiconductor. Zygo partnered with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory National Ignition Facility to provide high-end precision optics in support of their inertial fusion energy testing program which provides a significant leap forward in the realization of sustainable fusion energy.\nAchieving these heights of energy production require the use of highly precise optics and scalable manufacturing processes which were developed in partnership with Zygo. I want to congratulate the Zygo team for their tremendous contributions supporting important advancements in research and technology.\nLastly, let me briefly touch on the supply chain issues and inflation. While tightness remains in certain areas, we are seeing improvements in the global supply chain and logistics. Additionally, although inflation remains elevated, we are seeing -- we are also seeing modest improvements versus levels experienced in 2022.\nAs we look ahead to 2023, we will continue to proactively manage our supply chain and remain confident in our ability to offset inflation with price increases.\nNow shifting to our outlook for the year ahead. While macroeconomic uncertainties remain, we are confident in the quality of our businesses, the flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model and our ability to navigate through these uncertain times. Additionally, given our record backlog and proven operating capability, we are confident in our outlook for 2023.\nFor 2023, we expect both overall and organic sales to be up mid-single digits versus 2022. Diluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.84 to $6, up 3% to 6% compared to last year's results. For the first quarter, we anticipate overall sales up mid-single digits, with adjusted earnings up $1.38 to $1.42, up 4% to 7% versus the prior year.\nIn summary, AMETEK's fourth quarter and full year results were excellent. Our record backlog, the strength and flexibility of the AMETEK Growth Model and a world-class workforce position us nicely for 2023.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had a very strong fourth quarter to complete an outstanding year.\nIn the quarter, we delivered record level operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the fourth quarter and for the full year, along with some additional guidance for 2023.\nFourth quarter general and administrative expenses were essentially flat versus the prior year. And for the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $6 million, driven largely by higher compensation costs. And as a percentage of sales, were 1.5% versus 1.6% of sales in 2021. For 2023, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly versus 2022 levels and remain at approximately 1.5% of sales.\nThe effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 18.9%, up from 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021. For 2023, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures were $58 million in the fourth quarter and $139 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be approximately $140 million or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $89 million and for the full year was $320 million. In 2023, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $325 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $154 million or $0.66 per diluted share.\nFor the quarter, operating working capital was 18.9% of sales. Cash flow in the fourth quarter was excellent with operating cash flow of $385 million, up 37% versus the fourth quarter of 2021, free cash flow was also up 37% to $327 million in the quarter, while free cash flow conversion was 106% of net income.\nTotal debt at year-end was $2.39 billion, down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $345 million and during the fourth quarter, we deployed approximately $240 million on the acquisition of RTDS Technologies. Gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio at year-end was 1.2x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x.\nAs Dave noted, we remain active on the acquisition front with a solid pipeline of acquisition candidates. Given our strong cash flow and modest levels of leverage, we are well positioned to deploy additional capital. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nIn summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout all of 2022, delivering strong growth and a high quality of earnings in a challenging operating environment. AMETEK is well positioned for 2023, given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce.\nKevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Rocco, can we please open the lines for questions?"

I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered record results in the third quarter, with stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operational execution leading to earnings above our expectations.\nOperationally, our businesses are performing exceptionally well and successfully offsetting inflation with price increases, resulting in impressive margin expansion. We are also seeing continued strong and broad-based demand across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record backlog of $3.2 billion.\nAnd this morning, we announced the acquisition of two excellent businesses, Navitar and RTDS Technologies, expanding our presence in high-end precision optics and in testing solutions for the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. I will provide more details on these acquisitions shortly.\nGiven our results in the third quarter and outlook for the fourth quarter, we are again increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. Now let me turn to our third quarter results.\nThird quarter sales were a record $1.55 billion, up 8% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 11%. Acquisitions added 1 point and foreign currency was an approximate 4-point headwind in the quarter.\nDemand also remains solid across our niche markets, with organic orders growing 9% in the quarter while book-to-bill was 1.07, our ninth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3.2 billion, up approximately $1.4 billion from the end of 2020.\nOperating income in the quarter was a record $385 million, a 14% increase over the third quarter of 2021. While operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter, up a robust 140 basis points from the prior year, with strong margin expansion in each operating group. Our ability to drive meaningful margin expansion despite the inflationary environment reflects the differentiation of our technology solutions and our flexible operating model.\nEBITDA in the quarter was also a record of $463 million, up 12% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins a record 29.8%. This outstanding performance led to a record of earnings of $1.45 per diluted share, up 15% versus the third quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.36 to $1.38.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. The Electronic Instruments Group delivered excellent operating performance with continued strong and broad-based growth.\nSales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.05 billion in the quarter, up 7% from the third quarter of last year. Organic sales were up 10%, with a 1 point contribution from acquisitions being more than offset by an approximate 3-point foreign currency headwind.\nGrowth was again broad-based across our EIG businesses, with particularly strong growth within our Rauland, TMC/Precitech and Thermal Process Management businesses. Third quarter operating income was $272.7 million, up 11% versus the prior year. And operating margins were 25.9% in the quarter, up 90 basis points from the prior year.\nThe performance of our Electromechanical Group in the quarter was exceptional, with excellent sales growth and record operating results. EMG's third quarter sales were a record $497.7 million, up 8% versus the prior year, with organic sales growing 13% in the quarter and foreign currency at [4.81].\nGrowth was very broad-based across all of our EMG businesses. EMG's operating income in the third quarter was a record $136.5 million, up 19% compared to the prior year period. EMG's third quarter operating margins were a record 27.4%, up an impressive 240 basis points versus the prior year.\nOverall, our businesses delivered outstanding performance in the third quarter, allowing us to manage an uncertain macro environment, meaningfully expand margins and drive earnings ahead of our expectations. Now switching to our acquisition strategy.\nWe are very pleased to announce the acquisition of two highly strategic businesses. Navitar and RTDS Technologies are both excellent businesses and highly strategic acquisitions for AMETEK, expanding our presence with -- in attractive secular growth markets. Now let me take a moment to provide additional color on both these acquisitions, starting with Navitar.\nNavitar is a leading provider of optical solutions for critical applications across several markets, including medical and life sciences research, machine vision and robotics, semiconductor and industrial automation. Their comprehensive suite of high-precision, custom optical solutions includes fully integrated imaging systems, sensors, cameras, optics and software.\nNavitar is an excellent strategic and complementary fit with our Zygo business unit as their technical capabilities around cameras and optical systems further expand Zygo's product offering. Additionally, Navitar is a high-growth business, well positioned to benefit from the growth in demand for precision optical solutions across attractive growth markets. Navitar was privately held and is based in Rochester, New York.\nNow switching to RTDS Technologies. RTDS provides real-time digital simulation systems used by utilities and research and educational institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Their simulation solutions allow engineers to rapidly prototype, verify and test the performance of the electric grid, power instruments and networks in a closed-loop systems to help accelerate product development life cycles and decrease testing costs.\nRTDS' simulation solutions are playing a key role in the modernization of the electric grid infrastructure as well as supporting secular growth drivers, including renewable energy, distributed power generation and energy storage. The acquisition of RTDS broadens our Power Instruments business' testing and simulation capabilities while expanding our exposure to the renewable energy space. RTDS is privately held and based in Winnipeg, Canada.\nWe are very excited to welcome the Navitar and RTDS teams to the AMETEK family. We deployed approximately $430 million on these acquisitions, acquiring approximately $100 million in annual sales.\nOver the past 2 years, we deployed more than $2.4 billion in capital on acquisitions and acquired eight businesses. Our acquisition pipeline remains solid. We have a strong balance sheet and significant financial capacity and look to remain active in deploying capital on strategic acquisitions.\nIn addition to the recent acquisitions, we continue to focus on ensuring AMETEK is strategically positioned for long-term sustainable growth. Our businesses are driving broader adoption of our organic growth initiatives, improving growth presence, digitalization and new product development.\nThis includes making strategic growth investments across our businesses to help support and accelerate growth. For all of 2022, we now expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives. We are seeing great results from these efforts over both the short term and long term.\nIn the third quarter, sales from new products introduced over the last 3 years was 27%, a record level for our Vitality Index, reflecting the great work of our teams. These efforts have helped lead to double-digit organic sales growth in each of the past 6 quarters.\nNow turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. While we remain cautious in the short term, given the dynamic macro environment, we are highly confident in the quality of our businesses and our ability to manage through these challenging times. Given our strong third quarter results and outlook for the balance of the year, we are again increasing our sales and earnings guidance.\nFor the full year, we now expect overall and organic sales to be up approximately 10% versus our prior guidance of up high single digits. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.61 to $5.63, up 16% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.46 to $5.54 per diluted share.\nFor the fourth quarter, overall sales are expected to be up mid-single digits compared to the same period last year. And fourth quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.47 per diluted share, up 6% to 7% versus the prior year.\nTo summarize, AMETEK had another excellent quarter. We delivered record performance, strong orders and sales growth, robust margin expansion, increased our earnings guidance for the year and acquired two strategic businesses. The strength of the AMETEK growth model and our talented global workforce is evident in our results, thus far, this year and will continue to allow us to operate at a high level through challenging market conditions. We remain well positioned for continued long-term growth.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, then we will be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the third quarter with strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.\nThird quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.7 million, up $3 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expense in the quarter. For the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021.\nThe effective tax rate in the third quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the third quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures in the third quarter were $28 million, and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million for the full year or about 2% of sales. Depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $76 million. For the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $310 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share.\nFor the quarter, operating working capital was 18.4% of sales. We generated strong levels of cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $327 million, up 7% versus the third quarter of 2021. Free cash flow was $299 million in the third quarter, up 6% from the prior year, and free cash flow to net income conversion was 100%.\nTotal debt ended the third quarter at $2.36 billion, down from $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $310 million. At the end of the third quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.1x.\nAs Dave noted, we've been active on the acquisition front. During the third quarter, we acquired Navitar. And subsequent to the end of the third quarter, we acquired RTDS Technologies. Combined, we deployed approximately $430 million on these two acquisitions.\nWe remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong cash flows. We have no material debt maturities due until 2024 and modest levels of leverage. We continue to have excellent financial capacity and a strong balance sheet. Following our two recent acquisitions, we still have over $2 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nIn summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the third quarter and through the first 9 months of 2022. Our outlook for the remainder of the year remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and world-class workforce. Kevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Kate, could we please open the lines for questions?"

My name is Richard, and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Coleman, you may begin.\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Richard. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for AMETEK's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.\nWith me today are Dave Zapico, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Burke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which are subject to change based on various risk factors and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations. A detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results is contained in AMETEK's filings with the SEC. AMETEK disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.\nAny references made on this call to 2021 or 2022 results will be on an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures can be found in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with prepared remarks by Dave and Bill, and then we'll open it up for questions. I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone.\nAMETEK had another excellent quarter, with stronger-than-expected organic sales growth, outstanding operating performance, robust margin expansion and record earnings. Importantly, demand remains strong and broad-based across our diversified niche markets, leading to impressive organic order growth and a record $3.1 billion backlog.\nGiven our second quarter results and our outlook for the back half of 2022, we have increased our earnings guidance for the year.\nNow let me turn to our second quarter results. Second quarter sales were a record $1.51 billion, up 9% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales were up 12%. Acquisitions added a point and foreign currency was a 3-point headwind in the quarter. Organic orders were up a very strong 11% despite a highly challenging prior year comparison. Book-to-bill was 1.09 in the second quarter, our eighth consecutive quarter of positive book-to-bill.\nOperating income in the quarter was a record $365 million, a 15% increase over the second quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.1% in the quarter, up 130 basis points from the prior year with strong incremental margins. EBITDA in the quarter was a record $444 million, about 15% over the prior year with EBITDA margins of 29.3%.\nThis outstanding performance led to record earnings of $1.38 per diluted share, up 20% versus the second quarter of 2021 and above our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.30, driven by stronger-than-expected sales and excellent operating performance.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $1.03 billion, up 10% from last year's second quarter. Organic sales were up 12% in the quarter, with foreign currency headwinds more than offsetting acquisition contributions.\nOrganic growth remains very strong across our EIG businesses with particularly impressive growth across our Ultra Precision Technologies and P&AI division. EIG's operating performance was impressive, resulting in record operating profit and robust margin expansion in the quarter.\nSecond quarter operating income was $265.1 million, up 17% versus the prior year and operating income margins were 25.8% in the quarter.\nThe Electromechanical Group also delivered strong sales growth and excellent operating performance in the quarter. EMG's second quarter sales were a record $486.3 million, up 7% versus the prior year with organic sales growing 11% in the quarter. EMG's growth was also broad-based, with strong growth across both our EMIP and Automation businesses.\nEMG's operating income in the second quarter was $124.4 million, up 11% compared to the prior year period. EMG's second quarter operating margins were excellent at 25.6%, up 70 basis points versus the prior year.\nOverall, outstanding results in the quarter, reflecting the quality of our differentiated businesses, the strength of our operating model and the tremendous efforts of our employees. I would like to thank all AMETEK colleagues for your commitment to AMETEK and for the many important contributions you make to our sustained success.\nNow let me touch on the supply chain. Overall, the global supply chain remains constrained, with the largest challenging -- challenges continuing to be the availability of electronic components. As we noted previously, we have strategically decided to hold additional inventory of select components to support the strong customer demand and as a hedge against the tight supply chain. Additionally, AMETEK's global sourcing teams are doing an outstanding job working to identify additional sources of supply.\nWhile these supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation, we have been able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread again this quarter and outstanding margin trends.\nThe combination of our global supply chain capabilities and pricing power provides us the confidence in our ability to manage through these uncertain times. During our first quarter earnings call, we noted that the COVID-driven lockdowns across parts of China were expected to delay some China sales from the second quarter into the second half of the year. These lockdowns caused less impact on the business in the quarter than we anticipated.\nDue to the excellent efforts of our China team, we were able to operate in a closed loop system and adjust our logistics and supply chain networks to support production and shipments. Additionally, during the last 2 weeks of the quarter, as restrictions were lifted, we were able to resume multi-ship production and recover much of the delayed shipments.\nThe impact of China's zero-COVID policy is something we are closely watching as we will need to react and adjust in the future. Thank you to our entire team in China for your tremendous commitment and resilience during this time.\nNow switching to our acquisition strategy. Our top priority for capital allocation remains the value-enhancing strategic acquisitions. Our M&A pipeline is very strong. Our business unit and corporate development teams are busy managing an active pipeline of attractive acquisition candidates.\nAs Bill will highlight in a moment, we have a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow providing us with meaningful capacity to support our acquisition strategy, and we expect to be active in the second half of the year.\nWe also remain focused on driving higher levels of organic growth by consistently investing in our businesses to support their strategic growth initiatives. We're seeing the benefits of these investments in stronger organic growth. Our investments in research, development and engineering continues to yield advanced technology solutions, allowing us to expand our leadership position across our niche markets.\nOne measure of the success of these efforts is our Vitality Index, which was a very strong 26% of sales in the second quarter. This level of vitality reflects our business' ability to develop new products aligned with compelling growth opportunities.\nOne example of this is AMETEK's expansion into the high-growth areas of precision optics. AMETEK's Zygo business, based in Middlefield, Connecticut, provides leading-edge extreme precision optics for the design and protection of very large complicated aspheric lenses. These capabilities supported the manufacture of the 18 hexagonal-shaped mirrors, which make up the James Webb Space Telescope's primary mirror. The James Webb Telescope very recently produced the deepest and sharpest infrared images of the deep universe. Truly amazing images due in part to Zygo's capability.\nZygo also provides advanced optical systems for use in the next generation of semiconductor production equipment. Their incredibly precised mirrors are playing an important role in supporting the development of EUV, or extreme ultraviolet optics, for the next generation of semiconductor technologies. Just two of the many examples across AMETEK of the unique and highly differentiated capabilities and technologies we provide our customers.\nNow turning to our outlook for the remainder of the year. With our strong results in the second quarter, continued solid order momentum and record backlog, we have increased our full year earnings guidance. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up high single digits, with organic sales now also expected to be up high single digits versus our prior guidance of up mid- to high single digits.\nDiluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.46 to $5.54, up 13% to 14% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.34 to $5.44 per diluted share.\nFor the third quarter, we expect overall sales to be up in the high single digits compared to the same period last year, and third quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.38 per diluted share, up 8% to 10% versus the prior year.\nWhile we are closely monitoring the various macroeconomic headwinds, we are not seeing slowing in our businesses as demand remains solid and our businesses are operating at a high level. We are confident in our ability and improved outlook for the year, given our strong backlog, ability to offset inflation with price increases and outstanding operating capability.\nIn summary, AMETEK's second quarter results were excellent. Our businesses are well positioned with differentiated technology solutions serving a diverse set of growing niche markets. Our organic growth initiatives are driving higher levels of growth, and our portfolio is aligned with attractive mid- and long-cycle markets.\nAdditionally, our asset-light business model and strong cash flow provides us the flexibility to navigate challenging environments, while continuing to deploy capital and drive increased shareholder value. AMETEK remains firmly positioned to deliver long-term sustainable growth.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered excellent results in the second quarter led by strong sales and orders growth and tremendous operating performance. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.\nSecond quarter general and administrative expenses were $24.6 million, up $2 million from the prior year, and as a percentage of total sales was 1.6%, in line with the second quarter of 2021.\nFor the full year, general and administrative expenses are expected to be up modestly from 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales versus 1.6% of sales in 2021.\nThe effective tax rate in the second quarter was 18.5%, down from 20.6% in the second quarter of 2021. The lower rate this quarter was driven by lower tax on foreign income.\nFor 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 19.5%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate.\nCapital expenditures in the second quarter were $26 million, and we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $125 million for the full year, or about 2% of sales, reflecting our asset-light business model.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $77 million. And for the full year, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $315 million, including after-tax acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $148 million or $0.64 per diluted share.\nFor the quarter, operating working capital was 18% of sales. Operating cash flow was $236 million and free cash flow was $210 million in the second quarter. We expect approximately 100% free cash flow to net income conversion for the full year. Our working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add select inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and to hedge against the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased 1.44 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $173 million. And year-to-date, we've repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares, for a total of $330 million.\nAs a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital.\nTotal debt ended the second quarter at $2.5 billion, down slightly from the $2.54 billion at the end of 2021. Offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of $349 million. At the end of the second quarter, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.4x, and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2x.\nAs Dave noted, AMETEK has a robust balance sheet with no material debt maturities due until 2024, modest levels of leverage and strong cash flows. As a result, we are well positioned to deploy meaningful capital to invest in our acquisition strategy with approximately $2.3 billion of cash in existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nTo conclude, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the second quarter, delivering strong sales growth, outstanding operating performance and a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned going into the back half of the year, and we'll continue to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives.\nKevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, Bill. Richard, could we please open the lines for questions?"

My name is John. I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to Kevin Coleman, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\n\nKevin C.

I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK delivered outstanding results in the first quarter, with strong sales growth and excellent operating performance, driving robust core margin expansion and earnings which exceeded our expectations. We are also seeing continued strong demand. This demand remains broad-based across our diverse set of niche markets, leading to outstanding orders growth and a record backlog. I'm very proud of the way our teams are managing a challenging and uncertain macro environment. AMETEK's flexible operating model allows our businesses to quickly adjust and adapt to changing economic conditions and deliver exceptional results.\nBefore I provide more details on the results for the quarter, I wanted to comment on the ongoing geopolitical events in Ukraine. We are deeply saddened by the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hearts and thoughts are with all those affected. To assist with the immediate needs of this mass humanitarian crisis, the AMETEK Foundation has made donations to several charities that are actively providing food, shelter and medical supplies to those impacted. Additionally, many AMETEK colleagues in our businesses have mobilized to help in whatever way they can through donations to charities supporting the crisis. Thank you to all employees who are supporting those in need.\nNow let me turn to our first quarter results. First quarter sales were $1.46 billion, up 20% over the same period in 2021. Organic sales growth was 14%. Acquisitions added 7 points, and foreign currency was a 1-point headwind in the quarter. Overall, orders in the first quarter were $1.7 billion, an increase of 22% over the prior year period while organic orders were up 18% in the quarter. Book-to-bill was 1.17 in the first quarter, reflecting continued robust and broad-based demand. Backlog at quarter end was a record $3 billion, up approximately $1.2 billion from the end of 2020.\nOperating income in the quarter was $353 million, a 20% increase over the first quarter of 2021. Operating margins were 24.2% in the quarter, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Core operating margins were 25.5%, up an impressive 140 basis points versus the first quarter of 2021, with strong core margin expansion in each operating group. This outstanding margin expansion is a testament to the strength of our operating capability and the great work of our teams in managing inflationary and supply chain impacts across our business.\nEBITDA in the first quarter was $434 million, up 22% over the prior year, with EBITDA margins of 29.7%. This outstanding operating performance led to earnings of $1.33 per diluted share, up 24% versus the first quarter of 2021, and above our guidance range of $1.24 to $1.28.\nNext, let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for our Electronic Instruments Group were $987.8 million, up 25% from last year's first quarter. Organic sales were up 15% in the quarter while recent acquisitions contributed 11% and foreign currency was a 1-point headwind. Organic growth was particularly strong across our Ultra Precision Technologies division, with Creaform record technologies and TMC Precitech businesses leading to growth.\nEIG's operating income in the first quarter was $244.8 million, up 18% versus the prior year, while EIG operating margins were 24.8% in the quarter. EIG's core margins were up a very strong 130 basis points over the prior year to 27.5%.\nThe Electromechanical Group also had a great quarter, with excellent organic sales growth driven by broad-based demand and strong operating performance. EMG's first quarter sales increased 11% versus the prior year to $470.8 million. Organic sales growth was 12%, and foreign currency, a 1-point headwind. Demand within our automation businesses remains excellent, reflecting AMETEK's highly differentiated motion control capabilities and leadership positions within our niche applications.\nEMG's operating income in the first quarter was a record $128.2 million, up 22% to the prior year period. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 250 basis points to 27.2%, which includes an approximate $7 million gain on the sale of a facility in the quarter. On a core basis, excluding this gain, EMG margins were up a very strong 100 basis points versus last year's first quarter.\nOur teams continue to deliver outstanding performance in a very challenging and dynamic operational environment. In addition to ensuring we successfully navigate the current macro environment, we are focused on ensuring AMETEK is positioned for long-term success and sustainable growth by making investments in our organic growth initiatives.\nIn 2022, we expect to invest approximately $110 million in support of these growth initiatives, including strong growth across our research, development and engineering groups. AMETEK's leadership positions in our niche markets are driven by deep industry expertise and the differentiation of our technology. Our research and engineering teams do a wonderful job developing innovative, next-generation products and technologies to support their customers' applications.\nFor the full year, we now expect to invest more than $345 million or over 5.5% of sales in RD&E. Our Vitality Index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past 3 years, was a very strong 26% in the first quarter.\nOne way we recognize and celebrate the great work of our businesses' new product development efforts is through the AMETEK innovation award, this award provided annually to the AMETEK businesses who best demonstrates breakthrough innovation of new technology driving expanded growth opportunity. The most recent innovation award winner was our used trailer Rotron business unit, a leading provider of advanced thermal management systems for use and support of critical aerospace, defense, industrial and commercial applications.\nUtilizing various elements of the AMETEK new product development process, the team developed a highly innovative heat exchanger that provides meaningful improvements in aircraft engine performance versus the incumbent technologies. This new product will deliver strong incremental sales for AMETEK while providing important sustainability benefits to the reduction of approximately 1 million [tonnes] of carbon dioxide over a 10-year period due to an advanced, more thermally and aerodynamically efficient design of the heat exchanger.\nDriving such benefits aligned with AMETEK's core value of social responsibility by using innovative solutions to help our customers create a more sustainable future. Congratulations to the used trailer Rotron team and all the AMETEK colleagues contributing to the development of outstanding new products and technologies.\nNow switching to our acquisition strategy. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of 6 businesses. Those businesses are integrating nicely, and we expect contributions from the acquisitions in the coming years as they further implement key elements of the AMETEK Growth Model. Our acquisition pipelines remain strong, and our M&A teams remain busy in identifying attractive acquisition opportunities. We have ample balance sheet capacity and strong cash flows to support our acquisition strategy and expect to remain active over the coming quarters.\nNow let me touch on the supply chain issues. Overall, the global supply chain and logistics channels remain tight and unreliable. The supply chain and logistics environment in the first quarter was similar to what we experienced during the fourth quarter, with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components. These issues are leading to higher inflation, but given our product differentiation, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing, leading to a strong price inflation spread and outstanding margin expansion.\nNow to our outlook for the remainder of the year. While we are bullish on the future, we remain cautious in the short term given uncertainty related to the supply chain challenges, the war in Ukraine and the COVID lockdowns in China. However, given the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model and our proven operational capabilities, we are confident in our ability to manage these ongoing headwinds. Additionally, our record backlog and leadership positions across attractive mid- and long-cycle markets position us well for continued strong growth.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be up mid- to high single digits while overall sales growth are expected to be up high single digits, down slightly versus our prior guidance given increased foreign currency headwinds. Given our first quarter results, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance. Diluted earnings per share for the year are now expected to be in the range of $5.34 to $5.44, up 10% to 12% compared to 2021. This is an increase from our previous guidance range of $5.30 to $5.42 per diluted share.\nWhile confident in our increased outlook for the year, the COVID-19 lockdowns throughout China are expected to shift some sales from the second quarter into the second half. For the second quarter, overall sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digits compared to the same period last year, and second quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.30 per diluted share, up 10% to 13% versus the prior year.\nTo summarize, AMETEK delivered a strong first quarter, with solid orders and sales growth, strong margin expansion and a high quality of earnings, allowing us to increase our earnings guidance for the year. These outstanding results speak to the strength of the AMETEK Growth Model, along with the resilience of our world-class workforce. Our differentiated technology solutions and market-leading positions across diverse niche applications have allowed us to navigate through these difficult economic cycles. While we expect these challenges will continue throughout '22, we remain well positioned for continued long-term growth.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details of the quarter. Then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave noted, AMETEK delivered outstanding results to start the year, highlighted by strong sales and orders growth, excellent operating performance and a high quality of earnings. I'll provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter.\nFirst quarter general and administrative expenses were $19.7 million, up $1 million from the prior year due to higher compensation expenses in the quarter. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.5% of sales.\nThe effective tax rate in the quarter was 19%, down from 19.5% in the first quarter of 2021. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively from this full year estimated grade.\nCapital expenditures in the first quarter were $26 million. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $125 million or approximately 2% of sales.\nDepreciation and amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share.\nFor the quarter, operating working capital was 17.1% of sales. Operating cash flow was $201 million, and free cash flow was $175 million. Our first quarter working capital and cash flow results reflect our strategic decision to add inventory in certain areas to support continued strong customer demand and as a hedge against longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain. While this investment resulted in lower cash flows and free cash flow conversion in the first quarter, we continue to expect a strong 110% free cash flow-to-net income conversion for the full year.\nDuring the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of stock in the open market for approximately $152 million. Total debt ended the first quarter at $2.54 billion, unchanged from the end of 2021, and offsetting this debt is cash and cash equivalents of about $340 million. The end of the first quarter, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.5x, and the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3.\nWe continue to have excellent financial capacity and flexibility, with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities at March 31 to support our growth initiatives. As a reminder, our top priority for capital deployment remains strategic acquisitions as we believe it provides AMETEK and our shareholders with the best returns on our capital.\nIn summary, our businesses drove excellent performance in the first quarter, delivering strong earnings growth in a very challenging environment. We remain well positioned to manage ongoing economic challenges while continuing to invest strategically in our long-term growth initiatives.\nKevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. John, can we please open the lines for questions?"

I'll now turn the meeting over to Dave.\n\nDavid A. Zapico\n\nChairman of the Board & CEO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. AMETEK included 2021 with an excellent fourth quarter. Stronger-than-expected sales growth and outstanding operating performance resulted in robust profit and earnings growth. Demand remains strong and broad-based across our end markets, leading to superb order growth and a record backlog as we enter 2022.\nWe are integrating 6 recent acquisitions into the AMETEK growth model and are well positioned to deploy capital on additional acquisitions, given our excellent cash flow generation and strong balance sheet. We asked a lot of our teams in 2021 and as the pandemic and supply chain tightness led to disruption and uncertainty. As always, our colleagues stepped up to these challenges and delivered tremendous results. Thank you to all AMETEK colleagues for your hard work and tremendous contributions to our success.\nNow let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter sales were a record $1.50 billion, up 25% over the same period in 2020 and above our expectation. Organic sales growth was 17%. Acquisitions added 9 points and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind in the quarter.\nOverall, orders in the fourth quarter were $1.61 billion, an increase of 26% over the prior year period, while organic orders were up an impressive 22% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record backlog of $2.73 billion, which is up over 50% from the start of the year driven by strong underlying orders across our businesses plus the contributions from acquisitions.\nFourth quarter operating income was a record $361 million, up 21% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and operating margins were 24%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, core operating margins were 25.8%, up a very strong 90 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2020.\nEBITDA in the fourth quarter was $437 million, up 21% over the prior year, and EBITDA margins were 29.1%. This operating performance led to record earnings of $1.37 per diluted share, up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2020 and above our guidance range of $1.28 to $1.30.\nOur record performance in the fourth quarter speaks to the strength of the AMETEK growth model and our ability to drive strong growth throughout economic cycles. While the pandemic impacted results in 2020, we have quickly recovered and are now running well above pre-pandemic levels. For example, AMETEK's fourth quarter 2021 sales were 15% higher than our sales in the fourth quarter of 2019 prior to the start of the pandemic, while core operating margins were up 300 basis points and earnings were up 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2019.\nNow let me provide some additional details at the operating group level. First, the Electronic Instruments Group. Sales for EIG were a record $1.06 billion, up 29% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Organic sales were up 17%. Acquisitions added 13% and foreign currency was a 1 point headwind. Growth remains strong and broad-based across EIG with particularly strong growth in our Gatan and CAMECA businesses. EIG's fourth quarter operating income was a record $280 million up 18% versus the same quarter last year and operating margins were 26.4%. Excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, EIG's core margins were excellent at 29.3% up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2020.\nThe Electromechanical Group also delivered outstanding sales growth and excellent operating performance. Fourth quarter sales for EMG were $447 million up 18% versus the prior year driven by broad-based organic sales growth. Our automation businesses saw continued strong demand across a wide range of end markets. EMG's operating income in the fourth quarter was $105 million, up 32% compared to the prior year. EMG's operating margins expanded an exceptional 260 basis points to 23.6%.\nNow for the full year results. Overall performance was outstanding in 2021, establishing annual records for essentially all key financial metrics. Overall sales for the year were $5.5 billion up 22% from 2020. Organic sales increased 15%. Acquisitions added 7%, and foreign currency, a modest tailwind. Overall orders were up 40% versus the prior year with 26% organic orders growth leading to a record backlog and providing us solid visibility as we look ahead to 2022.\nOperating income for 2021 was $1.3 billion up 22%, and operating margins were 23.6% with core margins up 110 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA for the year was $1.6 billion, up 20% from 2020. And full year 2021 earnings were $4.85 per diluted share, up 23% versus the prior year.\nIn addition to the excellent financial results in 2021, we also positioned AMETEK for long-term success by continuing to invest in our businesses to support their organic growth initiatives. One important initiative is new product development, as we look to further expand our differentiated technology solutions in attractive growth markets.\nIn 2021, we invested $300 million in research, development and engineering or approximately 5.5% of sales. This level of investment was up 22% over 2021. One way we measure the success of new product development efforts is through our vitality index, which reflects the level of sales from products introduced over the past 3 years. In the fourth quarter, our vitality index was a very strong 25%.\nThese investments are driving outstanding innovation, including a growing number of important solutions in support of our customers' sustainability initiatives. We're supporting the development and expansion of renewable energy solutions, providing important technologies used to monitor, measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, assisting scientists and the understanding of the impacts of climate change and supporting the development and testing of electric vehicles, to name just a few of the important applications AMETEK plays a key role in supporting.\nWe are expanding our research, development and engineering investments and expect to invest approximately $340 million or 5.5% of sales in RD&E in 2022. This is a 13% increase over 2021 RD&E spend.\nWe are also deploying our capital and strategic acquisitions, adding to our portfolio of market-leading industrial technology businesses and driving excellent returns for our shareholders. We had a record year of capital deployment in 2021, deploying approximately $2 billion on the acquisition of 6 businesses. Our latest acquisition, Alphasense, was completed in the fourth quarter.\nAlphasense develops and manufactures gas and particulate sensors for use in environmental, health and safety and air quality applications. Their sensors are used in both fixed and portable systems to detect a variety of gases, including oxygen, volatile organic compounds and harmful toxic gases. Alphasense's sensor projects and technologies are highly complementary with our MOCON business and provide our sensor offering serving -- and broaden our sensor offering, serving critical health, safety and environmental applications. Alphasense is based in Essex, U.K. and has annual sales of approximately $30 million. Our acquisition pipeline remains active. Our M&A teams continue to work diligently, and we expect to remain very busy in 2022.\nAs our results reflect, our businesses are doing an excellent job managing the ongoing operational challenges caused by the pandemic. AMETEK's flexible, agile operating structure, including our global supply chain capabilities, provide us the ability to quickly adjust and react to challenges.\nThese supply chain issues are leading to higher inflation. However, we were able to more than offset this inflation with higher pricing given our differentiated product offering. Overall, the operating environment remains similar to what we experienced during the third quarter with extended lead times for a broad range of materials and components, along with logistics and labor availability issues. We remain focused in the short term on managing our supply chain and ensuring we can safely operate our factories while also continuing to drive long-term operational excellence initiatives across our businesses.\nMoving to our outlook for 2022. We remain cautious in the short term, given ongoing COVID-19 and supply chain challenges. However, we are confident in the strength of our businesses and our ability to manage through these uncertain times. For the full year, we expect overall sales to be up approximately 10%, with organic sales up mid- to high single digits versus 2021.\nDiluted earnings per share for the year are expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.42, up 9% to 12% compared to 2021. For the first quarter, overall sales are expected to be up approximately 20% compared to the same period last year, and first quarter earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.28 per diluted share up 16% to 20% versus the prior year.\nIn summary, I would like to thank all of our employees for their tremendous efforts this past year. AMETEK's fourth quarter and full year results were excellent and reflective of the resilience and strength of our workforce and the AMETEK growth model. Our strong orders and record backlog position us nicely for 2022, and we look forward to the new year and continuing to build on the momentum gained in 2021.\nI will now turn it over to Bill Burke, who will cover some of the financial details, and then we'll be glad to take your questions. Bill?\n\nWilliam Joseph Burke\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dave. As Dave highlighted, AMETEK had an impressive finish to 2021 with outstanding operating performance, leading to better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter. Let me provide some additional financial highlights for the quarter and the full year as well as some additional guidance for 2022.\nFourth quarter general and administrative expenses were $23.7 million, up $6 million from the prior year largely due to higher compensation expense. For the full year, general and administrative expenses were up $19 million, also driven largely by higher compensation costs. For 2022, general and administrative expenses are expected to be roughly in line with 2021 levels and approximately 1.4% of sales.\nThe effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 17% down from 20.1% in the fourth quarter 2020. This lower tax rate was due to return to provision adjustments. For 2022, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be between 19% and 20%. And as we've stated in the past, actual quarterly tax rates can differ dramatically, either positively or negatively, from this full year estimated rate.\nWorking capital in the quarter was excellent at 15.2% of sales. This reflects the strong work from our teams in managing working capital. We have also strategically added inventory in certain areas to help address the longer lead times we are experiencing across the supply chain.\nCapital expenditures were $43 million in the fourth quarter and $111 million for the full year. Capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be approximately $125 million or about 2% of sales.\nDepreciation amortization expense in the quarter was $78 million and for the full year was $292 million. In 2022, we expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $320 million, including after-tax, acquisition-related intangible amortization of approximately $150 million or $0.64 per diluted share.\nWe continue to generate strong levels of cash given our asset-light business model and working capital management efforts. Operating cash flow was $282 million in the fourth quarter and $1.16 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $238 million in the quarter and $1.05 billion or 106% of net income for the full year. Total debt at the year-end was $2.54 billion up only $131 million from the end of 2020 despite having deployed approximately $2 billion on acquisitions in 2021.\nDespite the record level of capital deployment, our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio declined from 1.8x at the end of 2020 to 1.5x at the end of 2021, a testament to the strength of our operating model. Offsetting this debt was cash and cash equivalents of $347 million. We remain very well positioned to deploy additional capital given the strength of our balance sheet and strong free cash flow. We have approximately $2.3 billion of cash and existing credit facilities to support our growth initiatives.\nIn summary, our businesses performed exceptionally well in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, delivering a high quality of earnings in a very challenging environment. Our outlook for 2022 remains positive given our strong financial position, our proven growth model and our world-class workforce. Kevin?\n\nKevin C. Coleman\n\nVP of IR & Treasurer, AMETEK, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bill. Andrew, could we please open the lines for questions? ."

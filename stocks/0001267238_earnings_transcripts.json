[Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Sean Moshier, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nSean Moshier\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter results with you today. Joining me for Assurant conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Keith Meier, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued an earnings release announcing our results for the third quarter 2025. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. Also on our website is a slide presentation for our webcast participants.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.\nAdditional information regarding these factors can be found in earnings release, presentation and financial supplement on our website as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in analyzing the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the earnings release, presentation and financial supplement on our website.\nWe'll start today's call with remarks before moving into Q&A. I will now turn the call to Keith Demmings.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2025 continues to be a remarkable year for Assurant. We delivered a very strong third quarter with double-digit earnings growth across both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Our performance during the quarter and year-to-date continues to drive significant cash generation and support our balanced capital allocation.\nThrough our powerful B2B2C business model, and diversified lifestyle and housing portfolio, we continue to execute for our partners, policyholders and shareholders. Our unwavering commitment to operational excellence continues to deliver exceptional client outcomes, customer experiences and differentiated returns. Through the first 9 months of the year, we've achieved 13% adjusted EBITDA growth and 15% adjusted EPS growth, both excluding reportable catastrophes. Given the strength of our business performance, we're increasing our 2025 outlook.\nWe now expect full year adjusted earnings per share growth of low double digits and adjusted EBITDA growth approaching 10%, excluding cats, a significant increase from our initial expectations for both metrics. This upward revision further differentiates Assurant in the broader P&C industry as a provider of innovative services within specialized protection and insurance products.\nOur performance is a testament to our talented employees and their commitment to our clients and policyholders. Their dedication is the foundation of our success. And it's one of the reasons why we've been recognized by time as one of the world's best companies for the third year in a row.\nLet's turn to global lifestyle performance and highlights. Lifestyle earnings have continued to accelerate throughout 2025 and have increased 4% or 6% on a constant currency basis year-to-date, supported by double-digit growth in the third quarter. We remain well passioned to deliver full year growth across both Connected Living and Global Automotive.\nIn Connected Living, performance has been the result of executing on our long-term strategy to drive commercial momentum through new client programs and the continued expansion of our partnerships, combined with enhanced capabilities and services. This quarter, we're excited to announce 2 new connected living opportunities that were made possible by important investments, which have enabled us to expand our end-to-end solutions and reinforce our competitive advantage.\nFirst, in mobile, we're significantly expanding our repair and logistics capabilities through a new multiyear agreement with a large U.S. mobile carrier. We have co-created and are now operating a new fully dedicated state-of-the-art logistics facility, where we receive return devices from across their entire ecosystem, including mobile phones, tablets, home Internet and accessories. This one facility solution will process and repurpose all returns from store locations, customers and manufacturers under one roof.\nOur joint vision was to create a facility that maximizes circularity in the mobile industry, allowing us to reuse, repair and remanufacture and deliver these devices back to end customers within the client's network. This allows us to help them optimize their device protection program while improving the end customer experience. This leverages our capabilities, including device processing, upgrading, repair and rapid claims fulfillment while providing a broad supply of high-quality refurbished devices for insurance replacement, wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels.\nThis collaboration demonstrates Assurant's role as a strategic partner and solidifies our position as a leader in the reverse logistics space. Successfully executing programs like this demands seamless integration of our operational technology and supply chain management with our clients. We leverage advanced automation, AI and robotics on the processing side to maximize efficiency and ensure consistent, scalable outcomes.\nWe're encouraged by the traction we've made in mobile repair and reverse logistics and continue to be excited about additional near-term opportunities. Our second new opportunity within Connected Living is in our retail extended service contracts business, where we recently launched a partnership to provide administration and underwriting with Best Buy, the world's largest specialty consumer electronics retailer.\nThrough this partnership, Best Buy's Geek Squad protection customers will begin to have access to additional services by Assurant. Receiving support through our AI-enabled virtual agents, live chat and access to repairs through our nationwide serve network, including our cell phone repair or CPR stores. This partnership represents another win in a space where we've increased our footprint and gained significant momentum over the last several years, now working with U.S. retail leaders across appliances and consumer electronics.\nLooking to 2026 and beyond, we see clear opportunities within Connected Living that will further strengthen Assurant. In Global Auto, adjusted EBITDA increased 4% year-to-date and we remain on track to grow for the full year, supported by stable run rate earnings and ongoing loss experience improvement.\nWe also continue to optimize performance across the business, with a sharp focus on our clients, systems, product design, claims cost and people. We have momentum in Global Auto, which is driven by renewed partnerships across distribution channels, including international OEMs and U.S. dealership groups further solidifying our client base and reinforcing our position as a market leader.\nA great example is our expanded partnership with Home and Automotive, one of the largest privately owned dealership groups in the United States. Following Homeowners's 2024 acquisition of Lease Automotive Group, Assurant will support 30 newly added dealership locations with finance and insurance products, dealership sales and participation program guidance.\nOur dealer services are also driving new business wins. Our platform is built to support dealers at scale with everything from product innovation to operational support, attracting new partners while creating opportunities with existing ones.\nAcross lifestyle, our ability to deliver solid results while investing in innovation is a key differentiator.\nTurning to Global Housing. We continue to outperform with outstanding lender place results in our homeowners business as well as continued property management company or PMC expansion within renters. We expect another year of strong housing adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding cats, further building on the impressive growth demonstrated since 2022. We continue to expect a very strong combined ratio for the full year trending below our initial expectations of the mid-80s. This excludes prior year development and reflects lower-than-expected cats for the year.\nIn Homeowners, we're seeing the impact of our multifaceted growth strategy. supported by our differentiated market position, scale and client focus. One prime example is the momentum we have through new business wins. Following a standout 2024 with significant client renewals and new partnerships, we see meaningful growth potential from our robust new business pipeline that we expect to lead to policy expansion over time.\nAs we continue to scale, we expect to sustain disciplined expense management to underpin our growth. In renters, our increasing scale is reinforced by technology-enabled services particularly our Cover360 platform in the expanding PMC channel. This platform has helped deepen relationships with existing clients and win new business, supporting sustained double-digit premium growth and increasing penetration rates for renters policies.\nDuring the third quarter, we completed a multiyear renewal with the largest PMC in the U.S. and signed 2 new PMC partnerships. We continue to see benefits from the new renters portfolio that we onboarded earlier this year, adding scale and identifying opportunities to further expand our footprint in the PMC market. Across both homeowners and renters, our strategic investments in technology and operational efficiencies continue to drive improved margins and better customer experiences.\nGlobal Housing is a cornerstone of our business, delivering strong results today while positioning us well for the future. Assurant's long-term strength and resilience set us apart in the PMC space. Over the last 5 years, we've delivered a compound annual growth rate of 12% for adjusted EBITDA and 18% for adjusted EPS, both excluding catastrophes. Our average ROE from 2019 to 2024 outperformed the S&P 1500 PMC index median, with less than half the volatility.\nWhile our 5-year average ROE of approximately 13% reflects the impact of prior acquisitions, our average return on tangible equity over the same period trended above 30%, well above the median of the PMC index, a testament to our earnings power and differentiated returns. Our unique and advantaged portfolio of lifestyle and housing businesses has created diversified sources of earnings and capital generating strong returns, robust cash flow and strong growth with lower volatility.\nLooking ahead, we remain laser-focused on finishing the year strong and building for 2026. Although we see power in the diversification in our business, we are pleased to drive growth in 2025 across our global housing, Connected Living and Global Automotive businesses. We're well positioned for future growth as we expand offerings with a focus on increasing attachment rates with existing partners, winning new clients across the globe and prioritizing investments in our core markets. That includes launching new products and services across both lifestyle and housing and continue to embed innovation across everything we do, from AI-powered tech support and personalized solutions to robotics in our device care centers.\nThese enhancements are helping us drive simpler, faster and more consistent outcomes for our clients, helping them increase the lifetime value of a customer. We see further opportunity for attractive organic growth as we enter adjacent sectors through new product offerings planned for early 2026, creating pathways for growth that align with our strengths and extend our reach.\nWe have a clear strategy and a team that's ready to deliver on the strong momentum we have across Global Lifestyle and Global Housing. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we're energized by the progress we've made, and we're confident in our ability to continue creating value for stakeholders.\nI'll now turn it over to Keith Meier to highlight our third quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year.\n\nKeith Roland Meier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As we near the end of 2025, we continue to make significant progress on our key priorities. Driving growth and strong financial performance through our intense focus on innovation and product differentiation. We have continued to elevate customer experience building on our long history of technology advancements with AI and digital automation while increasing expense efficiency and ensuring our capital position remains strong, putting Assurant in a position to create meaningful value over the long term.\nOur third quarter results reflect that significant progress. As Keith mentioned, we're proud of the underlying strength of both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle, which together drove third quarter adjusted EBITDA and EPS growth of 13%, both excluding cats, demonstrating positive momentum within our businesses.\nLet's take a look at our segment results, beginning with Global Lifestyle. In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased 12% compared to last year, driven by double-digit earnings growth across Connected Living and Global Automotive. In Connected Living, earnings increased 11%, driven by strength within financial services, particularly a new card benefits program launched late last year.\nSubscriber growth in mobile with 2.1 million net additions year-over-year, largely from expanding partnerships with U.S. clients and optimized global trading performance supported by growth across U.S. cable and carrier partners as well as our certified preowned business.\nIn Global Auto, adjusted EBITDA was up 15%, which includes a net non-run rate benefit of approximately $6 million. When normalized for this non run rate item, adjusted EBITDA was up 6%, growing both on the sequential and year-over-year basis from improved loss experience. We're encouraged by the improved loss experience in our vehicle service contract business and stable earnings overall.\nWe continue to benefit from prior rate increases and enhancements to our claims processes and product designs while consistently working closely with our clients to stay on track to deliver full year growth despite ongoing inflationary pressures across the industry.\nFor Global Lifestyle, our net earned premium fees and other income grew 7%, primarily driven by Connected Living growth from mobile programs and a new program in financial services. as well as contributions from Global Automotive.\nMoving to Global Housing. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $256 million, including $3 million of reportable catastrophes. Excluding cats, adjusted EBITDA increased 13% to $259 million, marking another quarter of strong double-digit growth. Our homeowners business benefited from the absence of a previously disclosed $28 million unfavorable non-run rate adjustment in the third quarter of 2024. This was partially offset by $16 million of lower favorable prior period reserve development with $29 million in the current quarter compared to $45 million in the prior year period. Excluding these 2 items, underlying results were strong with 9% growth.\nResults benefited from favorable non-catastrophe loss experience mainly due to lower claims frequency and continued top line growth within lender-placed from higher in-force policies and average premiums. Finally, our liquidity position at quarter end was $613 million providing us with flexibility to continue to invest in our business, return capital to shareholders and support future growth. We are driving strong cash flows. This quarter, we returned $122 million to our shareholders, including $81 million of share repurchases and $41 million in dividends.\nThrough October 31, we have repurchased an additional $27 million of shares for a total of $234 million so far this year. During the quarter, we completed the successful issuance of $300 million in 2036 senior notes and redeemed $175 million of senior notes coming due in 2026. The issuance was well received and demonstrated the strong demand for our investment-grade bonds, further affirming the strength of Assurant and our capital position.\nLet's move on to our updated outlook for 2025. The strength of our year-to-date results reflect the power of our unique business model and differentiated financial profile driven by our year-to-date outperformance within Global Housing, and earnings momentum in Global Lifestyle. We now expect adjusted EPS to grow low double digits and full year adjusted EBITDA growth to approach 10%, both excluding cats. This increase from our previous expectations reinforces the earnings power of Assurant.\nWe continue to expect strong growth for the year in Global Housing as well as earnings expansion within Global Lifestyle, where both Connected Living and Global automotive are expected to grow. Global Lifestyle results are expected to be partially offset by investments in new partnerships and programs as well as unfavorable foreign exchange for the year.\nWe continue to expect approximately $15 million of strategic investments for 2025 directly tied to launching high-impact programs and clients. Within Global Housing, we expect strong growth for the year to be led by lender-placed, including increased policies in force.\nAs a reminder, our outlook does not contemplate additional prior year reserve development beyond the $91 million from the first 9 months of the year. In corporate, we now expect our 2025 full year loss to be approximately $120 million. an increase of $5 million from our previous outlook. This primarily reflects organic investments in a new adjacent program. We would expect additional investments associated with this opportunity in the corporate segment in 2026 and are looking forward to sharing more details on our next earnings call in February.\nAnd finally, our capital objectives remain consistent given our position of strength. As we focus on maintaining balance and flexibility, enabling us to support new business growth while returning excess capital to shareholders. For 2025, we now expect to return $300 million to shareholders through their repurchases. At the top end of our to $300 million anticipated range from the beginning of the year.\nFor the fourth quarter, we would expect a higher level of segment dividends compared to third quarter, given our business' ability to generate meaningful cash flows Full year cash conversion to the holding company is expected to approximate 2024 levels. The strength of our capital position and disciplined approach to capital management investing in growth while prioritizing shareholder returns. Our year-to-date performance, commercial momentum and increase in outlook reinforce the strength of our businesses and the value we bring to our stakeholders.\nAs we look to deliver our ninth consecutive year of profitable growth, we see significant opportunities across clients, products and geographies. Through the power of Assurance business model, we're driving growth by activating opportunities already in our pipeline, deepening relationships and expanding offerings with existing partners and increasing investments in core markets, all underscored by our relentless focus on innovation.\nWe're excited about what's ahead and remain committed to delivering meaningful value for all of our stakeholders. With that, operator, please open the call for questions."

I will now turn the call over to Keith Demmings.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. We delivered a very strong second quarter with double-digit growth in both adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes.\nOur results were fueled by continued outperformance in Global Housing and growth in global lifestyle reinforcing a strong first half of 2025. Through the first 6 months, adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% and adjusted EPS rose 16%, both excluding cats. Given our year-to-date performance, we're meaningfully increasing Assurant's full year 2025 growth expectations.\nExcluding catastrophes, we now expect full year adjusted EPS growth to approach 10% driven by mid- to high single-digit growth in adjusted EBITDA. When excluding prior year reserve development, we expect to deliver double-digit underlying growth for both metrics. Additionally, our significant cash generation and balanced capital allocation continue to support long-term shareholder value.\nThis year's performance reinforces our long-standing track record of success, driven by our powerful business model and the dedication of our global team. By combining innovative services with our protection and specialty insurance products, we deliver differentiated value through our unique B2B2C distribution channels in attractive lifestyle and housing markets.\nOur partnerships with the world's leading brands are powered by transparency, data-driven protection solutions and value-added services. We've continued to be a leader in our markets by embedding technology into our client systems, enabling exceptional customer experiences and optimizing performance. We are well positioned to achieve our ninth consecutive year of profitable growth in 2025.\nOur diversified business model enables us to perform consistently across a range of economic environments, often diverging from the broader industry trends. We believe this strength and resilience continue to differentiate Assurant in the broader P&C industry. Since 2019, we've delivered a compound annual growth rate of 12% in adjusted EBITDA and 18% in adjusted EPS, both excluding reportable cats.\nNow let me share some specific examples of the momentum we're seeing within our lifestyle and housing segments. Within Global Lifestyle, adjusted EBITDA growth accelerated in the second quarter, supporting our year-to-date performance. Through the first 6 months of the year, Lifestyle earnings increased 2% on a constant currency basis, which was in line with our expectations. We are well positioned to deliver growth for the full year.\nIn Connected Living, adjusted EBITDA increased 4% year-to-date on a constant currency basis. Sustained investments in our device care centers, automation and technology platforms enhance our end-to-end solutions across the value chain. These capabilities add scale, simplicity and flexibility tapping into new profit pools and accelerating growth and value creation for Assurant and our partners.\nThis has enabled our success in growing mobile subscribers globally. Over the last year, we've added 2.4 million devices protected, bringing our total to 65 million subscribers. Our growth is led by new client programs and the continued expansion of our partner relationships. We continue to make investments related to new products, services and programs, which we expect to roll out in the second half of this year.\nFollowing our acquisitions of cell phone repair or CPR in the U.S. and iSmash in the U.K., we recently acquired U Solutions in Japan to expand our local walk-in repair capability in the world's second largest mobile market. This acquisition strengthens our customer experience in the local market and unlocks future growth opportunities.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings were up modestly supported by year-over-year improvements in loss experience. Net written premiums have increased 8% year-to-date achieved through rate increases over the last 2 years and new business wins driven by our scale and critical dealer services business. A key highlight is our recent partnership with Coca Automotive, a fast-growing automotive group with more than 50 dealerships in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\nThrough Assurant Vehicle Care, we deliver vehicle protection products and comprehensive dealership operational support including in-dealership training. Internationally, we recently completed the acquisition of Jato in Brazil, expanding our automotive distribution network diversifying our product portfolio and reinforcing our presence in Latin America. Justato's expertise aligns with our commitment to delivering excellent service and seeking continuous improvement.\nThe acquisition presents exciting opportunities for future growth. Beyond new business wins and our expanding presence, we're renewing relationships across distribution channels, including dealership groups, OEMs and other affinity partners, further reinforcing our client base and market position. We're driving innovation in automotive by investing in AI technologies. These advancements are transforming key areas from enhancing dealership training to enabling seamless digital claim processing.\nTurning to Global Housing. Following 2 years of exceptional growth, the segment continues to outperform in 2025. Through the first 6 months of the year, adjusted EBITDA was up 25%, excluding reportable cats. Our business continues to benefit from multiple growth levers, including increased demand for lender-placed insurance within homeowners, driven by hardening of the voluntary insurance market across the U.S., significant expense leverage across Global Housing, which has improved by over 700 basis points over the last 2 years and increased scale from new business wins, including the third quarter rollout of a new mortgage servicing partner, which will add approximately 300,000 loans to our portfolio.\nIn homeowners, we see meaningful opportunities to expand with new clients by leveraging our existing infrastructure. Ongoing technology investments further enhance efficiency as we process and digitize millions of insurance documents each year through our market-leading loan tracking solution. In renters, our tech-enabled services remain a key driver of growth.\nOur Coverage 360-plus platform in the property management company or PMC channel has delivered 3 consecutive years of double-digit premium growth. The platform continues to deliver higher penetration rates, client renewals and new business wins. During the second quarter, we signed a top 15 PMC partner with over 100,000 units nationwide and completed multiyear renewals with 2 of our top 4 PMC partners.\nWe've also increased our renters' policies by 11% year-to-date, including a new renters book we added earlier this year. Overall, our growth within housing is underpinned by our attractive combined ratios. Excluding prior year development, we've achieved a year-to-date combined ratio of 87% with cats. We remain on track to deliver a mid-80s combined ratio for the full year, including our full year cat assumption of $300 million.\nInnovation is deeply embedded in Assurant's DNA and it continues to underpin our ability to generate future growth. As we look over the long term, we see significant opportunities across clients, products and geographies, including expanding offerings and increasing attachment rates with existing partners, winning new clients across the globe by executing on opportunities already in our pipeline, increasing investments in core markets, including launching new products and services across the lifestyle and housing businesses and entering attractive adjacent sectors through new product offerings.\nWe're laser-focused on executing on each of these opportunities as we continue to position Assurant for long-term growth, creating value for our partners, end consumers and shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Keith Meier to highlight our second quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year.\n\nKeith Roland Meier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We were very pleased with the growth in the quarter across both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Overall, second quarter growth was strong, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 13% and adjusted earnings per share growing 17% both excluding cats. Our year-to-date performance supports the increase to our full year 2025 outlook, which I will cover shortly. Starting with capital. Our holding company liquidity position at quarter end was $518 million, providing us with flexibility to drive future growth.\nOur robust cash flow is a key differentiator for Assurant. In the quarter, our businesses upstreamed over $230 million of cash flow to the holding company, which allowed us to return $105 million to our shareholders, including $62 million of share repurchases. Through August 1, we repurchased an additional $25 million of shares and have now completed $150 million in repurchases so far this year.\nI'll now walk through our segment results in greater detail, beginning with Global Lifestyle. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 6% compared to last year or 7% on a constant currency basis. In Connected Living, earnings increased 9% or 11% on a constant currency basis, led by our global mobile device protection programs and modest growth in our mobile trade-in programs.\nThe strength in device protection was driven by strong subscriber growth from new mobile clients and programs that began last year. This is a prime example of our momentum given the important investments we made in 2024. Our device training business saw improved profitability from higher volumes compared to prior year, including increased carrier promotions as well as consumer demand pull forward in the quarter. Based on historical trends, we anticipate lower sequential third quarter volumes given normal seasonality and a strong second quarter.\nMoving to Global Auto. Adjusted EBITDA was up modestly. In line with our expectations, we were pleased to see improved loss ratios in our vehicle service contract business and stable earnings overall. We continued to benefit from previous rate increases earning through our book and improvements to our claims processes, while keeping us on track to grow for the full year.\nFor Global Lifestyle, our net earned premiums, fees and other income grew 8%, led by strong growth in Connected Living from mobile device protection and trade-in programs, as well as contributions from a new program within financial services launched late last year.\nMoving to Global Housing. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $214 million, which included $30 million of reportable catastrophe impacts. Excluding cats, Global Housing delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. as adjusted EBITDA increased 18% to $244 million. Our homeowners business continue to benefit from favorable non-catastrophe loss experience with lower claims frequencies and increases to lender-placed policies in force, benefiting from pressure in the voluntary insurance market.\nResults also increased from higher favorable prior period reserve development, which was $34 million in the quarter compared to $17 million in the second quarter of 2024. Before moving to our 2025 outlook, I wanted to discuss Assurant's long-standing focus on leveraging technology to drive innovation for our partners and end consumers.\nWe have invested in AI and related technologies to support our clients. delivering efficiencies and improving the customer experience. We also have an effective AI framework that allows us to create, evaluate and scale use cases across our businesses. Artificial intelligence presents a powerful opportunity to further accelerate our capabilities and create additional value for our clients.\nIt enables us to improve productivity, enhance decision-making, and upscale our employees, delivering simpler, faster and more consistent outcomes. There are several areas throughout our businesses, where we believe AI can continue to transform our operations and product offerings. In Global Lifestyle, our innovation and device care center near Nashville, is increasing the use of robotics and AI to assess mobile device quality and process trade-ins with greater speed and consistency.\nThis supports higher average selling prices and better value for clients and end consumers. We are also further embedding AI into our Personal TechPro premium tech support services which cover connected devices and appliances. This enables us to better assist customers in navigating technical challenges and inquiries with precision and ease.\nIn housing, we recently deployed our generative AI solutions to enhance the speed and accuracy of document classification and processing across our loan tracking solutions with impressive early results. Looking ahead, technology-based solutions will play a critical role in extending client tenure and expanding market share. And our technology advantages will enable us to continue to differentiate Assurant against competitors in the market.\nFinally, I want to share some thoughts on our increased outlook for 2025. Driven by the strength of our first half results, including outperformance within Global Housing. We now expect enterprise full year adjusted EPS growth to approach 10% and adjusted EBITDA to grow mid- to high single digits, both excluding cats.\nThis represents a meaningful increase from our initial expectation of modest growth for both metrics. To put a finer point on the strength of our outlook, excluding favorable prior year development of $63 million in the first half of 2025 and $107 million for full year 2024. Underlying growth trends are expected to deliver double-digit adjusted earnings and EPS growth.\nWe now expect strong growth in Global Housing and continue to expect growth within Global Lifestyle, where both Connected Living and Global Automotive are expected to grow. For Global Lifestyle, growth is expected to be partially offset by investments in new partnerships and programs as well as unfavorable foreign exchange.\nAs a reminder, through the first half of 2025, we've made approximately $5 million of strategic investments and would expect roughly $10 million in the second half of the year. These investments are directly tied to the programs and clients we are in the process of launching or expect to launch in the near future.\nWithin Global Housing, we expect continued policy growth in lender-placed. As a reminder, our outlook does not contemplate additional prior year reserve development beyond the $63 million seen in the first half of the year. We have considered and continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions within our outlook, including tariffs, inflation, foreign exchange and interest rate levels, which may impact the pace and timing of growth.\nAnd finally, our capital objectives remain consistent given our position of strength as we focus on maintaining balance and flexibility to support new business growth, while returning excess capital to shareholders. From a share repurchase perspective, given our confidence in our solid capital position, increased earnings outlook and attractive share price we now expect share repurchases for the year to be between $250 million to $300 million, the upper end of our 2025 guidance.\nThis is subject to M&A as well as market and other conditions. In conclusion, our year-to-date performance and increase in outlook for 2025 is a testament to the unique and differentiated nature of Assurant as we continue to be well positioned to grow earnings once again for the ninth consecutive year, while also navigating various macroeconomic environments.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

You may begin.\n\nSean Moshier\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Keith Meier, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued an earnings release announcing our results for the first quarter 2025. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. Also on our website is a slide presentation for our webcast participants.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in the earnings release, presentation and financial supplement on our website as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in analyzing the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the earnings release, presentation and financial supplement on our website. We'll start today's call with remarks before moving into Q&A.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith Demmings.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that 2025 is off to a strong start. For the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate momentum, delivering 14% growth in adjusted EBITDA and 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share, both excluding reportable catastrophes. This quarter's performance highlights the position of strength from which we continue to operate, and is supported by our diversified global operating model, where we have market-leading businesses across global housing and global lifestyle that are underpinned by our robust capital position. .\nWe have a proven track record of delivering through various economic cycles over the long term, and we remain well positioned to achieve our ninth consecutive year of earnings growth. Our differentiated business-to-business-to-consumer distribution strategy in attractive markets is reinforced by our world-class workforce that enables us to win, build and scale transparent partnerships with many of the world's leading brands and our ability to deliver exceptional customer experiences through customized data-driven solutions and comprehensive wraparound services reinforces the strength of Assurant's long-term fundamentals.\nLast quarter, we outlined our 2025 priorities, and I'm incredibly proud of our team's progress to date. We're executing, optimizing and scaling significant partnerships across lifestyle and housing through the foundational investments we made in new programs and clients in 2024. We've continued to make high-value incremental investments to support new program launches in our pipeline and accelerate emerging growth opportunities. And we remain focused on achieving our 2025 outlook by driving operational excellence and financial performance.\nNext, I want to share a few segment highlights that support our attractive position. Starting with Global Lifestyle. We're laser-focused on achieving our growth objectives across Connected Living and Global Automotive. In Connected Living, we continuously enhance the customer and client experience by investing in innovative products and services while providing differentiated value to our clients with integrity and transparency. This has allowed us to build relationships with every major U.S. mobile operator along with many global leaders in the telecom industry. As mobile and cable operators continue to innovate and compete in the wireless space, Assurant's strengthen partnerships enhance our market position and support long-term growth.\nOur approach continues to generate momentum. -- and through key investments in leading-edge technology, including automation, robotics and AI at our device care centers, we anticipate meaningful opportunities to offer additional value-added services to our key mobile clients in the near future. During the first quarter, we continue to build on our track record of deepening relationships with key clients. reinforcing our position as a preferred partner. Recently, we partnered with Verizon to launch a new mobile device protection plan from total wireless Verizon's fast-growing no contract wireless provider. The program, Total Wireless PROTECT will allow new and existing customers affordable replacement and repair against accidents and mechanical breakdowns, supported by our more than 900 Assurant authorized repair centers nationwide.\nThis provides an opportunity to continue building deeper relationships with another U.S. mobile carrier. In Global Automotive, earnings remained stable, supported by a year-over-year improvement in loss experience. Our leadership team is quickly making progress to enable further success, including a unified, consistent branding approach in our go-to-market strategy, allowing us to better leverage our scale as a market leader. This has contributed to new wins within our U.S. and international distribution channels with a runway to gain additional share with large national dealers. And we're launching several new products within Global Auto this year.\nWe recently launched Assurant Vehicle Care Technology Plus, which provides coverage for high-tech vehicle components, wear and tear items and smartphone repairs.\nMoving to Housing. Shifts in the voluntary insurance market throughout the U.S. have increased demand for lender-placed insurance products within homeowners. Our product helps lenders, investors and homeowners remove the risk of uninsured loss. Through the exceptional efforts of our claims team, we remain committed to supporting our policyholders when they need us most. We're proud to be honored by the American Red Cross as a 2025 Disaster Relief Hero recognizing our support for those impacted by 2024 storms, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton and the wildfires in California.\nAs we look at results, our strong performance continued in the first quarter, driven by 17% top line growth within homeowners, primarily due to the addition of 70,000 lender-placed policies. We've achieved significant expense leverage resulting in a compelling combined ratio. Even with elevated cats in the first quarter, we delivered a combined ratio of 90%. For 2025, we're on track to deliver a combined ratio around the mid-80s including our full year cat assumption of $300 million.\nWe continue to extend the tenure of our client base, renewing 2 lender-placed clients in the first quarter and we see meaningful opportunity to expand with new clients by leveraging our existing infrastructure. In renters, we're executing our strategy to scale our technology-enabled services and recently added a new renters book with over 250,000 policies.\nOur Cover 360 platform continues to support double-digit written premium growth in our property management company or PMC channel. demonstrating our competitive edge in a distribution channel with further growth potential. The strength of our combined lifestyle and housing businesses has enabled us to grow significantly. Over the last 5 years, we've delivered a compound annual adjusted EPS growth rate of 18% and a 12% adjusted EBITDA growth rate, both excluding cats.\nSince we successfully placed our 2025 cat reinsurance program in April, which Keith Meier will cover, I want to take a moment to highlight how Assurant compares to certain large cat-exposed P&C peers. When we look over the past 6 years, Assurant ranks among the lowest in terms of cat exposure as a percentage of net earned premiums and as a percentage of shareholders' equity. Since 2019, we had the lowest average cat losses as a percentage of net earned premiums as well as the third lowest as a percentage of shareholders' equity. Equally compelling, our volatility across both metrics is among the lowest in the group.\nOver the last 10 years, our increased scale and efficiency within housing has driven a 10-year average combined ratio of 89% compared to the broader P&C market of 95%. This data illustrates the power of Assurant's unique and advantaged business portfolio as Global Lifestyle and Global Housing have delivered strong growth and returns with lower volatility. Given our demonstrated resilience over time through various economic environments, balance risk management and compelling growth path ahead, it's our belief that we should be valued at a premium to the S&P composite 1,500 P&C Index Median. Our strategy is centered around our powerful B2B2C distribution model across lifestyle and housing, which bolsters our competitive advantage and financial performance.\nIn the attractive markets where we operate, we see expanding opportunities to continue profitable growth through the scale and efficiency of our service delivery networks. We expect to continue extending our track record of winning new clients and solidifying relationships across the enterprise. Our business model has created diversified sources of earnings and capital while generating strong returns, cash flow and growth.\nLooking toward the future, we believe there are expanding growth opportunities, including increasing investments in our core markets, continue to expand offerings with existing clients and winning new global partnerships and entering attractive adjacent sectors through new product launches. Before handing it over to Keith, I want to spend a moment on the evolving economic landscape and Assurant's position.\n2024 marked an exceptional year of outperformance, representing our eighth consecutive year of earnings growth. Given the strong start to the year and the strength of our businesses, we remain on track to deliver our ninth consecutive year of profitable growth in 2025, reaffirming our enterprise outlook. We are closely monitoring the impact of macroeconomic conditions and tariff policies on our claims cost and consumer demand. We are also taking action to remain well positioned and stay ahead of future developments.\nWhile there remains significant uncertainty, our outlook considers the impact of tariffs. Differentiated features of our business model positions us to navigate the dynamic macroeconomic environment. In Lifestyle, our alignment of financial interest with our partners enables us to work side by side to help mitigate risk. This includes client risk sharing contracts that allow us to manage financial exposure through Connected Living and Global Auto.\nOur partnerships with leading brands provides us access to diverse supply chains across the world as our clients partner with us to optimize claims costs. Within housing, our inflation guard product feature includes quarterly state-by-state rate adjustments and will allow us to react quickly to higher materials costs in our lender-placed business.\nIn addition, lender place may also serve as a countercyclical hedge in the event of a broader market downturn, differentiating us from other P&C companies. Overall, the attributes that unify our lifestyle and housing segments also position Assurant to deliver shareholder value over time through growth and disciplined capital management.\nI'll now turn it over to Keith Meier.\n\nKeith Roland Meier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by sharing some key highlights we saw in the first quarter. 2025 is off to a strong start with double-digit growth across our primary performance metrics. achieving mid-teens growth for adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share, both excluding catastrophes. Our first quarter performance was driven by double-digit earnings growth in Global Housing led by our lender-placed business. Within Global Lifestyle, we were pleased to see improved loss experience within Global Automotive as well as solid contributions from our card benefits business in Connected Living.\nLooking at capital. Our holding company liquidity position remains solid at over $500 million at quarter end. Our cash generation allowed us to return over $100 million of cash to our shareholders including $62 million of share repurchases. Through May 2, we've repurchased an additional $25 million of shares. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2025, we continue to expect our buybacks will remain more balanced throughout the year due to the ability of our businesses to generate significant cash flow. Our ultimate level of repurchases will depend on M&A opportunities and other market conditions.\nTurning to our segment results. Let's begin with Global Lifestyle. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was down 5% compared to last year and included a $6 million impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. As a reminder, first quarter of 2024 included a $7 million onetime client contract benefit that was previously disclosed. Excluding this benefit, Global Lifestyle's underlying adjusted EBITDA was up modestly on a constant currency basis. In Connected Living, earnings declined 6%. Excluding the onetime benefit from the prior year, Connected Living EBITDA also increased modestly on a constant currency basis.\nResults benefited from a newly launched card benefits program within the financial services business, where we continue to be encouraged by the growth of a new client. The increase was partially offset by lower results in domestic mobile from device protection and trade-in programs. First quarter results also included approximately $3 million of incremental investments related to new capabilities and client partnerships, including Verizon's total wireless prepaid protection program.\nTurning to Global Auto. Adjusted EBITDA was stable as lower investment income, mainly from lower real estate joint venture income and unfavorable foreign exchange was offset by improved loss experience. We were pleased to see improved loss experience both year-over-year and sequentially as program changes and rate increases continue to earn through our book. In terms of revenue, our net earned premiums, fees and other income for Global Lifestyle grew 5% or 7% on a constant currency basis, led by Connected Living.\nMoving to Global Housing. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $112 million, which included $157 million of cat losses. Impacts from the California wildfires were $125 million, which includes estimated recoveries from subrogation. We saw another quarter of strong double-digit growth as adjusted EBITDA increased 31% to $269 million, excluding cats. Our homeowners business continued to benefit from significant policy growth from higher placement rates, including impacts from voluntary insurance market pressure. Noncatastrophe loss experience was also favorable year-over-year due to lower claims frequency.\nLooking at housing reserves. In the first quarter, favorable prior year reserve development was $26 million, which is modestly higher than the $22 million in the first quarter of 2024. Within our renters business, we continue to benefit from results in our P&C channel. which achieved its 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit written premium growth.\nMoving to catastrophe reinsurance. We are very pleased with the outcome of our 2025 program placement, which was finalized on April 1. We increased coverage at more attractive terms while maintaining a 1- and 5-year probable maximum loss or PML for our per event retention level, which is now $160 million. This is slightly above the $150 million program retention in 2024 due to growth in the business but maintains the same PML.\nOur main U.S. program provides nearly $1.8 billion in loss coverage in excess of our retention. Protecting Assurant and its policyholders against severe events or up to a 1 in 265-year PML. We continue to partner with a diversified group of over 40 highly rated reinsurers. In terms of cost, our 2025 catastrophe reinsurance premiums are estimated to be approximately $225 million compared to a normalized view of $203 million in 2024, which adjusts for the timing impact of our program placement change in the first quarter of last year. The increase in cost reflects the growth of the business, partially offset by lower rates where we believe we priced on the lower end compared to the broader market.\nWith the placement of our 2025 program, our expected annual catastrophe load is now $175 million. excluding the California wildfires. Including the wildfire impacts in the first quarter, our expected full year 2025 catastrophe load is $300 million.\nMoving to our outlook for 2025. I want to reinforce that we continue to operate from a position of strength across the company. As we've demonstrated in previous macro cycles, strong cash flow is one of the hallmarks of our company. The ongoing cash generation from our businesses is supported by our large base of customers across our diverse Lifestyle and Housing segments. Our balance sheet is in a strong position. Our over $10 billion investment portfolio is well diversified across industries and 93% of our fixed income assets are investment grade.\nAnd from a growth perspective, despite macro uncertainty, we continue to prioritize targeted investing across our businesses as we look to scale and win across the globe.\nTurning to our enterprise outlook. We remain on track to deliver on the objectives we outlined at the start of the year to grow adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS modestly in 2025, both excluding cats. Keep in mind that the outlook includes growing off of a very strong 2024, including favorable prior year reserve development of $107 million last year.\nGiven our first quarter results, and the resiliency of our business model over the long term, we are well positioned to navigate the dynamic environment. We have considered the impacts of tariffs within our outlook and continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions including inflation, foreign exchange and interest rate levels, which may impact the pace and timing of growth.\nIn Lifestyle, growth in Connected Living and Global Automotive is expected to be partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange as well as investments in new partnerships and programs in 2025. Combined, we continue to expect foreign exchange and incremental investments to mute lifestyle growth by a few percentage points.\nTurning to Housing. We are increasing our outlook and now expect growth. reflecting our first quarter results as well as the expected continuation of lender-placed policy growth in our homeowners business. Our capital objectives for 2025 remain consistent, as we focus on maintaining balance and flexibility to support new business growth while returning excess capital to shareholders. From a share repurchase perspective, our expected range for 2025 continues to be between $200 million to $300 million, subject to M&A as well as market and other conditions. Overall, we are off to a great start in 2025 as we continue to drive long-term shareholder value.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. Also on our website is a slide presentation for our webcast participants.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.

We'll start today's call with remarks before moving into Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Keith Demmings.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. 2024 represented another strong year for Assurant. I'm incredibly proud of the performance of our teams across the company. whose commitment to delivering for our clients and customers enabled us to achieve 15% adjusted EBITDA growth and 19% adjusted earnings per share growth, both excluding reportable cats. Strategic investments in our people, client partnerships, technology and capabilities and targeted actions to drive improved performance across key areas of the business, position us to continue to outperform and deliver exceptional value through our products and services.\nOur people are at the center of everything we do, and our performance is made possible by our world-class culture. Our culture is how we attract and retain incredible talent to deliver for our customers. We're extremely proud of the recognitions we've received, highlighting our commitment to innovation and sustainability, while supporting and empowering our employees.\nOur competitive advantage comes from the ongoing dedication of our global workforce and leadership team to drive new business through innovative solutions while elevating the customer -- deepening existing partnerships. In Global Lifestyle, we had an unprecedented year of client wins and renewals, particularly within Connected Living. We continue to invest in new innovative client programs and leading-edge technology including the incorporation of automation, robotics and AI at our device care center outside of Nashville.\nWe recently partnered to launch T-Mobile's Protection 360 Home Tech product. This new offering provides protection for an unlimited number of WiFi-enabled devices and electronics, while providing premium tech support to consumers. This critical new product represents another strategic growth vector and underscores the long-term opportunity presented by the convergence of broadband and mobile in the connected home. By prioritizing investments in programs and capabilities, we generated significant momentum and plan to execute on additional opportunities.\nIn Global Automotive, we made progress in stabilizing earnings through targeted actions to address elevated claim costs in our vehicle service contract business and our guaranteed asset protection product. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term outlook for this business.\nBefore discussing Global Housing, I want to first share that our thoughts are with everyone who is impacted by the events of the last few months, including the California wildfires. In these times, we have a critical role to play in our customers' journey. In Southern California, we're focused on making it quick and easy for policyholders to file claims online on the phone or in person at mobile claims centers, accelerating customer payments.\nWe remain proud of our role in removing the risk of uninsured loss for lenders, investors and homeowners through our housing offerings. As we look at housing's results, we delivered sustained outperformance in 2024, benefiting from the strength of our homeowners and renters businesses, including the rollout of technology innovation to enhance our customer experience. Leveraging the segment's differentiated advantages and efficiency initiatives, we have more than doubled our adjusted EBITDA in the past 2 years, growing the business from just over $400 million in 2022 and to over $900 million in 2024, excluding cats.\nEven including cats, housing has outperformed the P&C industry. Over the past 5 years, we've achieved an average return on equity of over 22% and our increased scale and efficiency has driven a 10-year average combined ratio of 89%, compared to the broader P&C market of 95%. With clear outperformance and expected growth ahead, the business has the opportunity to be better appreciated from a valuation perspective.\n2024 was a remarkable year of commercial success across Assurant, marked by significant client momentum as we enter 2025. Strong execution enabled us to capture new opportunities while solidifying and extending key client relationships. Across our global footprint, we had several key wins, including Australia's largest mobile carrier and 2 major financial institutions in the U.S. We renewed client relationships and reinforced our position as a leader and preferred partner throughout our businesses.\nIn our mobile business within Connected Living, we completed major renewals in 2024 that represent 3 of the top 5 largest mobile carriers in the U.S. More recently, we also secured a multiyear renewal with a large mobile carrier in Japan. We've now renewed our 4 largest mobile clients in the last year who represent over 40 million mobile devices protected, a testament to our ability to execute mobile protection programs across the globe.\nWithin housing, we renewed 10 lender-placed clients, representing over 17 million loans tracked. And in renters, we completed renewals of 2 top 10 property management companies as we continue the rollout of key technology-enabled services like Cover360 and Assurant TechPro. These help increase policy attachment while enhancing the experience of our partners and renters.\nUltimately, the continuing demand for our offerings and solutions, combined with our strong competitive edge, creates commercial momentum that will extend into 2025 and beyond. We believe in the power of our unique business-to-business to consumer or B2B2C business model. At our core, we're a premier global protection company that partners with the world's leading brands to safeguard and service connected devices, homes and automobiles, utilizing data-driven technology solutions to provide exceptional customer experiences.\nThe common thread across our entire enterprise is our powerful B2B2C distribution strategy in both lifestyle and housing, where we have strong leadership positions in attractive markets. Through our differentiated distribution, strong public Fortune 500 company financials and unwavering emphasis on client transparency, we create deep partnerships with leading brands across the world. In addition, our commitment to continuously enhance customer experience through customized solutions that wrap around our protection products is built on decades of investment and ongoing innovation.\nThis allows us to deeply integrate our technology and platforms with clients, supporting long-tenured partnerships and exceptional customer experiences. Since 2019, we've increased adjusted EBITDA by over $630 million or a 12% compounded annual growth rate while growing adjusted EPS by over $11 per share or an 18% compounded annual growth rate, both excluding catastrophes.\nAs we look at our performance versus the broader P&C industry, we've continued to outperform the S&P 1500 P&C index median, both excluding and including cats, when comparing across adjusted earnings and EPS growth. Our compelling track record of outperformance includes 8 consecutive years of profitable growth, demonstrating resiliency through various macroeconomic environments.\nIn addition, our portfolio benefits from earnings and capital diversification across geographies and business lines, positioning us to continue to invest in and achieve future growth. We believe we'll remain an attractive investment with a compelling path ahead, and we believe we should be valued at a premium to the S&P 1500 P&C index media.\nBefore turning it over to Keith Meyer to share additional insights on our results and review business trends, I want to highlight our strong momentum heading into 2025 and how we plan to deliver future growth. First, will focus on executing, optimizing and scaling significant new partnerships and program launches throughout lifestyle and housing, where we invested last year. Overall, we believe our 2024 investments should be fully earned back through 2025 with an attractive 1-year payback.\nNext, we'll support incremental investments for new launches in our pipeline and accelerate emerging growth opportunities. In addition to our connected home product launch, we have new opportunities with several clients particularly in global lifestyle, and we look forward to sharing more details over the coming quarters. And finally, we'll drive financial performance and operational excellence. We believe we're well positioned to meet our 2025 objectives given the commercial momentum we have within Connected Living, long-term tailwinds in Global Auto and sustained outperformance in Global Housing.\nOverall, our ability to deliver for our clients, drive efficiencies across our operations and focus on data-driven technology solutions should enhance our position as a leader in the businesses that we operate and extend our compelling track record of financial performance. I'll now turn it over to Keith.\n\nKeith Roland Meier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. I'm proud of what we achieved in 2024 and including the financial results delivered by our incredibly strong team. For the year, we increased adjusted EBITDA by 15% to over $1.5 billion, while growing adjusted earnings per share to over $20, both excluding cats. We have continued our long-term track record of growing earnings consistently demonstrating the power of Assurant. Our performance was highlighted by another exceptional year in Global Housing, where we delivered double-digit earnings growth overall for the second consecutive year.\nWithin Global Lifestyle, Connected Living grew 9%, excluding $25 million of investments and $12 million of unfavorable foreign exchange. More importantly, we set a solid foundation for growth as we enter 2025. In Global Auto, targeted actions in our vehicle service contract and GAP products stabilized earnings in the second half of 2024 and and we are excited about the trajectory of the business as we move into 2025.\nI'll begin by highlighting key trends we saw in the fourth quarter. From there, I'll walk through our 2025 outlook as we look to deliver our ninth consecutive year of profitable growth. Beginning with our fourth quarter enterprise results, adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share both increased 13%, excluding cats, led by Global Housing. Looking at capital. Global Lifestyle and Global Housing continued to generate significant cash flow as we upstream nearly $250 million from our segments in the fourth quarter, and over $800 million for the full year.\nWe returned $161 million of that cash to our shareholders in the fourth quarter, which puts our total capital return to shareholders for the year in excess of $450 million, including $300 million of share repurchases. Our buyback level was at the top end of our expectations for the year. At the same time, we ended the year in a strong capital position with $673 million of liquidity at the holding company.\nThis past November, we increased our common stock dividend by 11%. The increase represented the 20th consecutive year we have raised our dividend since our IPO. In addition, we were just added to the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index earlier this month. We are incredibly proud of this achievement and expect our strong capital returns to continue as part of our balanced capital deployment framework.\nTurning to our segment results, beginning with Global Lifestyle. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was down 6% compared to last year or 5% on a constant currency basis. In Connected Living, earnings were roughly flat on a constant currency basis. Fourth quarter results included $4 million of incremental investments related to new capabilities and client partnerships that are expected to drive future growth.\nInvestments in 2024 are already paying off as earnings from recently launched clients, including card benefits within our Financial Services business, have begun to contribute to Connected Living's fourth quarter performance. As Keith mentioned, we are now focused on scaling these partnerships for growth. These contributions were offset by lower U.S. trade-in programs, Year-over-year, training results were impacted by business mix and lower volumes. However, we did see sequential trading growth as expected.\nTurning to Global Auto. In the quarter, results were down 11% compared to last year. The year-over-year decline was largely driven by lower real estate joint venture partnership income of $13.8 million. Fourth quarter 2023 included a more significant real estate joint venture gain compared to a smaller gain this year. Excluding this, results in Global Auto were largely flat as higher investment income was partially offset by elevated loss experience in both our GAAP product and our vehicle service contract business compared to last year.\nImportantly, we continue to see claims experience remain stable from last quarter. As previously implemented program changes and rate increases continue to earn through our book, leading to a sequential improvement in earnings. In terms of revenue, our net earned premiums, fees and other income for Global Lifestyle grew 2% or approximately 6% on a constant currency basis, and excluding $85 million of favorable non-run rate premium adjustments in Global Automotive in fourth quarter 2023.\nMoving to Global Housing. Fourth quarter results were strong. building on an exceptional performance for the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $225 million, which included $50 million of cat losses, largely from Hurricane Milton. Excluding cats, adjusted EBITDA increased 32%. In the quarter, we saw a continuation of robust policy growth in homeowners from higher placement rates given voluntary insurance market pressure. As these additional policies are placed, we benefit from the significant expense leverage we have driven in this business from our technology investments.\nEarnings growth in the quarter also included impacts from favorable non-catastrophe losses due to lower frequency as well as lower catastrophe reinsurance costs. While we had favorable prior period reserve development of $38 million in the quarter, it was relatively consistent with fourth quarter 2023 and did not impact year-over-year growth trends. Within our renters business, we continue to benefit from strong results in our PMC channel, which achieved its tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit gross written premium growth.\nNow let's discuss our outlook for 2025. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share to increase modestly, both excluding cats. Overcoming $107 million of favorable prior year reserve development in housing's 2024 results. Excluding the significant favorable PYD in 2024, strong underlying growth trends are expected to deliver high single-digit earnings and EPS growth, both excluding cats. Our outlook includes our forward view of foreign exchange rates and interest rates but does not factor in potential impacts from tariffs, including those related to claims costs or consumer demand.\nWhile tariffs could potentially affect claims costs, we believe we are well positioned to react quickly to address potential impacts. Over time, our business model has had a proven ability to deliver in the face of various economic environments and cycles. Looking at our segments. For 2025, we expect global lifestyle growth driven by higher contributions from Connected Living and Global Automotive. Growth is expected to be partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates as well as investments in new partnerships and programs in 2025.\nIn mind, we expect foreign exchange and incremental investments to mute growth by a few percentage points. Turning to Global Housing. We expect EBITDA, excluding cats, to decline modestly. Given the $107 million of favorable prior year reserve development seen in 2024. Excluding the impact of prior year development in 2024, on an underlying basis, we expect strong global housing EBITDA growth in 2025. As a reminder, our 2025 outlook does not contemplate additional prior year development. Underlying growth is expected to be driven by our homeowners business, which will continue to benefit from lender-placed policy growth and expense leverage.\nFor the recent wildfires in California, we remain focused on Settling claims and helping our policyholders navigate through the event. Reportable catastrophes from the California wildfires are expected to approach or slightly exceed our per event catastrophe reinsurance program retention of $150 million. We'll provide a further update in May as we learn more and continue to settle claims. In terms of other impacts to 2025, we are working through the placement of our catastrophe reinsurance program, which will be effective on April 1. We expect a similar structure to our 2024 program, maintaining robust coverage at both the top and bottom end of our program.\nAs the program terms are finalized, we will also get greater insights into our expected cat load for the year. We'll provide an update in May on expectations, which will be inclusive of our California wildfire estimates. Our capital objectives for 2025 are consistent with prior years as we focus on maintaining balance and flexibility to support new business growth while returning excess capital to shareholders.\nFrom a share repurchase perspective, our expected range for 2025 is between $200 million to $300 million, subject to M&A as well as market and other conditions. This range accounts for our estimated impact from the California wildfires. Of course, we will continue to make sound capital allocation decisions over the course of the year as our track record has shown. Through February 7, we've repurchased $24 million of shares. We expect buybacks to be more consistent throughout the year compared to back-end weighted in prior years, driven by our confidence in our strong capital position and cash flow generation.\nAnd finally, speaking of cash flow generation, we believe Assurant is differentiated compared to the broader P&C industry, given our unique lifestyle and housing portfolio, which creates strong capital efficiencies and the ability to reinvest for growth. In 2025, we expect to continue to generate meaningful cash flows aligned with our recent performance. Overall, we are proud of our consistent outperformance and feel well positioned to continue our growth trajectory in 2025.\nWith that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]. It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Sean Moshier, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nSean Moshier\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2024 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Keith Meier, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the second quarter 2024. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. Also on our website is a slide presentation or participants.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by those additional information regarding these factors can be found in the earnings release, presentation and financial supplement on our website as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and supporting materials. We'll start today's call with remarks before moving into Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Keith Demmings.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Our strong first half 2024 results demonstrate continued outperformance from Global Housing and underlying momentum in Connected Living, positioning us to increase our full year 2024 growth expectations for Assurant overall. Excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted EBITDA increased 20% year-to-date, and adjusted EPS grew 29%. These results were the power of our combined housing and lifestyle business model. Starting with our first half business highlights.\nIn Global Lifestyle, first half 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $397 million, consistent with the first half of 2023. Our year-to-date performance has been driven by continued growth and momentum within our Connected Living business, particularly in the U.S. In Connected Living, adjusted EBITDA increased 6% or 8% on a constant currency basis. As we previously discussed, 2024 includes incremental spending related to implementation [indiscernible] that we expect will support long-term growth for Assurant. Excluding first half investments of approximately $13 million, year-to-date growth for Connected Living was 14% on a constant currency basis. One example of our innovative new offerings included the rollout of two programs with Spectrum Mobile, anytime upgrade and the repair and replace plan.\nAdditionally, we onboarded the pre and postpaid device protection subscribers of Telstra, our new partner in Australia. Combined, these new programs added 1.6 million mobile subscribers, driving strong sequential growth. This year, we've also completed long-term contract extensions with all of our major U.S. mobile device protection clients, including T-Mobile and two U.S. cable operators, continuing to strengthen our position in the market. In total, these renewals represent three of the top five large area [indiscernible] with a multiyear contract extension to continue supporting their postpaid and prepaid consumers beyond 2030. The renewal of T-Mobile allows us to continue to invest in this critical partnership and drive innovation for the future.\nIn financial services, we expanded our long-standing relationship with Chase by partnering with Chase Card Services within our growing card benefits business. We executed a multiyear contract to provide coverage to millions of Chase cardholders. This program will provide end-to-end delivery for approximately 15 travel and purchase protection benefits, including underwriting, claim processing and benefit servicing. We expect continued investments over the second half of this year as we move toward program launch at the end of 2024. This represents a marquee win for our card benefits business, which has gained strong momentum over the last several years. Our relationship with Chase now spans across our lifestyle and housing businesses. Reinforcing the depth of client partnerships that we drive across the Assurant enterprise.\nMoving to Global Automotive. Our first half earnings have continued to be pressured by ongoing inflation impacts on motor vehicle repair costs. We expect that the effects of inflation will continue to impact our auto results throughout the second half of 2024 in our vehicle service contract business. In addition, we expect continued elevated loss experience within our ancillary guaranteed asset protection or GAAP product. Our longer-term outlook, however, is bright as we've begun to see moderation of claims inflation on our vehicle service contract business given the rate actions taken over the past 24 months. Within our GAAP product, we're experiencing elevated losses driven by the combination of continued declines in used car prices from pandemic highs higher interest rates and the increase in the number of vehicles declared total losses by the primary insurance carrier. We expect this impact to be shorter term in nature relative to vehicle service contracts as the majority of GAAP claims are made within the first 24 months after vehicle purchase. In addition, for the past year, we've been proactively partnering with several clients to transition the risk on the GAP business. which will reduce a substantial amount of our claims exposure over time. Lastly, we believe the auto business will continue to benefit from our position as a market leader with scale and strong partnerships across multiple distribution channels.\nNow let's turn to Global Housing. For the first half of the year, Global Housing's earnings increased nearly 45%, excluding reportable catastrophes, Housing's year-to-date results have demonstrated both the importance of the business to our overall portfolio and the power of our unique and differentiated business model which has largely outperformed the broader P&C market. Our lender-placed insurance business safeguards homes that need insurance regardless of geography, while supporting the U.S. mortgage industry by removing the risk of uninsured loss for lenders, investors and homeowners. We review rates with each state on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate and that homeowners are protected. This process allows us to work together to balance risk and reward with fair and adequate rates while creating product safeguards to address macroeconomic factors such as inflation. In addition, we benefit from our strong track record, continued investments in customer experience and our compliance expertise, our most critical competitive advantages. These efforts have allowed us to renew existing partnerships and win new clients, including Bank of America. This, in turn, has contributed to increased scale, which combined with technology investments has led to significant operational efficiencies. Ultimately, this creates meaningful expense leverage, which will continue to benefit from going forward.\nOur specialized product and client base pride Assurant with differentiated advantages compared to many traditional homeowners insurance carriers. Overall, these combined advantages have led to the recovery and growth of this business within a relatively short time frame. We believe we are well positioned and we continue to believe there's an opportunity for the market to better value our specialized lender place business. In renters, we benefit from an attractive financial profile that is more capital efficient compared to traditional P&C businesses. We are focused on expanding our presence as a market leader within the property management company or PMC channel while providing our partners with innovative new offerings.\nIn the first half of the year, we increased gross written premiums in our PMC channel by over 20%, reflecting strong client demand for our Cover360 solution. This marks 8 straight quarters of double-digit growth of gross written premium in the PMC channel. Following the initial launch of our Assurant TechPro resident troubleshooting service, we recently signed a partnership with the largest PMC in the U.S. to be the first to provide this service to the industry. We expect to begin rollout in the second half of this year.\nTurning to our enterprise outlook. Given the strength of our first half results, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to grow high single digits and adjusted earnings per share to increase low double digits, both excluding catastrophes. This represents an increase from our initial expectation for both metrics. We anticipate strong growth within Global Housing, which is expected to lead our enterprise growth for 2024. In Global Lifestyle, we expect modest growth in 2024. Connected Living is expected to deliver another year of growth as we remain focused on driving long-term momentum through new partnerships and programs.\nOverall, we believe our first half performance and our increased 2024 outlook demonstrate the power of our differentiated business model with unique advantages, which make Assurant attractively valued. Over time, we've enhanced Assurant's risk profile by focusing on our capital-efficient businesses within lifestyle and housing, which are highly cash generative. We've established a track record of winning and delivering for B2B2C clients both lifestyle and housing, many of whom are industry leaders and market disruptors across the globe. We've created leadership positions in amplified competitive advantages through our protection solutions across devices, automobiles and homes. Together with our clients, we've seen these deliver mutual benefit from scale and deep integration, supporting innovative and flexible solutions to differentiate the customer experience.\nWe focused on specialized attractive markets with growth opportunities and long-term secular tailwinds. These factors contributed to long-term outperformance versus the broader P&C market, particularly the S&P Composite 1500 P&C index. We believe this comparison better reflects our current mix of businesses and offerings as we provide insurance solutions and fee-based services to our partners and their end consumers. In June, our subindustry index classification under the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, transition from multiline insurance to P&C insurance, a product of our multiyear transformation that included exiting pre-need, health and life insurance-related businesses.\nBefore handing it over to Keith Meyer, I wanted to highlight our recently published 2024 sustainability report, which demonstrates our progress in advancing our sustainability strategy and initiatives. We've introduced our new sustainability vision focused on advancing a connected respected and protected world. We've established long-term ambitions to support a thriving society a circular economy and a stable climate. We believe there's an important connection between our vision and ambitions and how we deliver value for our business and for our stakeholders. These priorities strengthen Assurant for the future, including how we attract, empower and reward a diverse workforce to drive innovation, contribute to the development and adoption of sustainable products and reduce the climate impact of Assurant's operations and supply chain.\nOverall, we're excited about the progress we've made so far this year. Continuing to drive attractive financial results and outperformance for the overall enterprise. As we look ahead, we believe we are well positioned to continue to drive business momentum in the second half and beyond. I'll now turn it over to Keith Meier to review our second quarter results and business trends impacting our 2024 outlook.\n\nKeith Roland Meier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We're proud of our second quarter performance as we continue to invest in value-added solutions for our clients and end consumers. We believe we are well positioned to build upon our historical track record of growth, strong capital generation and long-term shareholder value creation.\nLet's review the specifics of our strong second quarter results, which built upon the momentum from the first quarter. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 10% to $369 million, and adjusted earnings per share increased by 17% to $4.77, both excluding reportable catastrophes. From a capital perspective, we generated $142 million of segment dividends in the second quarter. Ending the quarter with $735 million of holding company liquidity, up from $622 million at the end of the first quarter. Our strong capital position has provided flexibility to invest in future growth while returning $80 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $40 million of share repurchases. In addition, we repurchased $20 million of shares between July 1 and August 2 and have now completed $100 million in repurchases so far this year.\nTurning to our business segments. Let's begin with Global Lifestyle. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased 4% to $190 million or 2% on a constant currency basis. Driven by Global Automotive, which declined by 8% or $6 million. Results were impacted by higher claims costs due to inflation and elevated losses from ancillary gap products. In Connected Living, earnings increased modestly on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by global mobile protection programs, including subscriber growth from U.S. cable operators and new Asia Pacific clients as well as improved U.S. financial services results. International results remained stable on a constant currency basis and have started to show signs of modest growth. Growth was partially muted by investments in new capabilities and client partnerships, which are expected to support long-term growth. Trading results were down from a decline in carrier volumes and business mix, including from lower promotional activity. Unfavorable foreign exchange remains a headwind and impacted Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA growth by 2 percentage points in the quarter.\nTurning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle grew by $75 million or 4% and Connected Living increased 6% and benefiting from contributions from new trade-in and mobile protection programs, including the U.S. and Asia Pacific. For full year 2024, we now expect Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA to grow modestly, reflecting continued strong performance from Connected Living and ongoing elevated claims in Global Auto. We expect growth in Connected Living to be led by the continued expansion of our U.S. business. We expect investments related to new clients and programs, mainly in Connected Living, to temper lifestyle growth by approximately 3% in 2024, but will be a critical driver for business growth over the long term. In Global Auto, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be flat to modestly down due to continued loss pressures from inflation and elevated losses within ancillary gap products. We continue to monitor foreign exchange impacts, inflation and interest rates, which have and may continue to impact the pace and timing of growth.\nI'd like to take a moment to discuss our auto business and how we have addressed inflation headwinds. As we've discussed, we expect auto claims inflation to impact our performance over the remainder of this year. Toward the end of 2022, the industry began to see large spikes in motor vehicle repair costs even as overall CPI trends began to stabilize. Exiting 2023, a the auto industry began to see signs of inflation levels declining. However, in the beginning of 2024, motor vehicle repair costs increased once again. impacting performance in the first half of 2024. Our underwriting risk in auto is limited to just a few clients as many of our clients choose to reinsure or share in the economics of the business. given Auto's profitable returns over the long term. There are a total of five vehicle service contract clients where we retain a portion of the claims risk that will improve over time, which is a small subset of our overall client base. Since 2022, we have implemented a total of 14 rate increases for these impacted clients. With additional increases planned over the coming quarters. In addition to rate increases, we have made changes to enhance our claims adjudication process, adjusting the product and modifying deal structures with clients to ensure mutually beneficial outcomes. Even with these vehicle service contract clients where we do retain some risk, we are profitable as we also earn investment income and received fees for our administrative program support.\nMoving to Global Housing. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA, including cats, was $161 million. During a quarter that included over 25 ISO events that impacted much of the P&C industry, we fared reasonably well with $46 million of reportable catastrophes across five events and no single event incurring more than $15 million in losses. Excluding reportable cats, adjusted EBITDA increased by 23% or $38 million to $206 million. The increase was driven by continued top line growth in homeowners, primarily from an increase in the number of in-force policies from the onboarding of the newly added Bank of America portfolio and the net impact of ongoing client and portfolio transitions. Additionally, lender-placed policies increased due to impacts from hardening traditional insurance markets in certain states. Lender Placed continued to see average premium growth related to higher average insured values and increases in filed rates.\nDespite higher expenses from client portfolio onboarding and offboarding activity in the quarter, expense leverage from scale, technology investments, and operational efficiencies remains a key driver of performance as reflected in the continued improvement in housing expense ratio, which was 37% in the quarter. Underlying EBITDA growth was partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year net impact of $11 million related to prior period reserve development. Second quarter 2024 had $17 million of favorable reserve development compared to $28 million in the second quarter of 2023. We continue to expect Global Housing's full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, to be the growth driver of our overall enterprise performance. We anticipate growth will be driven by continued top line momentum in homeowners, expense leverage and lower catastrophe reinsurance costs. placement rate and policies in force, both key drivers of earnings are expected to be impacted by ongoing client portfolio transitions in the second half of the year. However, both are expected to have healthy growth overall for 2024. Lastly, we expect Hurricane Barrel to be a reportable catastrophe in the third quarter. While claims are still developing, our early indication is that estimated losses will be between $30 million to $50 million. We will provide an update prior to our third quarter earnings call as we finalize the impacts.\nMoving to corporate. The second quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $27 million, which improved mainly due to higher net investment income from higher asset levels and yields. We continue to expect the 2024 corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $110 million, consistent with 2023.\nTurning to capital management. We generated significant deployable capital in the first half of the year. Upstreaming $395 million in segment dividends. For 2024, we expect our businesses to continue to generate meaningful cash flow. Cash conversion to the holding company is expected to approximate 2/3 of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current macroeconomic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to be focused on maintaining flexibility to support new business growth and to return capital to shareholders.\nGiven our strong capital position and robust reinsurance program, we expect to be on the high end of our $200 million to $300 million share repurchases range for the year. Our ultimate level of repurchases will depend on M&A opportunities, market conditions and cat activity. Overall, we've had a very strong first half of 2024, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve our increased full year financial outlook while also supporting business growth and shareholder value creation over the long term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Sean Moshier, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nSean Moshier\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2024 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Keith Meier, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter 2024. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. Also on our website is a slide presentation for our webcast participants.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.\nAdditional information regarding these factors can be found in the earnings release, presentation and financial supplement on our website as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and supporting materials.\nWe'll start today's call with remarks before moving into Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Keith Demmings.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results represent a strong start to 2024, reflecting the position of strength from which Assurant continues to operate.\nAdjusted EBITDA grew 31% year-over-year to $384 million, and adjusted EPS grew 42% year-over-year, both excluding reportable catastrophes. Our first quarter results were driven by the continued strength of our Global Housing segment as well as growth in Global Lifestyle. Our ability to continue to drive financial performance and operational excellence has supported strong cash flow generation and a solid capital position.\nBefore reviewing the highlights across our business segments, I'd like to take a moment to reiterate how our unique and differentiated business model has led us to consistently deliver financial results. Assurant holds market leadership positions across a variety of attractive specialized markets where we benefit from both scale and deep integration with our B2B2C client base.\nOur competitive advantages across our businesses have allowed us to be flexible and agile in executing for our partners and for end consumers. Cost savings from targeted actions, such as our previously announced restructuring plan and ongoing technology innovation, including digital first and artificial intelligence have supported reinvestment in businesses, where we have leadership positions. These high-return initiatives have enhanced our capabilities and supported new partnerships, laying the groundwork for continued growth.\nThe ultimate driver of our success is our people. In March, Assurant was recognized by Ethisphere as 1 of the world's most ethical companies in 2024. Operating ethically is foundational to protecting our clients' brands across the globe as well as our own. This recognition is a testament to the thousands of Assurant employees who champion our values every day.\nCollectively, our unique advantages have led to long-term profitable growth and shareholder value creation. We've continued to drive outperformance versus the broader P&C market, as evidenced by our long-term results compared to the S&P Composite 1500 P&C index. Since 2019, Assurant has delivered double-digit adjusted earnings growth including and excluding cats, outperforming the broader P&C index.\nNow turning to the quarter, I'd like to share highlights across our business segments. Global Lifestyle delivered adjusted EBITDA of $208 million in the first quarter of 2024. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 4% or 5% on a constant currency basis. Which is in line with our full year growth expectation. Growth was led by our Connected Living business, which delivered double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in the first quarter. To support growth, we're continuing to make several important investments in new partnerships, including for recently announced new launches such as Telstra, Australia's largest mobile carrier, where we completed the initial launch of several offerings. We are currently offering protection, upgrade and trade-in to Telstra's postpaid subscriber base.\nAdditionally, we recently completed a multiyear extension of our partnership with Spectrum Mobile, demonstrating the strength of our relationship. The expanded relationship includes the launch of 2 new mobile programs. The first of the 2 programs, the new anytime upgrade benefit, which is now included in the Spectrum Mobile Unlimited Plus data plan at no extra cost to consumers allows new and existing customers to upgrade their phones whenever they want. The second program is the new Spectrum mobile repair and replacement plan, which offers customers device protection and is supported by our dynamic fulfillment and claims management capabilities. These innovative new offerings with Spectrum Mobile are the result of our long-standing partnership and reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver market first solutions to meet the needs of end consumers.\nDuring the quarter, we also enhanced our global capabilities. For example, in Europe, we acquired iSmash, a leading independent tech repair brand in the United Kingdom, offering express drop in repair services for smartphones, tablets, laptops with nearly 40 retail locations. This acquisition further scales our walk-in repair offerings and is a prime example of the investments we're making globally to win new business and enhance existing relationships.\nMoving to global automotive. Similar to others in the industry, first quarter results reflected persistent inflation impacts to vehicle parts and labor repair costs. We've continued to take actions to address elevated inflation, including implementing additional rate increases in the first quarter that build upon those taken over the past 18 months, while also strengthening and enhancing our claims adjudication process.\nFor 2024, we expect auto earnings to be flat. Investment income growth and disciplined expense management efforts are expected to be offset by continued claims inflation. We remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of our auto business. Over the next several years, we expect rate actions to provide a tailwind for the business with the pace and timing of earnings growth dependent on broader market trends.\nNow let's discuss Global Housing, which drove our first quarter outperformance. Global Housing earnings grew significantly in the first quarter, up nearly 75%, excluding reportable cats, following an extraordinary 2023, housing's first quarter performance reinforces the power of our unique business model, which is highly differentiated versus the broader P&C market. Housing's competitive advantages have led to a compelling shift in its financial return over the past 2 years, delivering strong financial performance with attractive returns. We have several distinct advantages in Global Housing.\nFirst, we have strong market positions in our core housing businesses. Specifically in lender placed, we have strong relationships with the largest U.S. banks and mortgage servicers, including our new client, Bank of America, which we began to onboard in the first quarter. Second, as seen over the past 18 to 24 months in our lender-placed business, we've been able to achieve rate adequacy quickly through the built-in annual inflation guard product feature designed to adjust with building and materials costs and normal course state rate filings. Third, our scale and focus on operational efficiencies have created meaningful expense leverage, which we will continue to benefit from going forward.\nLastly, our lender-placed business provides a countercyclical hedge in the event of potential broader housing market weakness. While we would not expect tailwinds to be as significant as in prior recessions, we still expect policy placement increases if the housing market goes through a cyclical downturn. Similarly, in our renters and other business, we operate as a market leader across our affinity and property management company channels. The business has an attractive capital-light financial profile with limited catastrophe exposure and remains well positioned for long-term growth as we continue to innovate with our partners and capitalize on secular tailwinds within the rental market. During the quarter, we increased gross written premiums by over 15%, driven by strong growth in our PMC channel. We've continued to leverage enterprise-wide capabilities to improve our customer experience and create value for our clients. For example, we leveraged our premium technical support capabilities from Connected Living to help us launch Assurant TechPro for the multifamily housing channel, providing residents access to technical troubleshooting services, which is a first in the industry.\nTurning to our enterprise outlook. For 2024, we continue to expect Enterprise adjusted EBITDA to grow by mid-single digits, excluding cats. Based on our strong first quarter performance within Global Housing, which included $22 million of favorable prior period reserve development, our 2024 results are trending toward the higher end of the mid-single-digit outlook. We now anticipate global housing will lead our enterprise growth.\nIn Global Lifestyle, our full year outlook remains unchanged, driven by growth in Connected Living which is partially offset by incremental investments to support long-term growth. We continue to monitor global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, foreign exchange and interest rate levels as well as new business investments. Looking at earnings per share, we now expect adjusted EPS growth to approximate adjusted EBITDA growth, reflecting lower expected depreciation expense as well as higher earnings within Global Housing.\nI'll now turn it over to Keith Meier to review our first quarter results and 2024 outlook in further detail.\n\nKeith Roland Meier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. With our strong first quarter performance, we continue to focus on driving long-term shareholder value with thoughtful and decisive actions to continue to grow and outperform. To achieve this, we are committed to a deep understanding of our global partners and their end consumers' needs, executing on the opportunities identified as well as disciplined capital management to enable long-term growth.\nNow let's review the details of our first quarter results. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 31% to $384 million and adjusted EPS increased by 42% to $4.97, both excluding reportable catastrophes. From a capital perspective, we generated $254 million of segment dividends in the first quarter, ending the quarter with $622 million of holding company liquidity, up from $606 million at year-end. Our strong capital position allowed us to return $77 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $40 million of share repurchases. In addition, we repurchased $10 million of shares between April 1 and May 3.\nTurning to our business segments. Let's begin with Global Lifestyle. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 4% to $208 million or 5% on a constant currency basis. Year-over-year growth was driven by strong performance in Connected Living, particularly in the U.S., which was partially offset by lower results in Global Automotive.\nIn Connected Living, earnings increased 14% or $16 million primarily driven by continued momentum in our U.S. mobile protection programs and higher investment income. Results were partially offset by investments in new capabilities and client partnerships. In the U.S. Connected Living growth also benefited from modest improvements in loss experience within extended service contracts, resulting from rate actions taken over the last 18 months to offset higher claim severities from inflation. Trade-in results were flat as higher margins and contributions from new U.S. programs were partially offset by a decline in carrier volumes, including impacts from lower promotional activity.\nInternational Connected Living results included a $7 million favorable onetime extended service contract client benefit in Japan. Excluding this item, international results were stable on a constant currency basis, consistent with the trends from the end of 2023. Foreign exchange remains a headwind, impacting Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA growth by 1 percentage point in the quarter. In Global Automotive, first quarter adjusted EBITDA declined 9% or $7 million, driven by higher claims costs due to persistent inflation impacts as well as the normalization of select ancillary products. The impacts of inflation continue to be felt throughout the auto industry.\nAs indicated in the March Consumer Price Index, where motor vehicle repair costs rose nearly 12% year-over-year and accelerated over the quarter. Elevated claims costs were partially offset by higher investment income. Turning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle grew by $148 million or 7% and Connected Living increased 11%, benefiting from contributions from new trade-in programs and North American mobile protection programs. Growth from Global Automotive net earned premiums fees and other income was 3%, which was primarily driven by prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. For full year 2024, we continue to expect Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA to grow, driven by Connected Living. We expect growth in Connected Living to be led by the continued expansion of our U.S. business.\nIn Global Auto, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be flat as higher investment income is offset by continued loss pressure from inflation. Prospective rate actions taken over the past 18 months are expected to drive improvement over time, depending on the timing and pace of claims inflation impacts. Investments related to new clients and programs will temper lifestyle growth in 2024 but will be a critical driver in the strengthening of our business over the long term. We continue to monitor foreign exchange impacts, broader macroeconomic conditions and interest rates. Which may impact the pace and timing of growth.\nAs we enter the second quarter, we expect our sequential adjusted EBITDA trend to be impacted by the absence of the onetime client benefit and seasonally lower mobile trading volumes, both in Connected Living. Moving to Global Housing. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $193 million, which included $13 million of reportable catastrophes. Excluding reportable cats, adjusted EBITDA increased by 74% or $88 million to $205 million. Over half of the increase was driven by improving non-cat loss ratios from moderating claims trends and higher average premiums.\nA portion of the claims improvement was related to a $16 million favorable year-over-year net impact to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of a $22 million reserve reduction in the current quarter compared to a $6 million reserve reduction in the first quarter of 2023. The remainder of the adjusted EBITDA increase was mainly driven by continued top line growth in homeowners and an increase in the number of in-force policies, lower catastrophe reinsurance costs and higher investment income. For renters and other, earnings increased from growth in our property management channel.\nAs Keith mentioned, expense leverage throughout housing continues to be a strong differentiator as our technology investments and innovations are enabling a superior customer experience. This has played a critical role in our outperformance. Given the strong first quarter performance, we expect Global Housing's full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding cats, to lead our overall enterprise growth. We anticipate growth will be driven by favorable non-cat loss experience, continued top line momentum in homeowners and lower catastrophe reinsurance costs.\nOver the course of 2024, our lender-placed business is expected to be impacted by ongoing client portfolio movements. This includes the addition of multiple client portfolios, including the onboarding of Bank of America as well as expected offboarding impacts from the sale of a client to another party. Given the unique composition of each portfolio, these movements are expected to impact tracked loans and placement rate from quarter-to-quarter.\nHowever, policies in force, a key driver of earnings is expected to grow overall for 2024. As we turn to the second quarter, please keep in mind the following: first, we had $22 million of first quarter prior year reserve development. Second, we expect normalized catastrophe reinsurance costs following lower costs in the first quarter. which were impacted by timing differences related to the program transition to a single placement as well as favorable 2023 exposure true-ups.\nBeginning in the second quarter, we expect quarterly reinsurance premiums to be modestly above $50 million, which is an increase from the $34 million in the first quarter. And lastly, the second quarter tends to be an elevated period for non-cat loss experience.\nNext, I wanted to summarize the placement of our 2024 catastrophe reinsurance program which has now transitioned to a single April 1 placement date. We are pleased with our increased coverage at attractive terms, including cost savings realized in this year's placement. 2024 catastrophe reinsurance premiums for the total program are estimated to be approximately $190 million, a reduction in comparison to $207 million in 2023. As previously communicated, our per event retention increased to $150 million, aligning with a 1- and 5-year probable maximum loss or PML.\nOur main U.S. program will provide nearly $1.5 billion in loss coverage in excess of our retention, protecting Assurant and its policyholders against the PML of approximately 1 in 265 year store, an increase above the 2023 limit aligned to a 1 in 225-year PML. Overall, this year's placement was diversified and supported by the strength of our relationships with 40-plus highly rated reinsurers.\nMoving to corporate. The first quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $30 million, a $5 million year-over-year increase mainly due to higher enterprise growth initiatives. We now expect the 2024 corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $110 million, consistent with 2023.\nTurning to capital management. We generated significant deployable capital in the first quarter, upstreaming $254 million in segment dividends. For 2024, we expect our businesses to continue to generate meaningful cash flow. Cash conversion to the holding company is expected to approximate 2/3 of segment adjusted EBITDA. Including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current macroeconomic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements.\nAs we look forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to be focused on maintaining balance and flexibility to support new business growth and return capital to shareholders. From a share repurchase perspective, we continue to expect to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million, which will depend on strategic M&A opportunities, market conditions, and cat activity. Through the strength of our differentiated business model and given our first quarter results, we are increasingly confident in achieving our 2024 financial objectives.\nOur strong capital position provides us with the necessary resources to support business growth and shareholder value over the long term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Sean Mosier, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nSean Moshier\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Keith Meier, our Chief Financial Officer. Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. Also on our website is a slide presentation that we introduced this quarter for our webcast participants.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in the earnings release, presentation and financial supplement on our website as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures, and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and supporting materials.\nWe'll start today's call with remarks before moving into Q&A. I will now turn the call over to Keith Demmings. Keith?\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was an extraordinary year for Assurant, our seventh consecutive year of profitable growth. We drove shareholder value by delivering financial outperformance, maintaining a strong capital position and generating significant momentum throughout our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA grew 21% to nearly $1.4 billion, and adjusted EPS increased by 26%, both excluding reportable catastrophes.\nOur results were driven by the strength of our homeowners business within Global Housing, which delivered adjusted EBITDA growth of nearly 65%, excluding cats. In addition, our Connected Living business continued to grow, supported by our strong U.S. partnerships with mobile carriers and cable operators, and our ability to innovate and execute for our clients. Together, Lifestyle and Housing generated nearly $775 million in dividends. This allowed us to return over $350 million to shareholders, including $200 million of share repurchases. 2023 was a testament to the power and attractive financial profile of our unique and differentiated Lifestyle and Housing businesses.\nAssurant would not have been able to achieve this level of success without our talented people, including our newly refreshed management committee, further strengthening our leadership team. As we celebrate our 20th year as a public company, I am proud of the world-class culture we've created, exemplified by the many recognitions Assurant has received throughout 2023. Earlier this week, JUST 100 included Assurant as part of its 2024 rankings of America's most JUST companies, recognizing our commitment to serving our employees, customers, communities the environment and our shareholders. In addition, we received recognition from Fortune as 1 of America's most innovative companies, and Newsweek recognized the progress we've made to incorporate sustainability into our strategy by placing us on its list of America's most responsible companies. The dedication from our employees and leadership team, who strive to achieve our vision every day, makes it possible to innovate to better serve our clients and create value for our shareholders.\nWe begin 2024 in a position of strength and with great momentum. Over the past 2 years, we focused on further strengthening our business portfolio and driving operational excellence while accelerating innovation. By investing in businesses where we have leadership positions, we believe we're well positioned for future success. For instance, within Global Lifestyle, we've grown our presence in specialized markets, including in the commercial equipment space, where acquisitions have contributed to new client partnerships. We've strengthened our company through active portfolio management, making decisions to exit businesses that are not core to our long-term strategy. This included exiting our sharing economy offerings and international cat exposed businesses in Housing, further simplifying our portfolio.\nWe've made significant progress in driving operational excellence across Assurant with a streamlined organizational structure and real estate footprint. We've implemented Digital First initiatives across our operations to support our businesses and drive value for end consumers. Finally, we've accelerated innovation in a variety of ways to drive our business growth. Moving forward, technology innovation will continue to be an important driver of growth and value creation for Assurant.\nOur approach has driven success within our financial results, and is evident in our track record of winning new business and renewing client partnerships. This expansion of our client base is an integral part of our strategy and creates important tailwinds as we look toward the future.\nNow turning to highlights across our business segments. For 2023, Global Lifestyle earnings were relatively flat on a constant currency basis. In Connected Living, 2023 represented another year of growth for the business, with a 3% increase in earnings. Within our U.S. business, we drove high single-digit EBITDA growth as we continue to innovate and execute for our growing carrier and cable operator clients through our device protection programs. We strengthened critical partnerships, including Spectrum Mobile, where we provide mobile protection, trade-in and other value-added services. In addition, we expanded our trade-in programs with major OEMs by adding a large new partner as well as renewing AT&T, where we're deploying robotics in our mobile device facilities throughout the U.S.\nWe continue to make progress internationally. In Europe, we stabilized earnings by driving expense efficiencies while continuing to address ongoing macroeconomic challenges. Throughout Asia Pacific, we're excited by our market position and our long-term outlook. We're very pleased to announce a new partnership with Telstra, Australia's largest mobile operator. Our new multiyear deal will allow us to provide comprehensive products to support the end-to-end device life cycle for Telstra's broad base of customers, including their core mobile protection program as well as trade-in and repair capabilities. This partnership is significant as we continue to build our presence in Asia Pacific.\nTurning to Auto. Year-over-year declines were driven by inflationary impacts on claims costs. Beginning in 2022, we took decisive action to address significant inflation that impacted the auto repair industry. For the handful of deal structures, where we've been negatively impacted by underwriting results, we successfully partnered with our clients to implement meaningful rate increases, while making important changes to strengthen and enhance our claims adjudication process. Given the longer average duration of our auto service contracts, we'll earn through the full benefit of these actions over time, with improvement expected to begin in 2024.\nBased on the actions taken in Auto and the continued growth of Connected Living, we feel well positioned to deliver Global Lifestyle growth in 2024.\nLet's move on to Global Housing. In 2023, this segment grew significantly, driving our overall enterprise performance. The growth was led by our homeowners business, which was supported by higher premiums and in-force policy growth. The business rebounded from the inflation impacts on claims experienced in 2022 and also benefited from favorable prior year reserve development.\nIn addition to highlighting the significant earnings power of the business, our '23 housing results demonstrated differentiated returns and strong cash flow. Excluding favorable prior year development, our 2023 combined ratio was 83%, including $111 million of reportable cats, which was below our assumed annual cat load of $140 million.\nWe are also very pleased to announce a new partnership in our lender-placed business. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, we'll provide lender-placed insurance services to Bank of America's $1.8 million loan portfolio, further enhancing our market position and validating the competitive strength of our offerings. In renters and other, we increased earnings modestly in 2023 as our property management channel continued to expand. Written premiums in the property management channel grew nearly 20% in 2023. Along with adding new clients, we also achieved double-digit growth across 8 of our top 10 PMC clients, creating significant business momentum. Growth was supported by the continued expansion of Cover360, we now track over 1 million residents, a nearly 45% increase over the prior year. Technology innovation also enhanced our digital customer experience, including a new digital agent leasing portal and expanded claims processing powered by machine learning.\nLet's turn to our 2024 enterprise outlook. We expect continued profitable growth in 2024, driven by our business momentum. While growth is expected to be lower than the significant outperformance we delivered in 2023, we expect our '24 results will demonstrate the combined earnings power of our advantaged portfolio. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, is expected to grow mid-single digits, with Global Lifestyle and Global Housing delivering similar growth rates for the year. Adjusted EPS growth is expected to modestly trail adjusted EBITDA growth, primarily reflecting higher annual depreciation expenses related to technology investments critical in executing our strategy.\nBefore concluding, I'd like to introduce our recently appointed CFO, Keith Meier. Keith has been with Assurant for over 25 years and has served in leadership positions managing P&Ls across many of Assurant's businesses. In his most recent role as Chief Operating Officer, Keith led the transformation of our technology and drove significant operational efforts to support the end customer experience. I have no doubt that Keith, as our CFO, will be an enabler of driving profitable growth while allocating capital strategically.\nNow over to Keith to review our quarterly results and 2024 outlook in further detail.\n\nKeith Roland Meier\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Before reviewing the quarterly results, I'd like to share my perspectives as I'm about to wrap up my first 90 days as Assurant's CFO. During my time at Assurant, I've been fortunate to have led several businesses as well as take on a variety of other roles across the organization, including most recently, leading our technology and operational teams. These experiences have provided me with deep insights into our global clients and the understanding of what is needed to deliver a high level of business performance, always backed by strong financial expertise and discipline.\nAs CFO, driving growth and financial performance will continue to be my priorities. I'm focused on ensuring our capital position remains strong as we create additional shareholder value and drive profitable growth through further innovation and differentiation within our product portfolio.\nAs I look toward the future, I'm also focused on continued expense efficiencies by utilizing digital and AI technology, which also enables us to deliver better customer experiences. Lastly, I appreciated the opportunity to meet with many of our investors, employees and clients over the last several months and their willingness to share observations about Assurant as I began my tenure as CFO. Our discussions have enabled me to better shape my views and the path going forward.\nNow let's talk about our fourth quarter financial results, which reinforce the strength of our businesses and the performance that we've seen throughout the year. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 29% to $382 million, and adjusted EPS increased by 38% to $4.90, both excluding reportable catastrophes. Adjusted earnings and EPS growth were driven by year-over-year growth in both Housing and Lifestyle. Our capital position remains strong, generating $280 million of segment dividends in the fourth quarter and ending the year with $606 million of holding company liquidity. This allowed us to return $169 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $130 million of share repurchases.\nLet's review the businesses, beginning with Global Lifestyle. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 12% to $205 million, led by strong earnings growth of 23% within Connected Living as our U.S. mobile protection programs continued to grow. Higher yields on invested assets also contributed to the improved fourth quarter results.\nGlobally, our trade-in programs represent a critical component of our device life cycle value proposition, as well as a fee-based income driver supporting the growth of our mobile business. Throughout 2023, we serviced over 25 million devices, including 75 million in the fourth quarter, which represented a high watermark for the year. While trade-in results were down modestly year-over-year, we saw fee income growth from higher sale prices for used devices and contributions from new U.S. trade-in programs.\nInternationally, we continue to be impacted by subscriber declines in Japan, but have stabilized performance in a challenging macroeconomic backdrop.\nIn Global Auto, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was relatively flat as higher claims costs from inflation were offset by higher investment income. Claims were also elevated from the expected normalization of auto ancillary products and from international clients.\nDuring the latter part of the year, we saw positive signs in U.S. loss trends as we began to benefit from prospective rate increases that were implemented.\nTurning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle grew by $268 million or 13%. Growth from Global Automotive, which increased 14%, was due to $85 million of non-run rate premium adjustments with no corresponding earnings impact as well as prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living net earned premiums, fees and other income increased 12%, benefiting from contributions from new trade-in programs, higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA to grow, driven by both Connected Living and Global Automotive.\nWe expect growth in Connected Living to be led by the continued expansion of our U.S. business. We expect Japan and Europe to remain generally stable throughout the year.\nIn Global Auto, we expect rate actions taken over the past 18 months to drive improvement over time, beginning in 2024. Investments related to new client implementations will temper growth in 2024 for Lifestyle, but are critical levers to expand our portfolio and strengthen our business over the long term. We continue to monitor foreign exchange impacts, broader macroeconomic conditions and interest rates, which may impact the pace and timing of growth.\nIn terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, lifestyle is expected to grow mainly from our Connected Living business.\nMoving to Global Housing. 2023 was truly a strong year. We drove growth from the actions taken over the past few years to ensure rate adequacy and drive expense leverage while benefiting from the streamlining that we undertook to simplify our portfolio. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $186 million, which included $22 million of reportable cats. Excluding reportable cats, adjusted EBITDA increased by nearly 50% or $68 million to $208 million. 2/3 of the increase was driven by favorable non-cat loss experience in homeowners including a favorable year-over-year impact of $35 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $40 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to a $5 million reduction in the fourth quarter of 2022. The remainder of the adjusted EBITDA increase was from continued top line growth in homeowners from higher premiums and an increase in the number of in-force policies. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth.\nGrowth was partially offset by incremental expenses to support new business, and an increase to our catastrophe reinsurance premium.\nFor renters and other, earnings were flat as growth in our property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2024, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable cats, to grow, driven by continued top line momentum in homeowners.\nIn 2023, we benefited from $54 million of favorable prior year reserve development. Our expectation is to deliver growth in housing in 2024, overcoming the $54 million of favorable prior year reserve development, demonstrating the strength of the housing business.\nAs Keith discussed, we will begin onboarding 1.8 million loans from Bank of America in the first quarter. When fully onboarded, we expect the placement rate of the book to be below Assurant's current portfolio average of 1.8%, which may impact overall placement rate trends. Due to implementation expenses, we do not expect these loans to contribute significantly to adjusted EBITDA in 2024.\nIn terms of our cat reinsurance program, we have transitioned to a single April 1 placement date beginning this year. This greatly simplifies our placement process, while maintaining comprehensive coverage in the market. As this is a transition year, we placed virtually all of our 2024 program in January, with some smaller components remaining for the April placement. For our 2024 program, our per event retention will increase to $150 million, aligning with a 1- and 5-year probable maximum loss or PML, as we continue to optimize risk and return. This is consistent with our 2023 program.\nWe've expanded our risk protection to align with exposure by increasing our top end limit to protect against a 1 in 265 PML event. Over the past 2 years, we've continued to increase our capital protection, increasing the top end of our program from a 1 in 174 PML in 2022 and to a 1 in 225 PML in 2023 and now a 1 in 265 PML in 2024.\nReflecting on these expected changes, we now estimate the appropriate cat load to be $155 million for 2024.\nGiven the exit of our international property business, and the better market pricing as we leverage our strong reinsurer relationships, we expect a modest overall cost savings in 2024. We will provide further updates on the reinsurance program in May.\nMoving to Corporate. The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $30 million, a $3 million year-over-year increase, mainly due to higher employee-related expenses. For 2024, we expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million.\nTurning to capital management. As we look forward to 2024, we expect to continue to generate significant capital and focus on maintaining balance and flexibility to support business growth. For the full year, we expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows, approximating 2/3 of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable cats.\nCash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current macroeconomic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements.\nWe repurchased $200 million of common stock in 2023, and currently expect share repurchases to be in the range of $200 million to $300 million for 2024, which will depend on strategic M&A opportunities, market conditions and cat activity. As you can see, we are well positioned to deliver another year of growth in 2024 through the power of the Assurant franchise.\nI'll now turn the call back to Keith Demmings to share his views on performance as supported by our differentiated business model. Keith?\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nI'd like to take a few minutes to discuss why we believe that Assurant is so attractively valued today. Assurant is a powerful differentiated business with unique advantages that have outperformed over time. Our B2B2C business model throughout Lifestyle and Housing is different from other insurers and service-oriented companies. Not only do we operate in a unique, highly specialized and attractive markets, but we hold strong market positions and benefit from our scale.\nAt our core, we provide specialty insurance solutions and fee-based services that are often deeply integrated with our large clients as we play an important role in delivering services to their end customers. Our alignment with industry leaders and market disruptors has helped us generate significant scale within our businesses. Our competitive advantages are further strengthened by our broad set of capabilities that allow us to innovate and execute for our partners and customers, enabling us to be flexible and agile.\nWe have compelling and unique aspects of our business model that we believe create advantages. Our low capital intensity businesses allow us to grow efficiently, while generating additional capital for deployment. This is evident through our capital efficiency and strong cash generation of $3.5 billion over the last 5 years.\nOur risk profile is attractive. Earnings volatility is lowered by the risk-sharing structures within our business models, reducing the impacts of macroeconomic volatility. For example, throughout Connected Living and Global Auto, approximately 2/3 of total risk is reinsured or profit shared to our partners. Within Housing, our portfolio simplification efforts have focused on exiting more capital-intensive businesses, which has enhanced our risk profile. In addition, our robust catastrophe program substantially limits retained risk due to the low per occurrence retention level and high limit at the top end of the tower.\nLastly, we're well positioned to adjust pricing to enable our targeted rates of return. Lender placed is a prime example where our product has a built-in annual inflation guard feature to ensure policy pricing accounts for higher labor and materials cost as we've seen over the last 2 years. In Auto, most of our client deal structures share in the risk through reinsurance or profit shares. This creates close alignment between Assurant's underlying economics and our clients' financial results. Given this dynamic, we have the ability to adjust rates together with our clients to account for inflation impacts in the broader market.\nOver the past 18 months, we've successfully worked with our clients to put through prospective rate increases on new vehicle service contracts.\nFinancial performance is paramount for Assurant. While growth may not always be linear, we've delivered average annual earnings and EPS growth of double digits since 2019, which has generated significant cash flow. Our 2024 outlook adds to this historical growth that we've delivered.\nTo demonstrate the strength of our business model, we thought it would be useful to show how we performed versus a broad group of insurers on an adjusted earnings basis given the available data. Please keep in mind, this example is not to suggest a new peer group. We've selected the S&P 1500 P&C Index to highlight our performance against a credible and broad index that includes members we are often compared to, including specialty and P&C insurers. Over the past 5 years, we've grown double digits and outperformed the index. Our average annual adjusted earnings growth rate, excluding cats, up 12%, is almost double the index growth rate of 7% over the same time period.\nIncluding reportable cats, we've also outpaced the market, driving 10% average annual growth versus the index growth rate of 6%. We believe that our consistent ability to demonstrate strong, profitable growth and returns with lower volatility and required capital makes Assurant attractively valued. I'm confident that we'll continue to drive long-term profitable growth and create shareholder value.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin.\n\nSuzanne Shepherd\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Sustainability\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the third quarter of 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplements are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to our non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplements.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with the exceptionally strong results we achieved in the third quarter with adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, growing nearly 50% year-over-year or 19% on a year-to-date basis, both ahead of our expectations.\nOur results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing and our steadfast focus on executing our strategy, including driving innovation, creating efficiencies and strengthening our global partnerships. These efforts have positioned us to exceed our previous expectations of high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth, excluding catastrophes.\nWe now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of mid- to high-teens. Our year-to-date performance highlights Assurant's competitive differentiators, including our Advantaged Global Housing and Global Lifestyle businesses that have proven leadership positions with scale and significant cash generation. Combined, these businesses are extending Assurant's track record of strong financial performance, thanks in part to the swift actions we've taken across our global operations to improve results and strengthen the business given broader macroeconomic headwinds.\nWe continue to realize benefits from the actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and corporate real estate and realign our organizational structure, allowing us to reinvest throughout the enterprise. We extended our 2022 restructuring plan to include additional actions across the enterprise as we believe further enhancing Assurant's operational efficiency will support our long-term profitable growth and value creation.\nWe now expect total restructuring costs associated with our extended plan to be between $90 million and $95 million pretax, above our previously announced expectations of $60 million to $65 million.\nLooking at our business segments. In Global Housing, I want to thank all of our employees who supported policyholders impacted by Hurricane Idalia and the Hawaii wildfires as well as several other significant weather events during the quarter.\nAssurant plays a critical role in safeguarding our policyholders and supporting the U.S. mortgage industry. Our Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, more than doubled year-over-year and increased 72% year-to-date, led by significant growth in our homeowners business through top line growth and improving loss experience.\nOur ability to quickly execute changes, particularly in our lender-placed business, has helped us gain earnings momentum from higher in-force policies, average insured values and state-approved rate increases following inflation impacts in 2022.\nOur performance so far this year highlights Global Housing's compelling and uniquely positioned portfolio. Year-to-date, including $89 million of reportable catastrophes, our combined ratio is 82% and our annualized ROE is 29%, demonstrating strong returns and cash generation.\nIn our Renters business, we saw continued strength in our property management channel, where policies in-force have grown double digits this year. We continue to win new clients, grow existing partnerships and release new capabilities, including our upgraded leasing agent portal and digital insurance tracking enhancements.\nWe're very pleased with Global Housing's strong performance year-to-date, which reflects our focused execution around streamlined product lines where we have a clear competitive advantage and scale.\nTurning to Global Lifestyle. Third quarter earnings increased 7% year-over-year or 14% excluding a onetime client benefit within Connected Living last year. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA down 6% versus the same period in '22 has continued to improve throughout the year and is tracking in line with our expectations of a modest decline for the full year.\nWithin Connected Living, we continue to support long-term growth through the development of innovative offerings for our partners. U.S. Connected Living is poised for another year of solid growth, particularly within our mobile protection business, a testament to our breadth of innovative offerings, customer experience expertise and deep relationships with mobile carriers and cable operators.\nAs macroeconomic headwinds have persisted, including impacts from inflation, we've taken decisive action across our global operations to mitigate these impacts. In Europe, expense actions have allowed us to stabilize earnings as we focus on critical opportunities to grow our top line. We also continue to invest to advance product innovation and anticipate our clients' needs as well as improve customer experience through expanded service delivery capabilities. For example, as part of the extension of our '22 plan to realize benefits and simplify our business in corporate real estate, we're consolidating our mobile device care centers into 2 sites in the U.S.\nWe'll move the services currently offered in York, Pennsylvania to our existing facility in Texas. Over time, we'll be investing in a new site in Nashville, where we can leverage a strong talent market and greater logistics efficiencies as we evolve with emerging clients.\nTurning to our Global Auto business. We're beginning to see initial signs of claims improvement, as a result of the decisive actions taken over the last year to improve performance. These actions included implementing rate increases on new policies across impacted clients and advancing opportunities to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. We continue to monitor claims costs closely and expect improvement will be gradual over time given the way the auto business earns.\nIn auto, we launched Assurant Vehicle Care at over 500 dealers. Building on decades of proprietary data on cost of claims, Assurant Vehicle Care is a comprehensive new suite of vehicle protection products. It was developed to help our dealer partners optimize product design, pricing, training and sales to ultimately enhance attachment and economics. For the consumer, Assurant Vehicle Care provides a digital experience with more vehicle coverage, flexibility and transparency.\nNow let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given our year-to-date results and our business outlook for the remainder of 2023, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to grow mid- to high-teens, excluding catastrophes. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to exceed adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding catastrophes. This is primarily due to higher earnings growth that now more than offsets the increase in depreciation expense.\nFrom a capital perspective, we upstreamed $202 million of segment dividends during the third quarter and $493 million year-to-date. We ended the third quarter with $491 million of holding company liquidity consistent with the end of the second quarter.\nIn terms of share repurchases, during the third quarter, repurchases totaled $50 million. This brings our total repurchases to approximately $100 million for the year, including an additional $30 million of shares purchased through the end of October. Based on our strong year-to-date results, we expect fourth quarter buybacks to accelerate from third quarter levels and to be approximately $200 million for the year, consistent with our underlying repurchase activity in 2022. We're pleased with our strong capital position, which affords us more long-term flexibility over time.\nLooking to 2024, we expect a more modest level of earnings growth in Global Housing, excluding catastrophes, building on strong 2023 financial results, which included $40 million of favorable prior year reserve development.\nIn Global Lifestyle, we expect earnings growth to be led by Connected Living, particularly in the U.S. from the expansion of current programs, as we work to gradually improve the auto business, which we will continue to manage closely.\nFrom a capital perspective, we're committed to maintaining flexibility for our strong balance sheet and deploying capital for share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions to support our growth objectives. We will share our 2024 outlook in February, factoring in our fourth quarter earnings, business trends as well as the latest forecast of the macro environment for the year.\nIn the near term, we're focused on achieving our 2023 objectives and setting a path for continued growth and value creation in 2024 and beyond. As we look ahead, we remain committed to execution, innovation and enhancing the customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, particularly as we look to capitalize on growth opportunities while supporting continued momentum.\nBefore I turn the call over to Richard to review the third quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail, I want to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to deliver for our clients.\nOur company was recently recognized as one of TIME'S best companies in the world, highlighting Assurant's strong employee satisfaction, revenue growth and sustainability efforts. Assurant was also recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greatest companies demonstrating our commitment to and progress in operating more sustainably.\nThe recognition was timely as we recently introduced Carbon IQ by Assurant. This offering enables clients to see the carbon impact of each device, including new and refurbished devices and provides them with estimated CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain and life cycle to identify opportunities for reduction.\nWe're honored to be recognized for our outstanding culture, products and sustainability all of which help us better serve our clients. And now over to Richard.\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $357 million, up $118 million or nearly 50% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.68 for the quarter, delivering year-over-year growth of 67%.\nTo review results in greater detail, let's start with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $192 million in the third quarter, an increase of $12 million or 7% year-over-year. As a reminder, prior period results included a onetime client benefit of $11 million within Connected Living. Excluding the prior period gain, Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 14% or $24 million. This increase was primarily driven by higher contributions from investment income and mobile growth. Connected Living earnings increased $30 million or 32% excluding the onetime client benefit, demonstrating strong mobile growth from North American device protection programs from carrier and cable operator clients and better trade-in performance.\nFinancial Services also contributed to the growth. Trading results benefited from improved margins related to higher sales prices for used devices, partially offset by lower volumes, impacted by the timing and structure of carrier promotions.\nIn Europe, we stabilized performance through expense actions, mitigating the impact of headwinds that began in the second half of 2022. In Japan, results were impacted by subscriber decline which is expected to continue into 2024.\nGlobal Auto adjusted EBITDA declined $6 million or 8%. Results continue to be impacted by inflation of labor and parts leading to higher average claims costs. As expected, claims experience for auto ancillary products has also contributed to higher incurred claims costs in the quarter.\nThe auto earnings decline was partially offset by an increase in investment income from higher yields and asset values.\nTurning to net earned premiums fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $83 million or 4%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting an increase of 6% from prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living's net earned premium fees and other income increased 3%. Growth was muted by the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes of approximately $55 million with no corresponding impact to profitability. Excluding the impact of these contract changes, Connected Living's net earned premium fees and other income grew by 8%.\nThe quarter benefited from higher prices on used mobile devices and modest growth in North America mobile subscribers, excluding ongoing client runoff.\nTurning to the full year 2023. We continue to expect Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA to decline modestly. Global Auto will be down for the full year from unfavorable loss experience, including the impacts from continued normalization for select ancillary products previously mentioned. We've taken decisive actions this year in response to higher claims experience in our auto book, including prospective rate increases and repair cost reduction. While we've seen some improvement, the improvement is expected to take place over a longer period of time given the earnings pattern of the business.\nIn Connected Living, we expect our U.S. business to grow for the full year. Overall, we are pleased with Lifestyle's strong third quarter performance, especially in light of ongoing challenges in auto claims. For the fourth quarter, we expect higher trade-in volumes in mobile, but we also expect ongoing top line challenges in Japan and Europe and investments to support business growth. In terms of full year net earned premiums, fees and other income, Lifestyle is expected to grow consistent with year-to-date trends.\nMoving to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $165 million, which included $26 million in reportable catastrophes, primarily from Hurricane Adelia and Hawaii wildfires. Excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $191 million, with an increase of $106 million.\nHousing performance was mainly led by 3 main items: First, continued top line growth in homeowners from higher premium rates and average insured values in lender-placed as well as an increase in the number of in-force policies. Second, favorable non-cat loss experience across the segment, including a year-over-year positive impact of $39 million related to prior period reserve development. This was comprised of $15 million of reserve reductions in the current quarter compared to reserve strengthening of $24 million in the prior period.\nAnd lastly, additional scale within our homeowners expense base ultimately driving stronger operating leverage. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth for homeowners.\nFor Renters and Others, earnings grew modestly from favorable prior period reserve development. Growth within the property management channel was offset by softer affinity channel volumes. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to the strong homeowners performance, driven by top line expansion in lender-placed and favorable non-cat loss experience.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect higher expenses to support business growth. In addition, the third quarter included $15 million of favorable prior period development.\nMoving to corporate. The third quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $26 million, representing a modest year-over-year increase, mainly related to higher employee expenses. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million.\nTurning to holding company liquidity. We ended the quarter with $491 million and dividends from our operating segments totaled $202 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, third quarter cash outflows included 3 items: $50 million of share repurchases, $37 million for common stock dividends and $50 million to complete the repayment of our September 2023 notes.\nAs Keith mentioned, given our year-to-date performance and outlook for the year as well as the strength of Assurant's balance sheet, we expect to achieve full year share repurchases of approximately $200 million.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect our businesses to generate meaningful cash flows, approximating 65% of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements.\nIn closing, through the resilience of our unique business model, the decisive management actions taken and our intense client focus, we are confident in our ability to achieve the higher full year objectives we have outlined today.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin.\n\nSuzanne Shepherd\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Sustainability\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2023 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the second quarter of 2023. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement as well as in our SEC reports. During today's call, we will refer to our non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Our results in the second quarter were strong and well ahead of our expectations with adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, growing 21% year-over-year or a total of 6% on a year-to-date basis. Results were largely driven by continued momentum in Global Housing, primarily from higher top line growth and more favorable loss experience from prior period development on claims. Our performance is a testament to the resilience of our global business model, our compelling client offerings and steadfast focus on operational excellence.\nLooking at our business segments. Global Housing adjusted EBITDA increased 49% year-to-date, excluding catastrophes. These results reflect actions taken to transform our Housing business, including focusing on product lines where we have a strong right to win, dramatically reducing noncore areas and our international catastrophe exposure and aggressively deploying digital solutions to improve customer experience while driving greater operational efficiencies. This underscores our ability to quickly respond to ever-evolving market dynamics driving continuous improvement and better performance over time.\nDuring the first half of 2023, top line performance in our Homeowners business increased 18% year-over-year. This reflects higher average insured values and state-approved rate increases to account for higher claim severities from inflationary factors in lender-placed. Policy counts increased double digits this year from expanded loan portfolios of new and existing clients. While policy growth has been a contributor so far this year, we expect to level off from the first half of the year.\nIn our Renters business, our property management company distribution channel has shown strong policy growth year-to-date, increasing 14%. This has been driven by the ongoing rollout of our Cover360 solution, one of the many long-term investments we've made in Renters that has consistently added value to our PMC partners and customers over the last several years. Our strong growth within the PMC channel has helped to diversify profit pools to partially offset lower contributions from our affinity partners, along with higher non-cat losses, which have returned to more normalized levels. In summary, we're very pleased with Global Housing's performance year-to-date and expect strong year-over-year earnings growth to continue into the second half of 2023.\nTurning to Global Lifestyle. Underlying segment results were solid and demonstrated steady improvement from the second half of last year. Lifestyle earnings for the first 6 months of the year have increased $34 million or 9% over the second half of last year, from improved Connected Living results. Within Connected Living, we continue to invest in our technology platforms as we deepen our focus on product innovation and evolving our service delivery capabilities to improve customer experience. Our focus on innovation and global trade-in capabilities has continued to drive a significant level of interest from existing and prospective mobile partners. As we continue to realize ongoing efficiencies, we've implemented [ expense ] actions to mitigate macroeconomic headwinds throughout our global operations.\nIn Europe, these actions have had a positive impact, ultimately helping to stabilize earnings and allowing us to remain focused on growing the top line. Within extended service contracts, we've made significant progress with our partners in executing large-scale protection and administration programs. In addition, after several quarters of elevated claim severity, we've seen an improvement in the second quarter loss ratio due to rate increases with several clients.\nIn our Global Auto business, consistent across the industry, our repair costs have continued to increase from inflation. We've taken decisive actions to improve performance. For example, we've implemented prospective rate increases with several key clients, and we're also partnering with our clients to identify cost savings on claims to improve loss experience for programs where we hold the risk. It's difficult to predict the timing of an earnings inflection point, but we expect to see continued improvements as new business earned through although improvement may take several quarters to materialize.\nOverall, Global Lifestyle earnings were in line with our expectations for the first half of 2023. And while we work to create new vectors of growth for Lifestyle, we now anticipate Global Lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA will be down modestly for the full year. This is mainly due to the headwinds in Global Auto we just discussed and lower international contributions primarily from Japan.\nReflecting on the first half of 2023, our results have demonstrated the attractiveness of our compelling business model with clear competitive advantages, including alignment with global market leaders across lines of business, leadership positions with scale advantages in attractive and growing lifestyle and housing markets, demonstrated ability to innovate and differentiate through specialized solutions and a strong track record of taking decisive actions to overcome market challenges and drive performance. Combined, Global Lifestyle and Global Housing should continue to generate strong returns and cash flow, highlighting the strength and resiliency of Assurant.\nPrior to moving to our enterprise outlook and results, I want to take a moment to discuss the progress we've made through our sustainability efforts, a key differentiator for Assurant. In June, we published our 2023 sustainability report, reaffirming our long-term priorities around talent, products and climate. The report highlights our progress in reinforcing our company culture and leveraging ongoing employee listening and feedback to help support our global diverse workforce. The report reaffirms our 2020 to 2025 ESG strategic focus areas of talent, products and climate to build a more sustainable future together with our clients, customers, employees and suppliers. We continue to view our commitment to sustainability as a competitive advantage that delivers short and long-term business value. Of note, we achieved our 2025 supplier diversity target 2 years ahead of schedule. We increased our global gender diversity overall; we expanded coverage for electric vehicle protection products and we repurposed 22 million mobile devices globally.\nNow let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital. Given first half results and anticipated performance for the remainder of the year, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to grow high single digits, excluding cats. This represents an increase from our original expectation of low single-digit growth. Adjusted EPS growth is now expected to approximate adjusted EBITDA growth, each excluding reportable catastrophes, an improvement over our previous expectations for EPS growth to trail our EBITDA growth. The increase is mainly due to our higher-than-expected adjusted EBITDA growth, which is now outpacing the increases to depreciation and tax expenses.\nFrom a capital perspective, we upstreamed $180 million of segment dividends during the quarter and $292 million year-to-date, nearly half of segment adjusted EBITDA, including cats. We ended the quarter with $495 million of holding company liquidity, a significantly higher level than at the end of the first quarter. As expected, we resumed share repurchases during the second quarter, repurchasing $20 million of common stock as well as an additional $10 million throughout July. For the remainder of the year, we would expect to gradually accelerate our level of buybacks with the majority weighted toward the fourth quarter, keeping in mind third quarter is hurricane season, and we will look to preserve our capital flexibility.\nFor 2023, we don't currently expect to exceed the 2022 underlying buyback activity of $200 million. Overall, it's been a strong first half of the year, and we're well positioned for the full year. In both Housing and Lifestyle, it will be critical for us to continue to execute through innovation and enhanced customer experience for our clients and their end consumers, which is what differentiates Assurant and supports long-term growth.\nI'll now turn the call over to Richard to review second quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail. Richard?\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $337 million, up $59 million or 21% year-over-year. And adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $4.09 for the quarter, up 26% year-over-year.\nLet's start with Global Lifestyle for our segment results. This segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $197 million in the second quarter, an 11% decline year-over-year. However, prior period results included a real estate joint venture gain of $13 million, mainly impacting Global Automotive. If we exclude this prior period gain, adjusted EBITDA declined only 5% or $11 million, in line with our expectations. This decrease was primarily driven by lower results in Global Auto as continued inflationary impacts on labor and parts increased average claim severities. We also incurred increased claims cost on ancillary products as these costs revert to more normalized levels following their post-COVID lows. The Auto earnings decline was partially offset by higher investment income from higher yields and growth in the U.S. across distribution channels.\nIn terms of Connected Living, excluding the prior period real estate gain and $3 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, earnings were roughly flat. In Mobile, earnings were down from soft results in Japan and Europe, as expected. As a reminder, headwinds in international earnings did not materialize until the second half of 2022. In Japan, we continue to experience subscriber declines as our 4-year protection product continues to run off. And in Europe, while we are benefiting from previous expense actions taken in the latter part of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, lower volumes have impacted year-over-year results.\nU.S. mobile earnings were flat year-over-year as growth in North American device protection programs from carrier and cable operator clients was offset by lower mobile trade-in results. Trading results were impacted by lower volumes due to the timing and structure of carrier promotions and lower fee income from the previously disclosed contract change. However, higher prices on used devices partially offset the decline. Extended service contract earnings increased as U.S. client performance improved, benefiting the rate increases implemented from several clients that began to offset the impact of higher claims costs.\nTurning to [ net earned ] premium fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $96 million or 5%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living net earned premiums fees and other income increased 1%. However, this includes an approximate $60 million negative impact from the previously disclosed mobile program contract changes, which had no impact on profitability. Excluding these contract changes, Connected Living net earned premiums, fees and other income grew by 6%.\nThe quarter benefited from growth in mobile subscribers in North America, excluding client runoff and higher contributions from extended service contracts. For the full year 2023, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be down modestly for Global Lifestyle. Global Auto is expected to be down for the full year as we anticipate loss experience to remain unfavorable for several quarters and the impacts from continued normalization of loss experience for select ancillary products previously mentioned. As Keith described, we've taken specific actions such as rate increases on new business, repair cost reduction and changes to client contract structures to help mitigate these impacts, which is why we expect an increase in profitability over time. Higher investment income has and is expected to continue to partially offset these impacts.\nIn Connected Living, we do expect our U.S. Connected Living business to grow modestly for the full year. As a reminder, third quarter results historically include both lower trade-in volumes and higher loss seasonality. These items typically improve in the fourth quarter. In addition, our third quarter results last year included an $11 million onetime client benefit in Connected Living. And while Japan and Europe have stabilized, we are focused on top line growth, which has been slower to materialize than expected. Finally, we will also continue to focus on expenses while investing in growth opportunities, we have strong momentum with clients. In terms of net earned premiums, fees and other income for the full year, Lifestyle is expected to grow as growth in Global Automotive is partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds.\nMoving now to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $155 million, which included $13 million in reportable catastrophes from severe windstorms in the Southeast U.S. and flooding in Florida. Excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted EBITDA more than doubled to $168 million [ were up ] $87 million from both top line growth and favorable non-cat loss experience within homeowners.\nTop line growth in lender-placed came from higher average insured values and premium rates as well as more policies in force. These together accounted for approximately half of the increase in earnings. Favorable non-GAAP loss experience came from a $40 million year-over-year net reduction in reserves related to prior period development and is comprised of a $28 million reserve reduction in the current quarter plus a $12 million reserve strengthening in the second quarter of '22. Excluding prior period development, non-cat loss experience increased modestly due to the increase in frequency and severity. Higher investment income also contributed to earnings growth.\nTurning to our reinsurance program. We completed our 2023 catastrophe reinsurance program in June. We fared well in the market with this year's total cost increasing less than previously expected and only modestly over 2022. This increase is relatively small due to strategic actions taken, including exiting our international footprint, increasing our level of retention and adjusting our reinsurance coverage. As anticipated, our first event retention increased to $125 million from its previous level of $80 million and the retention level reduces to $100 million for second and third events. We also increased our total program coverage to a one in 225-year probable maximum loss to further minimize our risk from extreme catastrophes.\nMoving to Renters and Other. Earnings increased largely due to a benefit within our NFIP flood business of $5 million. Excluding this item, results were in line with 2022. For the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable cats, to grow significantly due to strong performance in homeowners, driven by top line expansion from lender-placed. Regarding the second half of the year, we expect ongoing momentum from a continued gradual abatement of inflation, lower seasonal losses particularly in the fourth quarter and continued revenue strength. This momentum should offset a modest increase in catastrophe reinsurance costs in the absence of both another NFIP benefit and additional favorable reserve development, which can be difficult to predict. Together, these last 2 items contributed $33 million to our first half results.\nMoving to Corporate. The second quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $29 million, up $4 million from lower investment income. For the full year 2023, we expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to be approximately $105 million. I would also mention that the investment portfolio continues to perform well with higher interest rates improving both short- and longer-term returns.\nTurning to Holding Company Liquidity. We ended the quarter with $495 million. In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $180 million. In addition to cash used for corporate and interest expenses, second quarter cash outflows included 3 main items: $20 million of share repurchases, $40 million of common stock dividends and $50 million related to previous acquisitions within Global Auto. For the full year, we expect our businesses to continue to generate meaningful cash flows, approximating 65% of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. This is consistent with our previous forecast. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current economic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory requirements.\nIn closing, we're quite pleased with our first half overall performance, which continues to demonstrate the strength and the diversity of our businesses and believe we are well positioned to achieve our increased full year financial objectives.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident-Global Lifestyle, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased by our first quarter results, which reflected better-than-expected performance within our Global Housing business and our ongoing focus on driving operating excellence across Assurant. The actions we announced in 2022 to simplify our business and real estate portfolio realign our organizational structure and accelerate the deployment of digital-first experiences are beginning to yield measurable results.\nWhile early, gross savings generated from these initiatives are helping to mitigate the impact of broader macroeconomic headwinds and fund additional critical investments in innovation and our talent. This was reflected in Global Lifestyle's results for the quarter, which improved sequentially in line with our expectations. Our first quarter results also continued to demonstrate the leadership advantages of our well-diversified business portfolio and our global client base. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver on our financial objectives for 2023, and we will continue to prudently manage our capital to drive shareholder value.\nLooking ahead, we'll maintain a steadfast focus on execution: first, by strengthening and expanding our global partnerships; second, by driving innovation and delivering on our digital-first vision to improve the customer experience; and third, by realizing savings from ongoing expense management efforts. Recently, we were recognized as one of America's most innovative companies by Fortune, demonstrating the importance we place on finding new ways to serve our clients and fostering a culture of innovation and inclusion.\nThrough consumer research and investments in emerging technologies, we develop new products and services to meaningfully enhance the consumer experience, and drive competitive advantages across our key markets, including mobile, auto and housing. We continue to strengthen our large embedded base of businesses.\nIn Global Lifestyle, we work with 15 of the top 50 most valuable global brands and provide protection and services for nearly 62 million mobile subscribers with a recurring monthly subscription service and we protect nearly 54 million automobiles across a wide range of distribution partners. Our scale supports both businesses to continue their track record of long-term growth. Our U.S. Connected Living business is expected to remain a solid growth driver, anchored by mobile device protection with marquee mobile carriers and cable operators. In addition, our trade-in business continues to be a strong contributor to overall mobile results.\nOur international results have begun to stabilize in line with our expectations, even as many of the factors impacting growth last year continue to persist including foreign exchange headwinds and lower business volumes. In Europe, we benefited from expense actions previously taken, leading to improved earnings when compared to the second half of 2022. Additionally, we renewed 8 key clients since the beginning of 2022, solidifying a strong foundation to support continued growth. In Japan, we're implementing actions to stabilize the impact from ongoing mobile subscriber declines and believe we are well-positioned in this critical market even as programs mature.\nIn addition to our multiyear partnership with KDDI, we're growing our footprint through expanded relationships with other large Japanese carriers. We're leveraging our core mobile solutions and technology offerings to help optimize operations and launch new services. Moving to Global Auto.\nWe're making steady progress integrating and leveraging recent acquisitions to support commercial success with new partnerships like CNH Industrial, which leverages the combined expertise of our legacy Assurant Lease and Finance business and the broad capabilities of our EPG acquisition. Outside of the U.S., we focused on expanding our share with OEMs. And in Latin America and Europe, we signed 2 new business partnerships in the quarter. Overall, in Lifestyle, while we remain cautious in the short term, given ongoing global macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to expect modest growth for the full year.\nWithin Global Housing, we continue to simplify our focus on product lines where we have clear competitive advantages and scale. We operate a countercyclical market-leading lender-placed business that has generated significant cash flow and attractive returns over the long term, while we invest to drive growth in our capital-light renters insurance business. Despite higher-than-expected CAT activity this quarter, Global Housing had a strong start to the year as adjusted EBITDA, excluding CATS, increased 7%.\nIn homeowners, which is primarily driven by lender-placed, top line grew 16%, both from higher policy growth and higher average insured values and rates, partially offset by increased non-CAT losses and CAT reinsurance costs. Policy growth came from both new and existing clients. In lender-placed, our ability to drive higher premiums both through our inflation guard product feature and rate actions have helped to offset continued inflation impacts on claims, which remain elevated across global housing.\nEntering the second quarter, the impact of inflation on building materials and labor costs is beginning to show signs of improvement. As we consider the magnitude and pace of earnings recovery for Global Housing over the year, it will be important to see how ongoing loss experience improves over the next few quarters. Let's turn to our enterprise outlook and capital.\nReflecting on the quarter and current market conditions, we continue to expect to grow adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable CATS, by low single digits this year. Adjusted EPS growth is still expected to trail adjusted EBITDA growth both excluding reportable CATS, primarily reflecting higher annual depreciation expenses related to several strategic technology investments critical to executing our strategy, a higher consolidated effective tax rate compared to favorable rates in 2022 and the timing of capital deployment. From a capital perspective, we upstreamed $112 million of segment dividends in the first quarter and ended the quarter with $383 million of holding company liquidity. We've been carefully monitoring the broader business and macroeconomic environment as we consider capital deployment. We now expect to resume share repurchases later in the second quarter, but at modest levels, given the ongoing market volatility. We expect the majority of share repurchases to be weighted toward the end of the year and maybe below 2022 underlying buyback activity.\nAs we look ahead, we're focused on the continued execution of our vision to be the leading global business services provider supporting the advancement of the connected world. We believe our strong global client partnerships and our ability to innovate for more than 300 million customers will be critical to achieving our vision.\nI'll now turn the call over to Richard to review the first quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail. Richard?\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $293 million, down $22 million or 7% year-over-year and 5% on a constant currency basis. While the results were lower than the prior year, they came in above our expectations, driven by stronger Global Housing performance. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $3 million and $0.49 for the quarter, down 12% year-over-year, primarily from lower segment earnings a higher effective tax rate compared to favorability in the prior period and a higher depreciation expense.\nNow let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $199 million in the first quarter, a 12% decline year-over-year or a 10% decline on a constant currency basis. The decrease came from lower results in both Connected Living and Global Automotive, partially offset by higher investment income. Connected Living earnings were down 15% or 11% on a constant currency basis from decreases in extended service contracts and weaker international results.\nExtended service contract results were lower due to an increase in claims costs and in particular, relative to the prior year quarter, which included favorable claims experience. We expect a modest level of higher cost to persist during the remainder of the year. The level of which will depend on the broader inflation trends in the market. However, we have recently implemented rate increases with several clients, which should begin to flow through during the course of the year, mitigating the increase.\nIn mobile, earnings were down as expected from [ softer ] international results, mainly in Asia Pacific and unfavorable foreign exchange, both of which are expected to continue. U.S. mobile earnings were flat year-over-year as modest mobile subscriber growth in North America device protection programs from carrier and cable operator clients was offset by lower mobile trading results. Trade and margins were impacted by device mix from carrier promotions and slightly lower volumes, mainly due to the discontinuation of in-store service and repair. Sequentially, however, we are seeing improved mobile performance including in the U.S. and Europe, as results benefit from expense management and more favorable loss experience compared to trends that emerged in the second half of 2022, while declines in Japan have started to stabilize.\nTurning to Global Automotive. Earnings decreased $8 million or 9% and $5 million, excluding real estate joint venture gains from the first quarter. Similar to others in the industry, the auto business was impacted by a rise in severity from higher parts and labor costs that contributed to elevated claims. We expect to recover a portion of the higher claims cost over time through client contract structures though we expect elevated claims experience to persist throughout this year. The auto earnings decrease was partially offset by growth in the U.S. across distribution channels. And although higher claims costs across auto and extended service contracts are being driven by inflation, these businesses are also benefiting from higher investment income due to higher yields.\nTurning to net earned premiums, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up by $52 million or 3%. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Connected Living net earned premiums fees and other income decreased 5%. This reflects an approximately $65 million impact from the previously disclosed new contract structures as well as premium declines related to mobile runoff programs. Excluding these contract changes in foreign currency, Connected Living's revenues grew by 4%. The quarter benefited from growth in mobile subscribers in North America and higher contributions from extended service contracts.\nFor full year 2023, we expect modest growth for Global Lifestyle, supported by the ongoing expansion of new and existing partnerships, particularly in Connected Living and accelerating expense savings throughout the year. We also expect increasing contributions from investment income and the positive impact from the actions mentioned to address rising claims cost. In terms of net earned premiums fees and other income for 2023, Lifestyle is still expected to grow modestly as growth in Global Automotive is partially offset by ongoing foreign exchange headwinds.\nMoving to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $68 million which included a $43 million increase in reportable catastrophes from severe weather and tornado events. Excluding reportable catastrophes, adjusted EBITDA was $118 million up $7 million or 7%. The stronger-than-expected results were driven by Homeowners' top line performance, mainly from lender-placed policy growth as well as higher average insured values and premium rates. Policy growth was mainly from expanded loan portfolios of new and existing clients, although we do expect the client portfolio to run off our books as the year progresses.\nWhile non-cat loss experienced across all major products increased by $32 million, our performance in the quarter demonstrates our ability to more than offset the inflation impacts. Catastrophe reinsurance costs also increased in line with our expectations.\nIn renters and Other, earnings decreased from expected higher non-cat losses, which should continue throughout the year. For full year 2023, we continue to expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding reportable cats, to grow due to improved performance in Homeowners, driven by top line expansion from higher rates and policy growth in lender-placed and by ongoing expense actions to be realized over the course of the year. We are monitoring potential changes in the reinsurance market as we place the remaining 1/3 of our reinsurance program in the coming months. Currently, we anticipate the cost to increase year-over-year, in line with our previous expectations.\nLastly, we are not anticipating a significant improvement in lender-placed non-catastrophe losses until later in the year and continue to monitor the impact of inflation closely. Please also keep in mind that the second quarter tends to be a seasonally elevated period for non-cat losses.\nMoving to corporate. The first quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $24 million, up $2 million driven by lower investment income. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to be approximately $105 million. Given the market volatility over the last quarter, I also want to take a moment to discuss our investment portfolio.\nInvestments cash and cash equivalents had a value of $9.3 billion at the end of Q1. The portfolio is high quality and diversified, reflecting our conservative investment philosophy. Fixed maturity investments in cash and cash equivalents represented 86% of our total portfolio. An estimated 94% of our fixed income securities are investment-grade rated. And overall, our U.S. regional bank exposure is modest.\nWe also have commercial real estate investments across a number of investment vehicles with the overall portfolio performing well. Our assets are diversified across geographic regions and property type with low average security size and have attractive loan-to-value and debt coverage servicing ratios. For example, our commercial mortgage loan portfolio represents approximately 3% of our investment portfolio with approximately 130 loans with an average loan amount of about $2.3 million. The loan portfolio is highly diversified across the U.S., including a variety of property classes and with office buildings representing 11% or approximately $34 million of the loan portfolio and our real estate equity portfolio represents only 2% of our investment portfolio. It is also a diverse portfolio with only 4 office assets with a $26 million book value. We also have CMBS and REIT positions with 98% of those investments being investment-grade rated. While certainly not risk-free, we believe our investment portfolio is relatively low risk as it relates to current macroeconomic headwinds.\nTurning to holding company liquidity. We ended the quarter with $383 million. In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $112 million. During the quarter, we issued $175 million in 2026 senior notes and redeemed a portion of the $225 million of senior notes due in 2023. We intend to redeem the balance of the notes on or prior to maturity in September.\nIn addition to the $136 million of cash used for corporate and interest expenses, first quarter cash flows included $37 million of common stock dividends. For the year, we expect our businesses to continue to generate meaningful cash flow, approximating 65% of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. Cash flow expectations assume a continuation of the current macroeconomic environment and are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance, and rating agency and regulatory requirements.\nAs Keith mentioned, given our performance in the first quarter and our current expectations for cash generation, we plan to resume modest buybacks as we exit the second quarter. We will continue to monitor the macroeconomic environment and adjust accordingly.\nIn summary, our performance in the first quarter provides us with the confidence in our full year outlook. And while macroeconomic uncertainty will likely continue throughout the year, we believe the strength and momentum of our businesses and strong cash flow generation are powerful differentiators for Assurant.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin.\n\nSuzanne Shepherd\n\nSVP of IR & Sustainability, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release, announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2022. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com.\nWe'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session. Some of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release and financial supplement as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.\nEffective January 1, 2023, we realigned the composition of our segments to better manage our risk and fee-based, capital-light businesses. Global Housing is now comprised of 2 primary lines of business, Homeowners and Renters and Others. Certain product lines, including our Leased and Financed business, previously reported in housing, have been moved to Global Lifestyle to better align with our go-to-market strategy. While this change has no impact on our consolidated results, it will modestly impact the earnings trends within the segments. Our 2023 outlook is based on this realigned view.\nPlease refer to the financial supplement for a reconciliation of certain key data for these changes.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting on my first year as CEO, I couldn't be prouder of the extraordinary dedication and commitment demonstrated by our employees in delivering for our clients and customers around the world. During the year, we made progress in executing our vision to be the leading global business services provider supporting the advancement of the Connected World. We continue to grow and strengthen our partnerships with key clients and delivered new innovative solutions, all while navigating more volatile market conditions. Our portfolio of lifestyle and housing businesses proved resilient, but not immune to macroeconomic headwinds.\nIn 2022, we grew adjusted earnings per share by 11% and delivered over $1.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA, both excluding reportable catastrophes. Adjusting for $27 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, adjusted EBITDA growth was 3%, and 2022 represented our sixth consecutive year of profitable growth. This is a reflection of our compelling strategy and resilient culture. We've held true to our company's purpose of helping people thrive, with a steadfast commitment to being a socially responsible company for all of our stakeholders. I'm proud that we've been recognized as a Great Place To Work in 13 countries, and most recently in the U.S. for the second consecutive year.\nOur focus remains on engaging and developing our diverse talent pool through enhanced leadership and skill development programs. We also continue to reduce our environmental impact as a core pillar of our ESG strategy. Building on our progress to date, we announced in December our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. This target aligns with the Paris Agreement and ensures we drive meaningful reductions. We've also taken a number of actions within our businesses to strengthen Assurant for the future.\nIn Global Housing, we initiated a business transformation, including exiting certain noncore businesses, such as our sharing economy as well as international cat-exposed business, where we did not see a path to leadership positions. More broadly, across Assurant, we realigned our organizational structure, as Suzanne referenced, to drive more focus and better deploy talent. We also took decisive action by accelerating several expense initiatives to realize additional efficiencies and position us for continued long-term growth.\nAs we announced in December, we expect to realize $55 million of annualized gross savings by the end of 2024 through the simplification of our organizational structure, and our real estate consolidation program given our increasingly hybrid workforce. These actions will help mitigate the impact of higher labor costs and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment as well as fund additional investments, including increased automation.\nIn addition to ensuring a more streamlined organizational and cost structure, we've gained momentum throughout the year in both Global Lifestyle and Global Housing, renewing and winning new clients in each of our major lines of business. In Global Lifestyle, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% in 2022, with growth from both Connected Living and Global Automotive. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EBITDA expanded by 11%, aligned with our original expectations for the year. In Connected Living, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 15% on a constant currency basis, driven by mobile protection program growth in North America.\nOur ability to continuously innovate our products and services has supported a stronger and more differentiated customer experience, resulting in increased Net Promoter Scores.\nIn addition to key partner renewals, including T-Mobile and XFINITY, we secured new business opportunities and new client partnerships, continuing to diversify our broad client base. In our mobile protection business, we now protect nearly 62 million global devices, driven by the 25 new protection programs we've added since 2015. We serviced over 28 million devices in 2022, mainly from our mobile trade-in business as we add scale and further demonstrate our position as a market leader with this important value-added service to our clients. We added several new trading clients and now have over 40 trade-in programs globally. We continue to invest in talent and strengthen supply chain operations to maintain our competitive advantage.\nIn Global Automotive, we grew global protected autos in 2022 by 2% to 54.1 million vehicles, helping to generate adjusted EBITDA growth of 5%. Recently, we expanded and enhanced our EV One protection offering in the U.S., and coverage is now available for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, including comprehensive battery coverage.\nIn our newly combined Leased and Financed business, we partnered with CNH Industrial in the U.S. and Canada to provide service contracts and physical damage insurance. CNH is the third largest agriculture and construction equipment company in the world. This partnership was made possible by the talent and expertise of our teams, including through the acquisition of EPG.\nIn Global Housing, we took swift action to mitigate the impact of high inflation within our lender-placed business. We began to see improved performance as we exited the year, reflecting the rate increases implemented over the course of the year. We expect higher rates to roll through our book into 2023 and beyond, while we manage ongoing elevated claims costs. In 2022, we renewed 8 lender-placed clients, including several of our most significant partnerships with multiyear agreements. These renewals represent 36% of our over 31 million loans tracked.\nIn Multifamily Housing, we now have over 2.6 million renters policies. While we've seen slower growth from our affinity partnerships, our volume with property management companies continues to expand as we signed several new partnerships, including 2 top PMCs with over 100,000 combined units. We also successfully completed multiyear renewals with 6 key client relationships.\nAs we continue to convert clients to our Cover360 platform, we expect to see ongoing policy growth in that channel. Throughout the year, we maintained a strong balance sheet as we navigated increased macroeconomic uncertainty. Our businesses contributed a total of $550 million in dividends to the holding company, or roughly 52% of segment earnings, including catastrophe losses. Together with the remaining net proceeds from the Global Preneed sale, we returned a total of $718 million in share repurchases and common stock dividends.\nLooking ahead, we believe we have a compelling vision and strategy that will drive outperformance and shareholder value long term. As a business services leader, we will continue to pursue profitable growth in more fee-based, capital-light businesses, which continue to account for the majority of our earnings. In addition, we'll continue to optimize results and cash flow generation in our risk-based business.\nIn 2023, we believe we can drive continued profitable growth, though at a more modest pace given strong '22 results in lifestyle and our near-term view of the broader economy. Specifically, we expect adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, to increase low single digits, with results improving as the year progresses, reflecting trends in the business and the broader market as well as the restructuring actions taken in 2022.\nEarnings growth is expected to be driven by improved performance in Global Housing as well as more modest growth in Global Lifestyle. Adjusted earnings per share growth is expected to trail adjusted EBITDA growth, primarily reflecting a higher annual depreciation expense related to several strategic technology investments critical to executing our strategy, a higher consolidated effective tax rate compared to a favorable 2022 and timing of capital deployment. We've had a long-standing track record of strong cash flow generation and disciplined capital deployment, and we continue to believe that a balanced capital deployment strategy drives long-term value.\nOur capital management priorities for this year will be focused on supporting the organic growth of our business and maintaining our investment-grade ratings. We expect share repurchases will remain a core component of our capital deployment strategy given the attractiveness of our stock. But in light of the continued uncertain macro environment, we believe it is prudent to preserve flexibility over the near term. Therefore, based on current market conditions and expected business performance, we anticipate that any share repurchases would occur in the second half of the year and could be below 2022 underlying buyback activity.\nAs the broader environment begins to stabilize and visibility improves, we will reevaluate levels and timing of capital deployment as part of our overall capital deployment strategy. Our M&A strategy will continue to focus on compelling deals in Global Lifestyle. However, the hurdle rate for M&A will be high given the attractiveness of our stock.\nAs we enter 2023, we remain well positioned for long-term growth through our differentiated lifestyle and housing portfolio. We are focused on creating new sources of growth, scaling new client wins and deepening current client relationships to continually drive added value for our key clients and customers.\nI'll now turn the call over to Richard to review the fourth quarter results and our 2023 outlook in greater detail. Richard?\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Keith has outlined our full year 2022 performance, I will focus on fourth quarter trends, particularly as we outlined our expectations for 2023. Given some of the significant changes in foreign exchange rates during the year, I will be citing some growth rates in both absolute and constant currency terms.\nFor the fourth quarter 2022, adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, totaled $296 million or $39 million or 15% year-over-year and 19% on a constant currency basis. Our performance reflected improved results from both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. Adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, totaled $3.56 for the quarter, up 24% year-over-year.\nNow let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $166 million in the fourth quarter, a 6% increase year-over-year, but double that, or 12% on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by higher Connected Living earnings, which grew 21% or 31% on a constant currency basis. Connected Living strong growth was primarily from 3 factors: first, reduced mobile service and repair expenses compared to the prior year period; second, continued modest mobile subscriber growth in North American device protection programs from carrier and cable operator clients; and third, higher investment income.\nAs expected, strong U.S. results were partially offset by continued weak performance in Europe and declines in Japan as programs mature. In device trading, we serviced 7.5 million devices in the fourth quarter, our highest quarterly volume this year. While volumes were strong, trading results declined as margins were pressured by device mix resulting from carrier promotions. Claims cost in Connected Living overall remain steady. Although we did see some pockets of higher costs from labor and materials within our extended service contract business.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings decreased $7 million or 10%, primarily from weaker global performance and higher claims costs. In the U.S., a higher portion of higher claims costs are expected to be recovered over time from client contract structures. The earnings decrease was partially offset by domestic growth across distribution channels.\nTurning to net earned premium, fees and other income. Lifestyle was up $20 million, or 1% and 3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by Global Automotive, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. When adjusting for unfavorable foreign exchange, Connected Living's net earned premiums, fees and other income increased slightly from growth in mobile subscribers in North America, partially offset by premium declines in mobile from runoff programs.\nBased on the new reporting structure for full year 2023, lifestyle adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow modestly from our revised 2022 baseline of $809 million, driven by both Connected Living and Global Automotive. Over the course of the year, we expect Connected Living to benefit from modest subscriber growth in existing North American mobile programs as well as increases in U.S. auto. The gradual ramp-up of our new mobile and connected home programs and expense savings from the previously announced restructuring plan should benefit results as we get into the second half of the year.\nWe do anticipate some continued headwinds to partially offset these growth drivers. These will be more pronounced in the first half of the year. Specifically, in 2022, we benefited from a number of favorable items that are not expected to recur. These included $24 million in investment income from real estate joint venture investments and $11 million from a client contract benefit.\nWe also anticipate continued headwinds in our international business, particularly in the first half of the year given lower volumes in Europe and modest subscriber declines as programs mature in Japan. In addition, unfavorable foreign exchange, which will impact both the top and bottom lines. And finally, we anticipate continued higher claims costs particularly in extended service contracts as well as less favorable loss experience for select ancillary auto products.\nIn terms of net earned premiums, fees and other income for 2023, lifestyle is expected to grow modestly as growth in Global Automotive is offset by declines in Connected Living and ongoing foreign exchange headwinds. Connected Living will be impacted by the implementation of 2 new contract structures, which we estimate will lower top line in 2023 by $230 million. It is important to note, though, that these 2 changes will have no impact to our bottom line. Excluding these changes, we would anticipate growth in Connected Living net earned premiums, fees and other income.\nMoving now to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $135 million, which included $22 million of reportable catastrophes from winter storms and Hurricane Nicole during the quarter. Excluding catastrophe losses, adjusted EBITDA was $157 million, up $31 million or 25%. The increase was driven primarily by lender-placed insurance, partially offset by $15 million in higher non-cat loss experience across all major products, including Multifamily Housing. Lender-placed earnings significantly increased, accounting for most of the increase in housing's earnings from higher average insured values and premium rates as well as policy growth. In addition, expense savings and higher investment income contributed to the increase. These items were partially offset by higher cat reinsurance costs.\nBased on the new reporting structure, for the full year 2023, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, to grow from a revised 2022 baseline of $417 million. Improved earnings performance is expected from 2 main drivers. First, top line growth from rate recovery and lender-placed; and second, ongoing expense actions to be realized over the course of the year. We expect ongoing elevated noncatastrophe losses, including higher seasonal weather-related claims in the first half and increased cat reinsurance costs to continue in 2023. Gradual improvement in lender-placed noncatastrophe losses is assumed later in the year. We also expect lower Multifamily Housing profitability from lower contributions from our affinity partners and higher non-cat losses as they return to more normalized levels.\nIn terms of our cat reinsurance program, in January, we secured 2/3 of our 2023 program. Similar to much of the industry, we've seen significant price increases, but the cost is relatively in line with our expectations. We anticipate elevated pricing will continue in June when we place the final third of the full program and have reflected this in our outlook. Given the significant increase in reinsurance prices, and in order to optimize risk and return, we expect our per event retention level to increase to $125 million. This incorporates the growth in lender-placed exposure, primarily from inflation, partially offset by some declines in our international risk exposure.\nReflecting on these expected changes, we now believe the appropriate cat load for 2023 is $140 million. And finally, I'd also note that our outlook for housing assumes no meaningful deterioration in the broader U.S. housing market that would cause an increase in placement rates or a worsening of loss experience.\nMoving to Corporate. The fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA loss was $27 million, up $2 million, and was driven by lower investment income. For the full year 2023, we expect the Corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to be approximately $105 million.\nTurning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with $446 million. In the fourth quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $89 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $13 million of share repurchases, $38 million in common stock dividends and $81 million related to the 2 strategic acquisitions previously announced that will strengthen our position in the commercial equipment space.\nDuring 2022, lifestyle and housing contributed $550 million in dividends to the holding company. This was below our expectations given changes in investment portfolio values, reserve strengthening and accounting changes for noncore operations.\nIn 2023, we expect our businesses to continue to generate meaningful cash flow. Cash conversion should approximate 65% of segment adjusted EBITDA, including reportable catastrophes. This accounts for the previously announced restructuring charges. This also assumes a continuation of the current economic environment and is subject to the growth of the business, investment portfolio performance and regulatory rating agency requirements.\nIn summary, we continued our track record of profitable earnings growth and strong cash flow generation in 2022 despite some challenging conditions. And although we do expect to face continued macroeconomic uncertainty in 2023, we firmly believe we're well positioned to serve our current and future clients and customers and to continue to grow Assurant.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability.

For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement that can be found on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. As we previewed last week, our third quarter 2022 results came in below our expectations. This reflected a more challenging macroeconomic environment and lower contributions from Global Lifestyle. Following a very strong first half of the year, where we grew Lifestyle adjusted EBITDA by 14% year-over-year, this quarter had more significant headwinds internationally, including unfavorable foreign exchange, a modest uptick in claims and lower Connected Living program volumes.\nWhile disappointing, our results don't change our view of the inherent growth momentum in the Lifestyle business. We believe the actions we're taking to drive additional expense savings will also better mitigate potential further deterioration in macro conditions. Looking at Global Housing, the segment's performance was in line with our expectations for the quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made in not only increasing revenues through higher average insured values and rates but also the transformation actions we've taken to simplify the business and drive future growth.\nLooking at the year-to-date performance through the first 9 months of 2022, Assurant's reported adjusted EPS of $10.05 is up 7% for last year, and adjusted EBITDA of $832 million is down 4%, both excluding reportable catastrophes.\nAs we evaluate our progress this year, we continue to believe we have a compelling strategy, strong fundamentals and momentum with clients as we continue to align with leading global brands and maintain market-leading positions across our key lines of business. For example, we announced a further multiyear extension of our long-standing partnership with T-Mobile. This important contract extension provides us with increased long-term visibility in our U.S. mobile business.\nAt the same time, it gives us greater opportunity to increase repair volumes through our over 500 cellphone repair locations with the ability to leverage this capability with other U.S. clients. We've also made investments to support our product development around the connected home, and we continue to engage in encouraging dialogue with key clients, creating a long-term opportunity for growth. This also included supporting our largest U.S. retail client with the expanded relationship we announced earlier this year. While macroeconomic conditions in Europe are challenging, we continue to win new opportunities and recently expanded our global partnership with Samsung to launch Samsung Care Plus smartphone protection in 6 major European markets. We now offer this solution across 3 continents.\nThis momentum, combined with our partnerships with well-positioned global market leaders, should help us outperform through an economic downturn.\nTurning to Global Housing. We've already begun a comprehensive transformational effort to position the business for long-term success, and we're pleased with our progress. Consistent with our practice of actively managing our portfolio of businesses and reviewing it for strategic fit, in addition to exiting commercial liability, we're eliminating our international housing catastrophe exposure. We don't see these businesses as core to our strategy or a path to leadership positions.\nAs we execute these changes, we're designing a new organizational structure for Global Housing to better manage our risk businesses from our capital-light oriented businesses as part of our transformational agenda and also to realize greater efficiencies. We're finalizing our plans for implementation in 2023. As we reflect on Assurant's overall results to date and current market conditions, we now expect 2022 adjusted EPS, excluding catastrophes, to grow high single digits from $12.28 last year, driven by share repurchases and Global Lifestyle growth.\nFor the full year, we expect adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, will be down modestly to flat with 2021. This will be driven by high single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth for Lifestyle, even with additional macro headwinds. In fact, on a constant currency basis, we expect Global Lifestyle to finish 2022 aligned with our original Lifestyle expectations of low double-digit growth.\nIn Global Automotive, we still expect to outperform our initial expectations, driven by tailwinds from investment income and underlying growth in the business as we expand share with clients and add to our 54 million protected vehicles.\nFor 2022, we continue to believe Global Housing will decrease by low to mid-teens, but we're pleased to see the initial improvements in our underlying results. From a capital perspective, we remain good stewards. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $667 million of capital to shareholders, including proceeds from the sale of Preneed. And by year-end, we expect to close 2 small acquisitions for a total of approximately $80 million. These deals will strengthen our position in commercial equipment with attractively priced assets and minimal integration effort. Looking ahead, given macroeconomic volatility, we will exercise prudence in the near-term relative to capital deployment so that we can maintain maximum flexibility to continue to support our organic growth.\nThis doesn't change our conviction of the strong cash flow generation of our businesses, nor our view of the attractiveness of our stock but rather as a reflection of the uncertain macro environment. As the broader environment begins to stabilize and visibility improves, we'll evaluate capital deployment to maximize shareholder value. Looking to 2023, we are confident in the growth of our businesses. We expect both our Global Housing and Global Lifestyle adjusted EBITDA, ex cats, to increase year-over-year. To that end, we're taking decisive actions to mitigate headwinds while we maintain our relentless focus on growth.\nThe Global Housing business is poised to grow in 2023, and we started to see evidence of that in the third quarter as rate increases flow through the book. In the long-term, the business should provide downside protection if we see a further deterioration in the U.S. economy.\nWe believe Global Lifestyle is positioned to grow in 2023. This is based on expectations of continued strong underlying growth momentum, even while factoring in lower international business volumes and increasing claims costs. We have also started several initiatives across the enterprise to drive greater operational efficiencies and leverage our economies of scale. We're now pushing even harder to realize incremental expense savings given the increasingly volatile market.\nWe expect to finalize plans in the months ahead so that we can implement in 2023 and beyond. This includes optimizing our organizational structure and best aligning our talent, leveraging our global footprint to reduce labor costs where possible, continuing to review our real estate strategy, recognizing we have an increasingly more hybrid workforce and accelerating our adoption of digital solutions. Our digital-first strategies are yielding positive results in 2022, both in terms of delivering better customer experiences and meaningful savings. As part of our 2023 planning, we're taking steps to accelerate digital adoption and automate processes which will further reduce cost and improve the customer experience. We're also applying the same principles to drive greater automation and self-service throughout our functional areas.\nWith this in mind and considering how the overall business environment has changed, we are reevaluating our long-term financial objectives shared at Investor Day. In February, we expect to share our 2023 outlook, also factoring in the most recent business trends and macro environment. This in no way changes our view on our business advantages, leadership aspirations or long-term growth potential. We continue to be well-positioned with industry-leading clients as we focus on key products and capabilities where we have market-leading advantages. We believe we have a compelling portfolio of businesses poised to outperform as we deliver on our vision to be the leading global business services provider supporting the advancement of the connected world.\nI'll now turn the call over to Richard to review the third quarter results and our revised 2022 outlook in greater detail. Richard?\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, totaled $240 million, down 11% from the third quarter of 2021. Our performance reflected weaker results in both Global Housing and Global Lifestyle. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, of $2.81, down 8% from the prior-year period.\nNow let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $166 million in the third quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 6%, driven primarily by Connected Living. Excluding an $11 million onetime client contract benefit in Connected Living, Lifestyle earnings decreased by $22 million. The Connected Living decline of $18 million was primarily from 4 factors: First, $7 million of unfavorable foreign exchange, mainly from the weakening of the Japanese yen; second, lower margins in our device trading business from lower volumes.\nHowever, this is expected to improve starting in the fourth quarter which we have already seen in October; third, our extended service contracts business was impacted by higher claims cost from wage and materials, and we did make some additional investments in Connected Home; and lastly, softer international volumes for mobile, particularly in Japan and Europe. The decline was partially offset by continued mobile subscriber growth in North America device protection programs from carrier and cable operator clients.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings decreased $4 million or 6%, primarily from lower investment income and higher losses in Europe.\nTurning to revenue. Year-over-year, Lifestyle revenue was up by $29 million or 1%, driven by continued growth in Global Automotive. Global Automotive revenue increased 9%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. On a year-to-date basis, our net written premiums in auto were down 2%, demonstrating the resilience of the business relative to the broader U.S. auto market which contracted at a faster pace.\nWithin Connected Living, revenue was down 4% year-over-year due to lower revenue in mobile, mainly from premium declines from runoff programs and unfavorable foreign exchange. This was partially offset by growth in subscribers in North America. In the third quarter, we serviced 7.1 million global mobile devices supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions for the growing adoption of 5G devices.\nFor the full year 2022, we now expect Lifestyle adjusted EBITDA to grow high single digits compared to 2021, led by double-digit mobile expansion and Global Automotive growth. Earnings in the fourth quarter should grow year-over-year, mainly from growth in Connected Living.\nMoving to Global Housing. The adjusted EBITDA loss was $25 million, which included $124 million of reportable catastrophes. As a retention level event, Hurricane Ian was the primary driver of reportable catastrophes in the quarter along with the associated restatement premiums. Excluding catastrophe losses, adjusted EBITDA was $99 million, down $18 million or 15%. The decrease was driven primarily by approximately $38 million in higher non-cat loss experience across all major products, including approximately $24 million of prior period reserve strengthening.\nLender-placed earnings were flat as elevated loss experience and $13 million of higher catastrophe reinsurance costs were largely offset by higher average insured values and premium rates. The placement rate increased 9 basis points sequentially, mainly from client portfolio additions having a higher average placement rate. The increase is not a reflection of a deterioration in the U.S. mortgage landscape.\nMultifamily housing increased non-cat losses, including some reserve strengthening and an increase in expenses from ongoing investments to expand our capabilities and strengthen our customer experience resulted in lower profitability. Global Housing revenue increased 3% from growth within several specialty offerings as well as higher average insured values and premium rates in lender-placed. This was partially offset by higher catastrophe reinsurance costs noted earlier from Hurricane Ian.\nFor the full year, we expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, to decline by low to mid-teens from 2021 with an increasing benefit in the fourth quarter from higher AIVs and rate. We're also evaluating our catastrophe reinsurance program as we approach the January 1 purchase to ensure we optimize risk and return. This may include increasing our retention level, reflecting the growth of the book of business stemming from inflation. In the meantime, we believe the implemented rate adjustments will result in higher premiums that can help to mitigate the increase in cat reinsurance costs.\nAt Corporate, the adjusted EBITDA loss was $25 million, up $2 million, driven by lower investment income. For the full year, we continue to expect Corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to be approximately $105 million.\nTurning now to holding company liquidity. We ended the third quarter with $529 million, $304 million above our current minimum target level. In the third quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $143 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 3 main items: $80 million of share repurchases, $37 million of common stock dividends and $6 million mainly related to Assurant Venture investments.\nFor the full year, in addition to the $365 million of Preneed proceeds, we expect incremental share repurchases to be on the lower end of our targeted range of $200 million to $300 million. As always, segment dividends are subject to the growth of the businesses, investment portfolio performance and rating agency and regulatory capital requirements.\nTurning to future capital deployment. Our objective continues to be to maintain our strong financial position while continuing to invest in our future organic growth. However, given the interest rate volatility and uncertain global macro environment, we plan to be prudent relative to capital deployment in the near future.\nIn conclusion, while our third quarter results were disappointing, we are confident that our fourth quarter results will improve. And with the additional actions we are taking to grow the top line and leverage our expense base, we are positioning ourselves for growth into 2023.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin.\n\nSuzanne Shepherd\n\nSVP of IR & Sustainability, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our second quarter 2022 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the second quarter of 2022. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We will start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement that can be found on our website.\nWe have revised all quarterly and annual results for full year 2020 through first quarter 2022 periods to reflect the change in the adjusted EBITDA calculation to exclude certain businesses that we now expect to exit fully, including our sharing economy and small commercial businesses and Global Housing as well as certain legacy long-duration insurance policies within Global Lifestyle. Results have been revised for the correction of any errors related to reinsurance of claims and benefits payable within the Global Lifestyle segment that occurred in late 2018 through first quarter 2022 as well as other immaterial corrections. The impact of these changes individually or in the aggregate, is not material to results for any prior period. A full reconciliation of certain reported and revised key measures of performance and metrics is provided in our second quarter financial supplement posted on assurant.com.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. As we outlined during our recent Investor Day in March, we aspire to be the leading global business services company supporting the advancement of the connected world. And so far in 2022, we've made solid progress delivering on that vision for the benefit of our clients and their customers, our employees and importantly, our shareholders.\nWe delivered adjusted EPS of $7.22, up 13% in the first half of last year, and adjusted EBITDA was $592 million, both excluding reportable catastrophe losses. We're very pleased that Global Lifestyle had such a strong first half of the year with momentum expected to continue, led by both mobile and auto. Our capital-light and fee income based businesses represented 82% of our adjusted EBITDA ex-cat so far this year and continue to add to the value of our franchise.\nWhile results in Global Housing were below expectations, largely driven by broader inflationary pressures seen across our industry, we have a clear path and several key actions underway to address near-term macro challenges. Longer term, we continue to believe that our combined housing and lifestyle portfolio of businesses is positioned to deliver attractive earnings growth and strong cash flow generation relative to the broader market, while also providing a compelling countercyclical hedge in what remains a volatile economic landscape.\nAs we look at our Global Lifestyle segment, our business services-oriented offerings generated adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% year-over-year and 14% year-to-date. Our market-leading franchise helped us expand our partnership with several world-class brands in the lifestyle market. In the U.S., we recently signed a multiyear renewal with a large cable operator within our mobile business. This includes comprehensive device protection, trade-in and premium technical support. With the renewal, we'll be including new capabilities, demonstrating our ability to grow relationships with value-added services that ultimately lead to a better customer experience.\nWe've now renewed two major U.S. cable operators in our mobile business within the last year, while also broadening our product offerings to support their growing mobile subscriber bases. We're pleased with the continued growth momentum in Global Lifestyle, which we expect will continue into the second half of 2022. As a result, we believe the segment will deliver mid- to high teens growth in adjusted EBITDA, mainly from strong mobile results, including device protection and trade-in as well as from the continued strength of our auto business.\nTurning to Global Housing. Similar to others in the industry, we were impacted by significant inflationary pressure, which resulted in higher claim severities and reinsurance costs in the quarter, most notably in lender-placed. These higher costs are expected to be mitigated through rate adjustments over time. In addition to regular rate filings in key states, our lender-placed product includes an inflation guard feature designed to address changes in material and labor costs. We recently implemented a double-digit rate increase on policy renewals. This rate increase will be applied to all renewals over the next 12 months. As a result, there is a timing lag that is magnifying the higher non-cat loss experience in the quarter and ultimately pressuring results through 2022. We believe this will normalize as incremental premiums earn over time. As we look at the housing portfolio, we're also taking other actions to improve profitability through ongoing expense efficiencies and driving even greater focus on the housing businesses where we see a path to market-leading positions that can deliver attractive financial returns.\nMost recently, we decided to exit the sharing economy business. The strategic and financial objectives for this business did not develop as we originally anticipated, and we want to focus on opportunities that more closely align to our long-term vision and where we have market advantages with a clear right to win. Stepping back and looking at Assurant overall, we believe we have an attractive portfolio of market-leading businesses, which are poised for long-term success. Given the current macro environment, we believe we can deliver adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% to 6%. This takes into account higher expected losses in housing, but also stronger results and momentum within Global Lifestyle.\nAdjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable cats, is now expected to grow 14% to 18% for the full year, reflecting this view of adjusted EBITDA. EPS growth will, of course, also be supported by share repurchases, including the return of $900 million in pre-need sale proceeds, which was completed in the second quarter. As we've shown historically through various market cycles, we believe we are well positioned to deliver our strategic objectives over the long term. We expect this period of macroeconomic challenges to be no different. Over time, we believe the strength and resiliency of our business model will endure, enabling us to execute on the 2023 and 2024 objectives we outlined at Investor Day.\nLooking forward, we expect adjusted EBITDA acceleration starting next year. While the earnings path may not be linear, we remain confident that in the long term, our combined lifestyle and housing business portfolio will continue to deliver attractive growth, strong cash flow generation and superior shareholder returns relative to the broader market.\nI'll now turn the call over to Richard to review the second quarter results and our revised 2022 outlook in greater detail.\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, totaled $277 million, down 8% from the second quarter of 2021. As Keith mentioned, performance reflected the strong growth across global lifestyle and weaker results in Global Housing. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share excluding reportable catastrophes, of $3.25, flat from the prior year period. The 2021 baseline for lifestyle and housing adjusted EBITDA has been updated to remove noncore operations and reflect the accounting correction, Suzanne noted to our prior period results.\nNow let's move to segment results, starting in Global Lifestyle. The segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $207 million in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 12% driven by growth across both Connected Living and Global Automotive. Connected Living earnings increased by $12 million or 11% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued mobile expansion in North America device protection programs from cable operator and carrier clients, including subscriber growth and more favorable loss experience. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings increased $10 million or 15%, primarily from higher investment income, including higher real estate gains and yields, favorable loss experience and select ancillary products also contributed to the results. As we look at revenue, Lifestyle revenue was up by $48 million or 3%, driven by continued growth in Global Automotive. Global Automotive revenue increased 7%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Despite the overall U.S. auto market showing signs of slowing, our net written premiums remained strong even against the record second quarter of 2021, as additional dealerships and strong attachment rates are offsetting the market headwinds.\nWithin Connected Living, revenue was down slightly due to lower revenue in mobile, mainly from premium declines from runoff programs and unfavorable foreign exchange. This was partially offset by growth in subscribers in North America and higher mobile fee income driven by global mobile devices serviced. In the second quarter, the number of global mobile devices service increased by $1.1 million or approximately 18% to $7.2 million. This was due to higher trading volumes, supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions from the growing adoption of 5G devices. In terms of mobile subscribers, growth in North America was partially offset by declines in runoff mobile programs previously mentioned, which also impacted mobile devices protected sequentially.\nFor full year 2022, we now expect lifestyle adjusted EBITDA growth to be mid- to high teens compared to 2021 baseline of $702 million. Mobile is expected to be the key driver of adjusted EBITDA growth for global expansion in existing and new clients across device protection and trade-in and upgrade programs. This will be partially offset by unfavorable impacts, from foreign exchange and strategic investments to support new business opportunities and client implementations. Auto adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow for the full year. But earnings in the second half are expected to be lower than the first half, mainly due to the absence of $14 million of real estate gains. Growth for the year will be partially offset by higher investment income and more favorable loss experience in select ancillary products.\nMoving to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $75 million, which included $20 million of reportable catastrophes for the second quarter. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased $40 million, primarily driven by $25 million in higher non-cat loss experience, largely in lender-placed and to a lesser extent, Multifamily Housing. This included $12 million in year-over-year reserve strengthening and higher fire losses in the quarter. The balance of the earnings reduction was driven mainly from $17 million in higher catastrophe reinsurance costs. The cost of our reinsurance program reflected both the higher exposures and increased pricing within the reinsurance market. And with the completion of our 2022 catastrophe reinsurance program in June, we believe we fared relatively well in the market given our strong relationships with our more than 40 reinsurance partners.\nWe maintained an $80 million per event retention including second and third events. We also continued to benefit from the placement of multiyear coverage covering 45% of our program and a cascading feature that provides multi-event protection. In Multifamily Housing, growth in our P&C channels was offset by increased non-cat losses and expenses from ongoing investments to expand our capabilities and further strengthen our client experience. Global Housing revenue was flat year-over-year as higher catastrophe reinsurance costs were offset by higher average insured values and lender placed.\nFor the full year, we now expect Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, to decline by low to mid-teens from the 2021 baseline of $512 million. In addition to the higher claims costs, REO volumes have continued to be muted and placement rate trends we are seeing are softer than originally expected. At the same time, we continue to realize expense efficiencies from new system enhancements and strength in digital capabilities. While the duration and magnitude of inflationary trends remain fluid, rate filings and inflation guards are expected to start to flow through premiums as we exit the year.\nAt corporate, adjusted EBITDA loss was $25 million, up $8 million compared to the unusually low second quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by higher employee-related and technology expenses. For full year 2022, we expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to be approximately $105 million.\nTurning to holding company liquidity. We ended the second quarter with $595 million, $370 million above our current minimum target level. In the second quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $189 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from three main items: $232 million of share repurchases; $75 million from the repayment of our 2023 notes; and $39 million in common stock dividends. For the full year, our outlook assumes $365 million of shares repurchased from the remaining premium sale proceeds plus an additional $200 million to $300 million.\nThrough July, we've bought back $504 million worth of our stock. Given changes in investment portfolio values, reserve strengthening for noncore operations and accounting adjustments, we expect segment dividend to be moderately below our target of roughly 3/4 of segment adjusted EBITDA, including catastrophes. While lower, we still expect capital generation to be strong given our business model and product mix. As always, segment dividends are subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and investment portfolio performance.\nIn conclusion, we believe Assurant is well-positioned for long-term growth and strong capital generation, underscored by the attractive portfolio of Global Lifestyle and Global Housing businesses.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin.\n\nSuzanne Shepherd\n\nSVP of IR & Sustainability, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2022 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the first quarter 2022. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We will start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated value statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplements as well as the Investor Day presentation materials that can be found on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance for the first quarter, which demonstrates the resiliency and strength of our business during a period of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty.\nWithin Global Lifestyle, stronger-than-expected performance in our capital-light Connected Living and Global Automotive businesses offset softer-than-expected results within Global Housing, mainly from our specialty offerings. The ongoing growth of our fee-based, capital-light offerings across Global Lifestyle and Global Housing accounted for nearly 80% of segment earnings in 2021. This differentiates Assurant as both a service-oriented partner to our clients and a compelling investment given our scaled customer base in markets with strong tailwinds. Our continued alignment with world-class partners and our ability to provide best-in-class products, services and customer experiences has positioned us well for expected profitable growth this year and over the long term.\nAs we outlined at Investor Day in March, we have a clear vision for the future, to be the leading global business services company supporting the advancement of the connected world. We aren't settling for the status quo. While we currently have scale leadership positions in attractive and growing markets, we have our sights set on being the leader in all of the businesses in which we operate.\nWith that said, we believe the financial objectives we outlined for Assurant over the next 3 years are attractive and will be supported by our focus on market-leading innovation, business simplification, operational optimization and the benefits of scale. We believe this will lead to continued strong cash flow generation, earnings growth and financial outperformance.\nIn Global Lifestyle, we remain focused on supporting our more than 250 million customers through our broad set of products and services across insurance, operations, mobile trading and repair and comprehensive administrative services throughout Connected Living and Global Automotive.\nFor this segment, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the low double digits for 2022 with average annual growth of 10% in 2023 and 2024. We anticipate Connected Living will lead our growth for the Lifestyle segment, driven by our multidimensional strategy. Over the next 3 years, Connected Living should benefit from increased mobile and retail client expansion and increase in fee-based traded and repair as well as contributions from strategic M&A. We continue to be excited about opportunities to drive growth in our retail business as we think about longer-term opportunities to serve the connected home.\nAs of May 1, we're pleased to announce that we have expanded our relationship with one of our largest U.S. retail partners. We moved beyond program underwriting and have expanded our services to provide for the end-to-end administration of the business, including call center support, claims management and oversight of service delivery. Not only does this allow us to deepen our relationship with a critical client, it allows us to continue to grow our retail business, while dramatically increasing our scale to support claims and customer service further improving our relevance with the third-party repair network that supports this business.\nWe now support a meaningfully larger number of appliance repairs, which we believe is strategically important to our ambitions to provide protection services to the evolving connected home. This partnership will also support additional investments in digital tools and technology platforms that are key to our long-term vision.\nGlobal Automotive is expected to benefit from our increased scale and strong national dealer, third-party administrator and international OEM partnerships. We will continue to invest in technology, integrating our systems and processes following several years of successful acquisitions. Throughout Lifestyle, we'll also continue to invest to expand our market-leading positions. We anticipate incremental spending related to the development of new products, such as our connected home offerings and increased investments for new client implementations.\nIn Global Housing, the business is expected to grow mid- to high single digits in 2023 and 2024. For 2022, we now expect mid-single-digit growth, given the sharing economy performance in the first quarter. Growth in housing is expected to be led by our lender-placed business, an important provider of property protection in the U.S. housing market. This will be driven by efficiencies across our operating model that will position us to benefit from the modest increase to placement rates and REO volume recovery that we expect later this year. Together, these trends will create scale benefits with our large portfolio of over 30 million loans, which will drive lower expenses across the business.\nMultifamily Housing remains an attractive long-term growth story, although 2022 will be pressured as we continue to make investments in our customer experience and technology. These investments should ultimately support growth of our 2.6 million renters policies and further penetrate the approximately 20 million U.S. renters market.\nLastly, our specialty offerings are still expected to grow over the long term despite recent elevated losses in sharing economy from policies previously written under less favorable contract terms, including those from one-off clients. As we consider potential impacts from macro factors, like inflation or supply chain disruptions throughout Lifestyle and Housing, we've not experienced a material impact to Assurant overall. In our mobile business, where the availability of parts fluctuates, we're working proactively with large suppliers to keep higher levels of inventory on hand to ensure timely and cost-effective repairs for customers. We'll continue to monitor developments and any corresponding impact on our business as is necessary.\nOur ability to meet our business goals is supported by the successful execution of our ESG efforts. We recently published our 2022 sustainability report, highlighting our commitment to build a more sustainable future for all stakeholders through our ESG initiative. We are continuing to advance our efforts, specifically within our strategic focus areas of talent, products and climate. Our sustainability report showcases recent actions and recognitions, while also providing insight into the impact of Assurant's sustainability efforts utilizing key ESG reporting frameworks, such as SASB and TCFD.\nIn addition to setting long-term targets for Lifestyle and Housing at our Investor Day, we also provided 3 key enterprise financial objectives; adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and cash generation. For this year, we continue to expect to grow adjusted earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, by 16% to 20% from the $12.12 we reported in 2021. This will be driven by 8% to 10% adjusted EBITDA growth from the $1.1 billion in 2021 as well as disciplined capital deployment through share repurchases, including using the remaining net proceeds from last year's sale of Global Preneed.\nFor 2023 and 2024, we expect to grow average adjusted earnings per share by 12% or more with double-digit average adjusted EBITDA expansion, both excluding reportable catastrophes. Through the first quarter, we returned approximately 85% of the $900 million of Preneed proceeds, and we expect to return the balance by the end of the second quarter. At the end of March, holding company liquidity totaled $738 million after returning $280 million in share repurchases and common stock dividends.\nOver the next 3 years, as the business continues to grow, we expect to generate approximately $2.9 billion of cash from our business segments, providing us with around $2.2 billion of deployable capital. We'll continue to be disciplined about capital deployment with the objective of maximizing long-term returns, taking a balanced approach between investments in growth and returning capital to shareholders.\nOur goal is to maintain greater capital flexibility as we see attractive opportunities for growth. We might hold higher levels of cash, depending on the opportunities we have in front of us, but we won't accumulate cash without line of sight to value-creating opportunities. We'll continue to return excess capital through share buybacks.\nOverall, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We're confident in our ability to continue to expand earnings and cash flows. This will also allow us to continue to invest in our businesses and sustain our track record of returning excess capital to shareholders over the long term.\nI'll now turn the call over to Richard to review the first quarter results and our 2022 outlook. Richard?\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. Adjusted EBITDA, excluding catastrophes, totaled $302 million, equal to the first quarter of 2021. Performance was driven by strong growth across Global Lifestyle, which was offset by higher non-cat loss experience in Global Housing, primarily from our specialty offerings. For the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share, excluding reportable catastrophes, of $3.80 , up 17% from the prior year period, driven by buybacks and a $9 million nonrecurring tax benefit from one of our international businesses.\nNow let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment reported adjusted EBITDA of $217 million in the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 13%, driven by continued earnings expansion in both Connected Living and Global Automotive. Connected Living earnings increased by $16 million, or 13% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued mobile expansion in North America device protection programs from cable operator and carrier clients, including more favorable loss experience and subscriber growth as well as an increase in global mobile devices service, including higher trade-in volumes from continued carrier promotions.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings increased $9 million or 12% from 3 items: higher investment income, favorable loss experience in select ancillary products and continued growth in our U.S. national dealer and third-party administrator channels, including growth of 5% in global vehicles protected. As we look at revenues, Lifestyle revenues increased by $99 million or 5%, aligning with our expectation that revenue would increase mid-single digits year-over-year. This was driven by continued growth in Global Automotive and Connected Living.\nIn Global Automotive, revenue increased 9%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts. Even with the decline in U.S. auto sales year-over-year, net written premiums increased 4% as we continued to benefit from higher attachment rates on used vehicles.\nWithin Connected Living, revenue increased 2% from higher mobile fee income driven by our global mobile devices service. Devices service encompasses the devices we touch in our trade-in, repair and dynamic fulfillment ecosystem. In the first quarter, the number of global mobile devices service increased by $800,000 or approximately 13% to $6.8 million. This was led by higher trading volumes, supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions from the introduction of 5G devices as well as initial service and repair volumes.\nIn terms of mobile subscribers, growth in North America subscribers was partially offset by declines in runoff mobile programs, previously mentioned, which also impacted mobile devices protected sequentially. For full year 2022, we continue to expect Lifestyle adjusted EBITDA growth to be low double digits compared to the [$740] million in 2021. Connected Living is expected to be the key driver of adjusted EBITDA growth, driven by global expansion in existing and new clients across device protection and trade-in and upgrade programs. This will be partially offset by strategic investments to support new business opportunities and client implementations as well as unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange in Asia Pacific and Europe. Auto adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase due to higher investment income and business performance throughout the year, which will be partially offset by higher expenses.\nMoving to Global Housing. Adjusted EBITDA was $104 million for the first quarter compared to $94 million in the first quarter of 2021, driven by lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased $30 million, primarily due to higher non-cat losses in our specialty and lender-placed businesses. Nearly 2/3 of the earnings decrease was from an unfavorable non-cat loss experience in our specialty offerings, including a $14 million increase within sharing economy, primarily related to a reserve adjustment and adverse development from policies previously written under less favorable contract terms.\nTaking a closer look at sharing economy, the product where we are seeing higher claims relates to on-demand delivery. It's a short-term liability policy covering the period when a driver may be using their vehicle for commercial purposes, which is not covered by a traditional auto insurance policy. We started writing this business in 2017 and is a relatively small portion of our Global Housing business, representing roughly 12% of specialists annualized net earned premium. We have taken several actions over the years, including modifying contract terms with some of our partners and discontinuing less profitable business to improve performance. However, based on the recent higher claims frequency and severity, we are taking a closer look at the business and expect to take appropriate steps to improve performance as we look to deliver on our financial objectives.\nTurning to lender-placed. This business comprised the majority of the balance of the increase in our non-cat loss experience within the segment. This was mainly related to elevated frequency and claim severities from fire claims, ultimately leading to lower earnings year-over-year. I did want to note that while fire claims tend to ebb and flow throughout the year, we continue to see higher cost of claims throughout our book due to inflationary factors, including labor and materials. These impacts continue to be largely offset by higher average insured values. In Multifamily Housing, underlying growth in our PMC and affinity channels was offset by more normalized losses compared to an abnormally low first quarter of 2021 as well as increased expenses from ongoing investments to further strengthen the customer experience.\nGlobal Housing revenue was up slightly year-over-year, mainly from higher average insured values and lender-placed and growth in Multifamily Housing. This was partially offset by lower specialty revenues from client runoff. Overall, we announced that Global Housing adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, to grow mid-single digits from the $486 million in 2021.\nLender-placed is expected to be a key driver for the following 4 items: first, expense efficiencies across the business, including system enhancements and new digital capabilities, we expect these to create additional scale as the volume of our business grows; second, higher average insured values; third, a modest lift from expected placement rate increases; and last, REO recovery later in the year, noting that volumes were significantly reduced from foreclosure moratoriums during the pandemic. Additionally, we are monitoring higher claims costs as well as reinsurance costs, which are aligned with the increase in [AIVs].\nOverall, for Housing, we would expect the combined ratio, including cats, of 84% to 89%. At Corporate, adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $22 million, an improvement of $6 million compared to the first quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by 2 items; first, lower employee-related expenses; and second, higher investment income from higher asset balances following the sale of premium. For full year 2022, we expect the Corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to be approximately $105 million. This reflects lower investment income compared to 2021. In addition, the first half of the year historically experiences lower expenses as investments ramp throughout the year.\nTurning to holding company liquidity. We ended the first quarter with $738 million, $513 million above our current minimum target level. In the first quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $129 million. In addition to our quarterly Corporate and interest expenses, we also had outflows from 2 main items: $242 million of share repurchases and $37 million in common stock dividends.\nAs Keith mentioned, we expect to return the remaining portion of the $900 million of Preneed proceeds or approximately $125 million in the second quarter. Our outlook assumes returning an additional $200 million to $300 million throughout the year. For the year overall, we continue to expect segment dividends to be roughly 3/4 of segment adjusted EBITDA, including catastrophes. As always, segment dividends are subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and investment portfolio performance.\nIn summary, we're confident in our ability to achieve our financial objectives for 2022 and over the long term, as we discussed at Investor Day. Our earnings growth, strong capital generation, product and service offerings as well as our business resiliency continue to differentiate Assurant as a strong partner and as a compelling investment.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Suzanne Shepherd, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Sustainability. You may begin your conference.\n\nSuzanne Shepherd\n\nSVP of IR & Sustainability, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Keith Demmings, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer.\nYesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2021. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available on assurant.com. We'll start today's call with remarks from Keith and Richard before moving into a Q&A session.\nSome of the statements made today are forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are based upon our historical performance and current expectations and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. Additional information regarding these factors can be found in yesterday's earnings release as well as in our SEC reports.\nDuring today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to yesterday's news release and financial supplement.\nI will now turn the call over to Keith.\n\nKeith Warner Demmings\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. As I begin my tenure as CEO, I'm extremely proud of the opportunity to lead our nearly 16,000 employees across the world as we support consumers' ever-connected lifestyles. As I reflect on Assurant's transformation over the past several years, not only have we evolved our business model but also significantly expanded the breadth of our offerings and our customer base.\nToday, Assurant represents a cohesive group of higher-growth service-oriented businesses serving more than 300 million consumers globally. Collectively, our connected consumer and specialty P&C businesses have generated and are expected to drive continued profitable growth and strong returns.\nAs we position Assurant for 2022 and beyond, we see compelling opportunities to sustain growth, particularly with the convergence of the connected consumer in the global markets and geographies in which we operate. Continued success will require us to deliver on our vision for the future to empower leading brands to connect, protect and support their customers' connected lifestyles.\nOngoing investments in our people and capabilities will enable us to meet our customers how, where and when they want to be met differentiating our offerings through a superior customer experience. Continuously adapting to the changing needs of the connected consumer will be critical to achieving our long-term growth.\nTo continue to capture new opportunities, I believe success will require more than ever, our focus on 5 priorities: first, attracting, retaining and developing the best talent to unlock future potential; second, delivering a superior digital-first customer experience; third, deepening our strong partnerships with major clients and prospects worldwide while also developing offerings and capabilities that continue to differentiate Assurant; fourth, accelerating the pace of innovation and prioritizing the necessary investments across our operations and technology; and finally, continuing to further embed and support sustainability and inclusivity for the benefit of all stakeholders and the communities in which we operate.\nAnd already this year, we've made progress in our continued objective to build a more sustainable Assurant. I'm proud of our recognition by CDP on our environmental impact and commitment and our continued inclusion in corporate equality and Bloomberg Gender Equality indices.\nI want to take a moment to highlight our lifestyle and housing businesses and how we successfully executed our strategy throughout 2021. Within Connected Living, our mobile device life cycle management solution has enhanced our ability to introduce value-added services and capabilities to monthly device protection plans and trade in and upgrade programs. This has helped expand our market share and further differentiate our offerings. We now cover almost 63 million mobile devices, a figure that's doubled since 2015 and increased 18% in 2021 alone.\nAt year-end, we launched a partnership with Deutsche Telekom in Germany to provide an innovative mobile phone device protection program and trade-in program. Assurant had already been recognized by Deutsche Telekom for our commitment to sustainability with #GreenMagentaLabel, highlighting how our products and services make a positive climate contribution and reflect a responsible use of resources. This is another example of further integrating ESG into Assurant's business operations and offerings worldwide to drive more value for our partners and for our consumers.\nThroughout the year, critical investments continue to drive growth and differentiate the customer experience. Our trade-in and upgrade business, now inclusive of HYLA Mobile, drove exceptional performance, processing over 25 million devices supported by the rollout of 5G as well as our repair, asset disposition and technology capabilities.\nWe recently expanded our longstanding partnership with Telefonica to provide a comprehensive device trade-in program across several key countries in Europe and Latin America, where Telefonica is a market leader. The program will enable Telefonica to access our leading trade-in technology.\nWe also continue to integrate mobile service delivery options into our offerings through CPR's local same-day capability and the come-to-you repair capability through our acquisition of Fixt. Demonstrating our commitment to improving the customer experience, CPR by Assurant ranked first in the 2022 Entrepreneurial Franchise 500 for electronics repair. This is a testament to the success of our CPR franchisees and our commitment to provide customers with exceptional experiences, services and support.\nAnd we successfully executed on the major rollout of the in-store repair capability to nearly 500 T-Mobile store locations nationwide, showcasing our ability to adapt to rapidly changing consumer preferences. Over a period of 5 months, we recruited, trained and deployed nearly 2,000 technicians to deliver a seamless experience to T-Mobile customers in store while also converting approximately 10 million Sprint subscribers to Assurant. The in-store repair rollout will continue in 2022 as we further enhance the overall experience for T-Mobile customers.\nTurning to our Global Automotive business where we also have a strong track record of growth and innovation, we've continued to capture market share and see significant opportunities ahead. In 2021, we grew global protected vehicles by 10% to nearly 54 million and increased net operating income by 21%. The auto business is critical to the long-term success of Assurant, and we should continue to benefit in the future from increased scale through our alignment with industry leaders and our ability to support customers through digital channels.\nTurning to renters. The business grew policies and revenue by 7% in 2021, a testament to strong affinity and property management company channel relationships. We also secured multiyear renewals with 2 top 10 property management companies. Technology and innovation are critical components to our success in this business, and we'll continue to invest in our technology over the next several years to further enhance the customer experience for our 2.6 million policyholders.\nInvestments in 2021 included the continued rollout of Cover360, launching new customer-facing sales portals and expanding self-service capabilities that leverage machine learning to enable automation of claim payments. Ultimately, our investments should increase policy attachment rates, which have not yet hit mature levels throughout the industry. Additionally, in our attractive P&C offerings, including lender-placed insurance, we have maintained our market-leading position with large U.S. servicers and banks tracking over 30 million loans. Last year alone, we renewed 10 clients and partnered with 2 new clients.\nAs we look to 2022, we'll continue investments in operations, such as our customer-centric single-source processing platform, differentiating our tracking capabilities and improving efficiency. Overall, I'm pleased that our businesses have delivered on our commitments for 2021 as we delivered value for our clients and customers. We also further demonstrated the resiliency of our unique business model as we navigated the pandemic and manage inflationary pressures.\nExcluding reportable catastrophes, we generated 14% earnings per share growth on the high end of our expectations. Net operating income, also excluding cats grew by 11% to $672 million, making 2021 our fifth consecutive year of profitable growth. Our balance sheet remains strong. Combined, our businesses contributed a total of $729 million in dividends to the holding company, representing approximately 100% of segment earnings. This allowed us to return a total of $1 billion in share repurchases and common stock dividends and complete our 3-year $1.35 billion capital return objective.\nIn addition, we completed 60% of the $900 million we committed to return through share repurchases as part of the sale of our Preneed business. We anticipate returning the remainder by the end of the second quarter.\nNext, I'd like to review some initial thoughts for 2022. As we look ahead to sharing our long-term vision, strategy and financial objectives at Investor Day in March, we can make an even more compelling case for the future. Given our ongoing shift to more service-oriented fee-based businesses, we believe adjusted EBITDA rather than net operating income is a better representation of how to evaluate our operating performance for the enterprise and segments.\nIn 2021, adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, increased 9% to $1.1 billion, driven by strong results in Global Lifestyle, particularly in Global Automotive and Connected Living as well as a lower corporate loss. In 2022, we expect growth in adjusted EBITDA ex cats of 8% to 10%, a reflection of the strength of our business portfolio. Within Global Lifestyle, we expect adjusted EBITDA to increase by low double digits but likely not exceed the 12% growth we had in 2021. Segment growth will be driven by Connected Living, particularly mobile, even as we make strategic investments to support new business, including continued investments in our in-store mobile repair capabilities.\nWithin Global Housing, adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, is expected to grow mid- to high single digits, driven primarily by lender-placed from higher average insured values, operating efficiencies and improved results in specialty offerings. Our Corporate segment is expected to generate a loss of approximately $105 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is in line with our historical levels.\nCash flow generation is also expected to remain strong and is a core component of Assurant's financial profile, allowing us to continue to invest in and transform this company. As we look at our capital management priorities going forward, we'll continue to be strong stewards of capital. Our goal is to continue to maximize long-term value creation through disciplined capital deployment while also maintaining our investment grade and financial strength ratings. Given the attractive business opportunities we see ahead, we expect a more balanced capital deployment mix, targeting compelling investments to drive long-term growth whether organic or through M&A as well as ongoing return of capital to shareholders. We believe this combination will enable us to sustain above-market profitable growth and generate significant value for our shareholders.\nWe recognize that for periods of time, this may result in higher-than-average levels of holding company liquidity to ensure we have the flexibility to make investments that generate compelling returns while also returning capital mainly through buybacks given the attractiveness of our stock.\nLastly, I wanted to acknowledge and thank all who have supported my transition as CEO over the last several quarters. Your feedback and ongoing dialogue has been incredibly valuable as we collectively look to build upon the success of Assurant for the future. And I want to thank our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts in 2021, a year in which we again outperformed despite the challenges of the pandemic.\nI will turn the call over to Richard to review the fourth quarter results, our '22 outlook and business trends. Richard?\n\nRichard Steven Dziadzio\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Assurant, Inc.\n\nThank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. As Keith noted, we're pleased with our performance in 2021, which continued to reinforce the strength of earnings and cash flow generation of our businesses. For the fourth quarter, we reported net operating income per share, excluding reportable catastrophes of $2.49, up 21% from the prior year period. Excluding cats, net operating income for the quarter totaled $144 million and adjusted EBITDA amounted to $245 million, a year-over-year increase of 16% and 8%, respectively.\nNow let's move to segment results, starting with Global Lifestyle. This segment reported net operating income of $108 million in the fourth quarter, a year-over-year increase of 23%. Growth was driven by strong performance in Global Automotive and Connected Living.\nIn Global Automotive, earnings increased $12 million or 29% from fourth quarter 2020. The increase is based on 3 main items, including: first, continued organic growth across distribution channels, mainly in the U.S. and including AFAS contributions; second, the loss experienced from select ancillary products; and third, higher investment income.\nConnected Living's earnings increased by $9 million or 21% year-over-year, more than offsetting the implementation costs associated with the initial deployment of in-store device repair services with T-Mobile. These costs are primarily related to technician hiring and parts sourcing and will further impact Connected Living's earnings in 2022 as we continue investing in our in-store capabilities.\nThe fourth quarter increase in Connected Living was primarily driven by 3 items: higher trade-in volumes, including a full quarter of contributions from HYLA and carrier promotions; higher international earnings, including improved performance in Europe and Asia Pacific; and continued mobile subscriber growth in North America, including growth from our cable operator partners. This quarter, Connected Living and Global Automotive results also included a modest tax benefit that improved earnings.\nFor the quarter, lifestyle's adjusted EBITDA increased 16% to $159 million. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the segment's increased IT depreciation from higher investments as well as amortization resulting from higher deal-related intangibles from the more recent transactions in T-Mobile and Global Automotive.\nAs we look at revenues, lifestyle revenues increased by $168 million or 9%. This was driven mainly by continued growth in Global Automotive and Connected Living. In Global Automotive, revenue increased 12%, reflecting strong prior period sales of vehicle service contracts across all distribution channels. In the U.S., we saw continued expansion from our national dealer network and third-party administrators while we benefited internationally from higher volumes with OEMs. As expected, our net written premiums, a key sales metric, continued to normalize compared to the third quarter, but remain elevated. We expect continued normalization into 2022.\nWithin Connected Living, revenue increased 7%, primarily due to mobile fee income that was driven by strong trading volumes, including contributions from HYLA. Trading volumes continue to be elevated in the fourth quarter, supported by new phone introductions and carrier promotions from the introduction of 5G devices.\nHigher revenue growth in domestic mobile subscribers was offset by declines in runoff mobile programs previously mentioned. For the year, mobile subscribers grew 18% to nearly 63 million, driven by growth in North America, including the transition of legacy Sprint subscribers. Excluding the Sprint transition, our North America device count continued to grow at a healthy pace and was up 8%, offsetting declines in other regions.\nLooking ahead to 2022, we expect Global Lifestyle adjusted EBITDA to increase by low double digits. Growth will be mainly driven by Connected Living and particularly mobile from continued global expansion in existing and new clients and across device protection and trade-in and upgrade programs.\nGiven the strategic investments we're making across Lifestyle to support new business opportunities, including in-store service and repair capabilities, we do not anticipate growth to exceed the 12% growth rate we had in 2021.\nIn Global Automotive, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be stable in 2022 compared to 2021, as we overcome headwinds in investment income and the absence of $10 million of nonrecurring gains we recorded in the first half of 2021.\nMoving to Global Housing. Net operating income was $80 million for the fourth quarter compared to $61 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, driven by lower reportable catastrophes. Excluding catastrophe losses, earnings decreased $7 million, mainly due to higher non-cat losses in our Specialty P&C offerings. Non-cat losses included an $8.2 million increase, primarily related to reserve strengthening for runoff claims within our small commercial book. As a reminder, this book stopped adding policies in 2019, but we continue to manage open claims. Absent this reserve increase, earnings were relatively flat as growth in lender-placed was offset modestly by higher non-cat losses.\nRecall certain factors in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 temporarily depressed non-cat loss levels. We do not consider those periods to be representative of historical and future trends. Earnings growth in lender-placed insurance was driven by the higher average insured value of in-force policies and claims processing efficiencies, which were partially offset by the impact of the continued foreclosure moratoriums.\nIn January, we replaced our existing reinsurance coverage, representing 2/3 of our 2022 catastrophe reinsurance program placement. We were able to continue placing reinsurance, covering multiple years to mitigate changes in the pricing of cat reinsurance in any 1 year. And similar to prior years, the remainder of our reinsurance will be placed around midyear. We will continue to evaluate the risks and rewards of purchasing additional reinsurance as well as alternatives that could more meaningfully reduce our risk.\nIn Multifamily Housing, underlying growth in our affinity and PMC channels was offset by increased expenses, primarily investments to further strengthen our customer experience, including our digital capabilities. Global Housing revenue increased 2% year-over-year, mainly from higher average insured values and premium rates in lender-placed and growth in multifamily housing. This was partially offset by lower specialty revenues from client runoff.\nFor 2022, we expect Global Housing's adjusted EBITDA, excluding cats, to grow by mid- to high single digits compared to 2021. This is expected to be driven by 3 factors: first, growth in lender-placed insurance from continued higher average insured values and gradually higher REO volumes due to easing foreclosure moratoriums throughout the year. Growth is expected to be partially offset by the impact of higher labor and material costs.\nSecond, expense savings initiatives, including our digital-first efforts focused on automation will have a positive impact, albeit partially offset by continued investment initiatives, particularly in Multifamily Housing. And third, improved loss experience in our specialty offerings related to small commercial.\nAt Corporate, the net operating loss was $24 million, an improvement of $3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This was mainly driven by higher investment income in the quarter from higher asset balances, including proceeds from the sale of Global Preneed. For 2022, we expect the corporate adjusted EBITDA loss to approximate $105 million, more in line with historical levels.\nTurning to holding company liquidity. We ended the year with slightly over $1 billion, primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our Preneed business. In the fourth quarter, dividends from our operating segments totaled $176 million. In addition to our quarterly corporate and interest expenses, we had outflows from 3 main items: $290 million of share repurchases; $39 million in common stock dividends; and $5 million related to Assurant Ventures investments.\nFor 2022, we expect our businesses to continue to generate strong cash flow and at a similar rate to prior years. Within transition to adjusted EBITDA, we expect segment dividends to be roughly 3/4 of segment adjusted EBITDA, including catastrophes. This translates to approximately 100% of segment net operating income. As always, segment dividends are subject to the growth of the businesses, rating agency and regulatory capital requirements and investment portfolio performance.\nAs Keith mentioned, we expect to provide additional color for 2022, including our outlook on a per share basis that aligns with adjusted EBITDA, along with further detail regarding our long-term view of financial metrics that support Assurant's strategic direction at Investor Day next month. As a result of the expected level of share repurchases, we wanted to note that we expect that our growth on a per share basis will significantly exceed our adjusted EBITDA growth.\nIn closing, we are really excited to have met our objectives for 2021 despite the difficult operating conditions brought on by the pandemic, and we're excited to be entering 2022 with the positive business momentum we've highlighted today.\nAnd with that, operator, please open the call for questions."
